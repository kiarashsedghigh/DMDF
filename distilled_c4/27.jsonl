Are they bound to use their platform to speak up, either through their work or other means? Or should they remain silent, stuck in their lane and apolitical?\nThe second season of National Geographic\u2019s anthology \u201cGenius\u201d takes a hard stand for the former. The limited series, which followed Albert Einstein\u2019s life last season, turns its gaze to Spanish painter Pablo Picasso in the late 1930s. Fascism is on the rise, and the curators of Paris\u2019 Exposition Universelle want Picasso to create something on a giant, wall-sized canvas at the expo. But they don\u2019t want just any Picasso painting \u2014 they want something that will speak to this moment, to the fear of creeping Nazism across Europe.\n\u201cThe threat is enormous, so the picture must be enormous, so as to move the people,\u201d one of the curators says. Picasso, as played by Antonio Banderas, is wary, both of the scale of the project and the idea of being so political: \u201cPictures cannot stop a war, no matter how gigantic it is,\u201d he says. But the 1937 bombing in Guernica inspires him to create his most famous anti-war painting, named after the city. Silence, for Picasso, is not an option.\n\u201cGenius: Picasso\u201d is generally about the artist as a brilliant mind, emphasizing his genius by calling him so many times throughout the series (four episodes of which were provided to press for review). But the show is even more interested in the idea of Picasso as a former revolutionary, showing us his rebellious days as a young artist (played in flashback by Alex Rich). Before \u201cGuernica,\u201d Banderas\u2019 Picasso lives a lofty and luxurious life; his art no longer challenges authority in the way it once did. How is this man the same as the one we see in his youth, so determined to upend norms and change the status quo?\nOf course, the answer becomes clear as Picasso paints \u201cGuernica\u201d: The artist never lost his fiery spirit. He just didn\u2019t have to use it during less threatening times. It takes no less than Adolf Hitler and the rise of the Nazis to make Picasso passionate again.\nThe more \u201cGenius: Picasso\u201d focuses on that divide between the young firebrand and older laggard, the better the series is. Unfortunately, as the show goes on, it increasingly turns to its ensemble of Picasso\u2019s friends, admirers, and lovers.\nTo a one, the cast is strong; as Dora Maar, one of Picasso\u2019s more serious lovers, Samantha Colley is a particular standout. She plays Dora as formidable opponent to Picasso, capable of holding him accountable in a way no other can, while emphasizing her deep love for him. Colley is one of four players returning from \u201cGenius\u2019\u201d first season, joining T.R. Knight, Seth Gabel, and Johnny Flynn for another round.\nThe problem is one of focus. The show isn\u2019t \u201cGenius: Picasso and Pals\u201d; it\u2019s about one man, one genius. As the show\u2019s attention spreads, \u201cGenius\u201d increasingly feels like an ensemble series. Unfortunately, with so few episodes, and two different timelines to progress through, side stories feel like distractions from the core idea of the season.\nWhen Picasso is at the forefront, though, \u201cGenius\u201d is impressive. It presents him not just as the legendary painter remembered by history, but a flawed figure"}

Lebo, a former victim of violence, says she's grateful she was able to get out of what she calls a haunting situation.\n\"I remember those days clearly: one moment he was gentle and romantic and the next moment he would [throw] punches,\" she says.\nViolent behaviour gradually developed as their relationship went on. \"It went from a slap in the face to kicking and punches that would leave me bruised and blue,\" Lebo recalls.\nShe admits that she enjoyed the shoving and occasional slaps at first because she found it cute that he was the \"jealous type\".\nThen Rachel, my other friend, points out the dangers of believing that if your man truly loves you, he will be jealous. It doesn't make it okay for him to slap you around.\nLebo and I nod in agreement. Lebo can't believe how silly she was and how fortunate she is to have finally gained the confidence to remove herself from that situation.\nSuch errors in judgment are regrettably common among girls and women in black society. Some are not as fortunate as Lebo: they get trapped in relationships that lead to a lifetime of hardship. Bad choices such as unplanned pregnancies and marrying abusive men have echoes that sometimes continue throughout their entire lives.\nThese issues tend to prevent women from getting an education, to the extent that black women represent the bulk of those suffering in poverty in South Africa today.\nRachel lambasts the government for failing to ensure that women are empowered to be more independent. Women are too often made the custodians of the problems that plague our society.\n\"They end up being trapped in violent homes because of monetary reasons. Women who are abused often ask themselves where will they go and what will happen to their children if they leave?\" she says, angrily.\nThis kind of pattern threatens to create a vicious cycle that could be inherited by future generations.\nThe World Health Organisation says children who grow up in families in which there is intimate-partner violence may suffer a range of behavioural and emotional disturbances that can be linked to the perpetration or experience of violence later in life.\nLebo expresses her unhappiness with the department of women, children and people with disabilities, whose initiatives for women and children are scarce. But these government officials will crawl out of the woodwork when the 16 Days of Activism campaign starts.\nSuch initiatives are great in highlighting the violence and other abuse suffered by women and children, but real change remains a challenge."}

The project would cause the averagecost per day for patients to rise by $6, said Edward Hindin, senior vice president for HealthEast, the hospital center's holding company.\nThe project would involve 55,000 square feet of new construction and 37,000 square feet of renovations. It is a paring down from the original \"Project 85,\" a $37-million bid for 275,000 square feet in June 1983; and \"Project Response,\" a $22-million application involving 143,000 square feet, submitted in October 1984.\nOfficials said the hospital needs to build an addition for administrative, educational and support services because it is opening an already licensed and approved 32-bed unit to meet increasing admissions.\n\"We have everything we need to meet the demand - physicians, nurses, equipment and seed money - except one thing. That is space. We haven't got any space,\" said the Rev. Daniel G. Gambet, vice chairman of the hospital center board.\n\"We're not filing this application because we're empire builders - just to say we're bigger or have the misbegotten 'edifice complex.'

Spiker, hospital center president, emphasized the continuing increase in admissions and occupancy rate at or about 90 percent, which in July, August and September of this year resulted in the rerouting of ambulances to other hospitals.\nThe proposed addition will hold a new auditorium, classrooms, expan- ded library, and room for research, educational development, employee health, social services, oncology, the microbiology laboratory, personnel, public relations and administration.\nSome of those services were located in what will be the new patient care unit, others were scattered throughout the hospital or in rented, off-campus facilities.\nRenovations to vacated space in the main building will allow expansion of the cafeteria and food preparation areas, nutrition support, patient education, enterostomal therapy, medical records, biomedical engineering, business office, computer services and nursing supervisor departmental space.\nAn interim solution, the rental of 14 modular units or trailers to house administrative and support services, and use of some solarium space is costly and inappropriate, officials added.\nHindin noted it costs the facility $8 to $14- a square foot to continue renting the additional space needed, compared to the $8.50 to $9-per square foot it would cost in new construction.\nThe project, which was to be delivered to the Health Systems Council of Eastern Pennsylvania (HSC) today, would be scheduled for a regional review in March 1986.\nIf approved by the region and the state health secretary, construction could begin as early as September 1986 and be completed within a year.

Today: the Brooklyn Nets, the Jay-Z and Mikhail Prokhorov-owned and Brooklyn upstarts that cost more than the entirety of Brooklyn's DIY craft breweries.\nThe Brooklyn Nets have been one of the most talked about teams this offseason, primarily because of the new first part of their name: Brooklyn. They've moved across both the Hudson and the East River and now they're sharing real estate with dive bars galore, mustache-waxed dads pushing babies rocking Velvet Underground tees in strollers, kids in jeans that hug the crotch an uncomfortable amount, and [insert Brooklyn trope of your choice]. They're also the first professional sports team to claim the borough as their own since the Dodgers took off for Southern Cali in 1957. That means there's been a dearth of professional sports in Brooklyn for 55 years, so it's too bad they're stuck with this: an expensive, motley group that'll be nearly worthless on defense.\nEven their prepubescent-voiced head coach, Avery Johnson, admits as much: the Nets need to get tougher on defense. We're sorry, but Brook Lopez and Kris Humphries are about as terrifying a defensive low-post tandem as Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.\nReggie Evans is an upgrade at the 4 on defense, but he's obviously not the starter and he's limited on offense. Lopez is a legit 7-footer, but he's coming off a broken right foot that limited him to just 5 games last season, and he makes Lou Amundson look svelte on defensive rotations. And Humphries, when he wasn't busy in his blink-and-you-missed it marriage to Kanye's current amour, was befuddled by opposing power forwards. Joe Johnson is a big 2 that can match up against most small forwards and Gerald Wallace is a big 3 that can match up against a most power forwards, but they'll still have to hide Humphries or Lopez on defense. Deron Williams is an all-world point, but that's primarily on the offensive end.\nLast season Nets opponents had an effective field goal percentage of .513, good for second to last in the league. They weren't much better on the boards either, finishing 28th out of 30 teams in defensive rebounding percentage (via basketball-reference). This wasn't a coincidence, as they finished second to last (only better than the historically bad Charlotte Bobcats) in points allowed, giving up 106.9 points per 100 possessions (via Hoopdata). I'm pretty sure I could drop 20 points on this defense, and I haven't played organized ball in more than a decade.\nThey can't rebound; specifically, Brook Lopez can't rebound.\nSure, Joe Johnson can pick up some boards with his size, but since there's a component of hustle involved in collecting any rebound, Johnson leaves you wanting.

Already without the departed Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola, Brady has lost receiver Josh Gordon and isn't getting as much as expected out of favorite targets Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman.\nAnd New England's bottom-12 defense, which through 15 weeks ranked below the league median in terms of DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) at Football Outsiders, has surrendered more than 30 points on five occasions.\nOnly two Patriots are headed to the Pro Bowl, and only cornerback Stephon Gilmore has a shot at being an All-Pro.\nKnown for gaining steam in the second half of the season, the more-fallible-than-ever Pats are just 3-3 in their last six games, and they haven't won outside of Massachusetts since before Halloween.\nAnd yet it remains inevitable: New England is going to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in the last five years, the sixth time in the last 12 years and the ninth time in head coach Bill Belichick's 19-year tenure.\nThat's because this is the perfect year to be less than perfect, and the Patriots still have just enough experience, talent and smarts to take advantage of the fact that the rest of the AFC is composed of sick kittens that are destined to lose control of their bladders the moment they step foot on the FieldTurf at Gillette Stadium.\nThe defensively inept AFC West-leading Kansas City Chiefs have lost three of their last five games, surrendering a startling 35.6 points per outing during that span, while the offense has lost an edge without Kareem Hunt (released) and Sammy Watkins (foot injury). Kansas City is doing the opposite of peaking at the right time, and a team that has lost six consecutive home playoff games looks doomed to suffer another early-postseason exit.\nThe Los Angeles Chargers were the conference's hottest team, but L.A. scored just 10 points in a gross Week 16 home loss to a Baltimore Ravens squad that was traveling on short rest with a raw rookie quarterback.\nSpeaking of that raw rookie quarterback, does anybody envision Lamar Jackson winning a playoff game in Foxborough?\nAnd after loading up on wins against soft opponents in October and November, the AFC South-leading Houston Texans have lost two of their last three games and allowed the Pats to leapfrog them into the No. 2 seed in that conference. Now, the Patriots merely need to beat the New York Jets at home on Sunday to skip Wild Card Weekend.\nAnd that's huge, because blocking the Pats from a first-round bye is the key ingredient in the recipe for a non-New England Super Bowl.

But they're 0-of-3 at getting past the AFC Championship Game without a bye.\nA New England win over the Jets and a Chiefs loss to the Oakland Raiders would guarantee the Pats home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.

It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to whether the couple paid for that privilege, but either way, they should be able to sell the first pictures from the wedding and make a killing without the risk of them leaking out.\nIt\u2019s easy to be negative about the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West marriage on account of their eccentricities and over the top personalities, but in many ways, they actually seem perfect for each other. They both have a unique appreciation for all things artistic, gaudy and flamboyant. They both get hounded by the paparazzi, slammed by the media and obsessed over by certain segments of the general public. They\u2019re on the same page, and with the daughter they now share, they may actually wind up being perfect for each other."}

And if any of you who care about this stuff haven\u2019t read Ken Doctor\u2019s dissection of the strategy, go do that immediately.\nBack? OK. For extra credit, here\u2019s a condensed and edited\u2013but still very long!\u2013version of a chat I had yesterday with Times digital czar Martin Nisenholtz. I\u2019m not convinced Nisenholtz is convinced that the plan the Times rolled out yesterday is the best possible plan. But if that\u2019s the case, he certainly didn\u2019t let on.\nThe Times is charging more for access to its iPad app than for smartphone apps, because it thinks it can. iPad users spend more time with the paper, and the Times thinks people who spend more time with the paper will pay more for it.\nThe Times only expects a small sliver of its Web readers to become paying users. Niseholtz doesn\u2019t exactly say this out loud, but if you piece together his commentary, that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. He doesn\u2019t expect the \u201cvast majority\u201d of readers to ever see the paywall, so what he\u2019s really trying to do is convert a percentage of the remaining minority. But if you\u2019ve read Doctor\u2019s piece, then you already know this.\nThe Times isn\u2019t trying to price its digital subscriptions in a way that protects its print subscription business. On the one hand, this makes sense\u2013after all, the subscription plans are aimed at converting heavy users of its Web site who aren\u2019t already print subscribers. On the other hand, given that print subscribers remain the Times\u2019 most valuable asset, this one seems hard to reconcile.\nPeter Kafka: Just to be clear, when the Times says non-subscribers can read stories above their 20-per-month limit if they come from referring links, you\u2019re not just talking about Twitter and Facebook, but any link from any site, right?\nKafka: It could be the Journal. It could be a blog, it could be the Financial Times, anything on the Web, right?\nNisenholtz: Yes. The only other thing is that Google has a methodology where they can limit the number of inbound links per day, and we intend to take them up on it.\nKafka: So that\u2019s Google doing the actual gating, not you?\nNisenholtz: Right. They had made this feature available prior to us going pay, so it\u2019s not like it was inspired by us per se. We\u2019re just taking advantage of it.\nKafka: Why limit Google\u2019s links, but not any other site\u2019s?\nNisenholtz: I think the majority of people are honest and care about great journalism and the New York Times. When you look at the research that we\u2019ve done, tons of people actually say, \u201cJeez, we\u2019ve felt sort of guilty getting this for free all these years. We actually want to step up and pay, because we know we\u2019re supporting a valuable institution.\u201d At the same time we want to make sure that we\u2019re not being gamed, to the extent that we can be.\nKafka: But if you really do want to game the wall, you\u2019ll be able to do it. You could could go through Microsoft\u2019s Bing, for instance.\nNisenholtz: We\u2019re obviously going to be vigilant over the next couple of months, in looking at the ways that people are doing that.\nKafka: I\u2019m surprised to hear you say you\u2019re going to spend"}

Often times, the units train independently of one another. However, once together, the brigade staff had to facilitate command and control and proper communication across the brigade to ensure the aircrews maintained safe flying procedures.\nIn order to facilitate such an understanding, the units began preparing for this deployment over a year ago. The CAB\u2019s Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), from Sedalia, Missouri, and 935th Aviation Support Battalion (ASB), from Springfield, Missouri, completed a \u201cWarfighter\u201d training exercise at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, in June of 2017. Since then they have completed multiple command post exercises, which provide training on the planning, coordination, command and control facets, and communication exercises, which test the unit\u2019s communication abilities over a great distance, said Hausman.\nThe training and preparation led to a culminating training event (CTE), completed at Fort Hood, Texas on July 26, 2018. The CTE brought together subordinate units that would be assigned to the CAB throughout the deployment.\nEarly June 2018, Soldiers assigned to HHC, 35th CAB; 935th ASB; the 2-211th General Aviation Support Battalion (GSAB), from West Jordan, Utah; and the 1-108th Assault Helicopter Battalion, from Topeka, Kansas, arrived at Fort Hood. Their time there provided Soldiers and Airmen from 15 different states an opportunity to establish a foundation and develop working relationships required to build successful team cohesion.\nGenerally, a combat aviation brigade is made up of an assault helicopter battalion, a general support aviation battalion, an aviation support battalion, an attack reconnaissance battalion, and a headquarters company, which provides command and control assets. While the mission is to provide aviation support, it takes more than pilots and crewmembers to fly a helicopter. The behind-the-scenes support personnel safeguard the operational abilities of the air crew and equipment.\nWithin the 35th CAB you\u2019ll find many different trades and skillsets, which all have separate, but necessary roles to support the organization. Some examples include: fuelers, truck drivers, logisticians, mechanics, and aviation operations specialists.\nAnother supporting role within the CAB is the legal department. U.S. Army National Guard paralegal, Spc. Joseph Christensen, with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2-211th GSAB, first spoke with individuals whom would become his supervisors during a short phone call just mere weeks before meeting them at Fort Hood.

There are only about 20 seats in the restaurant, but nearly all them \u2014 including the two sidewalk tables outside \u2014 were full. From a group of retirees to a young family with a toddler, who ate his bibimbap with a pink plastic spoon, Maejoo's audience seems to include everyone.\nOwner and chef Soojin Kim, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu in San Francisco, is accustomed to cooking for a wide audience. According to Kim, prior to opening Maejoo in April, she ran a catering company, Chez Maejoo, where she made lunches inspired by a variety of cuisines for tech companies like Apple and Netflix. Before that, she was head sous chef at Zynga.\n\"But I'm a chef, so I need a challenge all the time,\" Kim said. When Kim came across the tiny storefront located in San Leandro's Pelton Center, she decided it the was perfect spot to open a Korean restaurant. Kim calls Maejoo her \"test kitchen,\" where she perfects a small number of Korean dishes with a contemporary twist.\n\"My menu's very limited ... because I need ... consistency, quality-wise,\" Kim said. \"I know what is the good consistency of real Korean food. I'm very confident I can make it.\"\nAt Maejoo, you won't find offerings like black goat stew, blood sausage, or braised pig feet. The menu is simple and accessible even for first-timers to Korean cuisine; all the entr\u00e9es fall neatly into categories like bibimbap, tofu soup, barbecued meats, and noodles. But each item delivers in quality and flavor.\nThe meal begins with a free opener of baby carrots and cucumber sticks with a spicy, garlicky soybean paste for dipping. The soybean paste is made with a base of fermented soybeans called meju \u2014 which is where Maejoo gets its name. Meals also come with a few assorted, rotating banchan. On my visits, I received spicy, crunchy kimchi, as well as fishcakes with sesame seeds. Other banchan included seaweed salad, pickled daikon, and bean sprouts. You won't receive a dozen banchan like you might at other restaurants, but the important thing is that the banchan are well-made, and refills are gladly offered.\nFor starters, the Korean fried chicken wings, half with sweet spicy chili sauce and half with sweet soy glaze, stood up to their competition. Despite being covered in sticky sauce, the wings maintained a crunchy crust, and the chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy without being greasy. The sweet spicy chili sauce had a hint of heat from gochujang, a Korean chili paste, which was tamed by sweet and tangy flavor. The sweet soy glaze had a nuanced, subtle flavor thanks to sesame oil, sugar, garlic, and soy sauce.\nThe kimchi pancake was significantly thicker than kimchi pancakes I've had elsewhere, and looking at it, I assumed it wouldn't"}

He added that, as far as placing advertisements was concerned, they have to be held to the same standards as traditional media organizations.\nAnother concern is that sometimes advertisements are automatically placed alongside objectionable and inappropriate content within those platforms that brands do not have control over.\n\"The big issue for Google and Facebook is whether they are going to have human editing at this point ... of course they have the profitability. They have the margins to enable them to do it. And this is going to be the big issue \u2014 how far are they prepared to go?\" Sorrell said, adding they needed to go \"significantly far\" to arrest these concerns.\nA failure to address such issues could see Facebook and Google potentially take hits on ad revenue if brands stop advertising on their platforms. For example, French advertising firm Havas recently pulled all its ad spend from Google and its video platform, YouTube.\nThe Guardian reported that Havas took the step after talks with Google broke down because the tech giant couldn't provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees over the filtering and classification of video or display content.\nHavas' decision came after the UK government joined organizations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube, the Guardian report said.\nSorrell said blanket withdrawals from advertisers across these digital platforms will not solve the problem. Instead, he urged for greater cooperation with the tech giants.\n\"I think the most constructive way of doing it is getting Google and Facebook to understand the problem, which I think they do, and to get them to step up to control it just like any other media right now would in a traditional sense,\" he said."}

Not that I think DelBene can fix HealhCare.gov or the nightmare that is ObamaCare, for that matter, but I can see why he was the perfect choice to try.\n- He lasted 21 years at Microsoft, so he must like big-organization bureaucracy and politics. In other words, he is probably an empire builder and a glutton for punishment.\n- Having led Microsoft into online services \u2013 kicking and screaming all the way \u2013 DelBene is certainly comfortable taking on impossible missions with huge obstacles.\n- He is used to taking orders from women democrats (his new boss is U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and his wife is U.S. House of Representatives democrat Suzan DelBene).\n- DelBene just retired, so he\u2019s ready to work about as hard as everyone else in Washington.\n- Microsoft has a history of helping its archenemies \u2013 to its own detriment \u2013 having given Apple the $150 million cash infusion it needed to avoid bankruptcy in 1997. How much you want to bet this also comes back to haunt Bill Gates and company?\nThere are two things that continue to bug me, though.

Pincus? Zynga? Really? What, is the President of the United States a fan of FarmVille? Mafia Wars? Maybe he just likes to play Words with Friends with Alec Baldwin?\nIn any case, I wish DelBene luck trying to fix the most botched launch since Vista \u2013 and with all the politicians in his life.

Will mere anarchy be loosed upon East Africa?\nWith time, it became clear that achieving integration to the depth required to make political federation possible was not merely a matter of leaders making the right noises.\nThere is an old story, probably apocryphal, that shines a light on the way the East African Community and its interstate relations have evolved.\nIt says that when the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere was about to retire as president of Tanzania, his then Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, had a conversation with him about it.\nApparently, Museveni was concerned that Mwalimu was retiring at a time when the region still needed his leadership, especially on matters of regional integration. He reportedly asked the sage whom he expected young leaders like him to work with, now that he was leaving. Mwalimu reportedly assured Museveni that there would be no problem at all. He would work \u201cna wengine\u201d (with others).\nWatchers of the evolution of the East African Community since its revival must recall that Museveni has been the loudest advocate of regional integration. Even when analysts doubted that the revived EAC would make easy progress in the domain of free trade, he was already looking into the future, to when member countries would have a common currency and how they should transition quickly to political federation.\nPerhaps nowhere else in the region did this leap of the imagination arouse as much suspicion of his motives as it did in Mwalimu\u2019s own Tanzania.\nOver there, observers tended to read his pronouncements as evidence of his ambition to become the first President of East Africa.\nEven back in Uganda, speculation was rife that he would step down only if he were assured of moving on to become president of the federation.\nThose who were fronting these arguments would go as far as claiming that, given he was the oldest of the EAC presidents, his counterparts could not possibly deny him that wish.\nWith time, however, it became clear that achieving integration to the depth required to make political federation and a single currency possible was not merely a matter of leaders making the right noises. It would require a great deal of preliminary work in terms of laying the foundations.\nAlso, domestic politics and considerations of national sovereignty and interests, and how they would be impacted, were central to whether or not these ambitions could be achieved, and how quickly.\nSoon enough, we began to hear grumbling that some actors were dragging their feet on initiatives whose implementation had been agreed upon.

More Americans expressed \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of worry about domestic problems such as healthcare, the economy and crime than about terrorism among a list of 13 different issues.\nWorries about terrorism generally take a back seat to at least a few domestic problems, but concerns about the issue increased in 2002 and 2003 after 9/11.\nThe latest attacks, which took place at an airport and metro station in Brussels, could affect Americans' level of concern about terrorism. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, terrorism climbed to the top of Americans' list of the most important problems facing the U.S. in December. But by early March, mentions of terrorism declined significantly.\nBefore the attacks in Brussels, Americans already reported a heightened state of worry because of the increasing worldwide threat of terrorism, in particular from the Islamic State group, which has already claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attacks. Both last year and in Gallup's latest poll, conducted March 2-6, about half of Americans say they have \"a great deal\" of worry about another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, up from percentages mostly around or less than 40% in the previous 11 years.\nGallup's longer-term trend on terrorism concerns, first asked in 1995 and last updated in December, also found about half of Americans saying they are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried about personally becoming a victim of terrorism. And a January poll also found a decrease in Americans' satisfaction with the nation's security from terrorism.\nOlder Americans appear to worry more than younger Americans about potential terrorist attacks in the U.S. Less than half of Americans under the age of 50 say they worry \"a great deal\" about the issue. Meanwhile, about half of those between the ages of 50 and 64 (49%) and the majority of seniors aged 65 and older (58%) report worrying \"a great deal.\"\nConcern about possible terrorist attacks also differs by party. Republicans (64%) are much more likely than Democrats (36%) to say they worry \"a great deal\" about the possibility of future terrorist attacks in the U.S. About half of independents (48%) share this degree of worry on the issue.\nBecause Gallup has found an increase in Americans' worries about terrorism in the aftermath of past high-profile attacks, worry might increase after the attacks in Brussels, at least in the short term. Even before the latest attacks occurred, the level of concern was relatively high by post-9/11 standards.

{"idx": "27044", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: After a decisive electoral victory in October 2015 by the conservative Law and Justice party (known by its Polish acronym PiS), the politics of memory became a policy priority in Poland.\nFollowing more than two decades of negligence and avoidance when it came to the nation\u2019s past, in which nearly all of Poland\u2019s post-communist governments deemed it politically unrewarding to rouse historical demons and risk partisan support, the PiS government undertook an unprecedented project: re-narrating Poland\u2019s recent history.\nIt definitely helped that PiS became the first party in post-communist Poland to rule without a coalition partner. Governing with no impediments, it was capable of not only producing its own narrative of Polish history but also using that historical revisionism as a tool to exacerbate the country\u2019s already profound political polarization. Internally divided, with a society segmented into political tribes and a public space brimming with hatred, ever more distant from the core of European Union, and at loggerheads with almost all its neighbors, Poland today appears to be the antithesis of its own post-transitional success. Once a powerhouse of democratic institutions and liberal change, it is now slowly descending into a mafia-like state\u2014much closer to the model of governance promoted by Moscow than by Brussels.\nThe founding myth of the PiS is the betrayal of the 1989 Round Table agreement. At the time, Poland\u2019s democratic opposition came to terms with the communist leadership, cementing the latter\u2019s eventual retreat from power. It\u2019s true that the outgoing regime was indeed assured a comfortable passage into democracy, with substantial political privileges and economic handicaps still in their hands. But the agreement also provided for relinquishing power without spilling a single drop of blood, accepting democratic rules of the game, and agreeing on the country\u2019s total independence from Moscow, despite several thousand Soviet troops still stationed there. The Round Table deal set the tone for Poland\u2019s democratic transition that followed. It was a protracted, nonviolent process that paved the way for the first partially free democratic elections in the entire Eastern bloc, on July 4, 1989.\nYet for PiS politicians, the Round Table agreement represents a betrayal. Far from being the birthplace of Polish freedom, it was a rotten deal in which the soul of the nation was sold for political and economic privilege. Headed by PiS\u2019s chairman, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party\u2019s politicians instituted a systemic campaign of questioning the entirety of Polish post-transitional record right after assuming power in 2015. During the first PiS government, ruling in the years 2005 to 2007, their views were much less primitive, while Kaczynski\u2019s radicalism was tamed by his more moderate twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, then the country\u2019s president.\nIn their eyes, the Round Table represents a mere change of labels, a secret, profoundly disgusting pact that the dominant, liberal-intellectual faction of the 1980s opposition\u2014encompassing also ex-Communist Party members, Social Democrats, and former Marxists\u2014established with the outgoing regime to allow the latter\u2019s smooth transition into democracy. In the view of PiS, Round Table was an abandonment of the opposition, the society, and the Polish tradition of uncompromising freedom-fighting.\nKaczynski was the pivotal figure in all of this because he has played a major role both in the"}

The entire endeavor is tinged with futility, as the horrible weather seemingly mocks their efforts. While they struggle, the African American Jackson family rides by with all their possessions strapped to their buggy as if they\u2019re fleeing the farm. Henry\u2014who is white\u2014sees them and asks the patriarch Hap Jackson (Rob Morgan) for help. Even with little context for the moment, viewers can tell from the look on Hap\u2019s face and the \u201940s period setting just how big a line Henry is crossing. It\u2019s just as easy to see that, despite the quiet insult, Hap can\u2019t decline.\nMudbound, which debuted on Netflix and in limited theaters last weekend, is an old-fashioned epic drama about race relations in the 1940s Deep South, adapted from Hillary Jordan\u2019s 2008 novel. The film touches on the evil of the Jim Crow era, the oft-ignored post-traumatic stress suffered by servicemen returning from World War II, and the stifling sexism of the time. Mudbound is beautifully shot, well-acted, and surprisingly sweeping for a movie with a relatively small budget of $10 million; if it\u2019s guilty of anything, it\u2019s perhaps trying to do too much at once, which is understandable given its novelistic scope.\nBut Rees, whose debut fiction feature Pariah announced her impressive talent as a director in 2011, has a gift for smaller, multilayered moments, like Henry\u2019s transgression in asking Hap to help bury his father. Even before the story gets underway, the audience can recognize how Henry is leveraging his institutional power over a black tenant living on his land. He can\u2019t technically order Hap to assist him, but Henry is taking advantage of a terrible legacy of slavery and subjugation, one he\u2019d never openly acknowledge.\nBefore it explains what exactly drove the Jackson family from Henry\u2019s land or what killed Henry\u2019s father, Mudbound then cuts back to somewhat happier times. Even then, it\u2019s obvious that darker days are around the corner. Henry purchases his Mississippi farm seemingly as a way to prove his worth, to live independently off the land with his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan) and their children. Hap is a tenant on Henry\u2019s farm who dreams of buying his own land and living independently with his wife Florence (Mary J. Blige) and their kids. The two families\u2019 daily work, digging through the caked mud to plant their crops, is strikingly similar, but there\u2019s a vast gulf between them.\nRees (who co-wrote the script with Virgil Williams) explores that divide in various episodic tales. When their children get whooping cough, Henry and Laura compel Florence to help nurse the pair back to health, eventually taking her on as a maid (a job she resents, but with a salary she can\u2019t turn down). Henry\u2019s virulently racist father Pappy (Jonathan Banks) moves to live with the family and starts associating with similarly toxic folk in town, as well as openly sowing discord between the Mc"}

The special counsel has alleged 25 Russians, including 12 military officers, conspired to hack Democrats\u2019 emails and wage a social media influence campaign to sway the outcome of the 2016 election, and described in astonishing detail how they did so.\nNotably, though, Mueller has not brought criminal charges against any members of the Trump campaign for co-ordinating in that effort. He has charged several with lying to his investigators or to Congress \u2014 adding most recently to that list Roger Stone, a friend of Trump\u2019s for decades whom Mueller has accused of trying to thwart lawmakers\u2019 effort to investigate Russian interference in the election.\nMueller could still charge others or detail in a report whether his investigators came to believe there was coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. Strong majorities of Democrats and Republicans say Mueller\u2019s report should be made public in its entirety, with 81 per cent overall supporting its release.\nThat is far from a guarantee, though. William Barr, Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general who is expected to be confirmed this week, has declined to commit to releasing Mueller\u2019s findings, asserting that Justice Department guidelines stipulate a confidential report would be provided to the attorney general. The Justice Department, Barr has noted, generally does not reveal unflattering information about people who prosecutors decide should not be charged with crimes.\nJust over 4 in 10 Americans believe Mueller has proved members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign lied about contacts with Russians, and views on that question split sharply on partisan lines. More than 6 in 10 Democrats believe Mueller has proved Trump campaign members lied about such contacts, while more than 7 in 10 Republicans say he has not.\nTwo of Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen \u2014 have pleaded guilty to lying about the substance of their contacts with Russians, and a third, former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, has admitted to lying about his conversations with a London-based professor who had told him the Russians held \u201cdirt,\u201d in the form of thousands of emails, on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nThe poll\u2019s findings suggest that while Mueller has maintained significant credibility with the public, he faces a monumental challenge in issuing a report that is accepted and understood across the political spectrum.\nA sizable 34 per cent minority believes the special counsel has proved Trump\u2019s campaign co-ordinated with Russia to help the Republican win, an allegation Mueller has not made. A 55 per cent majority of Democrats believe Mueller has proved Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia.\nWhen he was appointed, Mueller was tasked with investigating whether there were \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\u201d with Trump\u2019s campaign.

Mission accomplished!\nBut some Oklahoma lawmakers appear bent on inflicting punitive measures on an industry that wants to do business in our windy state.\nAmong other things, a handful of bills would single out wind power for a $1-per-megawatt-hour generation tax, impose unnecessary fees for the production and decommissioning of wind power, take back incentives already awarded to wind power producers, and establish setbacks for airport runways, public schools, hospitals and almost any kind of military site or activity. Another measure would shift oversight of siting, notification and \u201cno hazard\u201d determination plans from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission.\nThese are not good-faith efforts borne from concerns about public safety. They are instead calculated efforts to thwart the development of one of the most improved, competitive and cleanest forms of power generation.\nDespite these misguided efforts, wind power projects will continue to be developed in Oklahoma. Last year, the Sooner State added 576 megawatts of new wind power capacity, according to the American Wind Energy Association. That number, though, could have been higher and Oklahoma could have retained its No. 2 spot in wind power capacity if state leaders had condemned this campaign against wind and created a business-friendly environment for developers wanting to capitalize on the revolution taking place in power generation.\nInstead, the state dropped to No. 3 in operational capacity, as other states built wind power projects that could have been sited in Oklahoma.\nOklahoma should be known as a dynamic, forward-looking place to live and work. If state lawmakers don\u2019t kill this legislative waste early in this year\u2019s legislative session, the state\u2019s efforts to recruit and retain enterprising businesses and a progressive workforce may suffer a permanent setback.\nWind power critics point to the so-called unsightly look of wind turbines, the noise they can create for nearby residents, the temporary footprint they create during construction and the birds they kill during operation. These are real impacts of wind power production and construction. But these impacts are exaggerated and are a small price to pay for the efficiencies of a modern power system that will increasingly rely on wind, solar and energy storage as resources for power generation.\nI have yet to hear anyone provide a valid reason that justifies a campaign to cripple the state\u2019s thriving wind power industry. If ending the industry\u2019s preferential treatment were the goal, then that end has been achieved.\nIn addition to ending the half-cent tax credit for zero-emission generation, the state also ended a five-year exemption for local property taxes. It was time for the wind power industry to survive on its own. It is surviving and it is going to play a starring role in a revolution Oklahoma will be forced to embrace.\nThe well-funded opposition to Oklahoma wind power relies on ancient rhetoric and ignores the progress and realities of today\u2019s modern power system. It ignores the steady cost reductions of wind power supplies and technology. It also ignores the need to offset lost capacity resulting from coal plant retirements, the growth of energy storage capacity and grid improvements designed to foster the development of wind and solar power.\nLawmakers should not be spending their valuable time on bills that do nothing to move the state forward"}

Next are Conf finals losers, Finals loser, Champion. Previous seasons have no implication.\nIt IS stupid, but that's how it is anyway.\nMakes zero sense to me. Sharks demolished Anaheim in the first round yet they get a higher pick. Stupid.\nI liked Bettmans response. \"Shut it, you can boo me all you want later.\"\nHe does play the role of villian well.\nI've always found the booing stupid anyway. It's not like he's the one making the real decisions. He just represents all of the owners. If Bettman were gone it would just be another puppet for the owners.\nBernier is a free agent. He can sign anywhere he wants. Not sure how that move affects him.\nI'll be pretty upset if we take another Power Forward.\nNot sure I follow. Varlamov is better than Bernier and it's not even close. Last year, Bernier had a .913 SV% and 2.85GAA last season. Varlamov had a 2.68SV% and .920SV %. Bernier only got a lot of game time because Varlamov had injury problems last year.\nLike I said, this move has no affect on Bernier. He is a free agent so he owes nothing to the Avs, and the Avs, don't owe him anything either. I think he would rather try and stick it somewhere else where he has a chance of getting more game time.\nAgreed. No idea how Dobson fell outside the top 10.\nFriendly reminder that the Oilers gifted them the draft pick that the Islanders turned into Mathew Barzal.\nThat team has always been on the bubble since Tavares pulled them out of the sunken place. I almost hope he stays so they can finally turn into a contender sometime in the near future.\nNice to see NHL Second Team All-Star Seth Jones making the pick for Columbus. I love his game and I still can't believe the mustard tigers decided he was the odd man out on their backend.\nCalgary and Arizona are always looking for better goaltending. Vancouver too.\noh I was just making a joke that he seems to always be confused. like when Freddie got traded to Toronto he was genuinely confused as to why they would do that -- and sign him to such a big deal -- when he, himself, is on the team. Like, the rest of the hockey world knew this meant he was going to be traded...but for some reason that was completely lost on Bernier.\nLike I imagine him seeing that trade and going \"huh...wait...I don't get it...when I sign with them there will be 3 pretty good goalies then...\"\nGot enough skunks on stage LA? Hurry up you clowns.\nSharks took the highly talented kid with a bad work ethic/attitude. I hope he busts.\nEither Rangers were afraid Ducks were going to take their guy, or they didn\u2019t think he\u2019d make it to 26.

However, the prosecutors did note that there are factors in the 22-year-old former Oregon State University student&apos;s case that would allow the judge to be more lenient. In that event, prosecutors asked for a sentence of 40 years.\nMohamud&apos;s defense team suggested 10 years.\nThe judge is expected to hear arguments regarding the sentence and possibly hear from Mohamud at a hearing Sept. 6, but the date may change.\nThe Oregonian and KGW-TV carried reports on the court filings.\nThe 107-page defense memo included the apology letter and reports from two government psychiatrists who describe Mohamud as a low risk of \"future dangerousness.\"\n\"Mohamed&apos;s life is worth saving: he will prove himself worthy of any mercy the court can provide to temper what he knows will be a significant prison sentence,\" his lawyers wrote. \"The family&apos;s indescribable suffering at the loss of the eldest son should be mitigated to the extent possible.\"\nMohamud wrote that reflecting on his conduct \"fills me with horror.\"\n\"My heart is filled with remorse, shame, sorrow, pain and misery every time I think about my actions on that day,\" he said.\nAnd he added, \"I am sorry and I regret it, not because of jail time but because my heart is truly in shock.\"\nMohamud has been in jail since his arrest.\n\"I turned to books to expand my mind and explore the words of others and see where I could grow as a whole and let broader ideas into my mind,\" he wrote.\nThe reading list filed by the defense included nearly 150 books, among them: \"Animal Farm,\" &apos;&apos;Pride and Prejudice,\" &apos;&apos;The Quran\" and \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\"\nIn conclusion, Mohamud told the judge, \"I give you my word to make the best use of my incarceration, to make myself a better person and to help my fellow inmates to do so as well.\""}

So went the statements churning out of the teams\u2019 respective public-relations wings.\nSo pretty much the same thing as before, only more visual.\nThe tale behind this one is simple enough: When an operation is so serious that it will require an anticipated six months before the patient\u2019s return to full action, and when A-Rod now has undergone surgery on both of his hips, we proceed with extreme caution in the universe of expectations.\nIt\u2019s way too soon to start wondering how the third baseman/DH can help the 2013 Yankees, triply so whether the man with 647 career homers can pass Willie Mays (660), let alone Barry Bonds (762).\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, the good news was threefold: 1) Kelly successfully reshaped Rodriguez\u2019s left femoral head, which will stop the bone from hitting the labrum (and causing further damage) when A-Rod swings the bat; 2) the doctor repaired the labrum; and 3) the cartilage damage in the area was minimal, which means micro fracture surgery won\u2019t be necessary.\nHaving said all of that, the source proceeded, \u201cWhether he comes back or not comes back is all in the rehab.\u201d Rodriguez, his physiology changed, will have to establish new muscle memory.\nA few of those obstacles now rest behind A-Rod, hurdles leapt. Yet many more remain.\nThis isn\u2019t about the 2013 Yankees, per se. They signed Kevin Youkilis to serve as A-Rod\u2019s fill-in, and the two men put together 2012 campaigns that can be viewed as comparable, although you would give the edge to A-Rod. If these Yankees\u2019 fortunes depend upon the return of a healthy and productive A-Rod after the All-Star break, given that he has been in steady decline since signing his 10-year, $275-million extension in the 2007-08 offseason, then the two-time defending American League East champions are in trouble.\nNo, this is more about our favorite lightning rod, punching bag and headline generator, one of the very best players in the game\u2019s history no matter what illegal performance-enhancing drugs he took to get there. Wondering when he will be back and what he\u2019ll look like, assuming he can get back.\nWe always get the thumbs-up now.

Although by no means the first time I have visited an animal shelter, the experience never fails to fill me with both sadness and hope.\nThe sanctuary is located inside Tas-Sil\u0121 Fort, nestled between Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a and Marsaxlokk. It was built by the British Forces as a line of defence for Fort Delimara, and until about 60 years ago was used by the 100th Signals Unit of the Royal Airforce. In what was almost a sign of things to come, one of the RAF\u2019s canine mascots whelped her puppies there, and they were happily homed.\nThe Island Sanctuary lives up to its name. Any abandoned dog lucky enough to find its way there is truly blessed. As you approach the dog pens, you are welcomed by pen after pen of beautiful canine faces \u2013 some excited, some content, some hopeful and, yes, others fearful or angry.\nThese dogs come from many walks of life. Most have been cruelly abandoned by the family they loved so much. Others were born without a home and captured for their own safety. One of these dogs is Porto, so named because he was captured on the airport roundabout where he sheltered with his partner Mimma.\nPorto and Mimma were both strays and so afraid of people it was impossible to capture them. Until, that is, Mimma got hit by a car and was left for dead. Distraught, Porto wouldn\u2019t leave her side and that\u2019s how the sanctuary volunteers managed to capture both. Mimma is now a lot better and still lives with Porto. This is one of the happier stories.\nSadly, the refuge is also home to dogs that cannot be homed. They were raised to be aggressive fighters and then dumped by their owners when they no longer brought in money. Still bearing the scars of their many battles, these dogs are too dangerous to entrust to new owners.\nThey have grown up to hate both dogs and humans and need to be penned alone. The volunteers risk life and limb by entering their pen to clean, feed and care for them. While I was there I saw an experienced female volunteer weighing less than one of these 50-kilo dogs tending to it with all the love and patience you would give to a puppy.\nSome dogs are traumatised from abuse or neglect. Principessa is so afraid of people that when let out she invariably runs and hides under the bushes. Only one particular volunteer can manage to coax her out. These dogs remain anti-social and unhomable due to their terror.\nFor dogs that have mental scars, the sanctuary is a haven for the rest of their life, since it never puts down a dog unless it is suffering and it is absolutely necessary and when advised to do so by a vet.\nFor these dogs as well as old dogs that die there, a crematorium is available and their ashes are buried within the walls where they lived. The crematorium service is available to the public for many types of pets. You can take your pet\u2019s ashes home and it is a beautiful way of keeping your loved one close after they have passed on. A donation is needed to help cover the cost of cremation.\nFor many of the abused dogs, the physical and psychological healing begins once they are safely within the sanctuary. With the volunteers\u2019 help these dogs can be safely homed and the love of a new family can help them recover from trauma.\nDuring their time at the sanctuary the dogs live"}

About 40% of the cosmetics products targeting the general public received good scores.\n\"The top line for us, which is an unfortunate top line, is we realized black women have fewer healthy options when it comes to products marketed to them,\" Nneka Leiba, the deputy director of research with the Environmental Working Group and co-author of the study, told BuzzFeed News. \"That Black women buy and use more of these products could mean they are potentially exposed to more hazardous chemicals.\"\nWhile black consumers make up about 13% of the U.S. market, they account for as much as 22% of the $42 billion-a-year personal care products business, according to the report.\nThe disparity is worse for black women. The report found that the percentage of products scored as \"high hazard\" was about the same for both black and non-black market segments. But black women have fewer \"low hazard\" options marketed to them.\n\"If you\u2019re a black woman shopping for these products and you don't have any low hazard options, where do you go to?\" said Leiba.\nAbout 280 products evaluated by the group contain what it describes as hormone-disrupting chemicals such as parabens. Thirty products, including facial powders, foundations and styling products, contain imidazolidinyl urea, a formaldehyde-releasing preservative.\nThe worst-scoring products were hair relaxers, with an average score of 8.1 out of 10, with 10 being the worst hazard score. Hair color and bleaching products were the second most hazardous category with an average score of 7.9, according to the report.\nSusanne Montgomery, the director of research at Loma Linda University School of Behavioral Health, told BuzzFeed News that the findings validates some of the concerns she's raised through her research on the role estrogen and endocrine disrupting chemicals in black beauty products may have on black women's high incident rate of breast cancer.\n\"We're at the point where there is reason for concern and I feel that at the very least we should honor black women and give them the opportunity to discuss the available evidence and make their own decisions,\" she said. \"There's enough people lobbying them to buy products.

We\u2019ve become a very difficult side to play against, and hopefully we only keep improving once the manager is able to make the changes over the summer that he feels we need to become a better team.\nIn the short term, Paul is about to face his biggest test yet as Hibs manager because a derby at Tynecastle is never easy. It doesn\u2019t matter what level of form they\u2019re in, Hearts are always dangerous in this fixture. They\u2019ll be right up for it and will probably have big Uche Ikpeazu back. We\u2019re in good shape to go over there and give a good account of ourselves but it will take a really big effort to come away with a victory. The manager will learn a lot about his players \u2013 and the intensity of the Edinburgh derby \u2013 on Saturday. It will be another huge step in the right direction if he can get a victory that would take us above Hearts."}

Children of all ages relish the chance to try to navigate without a compass, develop knife skills and light a fire without matches. There is foraging for wild foods and medicines, and backcountry cooking to boot. It is great for family bonding and nobody will miss their screens for a second.\nFor a wet and wild adventure, try scaling a ghyll (a Cumbrian high mountain stream) in the Langdale Valley. Climb a waterfall, swim through deep pools and generally get totally drenched while having fun. It is an easy way to get children hiking through the stunning scenery without a single moan.\nIf you cross sailing with motor racing, you end up with land yachting. You will sit in a vehicle that looks a bit like a three-wheeled go-kart with a sail and, even if you have no previous sailing experience, after a short training session you will soon be racing the kids across the sands. Children aged five to 12 can sit alongside an adult in two-person land yachts.\nYou could do this at home, but if you are touring Norfolk, a trip to Bircham windmill near Sandringham lets children mix and shape their bready creations before leaving them to prove and be baked in an original coal-fired oven. As well as baking, there is also the chance to climb the mill and learn how flour was made in days gone by.\nIf they have not already, it is only a matter of time before your children are nagging to try this new sport. Also known as footgolf, it is (unsurprisingly) a combo of the two ball sports. Players use golf rules and football skills to kick a football into a cup in as few shots as possible. Courses are popping up around the country \u2013 and at Football Golf Pembs in Pembrokeshire, there is a skills area to practise in too.\nDiscover how to dig for ancient artefacts alongside Time Team professionals on a one-day archaeology camp.

Then one of the biggest heat waves on record hit. The high temperatures lingered in the triple digits for weeks and threatened to sunburn and shrivel the grapes as the vines shut down or slowed their metabolism.\nAny of those factors can hurt wine quality, but the vintners responded proactively, many protecting their crops with innovative practices such as shading the grape clusters with cloth and keeping the plants hydrated at night.\nThe ultra-high temperatures also caused a reduction in visitors to wine country, with many tourists and locals opting to forgo the squelching heat and either stay indoors or head someplace cooler. Meanwhile, all of the vegetation produced by the wet winter had become dry and brittle.\nBy late September, a cooling trend materialized, and just in time. Harvest is historically the busiest time for the majority of local businesses, with many tasting rooms and restaurants making upward of a quarter of their yearly revenue at that time. There was an audible sigh of relief as most of the grapes were harvested, safely being fermented or aged in wineries, and the wines tasting exceptionally delicious. Restaurants and hotels became full of tourists again, and everything was back to normal.\nThose earlier heat waves were nothing compared to the raging fires that began in the area on Sunday night, Oct. 8.

Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.: a new public insurance plan to compete with the private market, and whether employers must provide health care for their workers.\nThe committee was scheduled to meet daily through next week.\nDisagreements over costs and other issues hung up another key committee, the Senate Finance Committee, which has a more moderate makeup than Kennedy\u2019s panel and is considered Congress\u2019 best hope for producing a bipartisan bill.\nThe Finance Committee was supposed to produce a draft Wednesday.

His committee was supposed to start voting next week.\nMajority Democrats in the House could make their bill public this week, with committee votes after Congress returns from its July 4 recess.\nNegotiations were roiled Monday by an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that said Kennedy\u2019s bill would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years but leave 37 million people uninsured, compared with 50 million who are uninsured now.\nAnd on Tuesday a cost estimate for the Finance Committee bill became public: $1.6 trillion. Senators quickly huddled on ways to bring down costs, with Baucus insisting the final price tag on his committee\u2019s bill would be around $1 trillion.\nAt Kennedy\u2019s committee, officials said that after penciling in subsidies for families with incomes as high as $110,000, or 500 percent of the federal poverty level, they would limit the help to families up to $88,000 in income, or 400 percent of the poverty level.\nThe emerging Finance Committee bill also cuts off subsidies to help people buy insurance at 400 percent of the poverty level, but Baucus told reporters a reduction was \u201ca live option.\u201d There were indications the final cutoff would be closer to 300 percent of poverty \u2013 $66,000 for a four-person family.\nMajor cuts in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for some of the new costs but senators disagreed among themselves over whether to tax employer-provided health benefits \u2013 something Obama campaigned against. Also elusive was a compromise with Republicans on a new public insurance plan, which the GOP opposes.\nThe emerging bills envision a new insurance market \u201cexchange\u201d where people could go to shop for insurance coverage, helped by federal subsidies. Individuals will almost certainly be required to obtain coverage.\nBusiness groups were working overtime to soften any requirement for employers to provide coverage for their employees or face fines. Most large employers already offer health care, but senators are looking at requiring certain levels of care, so businesses fear a scenario in which the government would force them to offer more or different coverage than they already do.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that the plan requirements will be so robust that our members\u2019 plans won\u2019t meet those requirements,\u201d said Jeri Kubicki, the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 vice president for human resources policy"}

But Kismet never really took off, and as the location-based trend itself died down, the team decided to repurpose the technology for mobile messaging with Blink.\n\u201cWe want to let people be as anonymous, disconnected, and \u201coff the grid\u201d as they choose to be,\u201d explains Stephens. \u201cWhereas nearly all mobile messaging apps require a user to verify their phone number or confirm their identity in some way, the vast majority of our users prefer to remain anonymous,\u201d he says.\nTo date, Blink has seen around 100,000 downloads, but what\u2019s interesting are the app\u2019s demographics. Though around 51% of the app\u2019s user base is in the U.S., the next largest market Blink serves is the Middle East (15.4%), and nearly all of that group is from Saudi Arabia.\nBlink\u2019s traction in the Middle East makes sense, says Stephens, given how scarce privacy and anonymity are there. But he was also surprised that the service was taking off in that market, as it didn\u2019t yet support Arabic.\n\u201cWe believe a fair number of the anonymous users in the Middle East are ex-pats working overseas,\u201d Stephens says.\nBlink will now cater to this market in particular with localization to Arabic, and pro features that will be particularly relevant to businesses or ex-pats overseas who are concerned about anonymity and privacy. For instance, Blink will begin exploring more professional use cases \u2013 like wiping the messages off an employee or contractor\u2019s phone when they\u2019ve finished a job.\nDemand for Blink on Android was higher than typical, Stephens adds. Invite referrals to non-iOS devices had been ranging between 3-4 times than of iOS referrals, which he believes reflects Blink\u2019s popularity in markets like the Middle East where Android tends to dominate.\nThe new app is now available for download here on Google Play, or here on iTunes."}

You take a yam, cut it into a spiral, deep fry it, cover it in butter, smother it in sugar, coat it in cinnamon, eat. Is it healthy? Of course it\u2019s healthy\u2014yam is a superfood. The final product was a finalist at the 2009 Texas State Fair, before losing out to the eventual winner, deep-fried butter.\nA native of Dallas County, Whitley started off as a catfish cook and worked his way up the comfort food chain to an appearance on national television presenting Oprah and Gayle with a homemade sweet potato pie. He now teaches science at a public school. But last year he set his sights on something more daunting than the fried-food contest at the state fair\u2014getting elected to the Texas Legislature as a Democrat. Whitley, who\u2019s running in the Dallas-area 113th state House district, is one of a dozen candidates selected as part of a trial program for Battleground Texas, the Democratic organizing project launched last spring by a cast of Obama campaign veterans who are hoping to turn the nation\u2019s largest red state blue.\nBattleground\u2019s biggest investment is in the governor\u2019s race, where it threw its resources behind the campaign of state Sen. Wendy Davis. But Battleground has also invested heavily in a slate of 12 \u201cBlue Star Project\u201d candidates, giving them access to the group\u2019s army of volunteers and reams of field data, and working with first-time nominees to bring them up to speed. And with Republican Greg Abbott holding a steady double-digit lead over Davis in the polls, it\u2019s the performance of candidates like Whitley, in lower-profile state Legislature and judicial races from the Rio Grande Valley to Fort Worth, that might offer the clearest Election Day barometer of the group\u2019s success.\nBefore Battleground, Whitley says, Dallas Democrats\u2014Milton Whitley included\u2014\u201dwere good at eating donuts, but the organization wasn\u2019t there.\u201d In 2012, with President Obama\u2014normally a major boost to Democratic turnout\u2014on the ballot, Democrats failed to field a candidate in Whitley\u2019s district.

Now he\u2019s door-knocking six days a week in a golf cart\u2014souped up, in true Texas style, with a cab in the back and off-road capability.\nDavis\u2019 2013 filibuster of an anti-abortion bill also helped galvanize Texas Dems\u2014including several of Battleground\u2019s top candidates.

He had been told some hunter in Michigan took the beast with a bow within the last week that was allegedly over 400 lbs.\nSince I have functional eyeballs, there was no point debating the size of the animal. I mean, look at it. Even though I\u2019m fully aware of photography tricks and Photoshop, it appeared believable enough to me, though 350 \u2013 375 lbs. was even more believable.

As a rendering of the later, the Vulgate plural form, generationes , is treated in the article GENEALOGY. As a rendering of the former, the word generation is used in the following principal senses.\nIt designates a definite period of time, with a special reference to the average length of man's life. It is in this sense, for example, that, during the long-lived patriarchal age, a \"generation\" is rated as a period of 100 years ( Genesis 15:16 , compared with Genesis 15:13 , and Exodus 12:40 ), and that, at a later date, it is represented as of only 30 to 40 years.\nThe word generation is used to mean an indefinite period of time : of time past , as in Deut., xxxii, 7, where we read: \"Remember the days of old, think upon every generation\", and in Isaias, lviii, 12, etc.; of time future , as in Ps. xliv (Heb. xlv), 18, etc.\nIn a concrete sense, generation designates the men who lived in the same period of time, who were contemporaries, as for instance in Gen., vi, 9: \" Noah was a just and perfect man in his generations\"; see also: Num., xxxii, 13; Deut., i, 35; Matt., xxiv, 34; etc.\nIndependently of the idea of time, generation is employed to mean a race or class of men as characterized by the same recurring condition or quality. In this sense, the Bible speaks of a \"just generation\", literally \"generation of the just\" [Ps. xiii (Heb., xiv), 6; etc.], a \"perverse generation\", equivalent to: \"generation of the wicked\" [Deut., xxxii, 5; Mark, ix, 18 (Gr., verse 19); etc.].\nLastly, in Is., xxxviii, 12, the word generation is used to designate a dwelling place or habitation, probably from the circular for of the nomad tent. Whence it can be readily seen that, in its various principal acceptations, the word generation (usually in the Septuagint and in the Greek New Testament : genea ) preserves something of the primitive meaning of \"circuit\", \"period\", conveyed by the Hebrew term d\u00f4r."}

''This would have taken four pickers all day long,'' Mr. Meador said.\nCanopy shakers are still an unusual sight in Florida's orange groves. Most of the crop is harvested by hand, mainly by illegal Mexican immigrants. Nylon sacks slung across their backs, perched atop 16-foot ladders, they pluck oranges at a rate of 70 to 90 cents per 90-pound box, or less than $75 a day.\nBut as globalization creeps into the groves, it is threatening to displace the workers. Facing increased competition from Brazil and a glut of oranges on world markets, alarmed growers here have been turning to labor-saving technology as their best hope for survival.\nGlobal competition is pressing American farmers on many fronts. American raisins are facing competition from Chile and Turkey. For fresh tomatoes, the challenge comes from Mexico. China, whose Fuji apples have displaced Washington's Golden Delicious from most Asian markets -- and whose apple juice has swamped the United States -- is cutting into American farmers' markets for garlic, broccoli and a host of other crops.\nSo even while President Bush advances a plan to invite legal guest workers into American fields, farmers for the first time in a generation are working to replace hand laborers with machines.\nMr. Simpson and other growers have devised a system that increases yields and cuts the demand for workers during the peak harvest time by 90 percent; rather than cutting grapes by hand and laying them out to dry, the farmers let the fruit dry on the vine before it is harvested mechanically.\nSome fruit-tree growers in Washington State have introduced a machine that knocks cherries off the tree onto a conveyor belt; they are trying to perfect a similar system for apples. Strawberry growers in Ventura County, Calif., developed a mobile conveyor belt to move full strawberry boxes from the fields to storage bins, cutting demand for workers by a third. And producers of leaf lettuce and spinach for bag mixes have introduced mechanical cutters.\nAmerican farmers have been dragging machines into their fields at least since the mid-19th century, when labor shortages during the Civil War drove a first wave of mechanical harvesting. Mechanization grew apace for the following 100-plus years, taking over the harvesting of crops including wheat, corn, cotton and sugar cane.\nBut not all crops were easily adaptable to machines. Whole fruit and vegetables -- the most lucrative and labor intensive crops, employing four of every five seasonal field workers -- require delicate handling. Mechanization sometimes meant rearranging the fields, planting new types of vines or trees and retrofitting packing plants.\nRather than make such investments, farmers mostly focused on lobbying government for easier access to inexpensive labor. California growers, the biggest fruit and vegetable producers in the nation, persuaded the government to admit Mexican workers during World War I. Later, from 1942 to 1964, 4.6 million Mexican farm workers were admitted into the country under the bracero guest"}

What started out as Greece having a few debt issues has turned into a full-blown currency crisis, with talk of some countries even wanting out of it altogether.\nPersonally, I think it goes too far to say that the two things - debt and currency issues - are directly linked. The euro isn't in trouble because of Greece's debt. However, Greece and a clutch of other European countries with debt problems have had to turn to the European monetary union for financial help, which has MADE it Europe's problem. I guess what it has exposed is perhaps an inherent flaw in the system - a zone which was supposed to unite economies and make them stronger has in fact made it easier for problems to spread, BECAUSE they share the same notes and coins.\nFor what it's worth I still think the euro is a good idea. Standardised money and rates across dozens of countries makes it infinitely easier for residents and travellers alike ... and let's not forget the euro is only 11 years old - still a child with time to develop and mature. The current talk of abandoning it is, I feel, just a little bit premature.\nBut I've been known to be wrong before!\nAnd while we're talking euro, have a look at some of Al Jazeera's Europe blogs ... interesting insight from our correspondents in the region.\nPlenty more on the show this week too. We look at a hugely interesting issue, that of internet paywalls and journalism. The Times of London has become the latest big paper to start charging readers for online content. It's a difficult one really - one of the things about the internet was that information was (broadly) free and easy to access, but then why should a newspaper charge for its hard-copy versions and not its online versions, particularly when the online ones have more and fresher content? We'll speak to Bryan Glick from Computer Weekly magazine about that.\nAnd as the World Cup draws to a close, we look at its legacy. Will it be investment in South Africa and its most needy, or big empty stadiums that never see a major match again. It's phenomenal how much money the big sponsors spend and make out of a tournament like the World Cup ... surely it could all be put to better use, especially in a place like Africa.\nSo lots to see this week, PLUS a new segment we're calling Money Talks.

The overwhelming majority of Greek workers took part in the strike with dynamic demonstrations and other forms of action. In that way, Greek people expressed their anger and despair over the devastating measures carried out in Greece in the past year and a half.\nThe relentless, vicious austerity measures have been imposed by the PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Movement) government and the \u201ctroika\u201d of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union.\nThe 48-hour strike had the highest participation and made for the biggest demonstrations since the end of the Greek dictatorship in 1974.\nOctober 28 was the national commemoration day of the resistance to the German occupation of Greece during WWII. Two days before, a decision had been made to appoint troika representatives in all Greek ministries to supervise the running of the country. Greek people across the country grabbed the opportunity of the commemoration celebrations to say \u201cNo\u201d to the new occupation by the troika.\nDuring the customary October 28 parades, the Greek people\u2019s resistance to the anti-people policies was expressed through banners, slogans, chants and marching students turning their heads from the officials.\nIn many cities, protesters drove away government representatives who arrived to attend the celebrations. In Thessaloniki, Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the accompanying officials were forced to leave. The protesters repeatedly chanted slogans such as, \u201cYou are not wanted by the people \u2014 Take the memorandums and leave\u201d.\nThe people\u2019s mobilisations sent a clear message to the government and the troika. But in response, the PASOK government dismissed the October 28 protests.\nIt accused the protesters of disrespecting sacred institutions and bringing down democracy. This is an interesting point, considering the PASOK government has repeatedly violated the constitution and people\u2019s basic human rights. It was also claimed that the protesters represent only a small minority of Greek citizens \u2014 a huge lie.\nThe government tried to play down the importance of the protests. However, its ensuing actions showed the Greek people\u2019s message had clearly got across.\nIf it were a genuinely democratic government, it would respond by trying to satisfy its people\u2019s demands. Instead, this government has opted for less democracy and more oppression.\nIts role has been exposed. It is acting in favour of domestic and foreign corporate interests at the expense of most Greek people.\nPrime Minister George Papandreou asked for a referendum during a PASOK leaders meeting on October 31. The exact question for the proposed referendum was unclear.\nBy bringing up the possibility of a referendum the government was likely bidding for time. It was aiming at appeasing, confusing and manipulating the people.\nThe announcement brought on a strong reaction by troika representatives. They didn\u2019t want to risk an unfavourable outcome for their policies. The markets were also adversely affected.\nThen the likelihood of elections was mentioned, but taken back immediately.

In fact, some of them outright reject it as a way to help their clients find satisfaction with their eating habits and their bodies. Some of these professionals call themselves weight-neutral, others anti-diet, still others practice from a Health at Every Size (HAES) or intuitive eating perspective, embracing principles of body acceptance and diversity and pushing back against cultural norms of thinness and diet culture.\nBuzzFeed Health reached out to a bunch of these dietitians and asked them about their practice \u2014 why they took this approach, how it's worked for them, and what they've learned along the way.\nOf course, at BuzzFeed Health we understand that everyone has different feelings about and goals for their health and bodies; your decision to lose weight or stop trying to lose weight is yours alone. We're all making food- and body-related decisions for a zillion reasons, from health and digestion to societal cues to what we love or hate to eat, to what we have the energy to cook or the money to buy, to what our doctors might suggest to us. Bottom line: It's your call. We're just showing you the other side of the weight loss coin.\n1. \"Because if dieting doesn't work for most people, why do we blame the individuals and not the approach?\"\n\"My approach to working with clients is weight-neutral, meaning I'm concerned with their thoughts and behaviors, not the number on the scale. To people who are curious about my approach, I explain that weight does not dictate health, and there is no way of predicting what someone's healthiest weight is. Even if we could, 95\u201397% of purposeful weight loss attempts fail. Instead, I help my clients build sustainable habits that aren't built on restriction, and let their body settle at whatever size it's supposed to be.\nAfter practicing as a very traditional, weight-focused dietitian for a few years, it was clear to me that weight loss approaches just do not work. I would see clients who would make all the changes, and either lose weight and gain it back, or the scale wouldn't budge at all. Many would struggle to make any changes at all. If an approach isn't achievable for a large percentage of people, why do we blame them and not the approach?\"\n2. \"Dieting is black and white, all or nothing. In that paradigm, if someone is not doing 'all,' then the only option they have at their disposal is 'nothing.'\"\nA non-diet approach involves granting oneself unconditional permission to eat.\nGiven that frame of reference, when we propose a non-diet approach to chronic dieters, their initial reaction is some version of, 'If you are not putting me on a diet, what are we possibly going to do?' Such a reaction is understandable given their history, so we show them that another way exists.\nA non-diet approach involves granting oneself unconditional permission to eat and developing an internal system based upon recognizing and honoring hunger and fullness cues, eating enjoyment, and noticing how different foods affect the body. Instead of citing a presumed lack of willpower or a supposed food 'addiction,' we ask deeper questions in a neutral fashion to explore why someone might be eating when they are not hungry or over-consuming certain foods.

British businesses, including banks, have been experiencing a miserable time, and any success, let alone a success on this scale, will be good for morale. Barclays' pre-tax profit in 2009 was \u00a311.6billion, which includes a profit of \u00a36.3 billion from the sale of Barclays Global Investors.\nBecause I have worked with them, I have considerable regard for what might be called the old-fashioned side of Barclays. In 1983, I revived an old firm, Pickering and Chatto, as an independent publishing house.\nI was advised to go to Barclays as a bank with massive experience of dealing with small businesses. Barclays was willing to offer a moderate overdraft facility, on modest security. Over time Pickering's business has developed - we have published several hundred titles, created a number of jobs and repaid the original overdraft. Pickering now has money on deposit with Barclays, not the other way round.\nThis is how retail banking is supposed to work, and it often does. I do not say we could not have done it without Barclays, but it might not have been so straightforward.\nHelping retail customers is only part of Barclays' business - it makes big profits, or losses, in investment banking.\nIt is small businesses which create more jobs, proportionate to large ones. In any case, big businesses find it easier to raise funds - there is a funding gap between investments of \u00a310,000 and \u00a31million which only the banks can fill.\nSmall businesses fill niches in the economy which are too narrow to be profitable for larger firms. Without Barclays' services, the retail banking system in Britain would be much weaker, Britain would be poorer, unemployment would be higher.\nThe strength of the Barclays operation has been demonstrated by the fact that the bank did not have to go directly to the Government to survive the banking crisis. It also reflects the success of Barclays' investment arm run by Bob Diamond. Barclays chief executive, John Varley, was one of the few executives able to speak for his bank at the height of the panic in a measured way. He was educated at Downside, a Benedictine school, and showed a calm confidence one might expect in an abbot.\nBarclays group chairman, Marcus Agius, also issued a statement which amounted to a commitment to a social philosophy for banking. The statement recognised that 'the bond of trust between banks and their stakeholders has been significantly weakened by the events of the last three years'. Too true.\nDuring the crisis, the banks have been criticised for taking ill-judged speculative risks which forced them to turn to the Government for funds. This type of risk was handled by Barclays with considerable success.\nAlmost all banks were also criticised for paying excessive bonuses, and they still are.\nBarclays has paid very large bonuses this year, which seems shockingly extravagant to the general public. These bonuses have, however, allowed Barclays to appoint teams of star dealers.\nCritics of banks have put two hard facts together. The first is that most of the money that was lost in the panic was not lost by the retail bankers, though Northern Rock itself was a retail bank. The speculations which proved so disastrous were largely by investment banks.\nThe second fact is banks have continued to pay bonuses of millions of pounds despite bad results. MPs, criticised for their own expenses, have described as 'obscene' the bonuses bankers are paying themselves.\n"}

In a recent blog post, the internet pioneer, entrepreneur, and activist announced his plans to create a back-up archive in Canada to ensure continued, unfettered access to the platform's billions of free site histories, books, videos, and other materials--something Kahle believes is directly threatened by the U.S.' incoming administration.\nThroughout history, libraries have fought against terrible violations of privacy\u2014where people have been rounded up simply for what they read, [and] we are fighting to protect our readers\u2019 privacy in the digital world ... For us, it means keeping our cultural materials safe, private and perpetually accessible. It means preparing for a Web that may face greater restrictions. It means serving patrons in a world in which government surveillance is not going away, [and] looks like it will increase.\nAs Motherboard points out, Kahle's fears for the safety of the Internet Archive, and for its presently nonpartisan record of events, may well be warranted. During Trump's campaign, the site notes, the now-president elect \"appeared to favor a hardline stance on internet censorship\" in stating, for example, that combating extremism should involve \"[closing] that internet up\" and potentially limiting access to certain content--almost all of which has been archived by the nonprofit over time, including controversial posts that've since been taken down. Anticipating push-back to this stance, perhaps, Trump further commented that those who would protest such censorship in the name of freedom of speech are \"foolish people,\" Motherboard reports.\nNevertheless, the group's dedication to fostering insight through information stands to benefit politicians as much as it does private citizens. In addition to providing the world with free, private access to whole petabytes of documents, Kahle says, the Internet Archive's snapshot-gathering Wayback Machine supplies our democracy (and any to follow) with a fundamentally crucial element: historical hindsight.\n\"[It's] saving 300 million Web pages each week, so no one will ever be able to change the past just because there is no digital record of it,\" he explained. \"The Web needs a memory, the ability to look back.\"\nDepending how the next several years shake out for internet policy, however, a look back at American politics--and at the swirling mass of history and culture that surrounds it--may require a digital trip to Canada."}

The provincial government imposed a controversial merger on the six municipalities that stretched from Etobicoke Creek to the Rouge River, Lake Ontario up to Steeles Ave.\nThe forced amalgamation of Toronto, York, Etobicoke, East York, Scarborough and North York was resisted with verve, vigour and the kind of civic passion unparalleled since the huge majority of residents (three in four) had their protests squelched.\nMike Harris introduced Bill 103 at Queen\u2019s Park. The entire creation, it seemed, hollered \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 in referenda, nightly vigils, legislative filibuster and with the amplification provided by every available democratic tool. To no avail. The majority Tory government carried the day. The old city was history. A new one would be born eight months later. And everywhere, the citizens vowed never to love the child born out of what amounted to a political assault akin to forced marriage.\nThe fight has gone out of the dog \u2014 reality never matches the warnings of doom and destruction, so people forget what they had and what they\u2019ve lost and celebrate survival where spectacular success was possible. But look close to the surface and the wounds are only now healing.\nOf course, this sounds like strange doctrine to so many. Hundreds of thousands of newcomers have since arrived. The only Mad Max mayor they know of is Rob Ford, not the original Bad Boy Mel Lastman. Ancient grievances between old Toronto and the regional government of Metro Toronto are lost on them. They don\u2019t get the stubborn, latent whine from Scarborough that the burbs get no respect.\nMarket Value Assessment. A New Deal for City. Downloading. Relics of the past, yes, the very near past. Still, one rarely hears calls for de-amalgamation.\nBy the time the amalgamated government took office on Jan. 1, 1998, the metropolis had grown weary. And Harris bludgeoned what little fight was left by turning the bazooka on the city with an unprecedented dump of service costs and cuts on the new city, rendering it almost stillborn.\nQueen\u2019s Park used to pay close to three-quarters of capital costs and half the operating costs for the TTC. Harris advised the new government it was getting out of paying the operating costs and grudgingly supplied a diminishing percentage of the cost of building the system and supplying it with vehicles.\nHousing, a social cost if there ever was one, became Toronto\u2019s responsibility. He stopped paying for sections of highways and dumped the cost on the city. And those costs have framed the fiscal arguments for the past 20 years.\nThe changeover was so tumultuous and seemingly designed to destabilize the city that, in order to survive, Toronto had to pull together.\nUnderstand, this was the time the province filled in the tunnel already being built for the Eglinton West subway \u2014 yes the very route where the Crosstown LRT is being built now. Harris said no to the Spadina extension now going up to Vaughan. He acquiesced to Lastman for the Sheppard Subway, but short-turned it at Don Mills Rd., instead of all the way to the Scarborough Town Centre.\nTo many reading this, it is ancient history. But there are direct lines from our current fiscal issues to those decisions. Due to heroic, sustained advocacy, much of the social service costs"}

The NetWin 200, which is based on EMC\u2019s CX200 disk processor enclosure and a dual Intel Corp. Pentium 4 processor-based server attached to as many as 30 146GB disks, is aimed at customers who will implement it in a core-to-edge NAS/storage-area network configuration.\nIn this configuration, customers will install smaller Windows Storage Server appliances at the edge of the network that feed into the NetWin 200. In turn, NetWins will connect to Celerra NS600 arrays and then into Celerra Clustered Network Server boxes, which are connected to EMC Symmetrix storage arrays in the data center.\nIn addition to having as much as 4 terabytes of usable capacity, the NetWin 200 will have redundant cooling fans and data paths, and RAID 5 support, as well as EMC\u2019s PowerPath option, which switches data to an alternate path when the primary path fails.\nThe NetWin 200 will be managed by new software, the NaviSphere Agent for Windows Storage Server, which lets users create, delete and expand volumes, as well as monitoring and alerting for array faults or other problems. Like EMC\u2019s other NAS products, the NetWin 200 also can be managed from a Web interface or the Microsoft Management Console. It will work with EMC\u2019s OnCourse software for the automatic replication and distribution of files across the network. The front-end server runs Windows Storage Server 2003; the CX200 array runs EMC\u2019s Flare operating system.\nAs for the EMC Celerra NS600G SAN/NAS gateway, sources say it is based on EMC\u2019s Celerra NS600 NAS system. Unlike the NS600 though, the NS600G enables an Ethernet connection to separate Fibre Channel storage. The NS600G consists of a decoupled NS600 in which the NAS head can connect to several types of back-end Fibre Channel storage. It will support attachment to Clariion CX400 and CX600 arrays first, followed by connection to EMC Symmetrix arrays. Sources also say EMC is considering allowing the NS600G to work with other vendors\u2019 storage arrays.\nThe new Celerra NS600 NAS system has one controller instead of two and reportedly will be less expensive, although EMC has not announced prices or said when it will be available.\nThe NetWin 200, which is available now"}

In China today, it is hard to walk down the street or watch TV without catching a glimpse of a delicate face belonging to a household-name xiao xian rou, such as Li Yifeng, Yang Yang, or Wu Yifan. With First Class for the New Semester, which is produced jointly by China Central Television and the Chinese Education Ministry and is mandatory viewing for parents and children, some of China\u2019s older generation decided that they had had quite enough of these poreless wonders.\nMore than 100 years later, Mao\u2019s successors have arrived at much the same conclusion.\nAs the rising superpower flexes its muscles abroad, nationalistic propaganda films such as Wolf Warrior 2 and Operation Mekong pulse with images of burly, steely-eyed men. Military recruitment campaigns are on the rise. But such portrayals of masculinity run against the cultural tide\u2014like it or not, Chinese youth continue to nurse an insatiable appetite for xiao xian rou. And as much as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) loves a good social engineering challenge, aesthetic preferences are hard to instill from the top down. Moreover, xiao xian rou are too entrenched a part of the culture industry. For a country hoping to shift to a consumption-based economy, simply banning these delectable morsels\u2014as the party did with displays of tattoos in the media in the so-called \u201chip-hop ban,\u201d resulting in heavy makeup for some young actors and musicians\u2014is not a viable option.\nLike a lot of things about Chinese pop culture, these national idols are a foreign import. Their provenance can be traced to the classic 2001 Taiwanese drama Meteor Garden, which offered up what are arguably the direct ancestors to today\u2019s xiao xian rou. Telling the story of a clique of four handsome, rich, and arrogant boys called the F4 who terrorize a college campus, and the spunky girl who challenges them, Meteor Garden centered the female gaze in a way no Asian drama had before.

Every legislator was docked points for H 52 and H 3928, bills that were moved along on voice votes in informal sessions and which require health insurance coverage of cleft palates and children and young adults\u2019 hearing aids. While few lawmakers were actually present for the unanimous vote, any lawmaker could have stopped its passage by raising an objection.\nAIM\u2019s interests are more closely carried by the minority party, the scorecard indicates, though Senate President Therese Murray (D-Plymouth) received one of the highest scores in the Senate, with an 86 percent favorable voting rate. Murray in November faces a rematch with Republican Tom Keyes, who she narrowly defeated in 2010.\nIn the House, 12 Republicans scored higher than 80 percent while only 8 Democrats passed that percentage point. In the Senate, Murray was the only Democrat to top 80 percent while three Republicans cleared that threshold. However, AIM credited both political parties with voting for what it considers business-friendly bills.\nHouse members voted more in concert with AIM\u2019s goals than the Senate; the median Senate score was 67 and the median House score was 78.\nThe lowest score was given to Rep. James Miceli (D-Wilmington) who scored a 50 percent for voting against municipal health reform and health care cost-containment while voting for child care workers\u2019 collective bargaining, and not voting on an amendment AIM supported, which exempts employees who already receive insurance from counting toward the number of employees when determining whether an employer meets state health insurance requirements.\nIn the Senate, the lowest score was assigned to Sen. Marc Pacheco (D-Taunton) who cast the lone vote against freezing the unemployment insurance rate in 2011, joined most of his Senate colleagues in rejecting the reversal of a 2008 law that gives triple damages for wage and hour violations, and voted for collective bargaining of child care workers. Regarding his vote on unemployment insurance rates, Pacheco said at the time that the proposal had no public hearings, noted passage of previous unemployment insurance rate freezes, and said he hoped to see changes that would make unemployment insurance more equitable for small businesses.\nSome Republicans were docked points for opposing the health care or electricity cost control bills while some Democrats received lower grades for supporting collective bargaining among child care workers and opposing municipal health insurance reform, which made it easier to move city and town employees into the state\u2019s Group Insurance Commission."}

Kummeth, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne commented, \"We are excited to acquire the Exosome Diagnostic technology platform and integrate it into the Bio-Techne portfolio. ExosomeDx's technology is a game changer, and positions Bio-Techne to be a leader in the rapidly-growing non-invasive liquid biopsy market. There are multiple synergies with our core company, including our 40-year track record of developing and commercializing the highest-quality biologicals, especially in the field of cytokines. We will leverage our strong brand and market leadership position to extend these core competencies to the science of exosomes and cell free-DNA (cfDNA) biology and their utility as novel diagnostic tools. The non-invasive nature of this technology creates a new process for liquid biopsies and is likely to transform medical practice. Exosome Diagnostics complements our molecular pathology business, Advanced Cellular Diagnostics (ACD), which remains a robust growth segment for the Company.\"\nCurrently Exosome Diagnostics markets a urine-based test, ExoDx\u00ae Prostate(IntelliScore) (EPI), to assist physicians in determining the need for a prostate biopsy in patients with an ambiguous PSA test result. Exosome Diagnostics has approximately 200 filed patents and applications to protect the technology and enable the development of novel, highly sensitive diagnostics in various pathologies with either difficult or no current diagnostic solutions, like prostate, bladder, kidney, breast, glioblastoma and a host of other cancers. Mr. Kummeth continued, \"This is a very strategic acquisition for us as we also expand in the CAR-T cell marketplace, leveraging our growing critical mass in cell culture-focused product lines. Following this acquisition, the Company now sells solutions to the entire workflow of cancer: research, diagnostics and therapeutics. When this transaction closes, Exosome Diagnostics will mark our 14th acquisition in the past 5 years, and our most promising to date. We expect big things to come!\"\nExosome Diagnostics Chief Executive Officer John Boyce added, \"Driving the company's significant growth over the last two and a half years was the derivation and execution of a three-pillar business model that focused on companion diagnostic deals"}

This update has been developed in line with guidance published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), stating that approved safety management systems (SMS) should consider cyber risk management in line with the ISM code before January 2021. NP133C has been revised to help mariners achieve this by providing a checklist to document threats and procedures to mitigate risk to ships.\nIn February 2017, the IMO also made important clarifications on training requirements for ECDIS, stating that seafarers are not required to take type specific training at designated colleges but that companies are still responsible for ensuring all seafarers employed on their ships are familiarised with ECDIS.\nTo support this, the revised version NP133C now includes checklists designed to document and evidence that ECDIS familiarisation training has been completed, thus helping to ensure evidence can be provided during Port State Control inspections.\nUKHO have also updated their popular \u2018Living with ECDIS\u2019 Seminar series to include perspectives on industry initiatives on cyber-security, as well as advice on how owners and operators can ensure that their ships are compliant with upcoming changes to the ISM code.\n1.

He shows me maps on his computer that he says outline racial separation in Milwaukee.\n\u201cThe river is sort of the eastern boundary, you\u2019ve got highways that are built, the construction of I-43 had a profound impact on the African-American community when it was built, 41 on the west side,\u201d Levine says.\nLevine says those boundaries have helped solidify segregation in the community. He traces the origins of the situation back to the 1950s and 60s, when many African-Americans migrated to Milwaukee from the South for factory jobs \u2013 which were plentiful.\n\u201cMilwaukee was a relatively booming industrial economy with jobs that were accessible to modestly skilled workers, particularly males who could work in manufacturing and Milwaukee was one of the leading manufacturing cities in the country,\u201d Levine says.\nBut, Levine says in the 1980s, a recession hit and factories started closing. The downturn devastated the city\u2019s north side where many manufacturers were located and African-American workers lived.\n\u201cThe 1980s were the brutal decade in Milwaukee. There\u2019s just no question about it. All the data from my study on economic inequality and racial inequality in Milwaukee shows that that\u2019s where the bottom really dropped out and that\u2019s where the rate of black male non-employment increased, not just unemployment but falling out of the labor force and all sorts of consequences flowed from that,\u201d he says.\nConsequences such as the drug trade, violence and mass incarceration.

In a statement, the UK health body said: \u201cThe new de-identification process (known as De-ID) will protect patient privacy by de-identifying a person\u2019s records in a consistent way.\nThe NHS is working together with software firm Privitar on the De-ID network. According to Engadget, NHS data director Tom Denwood said the body already anonymises data, but De-ID is a more standardised and consistent method of doing so in bulk.\nMore than two years ago, the news of Google-owned AI firm DeepMind\u2019s collaboration with the Royal Free NHS Trust caused consternation among privacy experts.\nThe Streams project \u2013 an app to help monitor patient records, analyse blood test results and detect kidney issues, among other things \u2013 was criticised by New Scientist. The publication suggested that the volume of data collected far outstripped the information required for the app\u2019s purposes.\nIn 2017, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) found that an NHS Trust broke the law by sharing sensitive patient data with DeepMind, in violation of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.\nThe ICO also separately ruled that 1.6m sets of patient data were not proportionate to what was required to test the Streams app.\nIn a separate announcement, external reviewers appointed by DeepMind to report on its operations have flagged a series of risks and concerns in a document, including the potential for DeepMind Health to be able to \u201cexert excessive monopoly power\u201d.\nAccording to the report, the FHIR (fast healthcare interoperability resource) used by DeepMind for the Streams app works with an open API, but the contract between DeepMind and the NHS Trust in question funnels connections via the AI firm\u2019s own servers, banning connections to other FHIR servers.\nA lack of clarity around the DeepMind business model was also flagged by reviewers, who noted that the general public would suspect a hidden agenda or undisclosed profit motive \u2013 this would then be difficult to change once entrenched in people\u2019s minds.\nMany are calling on the UK government to implement a strong strategy to manage and regulate public sector data and deployment of AI in sensitive areas such as healthcare."}

They knew that music sales in the United States are less than half of what they were in 1999, when the file-sharing site Napster emerged, and that direct employment in the industry had fallen by more than half since then, to less than 10,000. They studied the problem in all its dimensions, through multiple hearings.\nWhile no legislation is perfect, the Protect Intellectual Property Act (or PIPA) was carefully devised, with nearly unanimous bipartisan support in the Senate, and its House counterpart, the Stop Online Piracy Act (or SOPA), was based on existing statutes and Supreme Court precedents. But at the 11th hour, a flood of e-mails and phone calls to Congress stopped the legislation in its tracks. Was this the result of democracy, or demagoguery?\nMisinformation may be a dirty trick, but it works. Consider, for example, the claim that SOPA and PIPA were \u201ccensorship,\u201d a loaded and inflammatory term designed to evoke images of crackdowns on pro-democracy Web sites by China or Iran. Since when is it censorship to shut down an operation that an American court, upon a thorough review of evidence, has determined to be illegal? When the police close down a store fencing stolen goods, it isn\u2019t censorship, but when those stolen goods are fenced online, it is? Wikipedia, Google and others manufactured controversy by unfairly equating SOPA with censorship. They also argued misleadingly that the bills would have required Web sites to \u201cmonitor\u201d what their users upload, conveniently ignoring provisions like the \u201cNo Duty to Monitor\u201d section.\nThe hyperbolic mistruths, presented on the home pages of some of the world\u2019s most popular Web sites, amounted to an abuse of trust and a misuse of power. When Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information, but then exploit their stature to present information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations.\nAs it happens, the television networks that actively supported SOPA and PIPA didn\u2019t take advantage of their broadcast credibility to press their case. That\u2019s partly because \u201cold media\u201d draws a line between \u201cnews\u201d and \u201ceditorial.\u201d Apparently, Wikipedia and Google don\u2019t recognize the ethical boundary between the neutral reporting of information and the presentation of editorial opinion as fact.\nThe violation of neutrality is a patent hypocrisy: these companies have long argued that Internet service providers (telecommunications and cable companies) had to be regulated under the doctrine of \u201cnet neutrality\u201d because of their power as owners of the Internet pipes. But what the Google and Wikipedia blackout showed is that it\u2019s the platforms that exercise the real power. Get enough of them to espouse Silicon Valley\u2019s perspective, and tens of millions of Americans will get a one-sided view of whatever the issue may be, drowning out the other side.\nThe conventional wisdom is that the defeat of these bills shows the power of the digital commons.

But unlike its primary smartphone competitor Apple, Google doesn&apos;t need to generate revenue from the devices themselves.\nLike its up-and-coming digital ad competitor Facebook , what Google has long understood is that the value of dominating the mobile device OS market is in the data. All those devices with Google search and other online, ad-generating sites set as defaults help the search giant amass huge amounts of data it can then use to better target its marketing partners&apos; spots.\nWith that said, it seems only natural that Google would implement similar data-gathering processes from other services, like its lightning-fast Internet and cable TV alternative Fiber. Turns out it is, and this could prove to be a true game-changer not only for the television ad industry, but for Google shareholders.\nIt&apos;s all about the dataThere&apos;s a reason Facebook was able to charge those advertisers fortunate enough to participate in its recently completed video ad testing phase $1 million each day: video ads work. The reason they work isn&apos;t simply because video garners a better response rate than banner ads, though they do.\nThe primary reason Facebook is able to charge so much for video ads is that it has mastered the art of amassing, analyzing, and utilizing massive amounts of user data to ensure the right ad is shown to the right person, at the right time. That&apos;s why Facebook is able to demand as much as six times more than ads on Google&apos;s YouTube property.\nBut make no mistake, Google is hardly a data-collection and utilization neophyte, as most any user of its search engine can attest. For example, let&apos;s say you \"Google\" a trip to Las Vegas to find the cheapest flight or vacation package. The next time you log on it seems half the spots you see are travel-related. That&apos;s no accident, and it&apos;s a big part of the reason so many marketers are shifting their ad dollars to digital alternatives like Google and Facebook. Online ads are extremely targeted, unlike television, and the results can be measured with laser-like accuracy.\nThis is going to be goodAs it stands, of the nearly $600 billion expected to be spent on advertising this year, about a third will be of the digital variety. In other words, the majority of advertising dollars are still directed toward television. That&apos;s changing, but will remain the case for years to come.\nNow, imagine if a provider could measure a TV viewer&apos;s usage: the shows they watch, how long they watch them, and most importantly to marketers, exactly how many times their ads were seen? That&apos;s exactly what Google Fiber is rolling out in its Kansas City market, and as one industry pundit said, it&apos;s akin to advertising&apos;s \"holy grail.\"\nJust as with digital spots, Google said its \"Fiber TV ads will be digitally delivered in real time and can be matched based on geography, the type of program being shown (sports, news, etc.), or viewing history.\" It&apos;s that last criterion -- viewing history -- that truly differentiates Fiber from traditional TV alternatives.\nKnowing which viewer is likely to be watching a particular program, and when, is a marketing goldmine.

His friends teased him, called him Famous Seamus.\nMichael Rosen is a polymath who writes witty and devastating polemical articles about education. He is best known, though, for being a \u201cChildren\u2019s Laureate\u201d and for writing poetry that delights and amuses young children. Asked the other day why he writes for the very young, he replied that poetry is popular with children until they reach secondary school. They like reading it, hearing it, writing it, acting it out. Thereafter, poetry is associated, as Rosen put it, with humiliation. It\u2019s the stuff you get tested on, that crops up in examinations. For many, poetry remains a terrain full of misty, murky deformations of language, requiring esoteric and sometimes desperate decoding skills.\nHearing that word \u201chumiliation\u201d in relation to poetry on the day after we\u2019d learned that Seamus Heaney had died reminded me of a time in the early 1970s, when he sometimes stayed with us on his visits to London. Occasionally Marie, his wife, came too, and once they both came with their three small children en route to Berkeley, Calif., where they were to spend the year.\nI was teaching English in those days at Holland Park School, a London school, and one of his poems\u2014it was \u201cDigging,\u201d of course\u2014had appeared on an examination paper the year before as an \u201cunseen\u201d text. We talked about this at breakfast one morning, and I remember Seamus being torn between pleasure that his poem would be read by thousands of young people and anxiety at the thought of the questions those young people would be obliged to expound upon. Would his poem remind them of failure rather than success? How off-putting that might be. Perhaps they\u2019d avoid his poems for ever more. So he came with me to school and talked to the class that had read his poem. As city children, some of them needed more help with the digging than the writing part of the metaphor, and they wondered whether whether \u201csnug as a gun\u201d had anything to do with the IRA. I\u2019m pretty sure he said it didn\u2019t, and I am certain that his poem and his visit made a lasting impression that was anything but humiliating.\nIt was after that, though I no longer remember when, that our dear friend Seamus became so famous that you hesitated to drop his name in public. His friends teased him, called him Famous Seamus. When we invited a bookseller in to clear some shelves, the only books he really wanted were the Heaneys. And then there was the late night knock on our door in October 1995. Seamus had just heard, in the most roundabout way, that he\u2019d won the Nobel Prize. He brought the champagne that we needed to celebrate, and celebrate we did. He always had double feelings about his success and his fame. He was a naturally modest man, rather shy and embarrassable, who blushed as he greeted you, but he knew how good his work was and he never pretended not to. He had had a few poems published in Ireland, but none here so far, when my husband, Karl, who was literary editor of the New Statesman, published some in the journal in 1964. The poems arrived from Seamus with a stamped self-addressed envelope in case they were rejected. They weren\u2019t, of course. But it was a gesture typical of Seamus."}

And when in the spring of 1978 important treaties involving an artificial isthmus-spanning waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans was approved by the higher body of the American legislature, Thomas III was not dead. Further- more, he stayed extraordinarily close to the cultural pulsebeat of his time: we know, for instance, that his cousin Laura, of Hewlett (near Great Neck on the same forked island that stretched east- ward from New York City like an alligator with jaws slightly agape), was the secretary of a local \"fan club\" celebrating the fame of a con- temporary jongleur hero named Wil- liam J \u00f2\u00e9\u00ce. Finally, like so many of his time, Thomas III was deeply adjecti- val-sublunary, vertically symmetrical, non-arboreal, and, almost invariably, bipedal. B EFORE embarking on the story of Thomas III, however, I must say a few words about the methodological obstacles inherent in such an enterprise. First there is the unclear and conflict- , ing evidence regarding dates. For in- stance, certain documents would seem . . to indicate that Thomas III had two different dates for a \"freshman mix- er\" at Yale. 2 Numbers are as important to the historian as are dates, and the figures that come down to us from 1978 have their own serious vexations. For example, the local Chamber of Commerce publication put the popula- tion of Great Neck at 11,263, while records from the Mayor's office indi- cate that it was 11,200. In such cases, I have generally used the lowest figure, knowing that the people of 1 978 were no less prone to exaggeration than we are today. 3 Other kinds of discrepancies and enigmas abound. We know that young Thomas III matriculated at Yale in the fall, yet the notes of admissions directors from four other universi- ties show that the boy had promised to attend each of those schools if ad- mitted-promised \"on his mother's life,\" in two instances. On the larger canvas, we have indications that many Americans began to decorate their homes with the artifacts of industry and commerce-zinc laundry sinks in bathrooms, steam tables In kitchens, crane operator's seats in living rooms, fluorescent-lighting fixtures from po- 2 \"Terry and I had a boss time last night,\" he wrote in his diary on the day after the dance, while on the same day a certain Theresa Bu- gliosi said in a letter to a friend at Wellesley, \"Went to the mixer at New Haven with creepy Tom last night.

That follows a 1.6 percent rise last year. However, emissions were stable for the three years before that.\n\"Possibly, this year is unusual,\" said lead author Corinne Le Quere at the University of East Anglia. But probably not, she added. \"We think that emissions are probably still going to go up for some years unless things change drastically.\"\n\"I'm not that surprised,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center, who was not involved in the research. \"The world economy is growing, and the cheapest, most scalable easiest way to meet much of that growth still comes from incumbent fossil fuel technologies.\"\nProjected emissions from China, the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, rose by 4.7 percent this year. Le Quere said a government effort to boost construction and stimulate the economy increased demand for emissions-intensive steel, aluminum and cement.\nIn the United States, coal continued to give way to cleaner natural gas. But a cold winter and a hot summer both raised energy demands, contributing to an estimated 2.5 percent increase in emissions.\nRising oil use for transportation also was a factor, as American consumers are once again buying bigger cars.\nEmissions declined by 0.7 percent in the 28-nation European Union, though emissions from oil increased.\nThe transportation sector is the \"biggest problem, I would say, worldwide,\" Le Quere added. \"We are really not making a dent in emissions from transport, in spite of the fact that the technology for electric cars is there.\"\nThe good news is that renewable energy is growing by leaps and bounds. That should help take the edge off the emissions curve, even as growth picks up in another Asian giant \u2014 India.\n\"We're not going to see what we saw in China in the early 2000s\" when that country overtook, and then doubled, emissions of the previous leader, the United States, she said.\nTrembath cautions, however, that Africa remains a question mark. \"We see China- and India-like growth numbers, 5 to 10 percent annual GDP growth, coming from a lot of sub-Saharan African countries,\" he said. \"That could mean a lot more oil consumption, a lot more natural gas consumption.\"\nThat's not a bad thing on many levels, he added. \"These are desperately poor countries that are just trying to achieve the same standard of living we enjoy in the United States.\""}

Should people bother paying the penalty for not having health insurance when they file their taxes this year? Will they be able to sign up on the exchange for 2018 after their COBRA benefits end? Here are some answers.\nQ. I didn\u2019t have health insurance for part of last year and thought I\u2019d get stuck paying a penalty. Now the new administration is talking about not enforcing the insurance requirement. Could I really be off the hook at tax time?\nAs long as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d \u2014 which requires most people to have health coverage or face a tax penalty \u2014 is the law of the land, you should pay the fine for not having coverage in 2016 unless you qualify for an exemption, said Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Straw also manages a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance site, part of an Internal Revenue Service program that provides free tax filing services for low and middle income taxpayers.\nStraw said she has heard that some tax preparers are advising taxpayers either not to pay the penalty or to delay filing because they anticipate changes in the law.\nThe confusion stems from uncertainty over Republican officials\u2019 comments that they may do away with the individual mandate when they overhaul the health law. In addition, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January that required federal agencies to waive or exempt health law-related provisions that would impose costs or penalties on individuals, to the extent permitted by law.\nOne strategy that has been discussed has been to broaden the hardship exemption so more people would qualify for it, which the secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to do.\nSome experts say changing the rules now could create even more confusion, since some people have already filed their returns. Those taxpayers might have to file amended returns, an extra expense if they use a tax preparer.\n\u201cSince the 2016 tax season is already underway, I would think it unlikely that the Treasury Department would say, \u2018Don\u2019t bother paying the penalty,\u2019\u201d said Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, an information services company.\nQ.

{"idx": "27181", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: From the moment Robert Ballagh opens the door to his studio, there\u2019s no mistaking who works there. The front room of the small house in Dublin\u2019s north inner city is cluttered with artefacts from the artist\u2019s life and work. There are reproductions of Ballagh\u2019s playfully perceptive self-portraits and print versions of his distinctive takes on Delacroix and G\u00e9ricault, a framed copy of the 1916 Proclamation and a North Vietnamese Army pith helmet. The studio space itself is similarly imbued with his personality, a portrait of Samuel Beckett standing beside a slightly chaotic spread of art materials.\nArt and literature, history and politics, painterly detail and worldly practicality: all these are trademarks of Ballagh\u2019s life as one of Ireland\u2019s most distinctive and popular artists. It\u2019s a life recalled with brio in A Reluctant Memoir, his newly published autobiography. But, as he discusses his career amidst personal surroundings, there is one poignant absence. Since his wife Betty died unexpectedly in 2011, Ballagh has been missing the woman who not only shared his life but also was his artistic compass.\nAn affably confident conversationalist, Ballagh is wistful as he remembers Betty. Unsurprisingly, her presence runs throughout his autobiography, even though \u201cshe would see a memoir as a totally self-indulgent thing\u201d, hence the reluctance in the title. In fact, there is little solipsism in the book. It is a picaresque personal history, as well as a fascinating insight into Ballagh\u2019s creative process. It\u2019s also a wicked critique of an Irish art scene that has often looked down its nose at Ballagh, despite singular visual works such as his outraged pop art rendition of Goya and his imaginative portrait of politician No\u00ebl Browne. Last but not least, it\u2019s an excoriating broadside on the inequities in Irish society.\nBallagh, who turns 75 next week, opens the book with his bereavement, but even this is refracted through his social conscience. He recounts how Betty died from a heart attack in a Dublin hospital while awaiting a operation on a debilitating bowel condition. He subsequently sued the HSE and two consultants for negligence.\nThe book isn\u2019t all so stark, however. In entertainingly vernacular style, Ballagh retraces his circuitous path to becoming an artist, starting with his childhood in 1950s Dublin. An only child, he grew up in Ballsbridge, happily hanging out with friends from different social and religious backgrounds.\nAs it happens, Ballagh\u2019s parents came from different backgrounds. His father Bobbie was a Presbyterian, while his mother Nancy was a devout Catholic. Though Bobbie converted to Catholicism \u2013 \u201csimply to keep my mother happy, I think\u201d \u2013 Ballagh traces his own dissenting instincts to his father\u2019s \u201cquiet contrarian\u201d influence.\nAs he went through school at Blackrock College and studied architecture at Bolton Street, music superseded any other artistic inclinations. Playing bass in a showband named The Chessmen, he became a full-time musician after dropping out of Bolton Street. Some of the book\u2019s most enjoyable chapters cover life as a musician playing the dancehalls of Ireland and Britain in the 1960s. Eventually, however, Ballagh tired of touring and quit.\nFor two months in 1967, he worked with Farrell on his large mur"}

All they had access to was what users had chosen to put on Facebook: their friends, messages, comments and photos. In which case, surely one possible defence against such attacks could be to do what many people are already doing for their own reasons: not to delete Facebook but to withdraw from it, to never give it your real self. Or, better yet, to give it an elaborate fictional self.\nThat would certainly follow the logic of Facebook\u2019s claims about itself. When Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, testified before the US Congress earlier this year, he said Facebook users were in control of their data and could edit or delete it at any time. This is true: over the last decade Facebook has vastly improved its privacy controls and users have power over who advertises to them through its platform. So just don\u2019t upload anything you wouldn\u2019t want Russian spies to know.\nBut that wouldn\u2019t quite be enough, because Mr Zuckerberg was very careful in what he told Congress. He only said \u201cyou control and own the data that you put on Facebook\u201d; he didn\u2019t mention the data others put on Facebook in your name. A recent study found advertisers could target you on Facebook using phone numbers and email addresses you never gave it and cannot ask it to delete. These are harvested from your friends and acquaintances who did agree to share their address books. Behind the scenes, Facebook can connect those details with your profile using what it already knows.\nFine: just make sure you never sign up to any social network with an email address any other human knows. Except that this, again, might not be enough. Facebook may be able to connect different datasets together using other tools: your name, your particular place in a network of friends, or your pattern of activity. You can be identified through a unique code your mobile phone operating system generates, and your phone has a unique ID too. Nor are social networks the only bodies collecting data on you. Data brokers buy up information from public registries, supermarket reward schemes and even invisible \u201ctracking pixels\u201d which tell marketers whether and where you have opened an email. Then they aggregate it into detailed profiles and sell it on to others. That\u2019s if everyone follows the rules.\nThe measures you would need to take in order to gain \u201ccomplete control\u201d of all this data might not be that hard, on their own. But you would have to be uncompromising. No checking your map on your phone because you\u2019re late for a dinner party, since this would involve switching on \u201clocation services\u201d. No discounts for being a member of something online. Certainly no social media apps on your phone.\nDoing all of this would entail wilfully opting out of all the benefits of data driven services, which not only make ordinary tasks easier but allow whole new tasks that were not previously possible.\nMost people aren\u2019t willing to make that compromise \u2013 I\u2019m certainly not. It might not even be worth it: you already walk down the street despite the risk of mugging, so why not use social media despite the risk of comprehensive identity theft?\nThe problem is, if you are worried, then you will not find a solution in data abstinence. As long as collecting and aggregating large amounts of data in one place remains a viable business model, there will"}

The agreement, signed in September 2017, stipulated that the new software would go live by no later than Oct. 31, the suit states.\nBut after that deadline passed, Tritech informed the county it could not deliver the software until December 2019, 14 months after the original deadline, the lawsuit states.\n\"Tritech\u2019 s upper level management acknowledged that the timeline they agreed to was 'misguided' at the outset and stated that they 'should have clarified that right up front \u2013 we didn\u2019t, that\u2019s on us,'\" the suit states. \"Tritech\u2019s inexcusable delay has and will put the lives of Berkeley County\u2019s citizens and emergency services personnel at unnecessary risk and danger.\"\nThe county contends that its existing software was \"quickly becoming outdated\" by mid-2016 and that in July 2017, the county and Tritech started discussing the company's Inform Public Safety Software suite as a solution to provide needed advancements in the efficiency and safety of the county's emergency services.\nThe suit states the county has, as of the filing date, paid a total of $1,012,318.02 for a product the company has not delivered.\nDocuments state the Oct. 31 deadline was first postponed to December, then to Feb. 12. The suit alleges that the company knew it would not be able to go live by Feb. 12, but concealed this from the county.\nIt also accuses the company of \"several fraudulent attempts\" to \"wrongly charge the county,\" including a charge for staff travel expenses when \"the Tritech staff never traveled to Berkeley County.\"\nThe suit also claims Tritech had its headquarters in California but closed them and laid off hundreds of workers as a result of a 2018 merger and that CentralSquare Technologies is the successor to Tritech. The suit alleges the merger and layoffs contributed to the company's delay in providing the software.\nThe county is seeking actual, consequential and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and pre-judgment interest."}

Who'd have thought Paul Scholes would offer the best analysis of their problems?\nPaul Scholes was the footballer\u2019s footballer, eulogised by greats like Zidane, Xavi and Ronaldinho. He\u2019d spray around laser-guided passes, make a few late tackles, maybe grab a goal, and then go home to the wife and kids. No nonsense with him.\nHe\u2019s made a conscious decision to avoid the spotlight during his playing career, which made his appearance as a Sky Sports pundit last night all the more surprising. He\u2019d only said about five sentences on TV before, but he summed up Arsenal\u2019s issues with startling precision.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they say: \u2018you four, five midfielders, go out there, do what you want. Try and score a goal, a few little nice one-twos, a bit of tippy-tappy football. Don\u2019t bother running back\u2019\u201d.\nOuch. It\u2019s hard to disagree with any of that. After promising so much, it looks this league campaign will end with another scrap for fourth.Wenger\u2019s title-winning sides played stunning football, but with players like Tony Adams, Patrick Vieira, Gilberto Silva and Sol Campbell, they couldn\u2019t be overpowered or outfought either.\nIn big games, we completely fail to adapt to the opposition\u2019s strengths, arrogantly assuming that our technical quality is enough to get a win. Anyone can see that Liverpool press high and attack with lightning pace, yet Arsenal went to Anfield with no idea how to deal with them. The 5-1 loss there could have been even worse. Arsene Wenger said that last week\u2019s game at Chelsea was the biggest of the season in the build-up, and we still played with astonishing naivety. To no one&apos;s surprise, we got another thrashing.\nIn away matches against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea this year, Arsenal have conceded seventeen (!) goals. It\u2019s just not good enough. Even Man United under Moyes have done better, conceding eight in the corresponding fixtures.\nThe most frustrating thing is that Arsene has shown that he can make changes. In the 2006-07 season, with a squad ravaged by injury, he switched from 4-4-2 to a counter-attacking 4-5-1. Arsenal came within minutes of winning the Champions League with those pragmatic tactics, beating Real Madrid and Juventus along the way.\nWilshere is clearly an immense talent, but he\u2019s had a poor season. He has yet to secure a fixed position in the team, his decision-making is still erratic and he has a tendency to over-elaborate. He does get a lot of knocks, but watch him closely; he constantly delays the pass too long and invites those damaging challenges. Scholes\u2019 assessment of his current level is spot-on.\nI\u2019m just not convinced his stunted development is down to the lack of a Vieira-like figure alongside him. Aaron Ramsey has grown into a superb midfielder in exactly the same environment. Cesc Fabregas became one of the world\u2019s best midfielders at Arsenal, despite having to carry the team almost singlehandedly.\nAfter drawing with Swansea, it looks like Arsenal fans will have to wait at least another year to win the league, Arsene Wenger would do well to take on board some of Scholes&apos; criticism."}

She decided to find out. One day at school she posed the question to her fifth grade students: \"How many of you have ever been fishing?\" Only five hands went up among her 25 students. Frey was stunned. \"That's when I decided my curriculum needed an adjustment,\" said Frey, who has taught phys ed at East Side for 21 years. And what an adjustment she has made. It started with basic instruction and an end-of-the-school-year field trip to a private pond where students got to catch fish. A parent donated rods and reels for the trip. This year, the concept blossomed into a full fledged fishing curriculum for fifth and sixth graders, thanks to a $3,500 grant from the Future Fisherman's Foundation (FFF). Frey heard about the grant through the Parks department officials who helped her facilitate the application. She attended a workshop with 94 other teachers in Traverse City this summer and came away brimming with ideas. \"We learned how to use various types of equipment, how to tie flies, aquatic education and how to teach it,\" she said. \"It was a fabulous experience and I now network with other teachers who have discovered what I have: Kids love fishing. They just need to be introduced to it.\" FFF unites the sportfishing industry with educators and conservation groups, providing grants to those who invest time and effort into introducing the sport to young persons. \"It's sad that so few kids are exposed to fishing these days,\" Frey said. \"It's also shocking that those who have fished learned from their grandparents, not their parents. We've lost an entire generation. It's no wonder that fishing license sales are down.\" She said elementary students spend little time in the outdoors and know little about nature. \"They're playing with computer games and don't get out to explore,\" she explained. \"They don't collect bugs, walk creeks, experience natural smells that my generation grew up doing. The (FFF) grant allows us to rejuvenate that.\" This fall, her phys ed class spent a portion of its 40-minute periods developing fishing and casting skills and learning about fish identification, habitat, conservation and safety. \"We put an aquarium at the entrance and the kids were fascinated with it,\" she explained. \"Les Kring (Elkhart County river biologist) got us fish from the St. Joseph River, and the kids swarmed that aquarium for six weeks.\" On the third week of the four-week program, students were taken to Herb's Pond in Union, Mich., where they caught a variety of species. Her class also made a field trip to Oxbow Elementary School where students helped her teach fishing to Oxbow's kids. \"Our kids got to become teachers and they loved that experience,\" Frey offered. And now she hopes to take her class on a two-hour fishing trip on the River Queen, a 65-foot, double decker cruise boat anchored on the St. Joseph River above the Elkhart dam. Though the plans were still in the making late this week, she hoped to take two classes Tuesday and two more on Wednesday.

What Would the Bambino Think?\nFor nearly a century, the Yankees\u2019 uniforms have remained distinctly uniform: white with navy blue pinstripes at home, traveling grays with navy trim on the road. They are the only major league franchise that has never placed names on the back of their jerseys at home or on the road.\nWhile the Houston Astros may have sported tequila sunrise uniforms, the Pittsburgh Pirates pillbox caps and the Chicago White Sox short pants, the Yankees have been impervious to the sport\u2019s fashion trends.\nFor the Yankees, it is a point of pride that Babe Ruth did not dress much different from Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly or Derek Jeter.\nBut later this month, the Yankees will play a home series against the Seattle Mariners looking like something else altogether. As part of a Major League Baseball-wide \u201cPlayers Weekend,\u201d from Aug. 25 to 27, the Yankees will wear an alternate uniform with a script \u201cYankees\u201d across the front, gray caps and \u2014 take a deep breath here \u2014 the players\u2019 nicknames on the back of their jerseys.\nClint Frazier will be wearing a jersey with \u201cRed Thunder\u201d on the back.

And Todd Frazier, the proud Jersey guy, will wear \u201cThe Toddfather\u201d on his back. It will also be the first time the Yankees \u2014 the only franchise to never have veered away from buttoned jerseys \u2014 will wear pullover tops.\nIn addition to the uniforms, players will be allowed to wear individually designed spikes, batting gloves, wristbands, compression sleeves, catcher\u2019s masks and bats. And each uniform will have a blank patch on the right sleeve for players to write the name of a person or organization that was instrumental in his development.\nIn the past, the Yankees have worn throwback uniforms and tweaked their look to conform with whatever Major League Baseball might have designed for a holiday commemoration. But it is unlikely that the Yankees, who carefully police the length of their players\u2019 hair and do not allow beards, would have gone along with something like Players Weekend if they had not been obligated to do so.\nIn this instance the team has no choice but to be part of an initiative driven by the players\u2019 union and Majestic Athletic, the M.L.B.-apparel licensee, which is selling the replica uniforms for $200.\nThe World Baseball Classic in March drew raves for the flair and passion that many countries besides the United States displayed \u2014 be it an audacious bat flip by Wladimir Balentien of the Netherlands, the dyed blond hair of the Puerto Rican players or the raucous Dominican Republic fans (and reliever Fernando Rodney\u2019s good-luck golden plantain).\nSabathia, who often wears an Oakland Raiders cap or jersey to the ballpark and organizes trips to N.B.A. games with his teammates, says he is keenly aware of the criticisms of his sport, particularly compared with how well the N.B.A., via social media and other platforms, has connected with young fans.\n\u201cThis is the first step in"}

Although life remains tough for the young rural family, they somehow manage to get by. Things aren\u2019t exactly as they should be, but in a way the family trudges on for some time.\nNonetheless, as time progresses, things really come to a head. Mealie-meal, which defines the basic food in the home and sustains the younger ones as porridge and sadza for the old slowly, but surely, begins to run out in the home. The unpleasant state of affairs heightens with each passing day until the supplies can hardly suffice; the home literally runs dry.\nThe younger ones wail day-in, day-out and clearly the family has a tragedy of humongous proportions on its hands. Neighbours also see the crisis, but they all stand aloof. The worst part, however, in the entire fiasco is that the man of the house remains tight-lipped in the face of the crisis, even continuing to draw from the few remaining resources at home to go on his endless hunting excursions.\nThe children have no clue what\u2019s happening. In their limited understanding they think the mealie-meal troubles will soon be addressed, but the problem seems to have reinvented itself with vengeance this time around. With all the focus on him, the man of the house remains unfazed, oblivious to the scorching calamity in his house.\nIn essence, he astoundingly sets out to host a massive party for the village and extended family, where tonnes of mealie meal are set to be squandered in a day.

ThePost\u2019s views appear to have been formed by uncritically accepting all of the propaganda offered up by the right-wing opposition press in Venezuela.\nIt should be beneath the Post to denigrate the recently elected Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as an \u201ceconomically illiterate former bus driver.\u201d Despite his lack of training in economics, Maduro is right that Venezuela is facing what amounts to internal economic warfare, with business hoarding, currency fraud, and contraband trading. The economic policies of Maduro, and those of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, have certainly been experimental, even trial and error, but these policies have also reduced poverty by half and expanded access to the social goods long denied to millions of ordinary Venezuelans. These are real gains in terms of human development that are all too easily dismissed by the Post.\nThe Post might have mentioned that some of the \u201ceconomic pragmatists\u201d it champions are precisely those whose ideologically driven bad advice sent the global economy in its recent free fall. Deregulation of the financial sector was an epical disaster, in the United States, in Latin America, and around the world, yet orthodox economic advisors continue to call for free market solutions to any and all economic problems. This is really bad advice, and people around Latin America realize it: three-quarters of the region is governed by left-wing governments, which appropriately see a larger role for the state in guiding their economic fortunes.\nThe Maduro administration faces serious economic challenges, and it is moving to address them. The present tiered currency exchange system is still conducive to a black market in U.S. dollars and the Venezuelan government is keenly aware that this system is in need of further reform. Venezuelan authorities are presently waging a stepped up battle against the flow of contraband. There also appears to be a consensus, on the left and on the right, that there is a need to diversify the productive base of the country and continue to step up agricultural production. The Post editorial has not taken into account Venezuela\u2019s great debate over the scope and form of such reforms that has been recently taking place within the Bolivarian project; this debate includes the question of whether to introduce a number of market oriented measures, to stay the course towards more social control over the economy, or to implement a combination of these approaches.\nThe Post describes the \u201cexit now\u201d strategy of the ultra-right as having called for \u201cpeaceful street demonstrations under the slogan \u2018the way out.\u2019\u201d This view is inaccurate. The hard-line right\u2019s strategy has involved repeated violent attacks on state institutions, public transportation, and the symbols of Bolivarian social investment. So while there were peaceful opposition demonstrations, the ultra-right wing elements were not peaceful, not at the barricades they built, not when they shot at police and passersby, and not when they fired home-made mortars and tossed incendiary bombs. These actions are not mentioned by the Posteditorial, perhaps because they do not play into the opposition\u2019s preferred narrative. The Post refers to the 40 persons killed as though they were all victims of government security forces. The best available evidence, however, indicates that as many as five of the deaths were due to the actions of government forces; the Post fails to mention those killed and injured by the extremist elements of the opposition.

If they want one of the top quarterbacks, they'll likely have to move up. The Browns (No. 1) and Giants (No. 2) aren't likely to trade their picks. But the 49ers (No. 3) could.\nNFL general managers regularly refer to a pick chart when determining the fairness of draft trades. The charts assign a point value to each pick, with higher picks being worth more points.\nIf Team X wants Team Y's pick, they'll combine a grouping of their own picks to reach a point value that gets close to the value of the desired pick. Each team's chart varies slightly, which is why charts are exchanged when negotiating a trade.\nHere's a look at the NFL Draft's trade chart, as compiled by ProFootballTalk.\nUsing the above chart as an example: The No. 3 pick holds a point value of 2,200. The Jets' No. 10 pick has a value of 1,300. So the Jets would need to make up the difference.\nIf the Jets combined their first-round pick (1,300), one of their second-round picks (480), and a fourth-round pick (82), they'd get to 1,862 points. That's still a 338-point difference. The Jets would have to include a future draft pick to close the gap -- potentially a second- or third rounder.\nTeams will use the same chart to determine the value of future picks. They'll estimate where said team will be selecting, then go from there. Example: A future Patriots' first-round pick is valued differently than that of the Browns.\nHere where things get tricky, though: The Jets may not be the only team competing for that draft pick.\nJets defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson wasn't in the mood to talk about his leadership ability.\nThe Broncos (4th overall), Cardinals (11th overall), Chargers (14th overall), Bills (17th overall) and Jaguars (25th overall) could all be in the market for a quarterback. They too could want to move up. The Jets may offer a fair trade ... but it won't matter if another team offers more.\nTeams, occasionally, will bid against each other, and have to give up more for the pick than it's worth. The Jets may have to overpay if they want to ensure they get their guy.\nAnd it's gotten to the point where they may have to.\n"}

The blue version was on display at the show and features a print of cars, trucks and buses all over it while the pink version has different-shaped hearts.\nWe also spotted two Tobot versions, which looked really cool and clearly show how the Kizon could be transformed in the future to perhaps offer various cartoon characters or something.\nThe blue and pink Kizon smartwatches feature a plastic body along with a rubber strap and although they are quite bulky, we liked them and can see how the primary school little'uns they are designed for would appreciate them too.\nIt looks like a toy but looks can be deceiving and this kiddy gadget does a lot more than originally meets the eye. The strap is closed with an almost popper like fastening and we were surprised as how secure it when we closed it, which is good as you wouldn't want it getting lost in the playground.\nThe face of the \"watch\" features a speaker and just a single button with a phone symbol on it. There is also a built-in mic within the device and a 3G connection, which if you haven't already guessed, means the Kizon allows calls.\nA micro-SIM slot sits on the left hand side of the device and the Kizon smartwatch has a feature called One Step Direct Call on board that allows the parent to call and speak to the child at any point in the day, and vice versa. The child can call just a single number using the button but this number can be changed in the accompanying app so if you need to change it to the babysitter for example, you can.\nThere is a small LG logo situated on the rubber strap but other than that, you wouldn't know the Kizon smartwatch was an LG device, which is actually probably a good thing as it could help prevent it being stolen or anything like that if it is just perceived as a toy.\nOn the right hand side there is the charging port and under the hood, the LG Kizon has a 400mAh battery, which is claimed to last 36 hours. Of course, we couldn't try this out, nor the calling functionality but we like the idea of this device. When the battery gets as low as 25 per cent, it will send an alert to the parents and alerts can also be set up throughout the day to let you know where your child is at certain times using the built-in GPS.\nThe LG Kizon smartwatch also comes Wi-Fi so real-time location information can also be delivered to parents, which if nothing else, is great for peace of mind.\nIt might not be the first device designed to help keep track of your kids, but we liked the LG Kizon's design and the fact that it allows for making and receiving calls, as well as location tracking is great."}

A major Walton gift to the University years ago (all details of which the UA wouldn't reveal at the time) led to creation of a division of Education Reform that has become deeply enmeshed in the politics of education in Arkansas.

The raspberries provide most of the sweetness, keeping the sugar content low. The calories, fat and cholesterol levels are low with relatively high amounts of nutrients per serving.\nA raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie includes frozen raspberries, plain, low-fat yogurt, sugar and frozen pineapple juice. Frozen pineapple juice is used in place of water to give the smoothie a fruitier taste. Alternatively, replace it with ice cubes while sacrificing flavor and nutrients. One serving of a raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie is about 8.5 ounces -- weight is more accurate than volume measurement, as different blenders whip varied levels of froth into the smoothie.\nOn average, a healthy adult needs about 2,000 calories per day, according to MayoClinic.com. Each 8.5-ounce serving of a raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie contains about 8 percent of that at 167 calories. Of those calories, 16 are from the 2 grams of fat in the smoothie, less than a gram of which is saturated. The smoothie also contains 62 milligrams of sodium and 4 milligrams of cholesterol. The majority of the sodium, calories, fat and cholesterol are from the yogurt. MayoClinic.com recommends 44 grams of fat and no more than 16 grams of saturated fat, 300 milligrams of cholesterol and 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily.\nEach serving of a raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie provides you with 6 grams of protein and 33 grams of carbohydrates. Protein keeps your muscles healthy while carbohydrates supply your entire body with energy. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 56 grams of protein daily and that women get 46 grams. Average healthy adults need around 225 grams of carbohydrates daily. The protein is mostly from the yogurt while the carbs are from the juice and raspberries. The true bonus of this smoothie is its fiber content -- a whopping 6 grams -- mostly from the raspberries. MayoClinic.com recommends that men consume 28 to 34 grams of dietary fiber daily and women 22 to 28. Dietary fiber prolongs the sensation of fullness by being slow to digest and keeps your digestive system working healthily.\nEach raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie contains 188 milligrams of calcium, which keeps your bones strong, and 31 milligrams of vitamin C, an essential element to a healthy immune system. Yogurt in the smoothie provides the calcium and raspberries the vitamin C.

His own life, however. certainly had enough conflict in it to justify a dark outlook, what with being a Catholic in Protestant England, and at one time seemingly involved in a treasonous action in Italy, for which he had to beg the Queen's forgiveness.\nO'Dette was quick to point out that Dowland was in fact possessed of considerable wit and comparatively high spirits, as exemplified in the many jiggs, toyes, galliards, puffes and jumps that leavened the program, which was devised to celebrate Dowland's 450th birthday in 2013.\nBut serious things were first, with the contrapuntally complex and (for the performer) challenging \"A Fancy,\" the fifth of Dowland's works with that title. It set out at once the distinctive elements of Dowland's style.\nIt also demonstrated O'Dette's mastery of Dowland's full-bodied writing, in which the suggestion of multi-stranded counterpoint is created by a compositional sleight of hand, a magician's secret that O'Dette revealed in his remarks.\nO'Dette's impeccable technique and thorough understanding of the music made vibrantly direct the connection between composer and listener. Dowland's wit was on full display in the upbeat trio of \"A Coye Toye,\" \"Mrs. Vaux's Jigge\" and \"Mistris Winters Jump,\" which made one wonder about the ladies commemorated in these short dances.\nAnother famous woman to receive a musical tribute from Dowland was portrayed in \"The most sacred Queene Elizabeth, her Galliard,\" a piece of surprising sauciness, which O'Dette played with panache and wit.\nBut it was from the darker, melancholic pieces that both Dowland and his interpreter mined the most sublime musical ore.\nThe long-lost \"La Mia Barbara,\" a manuscript discovered in Germany in the 1970s, demonstrated the extent of Dowland's compositional innovation, with its unexpected turns and melodic shapes that pushed the limits of the musical gestures and compositional rhetoric of his day.\nLikewise, \"Farewell\" found Dowland moving into chromatic realms that might be seen as avant-garde for their time.

Producer Elisabeth Holm says it's more about a 20-something woman figuring out her professional and personal life than about an abortion. Here are some examples of TV shows and films over the years in which a character has an abortion.\n\"Maude\" (starring Bea Arthur) devoted two episodes to the grandmother's unexpected pregnancy -- and her decision to have a legal abortion in New York. The episodes aired on November 1972 to enormous protest, just a year before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.\nThe 1987 summer romance \"Dirty Dancing\" was set in 1963, and while Frances \"Baby\" Houseman (played Jennifer Grey) was one of the leading roles alongside Johnny Castle (the late Patrick Swayze), there was another baby involved. While at a resort with her family, Baby helps pay for an illegal abortion for dancer Penny (Cynthia Rhodes), which ultimately leaves Penny debilitated. It forces Baby to step in as Johnny's new dance partner for an upcoming competition.\nWhen high schooler Becky Sproles (played by Madison Burge) becomes pregnant after a chance encounter with football player Luke Cafferty, Becky seeks guidance from Dillon High School guidance counselor-turned-principal Tami Taylor (played by Connie Britton). After careful consideration, Becky decides to have an abortion, with her mom by her side.\nIn the 2008 drama \"Revolutionary Road,\" Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play Frank and April Wheeler, a couple in the 1940s who become sick of their suburban lifestyle and set their eyes on Paris. After April gets pregnant and Frank is offered a promotion, the two put those plans on hold. April, still unhappy, ultimately decides to perform her own abortion, and dies after the botched procedure.\nAfter an earlier miscarriage, Cristina Yang (played by Sandra Oh) in the hit series \"Grey's Anatomy\" decides to have an abortion in order to keep up her workaholic tendencies. The show's creator and show runner Shonda Rhimes later told New York Magazine that she had wanted to include the plot line in the first season, but had \"some very strong conversations with Broadcast Standard and Practices back then about the topic.\"\nIn \"The Cider House Rules,\" a 1999 screen adaptation of John Irving's 1985 book of the same name, Homer Wells (played by Tobey Maguire) stars as a young orphan who becomes an apprentice abortionist, despite disapproving of the procedure. Charlize Theron stars as Candy Kendall, a young woman who comes with her boyfriend to the orphanage to seek an abortion, while Erykah Badu plays Rose Rose, a woman seeking an abortion after she's raped by her father.\nOn the NBC drama \"Parenthood,\" shy teen Drew (played by Miles Heizer) finds out girlfriend Amy (Skyler Day) is pregnant and supports her through her decision to have an abortion, even though he had told his sister that part of him wanted to stick out the pregnancy. At the end of the episode, Drew is seen crying in his mother's arms.\nThings got very real for viewers of the second"}

George Lucas' team attempted - and pulled off - incredible things that had never been tried before, delivering spectacle that was the first of its kind. Ever since that watershed moment in 1977, Hollywood has never been the same, and the audience expectations for what a blockbuster should look like were raised to astronomical heights.\nNearly four decades later, the galaxy far, far away is back on the big screen, and visual effects teams are still trying to push the boundaries of what's possible. It was heavily publicized in the lead up to Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens that director J.J. Abrams would be leaning on practical effects to bring the universe to life, blending the old school techniques with modern technology. If the movie was going to capture the magic of the original trilogy, successfully blending the two styles would be extremely important.\nScreen Rant recently talked to The Force Awakens special effects supervisor Chris Corbould and creature shop head Neal Scanlan about how they combined practical effects with CGI, if future Star Wars movies will use that same aesthetic, and the challenges of pulling off some of Star Wars 7's most memorable sequences.\nA lot was made about J.J. taking Star Wars back to its roots with practical effects and real locations, but obviously with a movie like this, CGI plays a large role as well. So how important was it for you guys to find the proper balance between practical and digital?\nCorbould: A lot of the time, there\u2019s a very huge demarcation, as far as once you\u2019re in space, that\u2019s obviously all digital. Where we strived to get the practical element is in the desert where we were doing explosions, Rey\u2019s speeder. But to be quite honest, there\u2019s a great marriage now between the departments, mine, Neal\u2019s and the digital people. For instance, Rey\u2019s speeder, we fabricated a bespoke shanty and mounted it with a 1,000 cc motorcycle engine, and there was a hidden driver within the body of her speeder. So we could drive through the desert at 60 or 70 miles per hour with Rey on the back of it. Then the digital guys took over and painted out all of our mechanics and then put in dust clouds and things like that. We strive to do as much as we can practically, wherever we can, as J.J. really wanted to do, but there\u2019s still a massive marriage between the three departments.\nScanlan: From a creature perspective, there was a time where we go back a few years now, before digital technology became so incredible, that I think animatronics and creatures had probably reached a point where we exhausted possibilities. But as soon as the digital revolution hit us, and this is where we are with ILM, it opened up a whole new world. So, as Chris was saying, the same thing with the speeder could be applied to the creatures. I think the mantra from J.J. was, if we can shoot it real, we must shoot it real. And I think what was interesting is, some time ago, if that meant real, it meant you had to do it all in camera. Now, you don\u2019t have to do it all in camera. What you can do is you can achieve as much as possible in camera. If you want to have a rod on something, if you want to see somebody\u2019s feet, or if you have a person on the outside as in the case of BB-8, it\u2019s not an issue anymore. Those things can"}

Trump intends for the parade route to begin at the White House and end at the Capitol. And while he seemed to back off the idea a bit in a Fox News interview on Saturday night (\"We'll see if we can do it at a reasonable cost,\" he said. \"If we can't, we won't do it.\"), it's obvious that the president very much wants to see America's military might march before him.\nHe was inspired by a parade he witnessed in France on Bastille Day last summer, which he called \"one of the greatest parades\" he had ever seen. That event involved military vehicles, a military aircraft flyover, and cavalry procession. \"It was a tremendous day, and to a large extent because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July Fourth in Washington,\" Trump said two months afterwards, during a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron. \"We're going to have to try to top it.\"\nThis exercise in parade one-upmanship would be exorbitantly expensive, at a time of massive national debt (now more than $20 trillion). Shipping tanks and military hardware to Washington could cost millions of dollars. Our last military parade took place in June 1991, when President George H.W. Bush held a military parade to mark U.S. victory in the Persian Gulf War. That parade cost $12 million \u2014 once adjusted for inflation, $21 million.\nMarc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, defended Trump's plan during an interview earlier this month, stating, \"I'm not sure that honoring our military is a waste of money,\" he said. \"This is not about a dictatorship. This is about the president wanting to honor the military.\"\nIt is indeed very important that we honor American servicemembers and appreciate the sacrifices they make for this country. As a military wife, I am always proud to see military men and women well represented at local and national events \u2014 such as the presidential inauguration, which my husband has marched in, or local Fourth of July, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day parades.\nBut honoring the military means more than dignified parades and pomp and circumstance. It also means making sure that military personnel are paid well, that they receive good benefits, and that their families are well cared for. It means caring for retired military personnel, and fighting the alarming rate of suicides, unemployment, and homelessness among veterans in our nation. It means honoring our commitments.\nIs there some value in holding these parades for the larger inspiration or edification of the American public, to remind them of the debt they owe to our military? Such displays can definitely inspire such feelings. But we already have many such events, albeit on a smaller scale. The massive amount of money required for a national event like Trump's parade seems neither advisable nor necessary. One cannot help but wonder if this parade is all about Trump, rather than all about the military and American public.\nFor the most part, major world powers do not stage regular parades of martial power and strength. The U.S. has only held large military parades following wartime victories. Few other countries parade their military regularly \u2014 such displays were more common during the Cold War among Communist countries, and were meant to inspire fear rather than healthy admiration or honor. Russia, China, and North Korea are the"}

Just a simple catalog of items to be completed, it's hard to imagine that there can be much technique to writing one and that improving yours can actually yield gains in productivity. But Gen Y blog Untemplater would beg to differ with those that see to-do list as self-explanatory and boring. In a recent post the blog laid out four ways to improve your to-do lists, supercharging your productivity with very little effort.\nDon't Write Everything Down. Wait, that's counter-intuitive -- why wouldn't you keep track of all of your tasks? Though I'm a firm believer in recording even tiny errands, I have one little exception: if you can finish a task in fewer than five minutes, without moving from where you are, don't write it down. Just do it. Taking the time to write out tiny tasks like \"email mom\" or \"print out tax papers\" can make your list miles long and increases the risk that no-brainer tasks will be prioritized behind high-profile jobs and eventually forgotten. Cut off accidental procrastination at the source and just get 'er done.\nOrganize Tasks by Creative Energy Required. Most creative types have at some point faced the grim experience of sitting down to write or design on a deadline, only to spend half an hour staring at a blank computer screen with drooling incomprehension. But there's always more than enough work to do. If you divide your to-do list into separate columns for creative and mindless tasks, it's easier to stay encouraged during low-inspiration work sessions. Plus, often when you've checked a few items off of the donkey-work side of the list, you'll find the thrill of productivity has replenished some of your creativity hitpoints.\nMark Tasks According To Where You Can Work On Them Help yourself take advantage of the 24 usable hours in every day by keeping separate lists or making special notations for tasks that must be done in the office, those that can be done at home, and oddball items you can check off anywhere. That way, next time you're feeling stressed out on the bus, you can check your to-do list and knock out a few emails, brainstorm your next freelance article, or address your grandma's birthday card.\nGive Yourself a Written Pat on the Back. Your to-do list can also serve as a source of positive reinforcement for work already accomplished. Spent some time doing a useful but unforeseen task? Create a \"Have Done\" section in your list's margin and scribble that sucker down. Even if you don't make a dent in your original list because you spend a day putting out fires, at the end of the day you won't wonder how your time slipped away. And while we're at it, consider adding occasional items like \"read for half an hour\" or \"eat a nice meal without multi-tasking\" to your list. Making your own mental well-being a top priority every once in a while isn't a weakness; it's what lets you keep churning out high-quality work week after week."}

Altuve finished with 9,634,464 online fan votes while Infante totaled 8,999,117.\nThe defending major league batting champion, Altuve extended his hit streak to 13 games Sunday and is hitting .301 with seven home runs, tying a career-high.\nAt the last announced count on the afternoon of June 29, Altuve had 7,282,934 votes \u2014 231,708 fewer than Infante. That gap was closed quickly as voting ended Thursday at 10:59 CT.\nThe good news was delivered to Altuve before it reached the public, while the team was still at Fenway Park.\nAltuve is just the seventh player in Astros history to earn a fan-elected start, and the first since Lance Berkman was named a National League starter at first base in 2008.\nThe voting for the first time this year was conducted exclusively online, with no paper ballots distributed at ballparks. Royals fans turned out in droves.\nThe Astros in turn pushed hard behind their star, with a t-shirt and web campaign around the hashtag \u201cYesWayJose.\u201d The team also offered voters a chance at winning a $1,000 shopping spree alongside Altuve at Academy Sports if fans voted the maximum 35 times allowable and posted proof they had done so to social media.\nAltuve, who also went to the Midsummer Classic in 2012 and 2014, joins Craig Biggio (1995-98) and Jeff Kent (2004) as Astros second baseman to earn the honor. The other Astros who became fan-elected starters were first basemen Lee May (1972), Jeff Bagwell (1997) and outfielder Cesar Cedeno (1973).\nOverall, the Astros have had a player elected to an All-Star game start 10 times, with Biggio going four times.\n\u201cI think it means a lot (to Altuve),\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe works hard, and it\u2019s unfortunately too many people don\u2019t get to watch it (behind the scenes).

Our beaches are empty because of massive red tide.\nAs a native Floridian, I know red tide has always been a factor to deal with on the west coast of Florida. However, I cannot remember it causing the deaths of sea turtles, manatees, sharks, large fish or dolphins.

The silhouette was updated a bit two years ago, with revamped bumpers, headlamps, and grille, along with new tinting for the tail lamps, but that didn\u2019t make it any less conservative. Inside, the Avalon plays it safe but appears and feels more contemporary; however, the materials aren\u2019t especially inviting, despite the recent addition of new wood and chrome trims.\nKeeping in mind that the 2010 Avalon clearly favors comfort above handling, this large car isn\u2019t at all disappointing to drive. Provided the roads are relatively straight, the front-wheel-drive Avalon has the goods, with the 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission providing strong yet smooth and quiet performance either from stoplights or for highway passing, with the transmission shifting almost undetectably. Handling surely isn\u2019t a strong point, but the Avalon is nothing like the comfort-oriented barges of yore\u2014the suspension soaks up nearly every kind of bump, yet the body stays in check if you pitch the Avalon into a sharper corner, showing plenty of poise. At 19 mpg city, 28 highway, the Avalon\u2019s fuel economy is quite good for a vehicle with this much space on offer.\nInterior space, along with comfort, is a tremendous strength for the 2010 Toyota Avalon. It\u2019s one of the roomiest sedans, with soft, highly adjustable front- and backseats that are contoured adequately for large adults. And with more width and legroom than most larger sedans, it can truly accommodate three adults in back. The trunk is not only huge but deep and easy to load into\u2014capable of holding several large suitcases.\nWith a full range of top safety features and excellent crash-test ratings, the 2010 Toyota Avalon is one of the best big-sedan choices for the safety conscious. Electronic stability control is standard, as are anti-lock brakes, front side airbags, side curtain bags, and a driver's knee bag. The Avalon gets five-star ratings from the federal government in frontal and side impact tests, plus top \"good\" results from the insurance-affiliated IIHS in frontal and side impact tests.

So What?\nLast week, Coresight Research reported that U.S. store closings in 2019 to date have exceeded store closings in all of 2018. That\u2019s major news\u2014the growth or shrinkage of square feet available to sell consumer products has always had a direct correlation to the trajectory of retail sales. That\u2019s always been a strong indicator of where the economy is going. The New York Times put the Coresight story on the front page of its business section.\nI don\u2019t care. The way that retail has changed in the last few years makes the number of square feet available to sell products less relevant than ever. While it\u2019s true that the shrinkage in the number of stores means stores will sell less stuff, it isn\u2019t necessarily a comment on the condition of the retail industry the way it used to be. In fact, retail sales have risen all through the demise of tens of thousands of retail stores in the last several years.\nStores have a different purpose now. Before the internet and mobile shopping, a store existed to hold stuff, and if you wanted to buy that stuff, you went to the store. But now that consumers can buy almost anything at any time or place, growth in store counts is an old metric that matters less.\nThe future of stores now depends on what you do with them. Aside from holding and selling products, stores now need to do more things: stimulate online sales, handle pickups and returns from online sales and even serve as warehouses or distribution points for products ordered online to facilitate fast delivery or pickup. They\u2019re also a billboard, reminding people in a community of a brand\u2019s existence and what\u2019s new at the brand as they go by so consumers will keep the brand top of mind when they shop online. So many brands now see greater activity online in areas around their stores\u2019 locations. In a process called \u201cshowrooming,\u201d consumers also use the store not just to purchase but to research the products they buy online.\nIn the future, stores need to be less about just what happens in their own four walls. Instead of asking consumers to come in to buy something, stores need to show their products at events, in hotel lobbies, even in private homes. Wherever consumers go and are in a spending mood is where products need to be offered for sale. Stores need to move outside their own environments and engage consumers where they are; they can\u2019t always insist on making consumers come to them. Retail now is more complicated and risky. It takes more skills and more capital, both human and financial, to succeed. Running stores isn\u2019t as much about real estate as it used to be.\nOne group that is heavily impacted by the store closings, of course, is landlords. The hard fact is that a square foot of retail space is worth less now than it was 36 months ago almost everywhere in America. It has taken landlords some time to adapt to this, and their reluctance to lower the lease price per square foot is a reason there are still so many gap-toothed retail spaces all over the country.\nAs they eventually begin to loosen up by lowering the price per square foot, the question arises: What other functions can a store serve? If the price per square foot is lower, should stores be taking additional space that they can use for programs, speakers, demonstrations, classes and other events? If they do that, won\u2019t that be a reason for consumers to come in and buy products, especially if the events are related to the products in the store? The possibilities are endless if"}

Kelly likely would have seen to it.\nBolton briefly fell back in line, but then may have had a hand in having Canada arrest Huawei\u2019s Meng, which Trump did not know about, but Kelly should have, so Kelly was out on his ear. At the very least, Bolton admitted he knew before the President did.\nBolton was accused of being behind a whisper campaign to ditch Mattis. Mattis is too tough and smart for that. However, Mattis\u2019 loyalties were confused, but military discipline predictable. Mattis was induced to fall on his own sword over the Syrian pullout.

And that was different for everyone, he said.\nSome would go straight to the local news section. Others not only started with sports, but specifically the box scores. Some might look at the national news or possibly the business section. Obituaries, letters to the editor, the comics, the weather forecast, the grocery store ads, even the horoscope might all be the most important part of the paper for different readers, he explained.\nThere was one thing he said you could never mess up. He cautiously warned it was an easy thing to screw up because it was a part of the newspaper that seemingly shows up automagically each day, probably done by crafty little Keebler elves with ink-stained hands when no one in the newsroom was looking.\nIt made me giggle, but I also suspected he was more right than wrong.\nFast forward to my first winter in Spokane. It was late January 2017. I learned quickly what qualified as plowing the roads after a big snow looked very different here than, say, every other cold-weather city in the nation. But that\u2019s a topic for another day.\nThe Spokesman-Review\u2019s features editor Carolyn Lamberson came over to my desk to tell me we were going to need to make a quick change to our daily crossword puzzle because the creator of the one we used had suddenly fallen ill and would no longer be producing one for newspapers.\nShe said we had a temporary replacement that would fit the same space as the old puzzle and that we could get feedback from our readers in the early spring on a more permanent replacement.\nIt definitely sounded both reasonable and practical to me.\nThe next day, I quickly learned our newsroom\u2019s voicemail system can hold 80 messages at a time. And all 80 of the messages on my desk phone were about one thing, with most callers using varying degrees of colorful language.\nThat brings up another important point: I\u2019m much more comfortable with the sheriff or the mayor or the CEO of a big local business calling me angrily first thing in the morning than I am one of our subscribers yelling at me to start my day \u2013 especially a reader who sounds like my grandma.\nI don\u2019t care who you are, no one wants to let their grandma down.\nNearly every message began by telling me how many years they had subscribed to our newspaper. The numbers were impressive on a whole bunch of levels. Then some might say they liked a few of the changes I\u2019d"}

Based on their insights and experience, IT I&O could be more responsive and more efficient.\nHaight notes that there is a growing \"movement\" addressing the need to make IT I&O more efficient. This movement goes by names like devops (which I wrote about a couple of weeks ago), agile operations, agile infrastructure, etc. This movement is in contrast to a dumbed-down approach to I&O, which seeks predictability by constraining options.\nI think Haight is absolutely right that the current approach to I&O is unsustainable. The highly-manual plethora of \"Bs\" (the Configuration Management Data Base, the Change Control Board, the Incident Tracking Board) acts as an obstacle to agility and innovation. And when you throw in scale (a hobbyhorse of mind that I ride in another blog post), what is merely inconvenient becomes untenable and unmanageable.\n\u2022 Many organizations do not hire skilled \"coal miners.\" That is to say, there are only so many smart, gifted, experienced I&O people to go around. Most organizations won't have the sharpest knives in the drawer. And the solutions the latter implement for administration are poorly designed, buggily implemented, and probably as poorly suited to scale as the manual alternatives. Standardized processes are usually implemented not to prevent brilliance, but to prevent the effects of stupidity. In effect, they replace high variability of outcomes with predictable mediocrity, which enables more sleep at night for senior management.\n\u2022 One person's skilled \"coal miner\" is another's undisciplined hacker. The elegantly architected system administration edifice developed by one smart person becomes an unmaintainable mess when inherited by another smart person. Everyone's had the experience of a really smart person leaving an organization and no one else being able to make heads nor tails of what he leaves behind. I recently had a conversation with a highly-talented engineer at a company and discussed with him the use of one of the commercial management frameworks for Amazon Web Services. He pooh-poohed the use of a framework with the comment \"I would just write one myself.\" Easier for him \u2014 more difficult for everyone else down the line.\n\u2022 It's inevitably idiosyncratic rather than standardized. Even when a number of people collaborate, the output, sans a standard approach, is a one-off, which makes bringing new team members up to speed difficult and imposes a high operational cost on the I&O operation.\nA better approach is to identify the emerging best practices from the devop movement and standardize on those. The fledgling products Chef and Puppet are steps in the right direction. Organizations trying to break free of the \"process\" box should look to products and practices that will be widely used across the industry, thereby avoiding the \"IH\" (invented here) syndrome, in which an organization charts its own course only to find"}

While \u201calternative facts\u201d, misconceptions, and misrepresentations of climate science are unfortunately widespread in public discussion, we are dismayed that this practice appeared on the editorial page of The New York Times.\nFact: The N. Hemisphere warmed substantially more than claimed by the writer. The globe warmed by about the amount Stephens claimed the Northern Hemisphere did when he referenced the 2013 IPCC report. The subsequent correction was inadequate, failing to note, for example, that Stephens understated the warming, and that the record warmth in each of the past three years magnifies this mistake.\nUsing the term \u201cmodest\u201d to describe this amount of warming is inaccurate and misleading. Science has found the warming to date to be large and rapid. Much as a fever of only several degrees can be deadly, it only requires a few degrees of warming to transition the planet out of ice ages or into hot house conditions. Importantly, the recent warming has been extremely rapid: more than 100 times as fast as the cooling that took place over the previous 5000 years. It\u2019s the rapidity that is most troubling. Human society is built on a presumption of stability, and the rapidness of the change is creating instability.\nNot surprisingly this warming has already led to impacts that are widespread and costly. The damage incurred in New York City during Super Storm Sandy was amplified by sea level rise that elevated and significantly extended the reach of the storm surge. Estimated costs for the additional damage were in the billions of dollars.\nStephens also mischaracterizes both the certainties and uncertainties regarding climate change, and misrepresents how science reports uncertainties. Contrary to the writer\u2019s false accusation that scientists claim total certainty regarding the rate of warming, IPCC reports present a range of estimates for global warming -- centering around 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) of warming since pre-industrial times.\nSome things we know for sure, for example that the Earth is warming and that humans are the dominant cause. Yet even the latter is expressed with care; the best estimate of the human influence is 110%, with a range of about 80% to 130%. In other words, natural factors alone would have caused the Earth to cool slightly, but human influences counteracted that and led instead to substantial warming.\nImportantly, the scientific treatment of uncertainty extends to climate projections, which give ranges of future warming under various emissions scenarios. However, Stephens suggests that risk management should only be guided by the possibility that warming and its impacts could be less than the best estimate, and not the possibility that it could be more. This cherry picking presents only one side of the range of uncertainties. But uncertainty cuts both ways, and reasonable risk management demands looking at both.\nWe respect the journalism at the Times and believe its reporters consistently do an excellent job of accurately covering climate change with depth and clarity. But that does not excuse disinformation"}

Plus, by rolling out different formats, Starbucks may help prevent store cannibalization, when one location takes clients from another nearby.\nAs part of the modernization, Starbucks is thinking about the full \"portfolio\" of stores in the neighborhoods it serves, CEO Kevin Johnson told CNN Business.\n\"Every store, every community, has its own personality,\" Johnson said. For example, in an area with 20 stores, Johnson said Starbucks is thinking critically about how many should have drive-thrus, how many should be designed for mobile ordering, and how many should be full cafes. The idea is to \"serve the multiple needs of that community.\"\nThat segmentation can also help the company fix its congestion problem, said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy.\nThe new stores will be designed with an eye for both speed and comfort. Some stores may be cashless, others may have areas with comfortable chairs where customers can settle in.\n\"I don't want anyone to walk away today thinking this is about furniture or a new renovation strategy,\" said Roz Brewer, the company's chief operating officer, in a statement. \"Reimagining the third place is about listening to our customers, so we can better position our business now and for the future.\"\nThe company began studying several of its key markets last summer, Brewer said during the meeting. Starbucks looked at stores in Texas, New Jersey and New York.\nTexas customers said they want to feel good in stores, according to Brewer. So \"we're making them brighter, we're making them fresher, we're making them cleaner.\" In New Jersey, Starbucks found that customers want different things throughout the day. So it streamlined the store for speed at checkout, but with a lounge area for people to use later in the day. In big cities such as New York, pickup stores make sense, in addition to separate cafes.\nConvenience is particularly important to today's customers, CEO Kevin Johnson told CNN Business. But Starbucks still wants its locations to be places where customers have relationships with their baristas, and feel comfortable hanging out.\nPart of making sure that Starbucks is an effective third place, Brewer said, is making sure that Starbucks employees are engaged and able to spend more time with customers. To that end, Starbucks is boosting its leadership programs and streamlining stores."}

(NASDAQ:OMEX), a pioneer in the field of deep-ocean exploration, reported results for the full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on current projects.\nOn March 21, 2018, the 11-judge panel of the Superior Court of the Federal Court of Administrative Justice in Mexico ruled unanimously in favor of Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cOdyssey\u201d) subsidiary, Exploraciones Oce\u00e1nicas, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\u201cExO\u201d), nullifying the denial of ExO\u2019s environmental permit application for the extraction of phosphate sand from its \u201cDon Diego\u201d project. Odyssey holds a 53.88% interest in ExO. To move to the next phase of development of the deposit, Odyssey and its subsidiaries need the approval of the environmental permit application, which is anticipated in due course as a result of this decision. However, until the judicial decision is published, any further details about the status or timing of the permit would be speculative. Odyssey will provide additional information regarding this matter once details appropriate for public disclosure become available to Odyssey.\nThe \u201cDon Diego\u201d project is expected to deliver significant economic and social benefits to Mexico in the form of job creation, lowered fertilizer pricing, increased crop yields, generation of tax revenues, and the funding of programs that will promote the protection and enhancement of the marine environment.\nPhosphate, which will be the product of the dredging project, is a key and irreplaceable component of fertilizers. The location of the \u201cDon Diego\u201d deposit makes it an attractive potential sourcing site for the Mexican fertilizer and agricultural industry. The deposit, which is centered more than 22 km offshore in the Pacific Ocean at an average of 80 meters deep is well within reach of standard dredging equipment.\nCurrently planned or operational shipwreck and mineral projects are typically conducted under leveraged contract models whereby Odyssey is paid to perform offshore services while retaining a significant back-end share of the future net proceeds from these projects. The combined potential cash flows from these projects are expected to fund operations for multiple years while simultaneously increasing the value of projects in which the company has an equity ownership position.\nOperations are currently underway on a contracted project that is expected to begin generating cash in 2018 to fund company operations and is forecast to produce cash returns for a minimum 12-18 months.\nPlanning continues for recovery of phosphate sands from the \u201cDon Diego\u201d project so that preliminary operations can commence soon after environmental approval is received. Odyssey is under contract to provide a variety of services related to this the project once approvals are in place. This contract has the potential to produce several million dollars in positive cashflows and enhance the value of Odyssey\u2019s investment in this project.\nSeveral other new subsea mineral projects that will require offshore exploration work and resource evaluation by Odyssey are currently under development. We anticipate receiving additional contracts during 2018 to provide services for these new projects, which are expected to produce cashflows and potentially equity stakes in these projects for Odyssey.\n\u201cOdyssey is making great progress already in 2018 on both the mineral and contracted shipwreck elements of our business, and we received notification from NASDAQ on March 8"}

There are several different types of somatitis and not all of them are well understood. Research has yet to find the actual cause of canker sores, for example, although there are many contributing factors, including stress, biting your cheek, irritation, chewing tobacco and gum disease, which could bring on a cankerk sore. In so many words, there are many contributing culprits, but no specific culprit to blame at this point.\nRegardless of what\u2019s causing your mouth pain, you probably want to do whatever you can to treat it. So, let\u2019s talk about some of the most common causes of mouth inflammation and what you can do about them.\nThere are a number of different kinds of stomatitis. One of the most common kinds is a canker sore. Canker sores are a form of ulcer that develops in the mouth, usually in the lips and gums. Canker sores are often painful, especially when touched.\nCold sores, another kind of stomatitis, are also common. Cold sores are caused by a virus called herpes simplex that can be passed orally by kissing or sharing drinks with someone who has the virus. More than half of Americans ages 14 to 49 carry the virus. Furthermore, when the cold sores retreat, they can reappear in the future, because the virus itself doesn\u2019t leave the body.\nCold sores usually develop as blisters around the lips or in the mouth. Usually, cold sores appear after an illness or frequently during periods of stress.\nVitamin deficiencies are also considered a potential trigger for cold sores, particular deficiencies of B-12. This vitamin deficiency can cause the tissue inside to swell, often painfully.\nSores in or around the mouth can make it difficult to eat or drink or even speak. Luckily, there are a number of things you can do to help.\nHow Can You Treat It?\nTreatment for this condition depends on what, specifically, is causing the issue. For canker sores, there a cure, but sometimes gargling with antibacterial mouthwash can help remove bacteria from the area, which can prevent infections and help speed healing. You could see a dentist who can use a form of laser treatment to resolve symptoms. This works very quickly. Although, in most cases of canker sores, they go away by themselves within a few days, allowing you to avoid an expensive trip to the dentists.\nYou can reduce the severity of the pain by avoiding foods or drinks that aggravate the sores such as foods heavy in citric acid or spicy foods. It is recommended that you avoid chewing gum or using chewing tobacco.\nMost cold sores also heal within a week, which means treatment is usually limited to using antibiotic ointment to help prevent infections.\nIn cases of stomatitis caused by autoimmune conditions, the treatment options are a bit wider. Most forms of treatment for autoimmune conditions rely on treating the inflammation of the tissue. And there are a number of different medications that doctors can prescribe to accomplish this.\nThe first is basic over-the-counter painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen. These belong to a class of drugs called NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They work to fight inflammation by blocking the body\u2019s production of an inflammation producing enzyme.\nIn addition, doctors often prescribe corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are a hormone that your body naturally produces in"}

Village bands have been a center of social gatherings in the Midwest since at least mid-18th century. They played everything from light classical music to waltzes and other dance tunes. It was John Phillip Sousa, \"The March King,\" who first put a uniquely American stamp on brass music, making the first commercially successful band recordings in 1890.\nSchool bands, playing during football games, have become a ubiquitous tradition throughout the United States, and many professional musicians got their start taking \"band\" for high school credit.

Of course, the lawmakers would have the bonanza of extending their terms indefinitely without undergoing an election.\nAfter initially remonstrating, Senate President Tito Sotto supported the cancellation. However, sensing the public mood, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque ended the debate, saying the President wants the midterm polls held as scheduled.\nBack to the legislative mill, even if the lawmakers could be shepherded to a quorum, the time challenge would still be forbidding. The 1987 Constitution requires revisions to be \u201cratified \u2026 in a plebiscite [to] be held not earlier than 60 days nor later than 90 days\u201d after their approval.\nHence, the new constitution should be approved by Congress no later than March 13, 2019, the 60th day prior to May 13, 2019. Given its All Saints Day recess of two weeks and its Christmas break of one month, the legislature would thus have only about six months to perform this vital constituent function.\nWhile the lengthy draft (longer than the present Charter) prepared by the consultative committee (ConCom) had been transmitted by the President to the legislature, Speaker Alvarez made it clear that the House (and probably the Senate, too) will carefully scrutinize it. After all, it is Congress, not the ConCom, which had been constitutionally tasked to undertake the revision.\nThe 1986 Constitutional Commission, working full-time daily, took about a year, including ratification, to complete the 1987 Constitution. The ConCom itself, also working full-time daily, took about six months, from January to July this year, to finish its draft. In contrast, Congress cannot work full-time daily. It needs to pass many vital measures like the budget, which normally takes four months.\nMoreover, the ConCom\u2019s draft differs substantially from that approved by the House committee on constitutional amendments. The ConCom patterned its output after the American system with a bicameral Congress that is independent from and is the coequal of the president. On the other hand, the House committee favored the presidential-parliamentary model that is more akin to the French system that has no vice president, but has a parliament that elects a prime minister who works in tandem with a nationally elected president.\n1) A confusing federal judicial system with four different high courts that are \u201csupreme\u201d in their own spheres: the \u201cFederal Supreme Court, Federal Constitutional Court, Federal Administrative Court and Federal Electoral Court,\u201d each one having a chief justice and several associate justices. This structure is more characteristic of the Russian system than the American one.\n3) While the power to impeach is lodged in the \u201cJoint Impeachment Committee of Congress,\u201d the power to try and remove officials is granted to the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Administrative Court.\nIn sum, six months would be utterly insufficient to resolve all these problems, given a Congress saddled with other vital work and with members campaigning for their political survival."}

The company reported the breach within 72 hours, as required by GDPR guidelines, but the event led security analysts to speculate about the \u2018gaping holes\u2019 that still exist in the security strategies of businesses more than three months on from the GDPR enforcement deadline.\nResearch carried out by Apricorn just ahead of the deadline found that more than two-thirds of UK companies were not confident they would be fully compliant by the cut-off date in May. Over 80 per cent cited at least one area they believed could cause them to fail to meet requirements \u2013 including a lack of encryption and gaps in employee training. In light of this, it\u2019s very likely that many organisations are still not operating completely within the GDPR guidelines.\nThere is nowhere to hide, even for those that manage to avoid a breach. Any company can be audited to check they are in compliance and, in the event that they are not and they don\u2019t take action to rectify any shortcomings, remedial fines could apply.\nEven for those that are fully compliant today, remaining so will require continued effort. This is something that respondents to the Apricorn survey recognised, with 98 per cent agreeing they will need to invest in policy, people and technology on an ongoing basis.\nSo three months on, what are the biggest areas of risk for UK companies? Respondents to the Apricorn survey were asked in which areas they were most concerned they would fall short, and their answers provide a good indication of where the greatest risks lie.\nFifty per cent of organisations admitted that a lack of understanding of the data they collect and process is their number one concern relating to non-compliance. Mapping and securing all personally identifiable information (PII) should be the number one priority.\nDocument exactly what data is collected and why, and how it is processed, stored, retrieved and deleted, so you can pinpoint what may be unprotected and at risk. Ensure you are collecting and keeping only the PII you require for legitimate business purposes, destroying anything that\u2019s no longer needed or has been kept beyond the retention policy date.\nThose companies which carried out a comprehensive information audit as part of their GDPR preparations cannot sit on their laurels. The work doesn\u2019t stop there. Data is an organic thing, with new information flowing into and generated by the business every day, so this mapping exercise has to be repeated on an ongoing basis.\nOnce the data is fully understood, the processes and policies around it need to be created, documented and enforced.

That approach may be tailor-made for D.C., where about half of the 48,000 K-12 public school students are enrolled in charters.\n\"In his work with students, educators, and families, Dr. Ferebee has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to improving student outcomes,\" Bowser wrote in a statement. \"He understands the complexities of leading a large urban school district in a growing city. He knows there's no one-size-fits-all solution to meeting the needs of our young people. And he has experience building partnerships that ensure more students have a path toward success.\"\nFerebee will succeed Antwan Wilson, who was forced out earlier this year amid a school transfer scandal. Wilson's family bypassed the city's school lottery system so his daughter could transfer into a highly coveted public high school. It marked a clear breach of a policy he helped draft to address the issue of high-ranking officials receiving special treatment in the school transfer process.\nWilson's interim replacement, Amanda Alexander, was the other finalist for the top job.\nThis is the second high-profile job that Ferebee pursued this year: he was a candidate to lead L.A. Unified schools in the spring, but eventually withdrew his candidacy.\nBefore taking the top job in Indianapolis, Ferebee worked at several districts in North Carolina, including the Durham schools, where he served as chief of staff.\nThe son of educators whose own career has been built by rising through district schools' leadership ranks in the South, he has a decidedly traditional educational pedigree. His dissertation at East Carolina University argued that public-school-choice provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act didn't improve student achievement. And on top of all that, he's the head of a struggling urban school system that many argue has been hurt even more by a fast-growing charter sector.\n\"There's this idea that you have to be on one side or the other--you can't wave both flags,\" Ferebee says of district and charter schools.\n\"The more we encourage people to wave both flags, the more effective we will be in educating our children.\""}

He described harassment, threats, vulgarity and public drunkenness.\n\"This panhandling has turned into more of a form of debauchery,\" he said. He said he understood the issue of panhandlers' rights, but that the scene outside his coffee shop was about partying, not mental illness and panhandling.\n\"We're all starting to worry,\" Mackillop said. He told the City Council that he had spoken to other business owners on the block.\n\"Every owner of those businesses has told me they're behind me,\" he said. \"This is a collective message.\"\nMackillop said that he had received threats on his life while asking people to move away from the doorstep. He added that he does not take the threats seriously, \"but you don\u2019t know which one might snap.\"\nOn Tuesday evening, Conner Lucas, who police said is homeless, allegedly cut the throat of another man at the intersection after a dispute spilled out from nearby City Hall Park. Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said Lucas, the man he allegedly stabbed and a third individual who sustained non-life-threatening injuries knew each other.\nAs of Thursday evening, the victim was in \"serious\" condition, said a representative from UVM Medical Center.\nCity Council President Jane Knodell said on Thursday that the City Council has not taken any action in the weeks since Mackillop's plea, but that it was an issue she believed needs more attention from the city government.\n\"Public safety is a core function of local government,\" she said.\nShe added that she agreed with many points that del Pozo made in an interview on Wednesday with the Burlington Free Press. Del Pozo had expressed frustration that \"quality of life\" offenses such as public drunkenness, fighting, public urination and \"smoking dope\" are decriminalized in Vermont.\nOfficers can write civil tickets, but del Pozo said the fines often go unpaid. While the chief said the civil system works well for many, some repeat offenders are unconcerned about the financial repercussions of not paying the fines. Even if they rack up several tickets and the police are unable to take them off the street.\n\"I agree with much of what he was saying in terms of creating consequences for repeat offenders,\" Knodell said. She added that she believed the city should explore whether to change the rules for repeat offenders and whether action can be taken on the local level or if it would have to come from the state.\nKnodell said the city should also be concerned about a lack of safety for the homeless population of the city.

In late March, a longtime member of the transient community, Richard Medina, was fatally stabbed in the middle of the afternoon at the corner of Church and Cherry streets.

Last month, he said, \u201cThe BBC has always shown a great ability to adapt to new challenges and make them opportunities,\u201d clearly a precursor to today\u2019s news.\nThe BBC will hope that the merger, which will be led by chief executive Tim Davie and chief creative officer Mark Linsey, will help it deliver more global hits and put together more partnerships such as the David Attenborough-fronted natural history documentary series, produced by BBC Studios\u2019 Natural History Unit and four-fifths funded by BBC Worldwide and international partners. It also will hope it can help it compete in the high-end drama space; BBC Studios is currently producing the BBC One and Amazon Prime co-production Good Omens, an adaptation of Terry Pratchett\u2019s novel by Neil Gaiman and starring David Tennant, and it will need BBCWW\u2019s funding expertise to piece together further deals.

There may be some features of your new laptops that will not work properly without a 64bit OS. Also on newer systems XP is actually SLOWER than win7.\nIf you do not like the layout of the OS there are plenty of ways to make win7 act and feel more like XP.\nThe only time I would suggest XP over 7 is if you already have XP pro, and need to replace Win7 Starter edition. But if you have to purchase an OS I would not buy a copy of XP today.\nHowever, as bad decisions cannot be stopped; When you install WinXP it will give you some HDD management options before installing. Remove both partitions on the system drive that were created by win7, make a new partition, and then reformat the drive before installing winXP.\nI would highly suggest making a restore CD/DVD before doing anything foolish.\nThere is no reason to go back to XP.\nWin 7 is faster, and much intuitive than XP ever was, and support for XP will be on the decline as time goes by. It is human nature to resist change, but it would be advisable to simply start getting used to the new look and feel. It is for the better in the long run. If the new laptop is that slow, you might try to find out why, but it is not because the laptop is running Win 7.\nWell, that is kinda what I mean. What type of disks do you have, upgrade or full version, of course if it is an upgrade version it won't work with Win7. You will have to fully format your drive and start all over, but then, if it is a full version, it still won't have the right drivers if your laptop has a sata drive, you will have to supply them to the setup program.\nThe setup program will give you the option to format and partition the drive before you start the install.\nYou will erase everything on the drive, just to be clear about that.\nAs the computer is a Compaq I would be much more suspicious of the hardware having problems than it being win7. I have a netbook (which is waaaaay worse than your new laptop) with win764bit and 1GB of ram, and it does not take 3min to load. It has to either be a setting, or a hardware issue.\nIf while installing XP you had deleted the partitions, made a new one, and then reformatted the new partition you would (or at least should) not have any installation issues. The 'at risk' error may be due to the BIOS if there is any BIOS level protection from changing the OS (but I thought that was only on Intel chipsets, not AMD), so check your BIOS settings and see if there is anything in there that may prohibit modifications to your system drive.\nHP support is a joke at best, and always has been. Remember all those people were told they were loosing their jobs just a month ago. I would bet that they are a little less than willing to give good customer service when they have a company that treats them like that. Also, they will not provide support for any software or hardware that did not come with their system (eg, you are on your own with XP).\nTry running Anvil Express or Personal APT on a Windows 7 computer in short they don't.

We sense we\u2019re at a turning point regarding the ongoing pain of systemic racial injustice, \u201cgotcha\u201d travel bans, ICE\u2019s new wave of aggressive immigration policing, or the stew of legal and ethical questions about gender and sexuality, just to cherry-pick a few issues off the top of my head. You can probably add a few more to my list.\nEach one of these issues affects me first as a follower of Jesus, and next as a citizen of the United States. But perhaps no other issue hits closer to home for me than the rising wave of anti-Semitism in this country and abroad. Between the bomb threats targeting Jewish organizations during the last month (including a new round today), the desecration in the last week two Jewish cemeteries in two different states, and the various accounts of vandalism of Jewish homes, synagogues and businesses (like this, earlier this month in Chicago), I am a little unsettled these days.\nI exist in a funny sort of no-man\u2019s land. I am Jewish, yet most within my own Jewish community would label me as a \u201cconvert\u201d and tell me I\u2019m no longer considered Jewish because I believe the Jewish Jesus is the Messiah. It has always been a point of amazement to me that a Jewish person can be an atheist or a Buddhist or a member of the mafia or whatever, and still be considered Jewish. Yet my faith makes me a bit of a pariah in my own community. I like to point out to people that if Adolph Hitler was here rounding people up, he and his minions would have no problem whatsoever putting me in line to go to the gas chambers (along with my husband, whose mom is Jewish, and my Jewish children and grandchildren). He would not be remotely interested in my confession of faith in Jesus. All that mattered to the Nazis would have been the fact that I have Jewish blood running through my veins. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of some disconcerting anti-Semitism in recent years \u2013 enough to know that while the Jewish community may stumble over the way in which I express my faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the people who hate Jews have no problem at all hating me, too. Because I\u2019m Jewish.\nI\u2019ve been watching how my grafted-in Gentile brothers and sisters in the Lord have been responding to these stories of anti-Semitism, both in real life and in the funhouse world of social media. I\u2019m heartened by the outrage of many friends over these stories and concern for me and my family. But I am also watching how some of the Christian microphone-holders are responding to this wave of anti-Semitism, and I\u2019m a little discouraged. Not surprised, but discouraged nonetheless.\nI know that for some Evangelical leaders, immigration and refugee issues are front-burner topics right now, as they should be. But it should go without saying that anti-Semitism is not disconnected from these things. I\u2019m saying it here, because \u201cshould\u201d is not what \u201cis\u201d right now. What is deeply concerning to me is the way too many Christian leaders have bought into either Trump-style nationalism as part of their worldview (the oft-cited stat that 81% of Evangelicals voted for Trump means that many influencers were cheering on this choice) OR they\u2019re already flat-out hostile toward Israel, thus, offering support to American"}

The IRS seeks $1.4 billion in back taxes, fees and penalties from Sam Wyly and $800 million from Dee Wyly.\nThe IRS claims that the Wylys set up a series of offshore trusts on the Isle of Man to hide income from being taxed but used the money in the trusts to fund their lavish lifestyle.

Well, essentially, the Islands of Plunder-sub-series is a part of expansions intended for the Skull & Shackles AP, providing sidetreks etc. on an island per island base \u2013 they can essentially be considered island-focused mini-adventures that work just as well within the context of a Freeport campaign, Razor Coast or Savage Tide \u2013 if it\u2019s remotely pirate/island-themed, these will work \u2013 and probably beyond that, but that I\u2019ll take a look at on a case by case basis. This Island of Plunder-module is intended to be run for level 4 characters during #2 of the Skull & Shackles AP.\nWhen the PCs board the Tamarind (fully mapped in gorgeous full color!), captain Batholomew Shaw immediately surrenders his weapons -alas, things are not as easy as they seem. While the captain sports minor enchantments, the module does mention this and provides excuses for the DM to rattle off \u2013 nice to see obvious PC capacities taken into account. Beyond the magic, astute and observant PCs can notice quite a few discrepancies in the Tamarind\u2019s make up that should make them aware of the potential issues with the craft -if they fail, though, they may very well be subjected to non-lethal poison that may knock them out and put them at a severe disadvantage.\nWhether they are imprisoned and need to escape from the secret cargo (including slaves) hold or whether open hostilities break out \u2013 the PCs will have a conflict on their hands -and one that is not too easy. While it is my personal opinion that the ship\u2019s alchemist\u2019s buffed AC at 20 isn\u2019t too bad, the module does sport advice for extremely low-powered groups to prevent frustration. Searching the ship, the PCs promptly stumble across the legend of Shayonna and a hinted trade planned by the pirates; Said being, though, is now known as the legendary Gaunt. Embarking towards her islet, the PCs are soon greeted by a less than friendly merrow strike squad.\nDespicable PCs may well sell the slaves for an excellent price, but more heroic PCs will have to brave coral flensing traps, ravenous urchin swarms and worse before finally facing down legendary Shayonna, who has the strange power to transform regular beings into merrow \u2013 and yes, she is a mythic threat and one that will challenge the PCs to the utmost. It should be noted that her legend can be gleaned by the PCs, making sure they know they do not have a regular adversary before them and her stats, fully provided herein, contain all required rules to run her.\nThe pdf concludes with player-friendly versions of the maps, including Shayonna\u2019s islet.

The assistance could amount to 80 billion euros ($116 billion).\nBut the money will come at a cost. The country will have to pay an interest rate for it and enact austerity measures that could choke growth and trigger a public outcry ahead of a June election.\nIreland is seeking a lower interest rate on the aid it accepted last year, after Greece was rewarded with a modest reduction to ease the repayment burden. Both countries are still struggling economically.\nThe Portuguese are keen to avoid that fate, and political parties huddled at the prime minister's official Sao Bento residence to discuss strategy in the bailout negotiations, which all sides want to complete by mid-May.\nSimon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform think-tank in London, said \"previous bailouts have solved nothing\" and Portugal \"is right to bargain hard\" because similar rates to those imposed on Athens and Dublin could be self-defeating.\n\"There's a risk that unless loans are extended at a serviceable interest rate, all the bailout would do would make things worse,\" he said.\nEuropean governments fear the three ailing eurozone members may need to restructure their debt \u2014 a move that would alarm investors who are expecting their loans to be repaid on previously agreed dates.\nRestructuring could be felt far and wide if investors lose confidence in the single currency bloc's fiscal soundness.\nTilford said that underlying worry puts Portuguese authorities in a stronger bargaining position as they assess the bailout terms on offer.\nA delegation from the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission started inspecting Portugal's books Monday to determine how much the country needs. Officials are due to begin direct negotiations next week about the scope and conditions of the loan, which is expected to be for three years.\nPortugal, one of western Europe's poorest countries, is in dire straits and its financial needs are pressing. Officials say the country will run out of money to meet its obligations by June, when it needs to come up with debt repayments totaling around 7 billion euros.\nPortugal may need the cash before a new government takes office in mid-June. That has led to demands from international creditors for a broad agreement between the squabbling political parties so that the conditions are met no matter who wins the ballot.\nEuropean Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Wednesday the bloc's rules don't allow for a bridge loan which would postpone a final deal until after the election.\n\"We're doing everything we can to conclude this (bailout) program in time so that we can deliver a first installment that will guarantee Portugal's financing requirements,\" Barroso said in Brussels, adding that Portugal's situation is \"delicate and extremely urgent.\"\nPortugal's problems are different from those of Greece, where true debt levels were obscured, and Ireland, which was engulfed by the collapse of its banking system.\nPortugal's difficulties have mounted over the past decade as it deferred economic changes that might have generated wealth.

This, however, raises questions on why Nigeria local footballers could not also attract some reasonable transfer to big European leagues and generate money to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) vis-\u00c3 -vis the country.\nUp till the mid-90s, soccer fans in Nigeria looked forward to weekends, so as to watch their darling teams and favourite football stars, and the stadiums were always jam packed. It would take a miracle for a fan to get a seat at the UAC, as Teslim Balogun Stadium was then called, or the Onikan Stadium if the fan were not seated by 2pm for a game billed for 4pm, especially if the game involved clubs like Enugu Rangers, IICC Shooting Stars, Bendel Insurance, Abiola Babes or Leventis United. But not anymore.\nThose were the days when a player would play in the Nigerian league this weekend and the following weekend he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s donning the colours of an European league without going through trials.\nIt is on record that former Super Eagles winger, Finidi George, played in the colours of Ajax Amsterdam without going through trials, a week after he played for Calabar Rovers in the local league.\nMany Nigerians were shocked at seeing Atlanta 1996 Olympic gold medalist, Dosu Joseph, in the colours of Italian Serie A side, Reggina, two weeks after staying between the sticks for Julius Berger in a league game in Lagos.\nBut for a Nigerian player to play for an average European club now, he must go through series of trials, because Nigeria league is little or nothing to write home about. Unlike before when it was at per with the Belgian league and close to the Dutch league.\nProprietor of second division side, AS Racine, Emmanuel Ibru, attributed lack of security, poor officiating and nonexistence of local rivalries as the bane of Nigerian league, which he said were also some of the reasons why fans had decided to shun league matches in the country.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For fans to return to the stadium, their security must be guaranteed. They must be sure of their safety such that one can bring his family to the stadium without any molestation from Area Boys (miscreants). Until then our league will still be in shambles.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lack of local rivalries competing in league has also taken the shine off the league. Those days in Lagos, there were rivalries among Stationery Stores, NEPA, ACB and Julius Berger; in Ibadan, the city stood still whenever IICC was taking on Water Corporation and later Leventis United.

The three men have not been charged with any crime, but are being held on what authorities said were immigration violations.\nRahman, a 33-year-old computer programmer known as Shafiq to friends, worked for Artist & Craftsman Supply, a company with 15 stores from Portland, Maine, to Los Angeles, owner Larry Adlerstein said in a telephone interview. Only a few days ago, Adlerstein said, Rahman surprised him by volunteering that he knew Shahzad, a Pakistani-born former financial analyst from Bridgeport, Conn., through the Pakistani community in that state.\nRahman told his boss he had not seen Shahzad in eight or nine years but was surprised by Shahzad\u2019s arrest in the attempted May 1 bombing, because the suspect was \u201cvery meek\u2019\u2019 when he knew him, Adlerstein said.\nA handful of federal agents showed up at Adlerstein\u2019s business in Portland around 9 a.m. Thursday and informed him that Rahman had been arrested. Adlerstein said he was upset because he likes Rahman and considers him a friend.\nUS Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington Thursday that authorities believe there is evidence that the three men taken into custody had provided money to Shahzad. But he said they were trying to determine whether the men knew they were supplying funds for what the Obama administration describes as an act of terrorism aided and directed by the Pakistani Taliban.\nOn Thursday, federal agents searched 39 Waverley Ave. in Watertown, where the Khans lived with Jehan in a first-floor apartment. They also searched for evidence and questioned witnesses at two Mobil stations in Brookline where Aftab Khan worked as an attendant. The Khans are distant relatives, according to an employee at one of the gas stations.\nYesterday, federal officials declined to release any additional information about Thursday\u2019s raids, characterizing the investigation as ongoing.\nIt is unclear when the three men taken into the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement will appear in federal Immigration Court in Boston. Unlike criminal defendants, people detained for alleged immigration violations face administrative charges, and a veil of secrecy surrounds proceedings.\nAnother way immigration cases differ from criminal cases concerns the right to legal representation. In criminal cases, defendants have a constitutional right to a lawyer, and the government will appoint one if they cannot afford an attorney. In immigration cases, individuals taken into custody have no constitutional right to a lawyer if they cannot afford one, although some lawyers provide services free.

As for everyone else, it might be better to cover your eyes. As our feature on the ills of medical statistics makes clear (\u201cSpin doctors&colon; The truth behind health scare headlines\u201d), see any percentage in a headline and you should start asking questions.\nThe massaging of complex data into a neat headline figure can distort it to the point where it becomes meaningless. Confusing absolute and relative risk, mixing up correlation and causation, mangling mortality and survival rates&colon; these are the sorts of solecisms that plague statistics in the sensitive area of human health and well-being.\nIt is tempting to lay the blame solely at the feet of ignorant politicians or an irresponsible media. They do indeed play a significant role, often perpetuating mistakes, muddles and misunderstandings.\nBut journalists and policymakers can only work with what they are given. Scientists need to bear in mind how their statistics can be abused \u2013 or perhaps unintentionally read the wrong way.\nTake the Fox News report in August 2008 that throat cancer among white men in the US had risen 400 per cent over 30 years. Solid science or sensationalist scaremongering? Both, actually.\nThe 400 per cent figure \u2013 463 per cent, in fact \u2013 can be traced to an academic paper reporting an increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus from 1.01 to 5.69 per 100,000 person-years.\nOn those numbers, to say that you would be better off worrying about being run over by a bus is an exaggeration \u2013 although not by much. But the huge, scary percentage is not Fox\u2019s invention. It is there in the study\u2019s abstract, along with the smaller and less frightening absolute figures&colon; mathematically unimpeachable, practically worthless and ripe for misinterpretation.\nThat is a minor transgression compared with evidence of a deeper-seated problem in medical literature. A review in 2007 of 119 systematic therapeutic studies in three high-profile medical journals revealed that only half reported both the benefits and harms of the therapy, and of those only two-thirds presented them using comparable figures.\nNo doubt much of this is innocent. But in medical research, where cynicism about the role of vested interests is widespread, such omissions or maladroit presentation can discredit worthy work \u2013 and worse still, misinform policymakers and the public.\nThis is a system with few checks and balances. The interests of researchers in search of funding, scientific journals in search of wider media exposure, and journalists in search of compelling stories often coincide to create a military-industrial complex for the production and propagation of dodgy statistics.\nThe bias in favour of misrepresentation is something against which all involved, New Scientist included, must be vigilant. But the vigilance must start at the source, cutting off questionable figures before they receive a bad press."}

From the heroic to the mundane, just about every day a real fan can strain his or her eyes and see something never seen before. Last week, the spectacle was Chris Davis' unprecedented (for a position player) 0-for-54 streak.\nAlas, the streak has since been broken, though Davis' numbers (through Monday night's games) remain underwater at .089-.196-.200. It's easy to forget that Davis was once one of the foremost sluggers in the game, while simultaneously easy to remember that he is the beneficiary of a seven-year, $161M commitment from the Orioles that runs through the 2022 season.\nWhat made Davis so great then, and was it wise for the O's to extend such a contract offer? The answers might seem simple in retrospect, but let's peel back some layers of the numbers and see what has changed between then and now.\nDavis didn't sign his current contract until after the 2015 season, but the story goes back farther than that. He didn't sign as an amateur until he was drafted for the third time, on the 5th round of the 2006 draft by the Rangers, as a third baseman out of Navarro Junior College in Texas.\nEach season I prepare an ordered list of minor league hitting prospects based on production relative to league and level, adjusted for age. Davis made my list five times, finishing in the top ten in both 2007 (#3) and 2008 (#8). He made the list so many times because he struggled making the adjustment to the major league level, and had trouble clearing the minors for good. Making contact was always a challenge, but the power was real.\nHe finally staked a permanent claim to a full-time MLB gig in 2012, when he hit 33 homers for the Orioles, but it was the next year, 2013, when he blew up into a star, unfurling a .286-.370-.634 line and leading the AL in both homers (53) and RBI (138) while finishing 3rd in the MVP voting.\nIn many of my posts here (like this one) I have referred to the concept of Adjusted Contact Score, which is a statistic that I have developed to measure how a hitter should have performed on balls in play based on his individual exit speed/launch angle mix. 100 equals league average, the higher the number, the better. Adjusted Contact Scores can be measured for all of a hitters' batted balls, or broken down by BIP type.\nIn 2013, Davis' Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score of 393 was historic. Since then, only Aaron Judge (414 in 2017) has posted a better single-season fly ball mark. Simply put, a 393 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score can cover a world of hurt.\nAnd there was plenty of \"hurt\" in Davis' 2013 overall profile. Now with big power comes big strikeout totals, but the big lefty has always gone to extremes in that department. In each of his seven seasons as a regular, Davis has struck out over two standard deviations"}

Many shoppers buy them in bundles that include several different types of cookware. Contributed by Made In.\nBy selling online only, Made In founders Jake Kalick and Chip Malt knew that they could appeal to customers who were already buying eyeglasses, razors and underwear through the internet.\nBut why pots and pans?\nThe easy answer is that Kalick grew up in the cookware industry. His grandparents started Harbour, a Boston-based commercial foodservice company, in the 1920s. He and Malt have known each other since they were 5 years old and growing up in Boston, but they stayed in touch as they started their careers.\nKalick worked in food, first in restaurants and then for his family\u2019s business. Malt was working for a direct-to-consumer apparel company and had millennials\u2019 buying habits on his mind.\n\u201cHave you ever thought about kitchen tools?\u201d he asked Kalick one day a few years ago.\nThat was the start of what became Made In. Over two years, the friends-turned-business-partners dug into the supply chain to find U.S. manufacturers to produce the sauce and saute pans they wanted to sell. Kalick knew the markups that were built into the price of familiar brands, such as All-Clad, so he knew they could increase the quality \u2014 and keep manufacturing in the U.S. \u2014 by selling to customers directly. Pots and pans might be heavy, but they are relatively easy to ship.\nBut before they started designing the product line, the company surveyed 100 cooks about what they knew and didn\u2019t know about pots and pans. \u201cNobody had brand affinity and everyone was waiting until they were married\u201d to buy them, Kalick says. Customers didn\u2019t want the handles to get hot and they didn\u2019t like the current handles on the market, so they engineered slightly slimmer handles that don\u2019t get so hot.\nWith bright colors and thoughtful design, Made In is trying to capture the millennial market of cooks who need kitchen gear. Contributed by Made In.\nThe founders say it was an easy decision to base their company in Austin. They looked at Los Angeles and Miami, but Kalick says the thriving start-up and food communities in Austin \u2014 \u201cthe Brooklyn of America,\u201d he says \u2014 was just the right fit. They moved here in early 2017 and, by September, they were shipping pots and pans across the country.\nKalick might have the background in cookware, but Malt says he considers himself the target demographic: He cooks three times a week and doesn\u2019t shy away from calling himself a \u201cfoodie.\u201d He still eats at restaurants but also entertains at home.\nSome of the pots and pans from Made In have a traditional look, but they are designed to compete with the high-end brands on the market. Contributed by Made In.\nMillennials might not be buying homes as fast as generations before them, but they are investing in the stuff in their homes, Malt says, and they are always looking for an excuse to get together.

Speaking from my own longstanding connection to the UK with films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire of the Sun and recently War Horse, it\u2019s very exciting to be heading back.\nThis might just be a good press release, and shouldn\u2019t be taken as indication that the new film will be primarily shot with practical sets and effects. But if nothing else, we\u2019ll take the suggestion that the prequel tendencies aren\u2019t the primary influence on this film. And we know that director JJ Abrams has an affinity for shooting on sets and locations that George Lucas didn\u2019t share over the past couple decades, so this instills a shred of optimism.\nJ.J.

Road crews will also bring that stretch of Jarvis Street up to a state of good repair.\n\"It is a big project,\" D'Andrea told CBC Toronto.\nThe work is part of a wider $720-million plan to maintain and improve infrastructure in Toronto. It is an attempt by the city to \"stay ahead of the curve\" in the hope of preventing water service disruptions, water main breaks and resulting damage to roads that could affect traffic, businesses and residents, he said.\nThe upgrades are also necessary to support future growth in the downtown core, he added.\nToronto Water and Toronto Transportation Services, he said, are working together to ensure the project creates the least inconvenience possible.\n\"In Jarvis Street, it is truly an integrated project,\" D'Andrea said.\nThe combined effort will be carried out in two phases to minimize disruptions to residents and traffic.\n\"At our end, it's integrating those needs as one single construction contract, rather than going in, replacing the water main, then sometime later coming in and reconstructing the road,\" he said.\nIf all goes as planned, the water mains be will be replaced by early October and the subsequent roadwork completed by the end of October.\nOne northbound lane and one southbound lane of Jarvis Street between Dundas and Queen streets will be open to traffic during the construction period. However drivers and cyclists will be urged to use either Church or Sherbourne street to travel to the downtown core.\nSome curbs and driveway entrances will be dug up and replaced, but there will be pedestrian access, according to the city.\n\"Smart\" traffic signs placed at Adelaide and Queen streets will provide road users updated estimates of how long it will take to travel through the work zone northbound to Gerrard Street E. The new signs are part of Toronto's smart work zone pilot, the city said in a news release.\nIt will allow officials to monitor conditions in real time and make any necessary changes to traffic signal timing to help reduce delays.\nWhile work on Jarvis is ongoing, crews will also replace an aging water main on Gloucester Street. The street will be temporarily closed at Yonge Street and a stretch between Yonge and Jarvis will be reduced to a single lane.\nThe decision to replace any individual water main is based on age, condition and the number of breaks it has seen in the past, D'Andrea said. The city is trying to \"get ahead of the curve\" and replace crumbling infrastructure before \"it begins to impact us quite significantly,\" he continued.\nThere are about 1,400 water main breaks per year in Toronto, he explained. Replacing those at the end of their service life is \"critically important\" moving forward, D'Andrea added.\nMost of the work on the Jarvis Street will take place Monday to Friday"}

Clearly, nobody has been immune to this now-global plague. Every effort to rebuild an economy in free fall has been one moment too late or one step too short, and the remedies, though expensive, have so far at least failed to address underlying structural issues.\nYet certain truisms have continued to prove their validity. As Justice Brandeis observed, sunlight is the best disinfectant. The transparency that comes with the glare of sunlight is hard for companies and government to deal with\u2014and so is resisted.\nBut transparency could begin to remedy one of the great costs of our current crisis: the public\u2019s monumental loss of confidence in the markets. One of the great accomplishments of the past 50 years has been the so-called \u201cdemocratization\u201d of the markets\u2014the successful effort to get Americans of all economic levels to invest in our process of capital formation. Not only did this create greater liquidity, but more important, it gave a much larger piece of America the opportunity to benefit from economic growth. The rise of the \u201cownership society\u201d became a noted part of our politics as well as our sense of well-being.\nNow, many of these investors are rightly concluding that the market has become nothing more than a casino on steroids\u2014with Wall Street and corporate CEOs playing the role of the house, swinging the odds against the investors at every turn. Trust will be regained only if there is a fundamental change in the rules of transparency and only if those rules are enforced. Such transparency could have prevented many of the cataclysms of the past year. So it is all the more troubling that we continue to fail to require anything close to the information flow that we should\u2014either about the behavior that brought us to where we are or about the transactions and efforts that are now being funded by taxpayers.\nNo doubt we all have our favorite questions that have not been answered. But here are a few year-ending queries to the players who have been central to the unfolding events of the past months. Some of these questions are retrospective in nature; some are prospective.\nFirst, for our Treasury Department\u2014and the Federal Reserve\u2014which seem able to lend or guarantee at a scale unheard of until now: Where is all the money going, and how is it decided who gets it? Many of the investments appear to be much less critical than an investment in Lehman Bros. would have been, for example. If this reflects learning, wonderful. But what is the current metric for evaluation?\nSpeaking of Lehman, what precisely was the conversation at the Fed among the various bankers that led to the conclusion not to give Lehman assistance but to give AIG an almost unlimited Fed pipeline? What, exactly, did each bank tell the government about its exposure to Lehman or AIG, and when?\nWhat did the government tell the banks about their obligation to lend, once they had received the infusion of billions to restore their balance sheets?

This week it said it would pay out $5.2 billion to purchase Sampoerna, the third-largest cigarette producer in Indonesia.\nThe purchase represents another example of a disturbing trend. Philip Morris and other big tobacco companies have sought to penetrate world tobacco markets since the 1980s - with either outright purchases of companies such as Sampoerna or state-owned tobacco enterprises being privatized (e.g., Russia), or through joint ventures.\nThe world's big tobacco companies have a physical presence in some 96 countries. And tobacco manufacturers are seriously lobbying China, whose smokers represent a third of the world's estimated 1.2 billion who light up, but whose government currently controls tobacco production.\nStill, a vibrant antismoking movement in Asia, notably in Thailand, offers some hope. And in eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa, antismoking efforts are just beginning to coalesce.

Based on 12 ADVIZOR Visuals, the Analyst Editions wizards and point-and-click user interfaces bring data display, interaction, authoring and deployment to a whole new level.\nThe process of building BI (business intelligence) reports involves three layers.

The document includes checklists and sets of questions to guide IT acquisitions, and focuses on agile methodology to deliver iterations of a service early, with multiple testing periods and frequent revisions. It also urges agencies to \"consider open source software solutions at all layers of the stack.\"\nThe stripped-down, IT-centric TechFAR dovetails with the guidance in the playbook, and specifically instructs feds on how the FAR supports use of agile in the technology procurement cycle using existing regulations.\nIndustry and federal procurement officials praised the documents as a good start and said that efforts to accelerate federal IT acquisition processes were becoming even more important as another round of budget uncertainty looms.\n\"We've reviewed and fully support the materials in the Digital Services Playbook and TechFAR,\" Mark Naggar, a procurement advisor for the Department of Health and Humans Service's Buyers Club initiative told FCW. \"It will assist all IT service acquisition stakeholders, notably program managers and contracting professionals as the documents address both procurement and implementation.\"\nThe TechFAR and the playbook, said Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president, public sector, Information Technology Alliance for Public Sector, are \"both good tools.\" He added, however, that the documents' emphasis on how to best navigate a sprawling set of acquisition rules is also ample evidence that legislative changes to the acquisition process are sorely needed.\nFederal acquisition rules, even with the new TechFAR, are outdated when it comes to buying IT, Hodgkins said -- especially some of the regulations' vendor reporting requirements for costs, labor and other categories. He argued the FAR is \"overburdened\" with rules drafted decades ago that might not make sense in the 21st century.\nHodgkins suggested that the TechFAR concept be expanded to include pertinent ways to buy commercial IT items. More readily available products, he said, could become even more important in the face of tighter federal IT budgets by offering a quicker, more efficient path for IT managers than the standard acquisition process. The Department of Defense, Hodgkins said, had a Commercial Item Acquisition rulebook that has been withdrawn and is probably outdated.

The same is true for their robot counterparts, two of which recently arrived in Massachusetts to be put through their paces in preparation for a long-off mission to Mars.\nValkyrie is built like a linebacker \u2014 6\u20192\u201d tall and 275 pounds. Its job is to go to Mars and maintain equipment in anticipation of the arrival of astronauts, potentially years after Valkyrie first touches down on the Red Planet.\nA manned mission to Mars is a high priority for NASA, which hopes to achieve the feat by the 2030s. As conceived, the expedition would require NASA to send equipment like rovers and a human habitat to Mars years before the astronauts launch. This is due to the relative orbits of Earth and Mars, which make it only practical to launch from here to there every two years.\n\u201cYou need to pre-position assets like a habitat, a power supply. Whatever you need on the surface, all that\u2019s done years before an astronaut gets there,\u201d says William Verdeyen, NASA project manager for Valkyrie.\nValkyrie\u2019s destination may be exotic, but the robot\u2019s tasks will be mundane. The Johnson Space Center in Houston will beam instructions to Mars (the transmission takes about 20 minutes), and the robot will carry them out autonomously. Likely jobs include repairing electronic boards, cutting cords, and changing batteries \u2014 all maneuvers that require dexterity, which is complicated to engineer.\nOver the next two years, the Northeastern team will work on improving Valkyrie\u2019s performance, especially at these kinds of fine-motor maintenance tasks. A separate team at MIT will be doing similar work with another copy of the robot.\nMost of Valkyrie\u2019s movements will take place inside the human habitat \u2014 a known environment for the engineers, which makes it relatively easy to navigate. Sometimes, though, the robot will have to venture outside, like to brush dust off of solar panels. There, things get more treacherous. And if Valkyrie falls on the rough, uneven Martian surface, there\u2019s always the risk it will never be able to get back up.

Anne was once on the rise in the world of women\u2019s surfing, but a near-death experience leaves her frightened of competing again. Blue Crush is about her trying to overcome her fears and get back out on the waves again, while also looking out for her 14-year-old sister and managing to pay the bills.\nA story set in Hawaii\u2019s North Shore about a group of young, surfing-loving friends has potential.

The movie could\u2019ve explored more of that world, but maybe the show will allow Weiss to do so.\nWeiss, who last created Switched at Birth, can hopefully put together a charming enough cast and group of friends for the Blue Crush television show. That\u2019s something the movie has going for it, and checking in with a charismatic group of friends who surf in Hawaii sounds like an actual show worth watching, not just another one of the many, many head-scratching film-to-TV adaptations we\u2019ve heard about in recent years. There\u2019s certainly nothing sacrilegious about attempting to do something new with Blue Crush."}

When rescuers first spotted the whale, it was struggling to swim and breathe. So, rescuers used buoys to keep it afloat and opened red umbrellas to keep the whale from getting a sunburn.\nThe whale likely mistook the plastic bags for food, said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation\u2019s North American operation. As the bags piled up in its stomach, the animal would have felt full and may have stopped hunting for its natural diet of squid, fish and octopus.\n\"At some point, their stomach fills up with trash and they can't eat real food,\" Asmutis-Silvia told National Geographic. \"You\u2019re not getting any nutrients in, and you've basically completely clogged your digestive system.\"\nThis pilot whale is hardly the only creature that has mistakenly dined on plastic with fatal consequences.

{"idx": "27369", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Despite Orban\u2019s disturbing rhetoric, many on the political right have praised Central Europe\u2019s illiberal democrats for supposedly speaking truth to power. From the editorial offices of the National Review to think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the message is that Orban and his ideological companions, including Zeman and Jaroslaw Kaczynski in Poland, are not trying to destroy the European Union but rather help it find its way \u2014 on issues of immigration, Europe\u2019s Christian roots, and national sovereignty.\nThose are legitimate conservative causes. However, superficial ideological sympathies and an enthusiasm to see Eurocrats and the bien-pensants get their comeuppance have created a monumental blind spot. People who fancy themselves defenders of freedom and democracy have become apologists for practices that are pulling the region \u2014 Hungary and Poland in particular \u2014 in an unmistakably authoritarian direction. Their chief error lies in assuming that the will of a parliamentary majority du jour can never be questioned. That is a mistaken understanding of democracy, which should always be embedded within a framework on constitutional rules constraining those who hold office.\nIn Poland, for example, the Law and Justice party has used its electoral mandate for sweeping reforms of the judiciary, described in damning detail by successive Venice Commission reports. Defenders of Central Europe\u2019s illiberal democrats claim that those reforms were adopted only in response to the politicization of courts under previous governments, typically glossed over by the EU. Shortly before the 2015 election, the Civic Platform-dominated parliament nominated five new judges to the Constitutional Tribunal, in a move that Law and Justice deemed deeply unfair.\nHowever, the changes to Poland\u2019s judiciary extend far beyond the reform of the Constitutional Tribunal (itself struck down as unconstitutional). New legislation gives the justice minister the discretion to appoint, dismiss, and \u201cdiscipline\u201d presidents of ordinary courts. The reforms bring the National Council of the Judiciary, a formerly self-governing body, under full control of the parliament. A new law forces nearly 40 percent of the Supreme Court\u2019s judges into early retirement and creates a retroactive mechanism for \u201cextraordinary review\u201d of final judgments. With the average age of judges now at around 40, the efforts to bring the judiciary under control of the rule of the majority cannot conceivably be about taking levers of power out of post-communist hands, as Law and Justice claims.\nIlliberal reforms aren\u2019t limited to Poland. Last year, the Hungarian government adopted new legislation concerning nongovernmental organizations, echoing Russia\u2019s infamous law from 2012 that requires foreign-funded NGOs to register as foreign agents. According to Fidesz Deputy Chairman Szilard Nemeth, NGOs funded by George Soros \u201cmust be pushed back with all available tools, and I think they must be swept out.\u201d Judging by the amount of government-sponsored propaganda \u2014 from posters that brought back memories of the anti-Semitism of the 1930s to letters sent to every Hungarian household accusing Soros of wanting to resettle millions of Muslims in Hungary \u2014 Orban\u2019s dislike of him is intense. The resentment has also prompted the government to adopt a law that leaves the Soros-funded Central European University \u2014 by most metrics the most prestigious academic institution in the region \u2014 in legal limbo.\nOf course, one may have, as I do, substantive disagreements with Soros.

The proposal will not be finalized until Wednesday, but Desai said it would likely ask for the waiting rate to increase from 40 to 50 cents and the mileage rate to go up to $2.50 from $2. The alliance will also ask for increases in taxi surcharges for rush hour and late night.\nThe request comes as the Bloomberg administration attempts to drill down a proposal to get more cab service in the outer boroughs. Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced in his State of the City speech in January he would propose legislation to allow livery cabs in the outer boroughs to pick up people hailing on the street \u2014 prohibited under current law.\nAfter a backlash from city officials and the taxi industry, the administration is considering creating another class of yellow cab that would be limited to outer-borough pick ups instead.\nDesai said the alliance isn\u2019t opposed to servicing the outer boroughs, but as it stands now it\u2019s not economical. Drivers cannot cruise residential streets for street pickups without losing money, she said. A fare increase would help convince drivers to go to Brooklyn or Queens, Desai added. She also suggested creating cab stands in commercial areas of the outer boroughs.\nOn his radio show this morning, Bloomberg said he was sympathetic to the cab industry\u2019s qualms.\nAbove all else, Desai said she wants to make sure the yellow cab reserves the exclusive right to pick up New Yorkers at the curbside."}

Moreover, the Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps is reportedly considering sending surface-to-air missiles to Afghanistan.\nIran may be seeking closer ties to the Taliban as a strategic move to frustrate the alliance of the United States, Western Europe and the Kabul government of Hamid Karzai, which the Taliban is fighting to overthrow.\nBen Farmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Iran may also threaten to spark violence in Afghanistan in the event the U.S. and Israel carry out a military strike on its nuclear power facilities. (After all, dozens of U.S. military bases in Afghanistan are within easy reach of Iranian missiles).\nInterestingly, Iran and the Taliban have watched each other warily for the past 15 years. As a fiercely Sunni Muslim movement, the Taliban regards Shia Muslims with extreme disdain and contempt (Iran is the world\u2019s pre-eminent Shia state).\nIndeed, when the Taliban seized the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif in August 1998, Iran blamed the group for the killing of nine Iranian diplomats. That massacre heightened fears that Iran would launch an attack on the Taliban in retaliation.\nNow, more than a decade later, Iran appears to see the Taliban as a strategic ally in a changed global landscape.\n\"Iran is willing to put aside ideology and put aside deeply held religious values for their ultimate goal: accelerating the departure of U.S. forces from Afghanistan,\" a Western diplomat told the Wall Street Journal.\nOver the past few years, reports have filtered out that the Taliban were receiving Iran-made military equipment. However, it is unclear if Iran will continue to provide them with more weapons, since such a provocation might lead to a direct confrontation with the U.S.\nIn addition, whatever support the Taliban currently enjoys in the Sunni-dominated Middle East would be seriously jeopardized if they developed closer relations with Shia Iran.\nOn the other side of the map, Pakistan, another Sunni Muslim state, has provided enormous aid to the Taliban over the years (openly and secretly). They, too, would be alarmed by any Iranian strategic designs on Afghanistan.\nHowever, Iran has at least one advantage \u2013 hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees have fled to Iran since the war erupted in 2001. The Iranian envoy to Kabul, Abu Fazel Zohrawand, has already warned the Afghan government that these refugees would be deported if Karzai signed strategic partnership agreements with the U.S.\nWhile that threat has passed, the status of Afghan migrants in Iran remains extremely insecure, suggesting they could be used as pawns by Tehran.\nNonetheless, Afghanistan (Taliban and otherwise), which desperately needs foreign investment to rebuild its economy and infrastructure after decades of war, may need Iranian help, regardless of the fallout.\nJanan Mosazai, the spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told NPR that the Iranians have considered making large-scale investment in the construction, mining and agriculture sectors.\nClearly, Tehran wants to see a pro-Iran regime take hold in Afghanistan after the last of the NATO troops depart.

The implication was that Streisand considered hers the only lead role in the film.\nDreyfuss is, in fact, getting heavy support from two studios for Oscar nominations. Disney is also promoting him, as best actor, for \"Tin Men.\" If Warner Bros. was pushing Dreyfuss as best actor, the category most people believe his role in \"Nuts\" belongs in, he would in effect be competing against himself.\nIt is not unusual for an actor or actress to be promoted for the same category from different movies. In fact, Jack Nicholson is getting a best actor double-pump this year. Warner Bros. is promoting him for \"Witches of Eastwick.\" Tri-Star is promoting him for \"Ironweed.\" The Los Angeles and New York film critics groups voted their best-actor awards to Nicholson for both films.\nAlthough actresses have been nominated in different categories before (Jessica Lange was nominated as best actress for \"Frances\" and supporting actress for \"Tootsie\" in 1982), it has never happened with an actor.\nUltimately, it is up to the academy voters to decide which category a performance belongs in, and which performance they care to vote for. When nominations are announced Feb. 17, maybe Dreyfuss' name will be there for \"Stakeout.\"\nHe did have a good year."}

Let someone else reinvent the wheel.\"\nGatland revealed he had been \"hurt\" by criticism from within the camp, notably from Ireland flanker Sean O'Brien.\nWhile the Lions' six-week, 10-match tour of New Zealand ended with a creditable drawn series - the Lions have only won once there in 100 years - a feature of the series was the level of abuse directed towards Gatland.\nThat included the New Zealand Herald newspaper featuring a cartoon of him as a red-nosed clown.\nSpeaking on Monday, Gatland said: \"I hated the tour. I did. I just hated the press and the negativity in New Zealand.\n\"When I look back on it now, there were a lot of things that were satisfying and what an achievement it was, but it was tough work. It was hard.\"\nGatland had suggested he would be prepared to take charge for a third time in 2021, but when asked on Monday, he said: \"I wouldn't subject myself to that.\n\"What I've learned from my Lions experiences is how difficult it is to put some continuity together in terms of people and staff, and the lack of preparation time.

The condition of public transport buses in Karachi is appalling. They are crammed with passengers especially during the rush hours.\nThe ironed clothes and polished shoes of office-goers commuters used to be wrinkled and blotchy while travelling in buses and minibuses overcrowded with passengers. For female commuters, there is a small separate compartment with seating capacity of less than dozen. But the bus conductor and drivers are skilful enough to squeeze up to two-dozen females commuters in this compartment.\nThese females are often disturbed by indecent attitude of male commuters. Despite having a exist door at the back many male commuters prefer to pass through the women\u2019s compartment in a bid to rub shoulders with them. Most of the female commuters feel themselves insecure, as majority of bus owners do not implement government\u2019s decision of partitioning female compartment for that of males.\nThe lack of barrier between the compartment of male and female commuters result in sexual harassment of female commuters in the shape of indecent looks and remarks and frequent pushing. The female commuters have often raised protest against their sexual harassment in public transport vehicles but their complaints seemed falling on deaf ears.\nFaryal, 22, a student of Karachi University in this regard says, \u201cIt is daunting task for female commuters to board on overcrowded buses in the morning or evening. She says she has to often quarrel with men, who occupy the seats in female compartments.\nShe says it is agonising to wait for about 30 minutes at the bus stop to catch a bus. \u201cI prefer to take two buses rather than one in order to avoid wasting my time waiting for the particular bus.\u201d She also complaints about male commuters, standing in close vicinity of female compartment in packed buses, trying to physically contact female commuters whenever possible. She said that ironically the \u2018point buses\u2019 of the Karachi University had no separate partition for female students.\nThe drivers often ignore traffic rules and public transport vehicles run in an undisciplined and risky manner creating chaos.

All it requires is a sudden brake to make those perched on the roof or clinging to the door to fall from the moving bus.\nThe majority of traffic cops ignore blatant traffic violation of bus and minibus drivers, provided to them Rs20 handed as bribe, which they shamelessly accept in presence of commuters. The Karachiites have urged that the compartment for ladies should be separated from the male compartment by an iron-sheet in such a way that no one could pass through it and no physical contact between the passengers of two compartments were possible.\nThey have requested that the number of bus routes should be increased and bus owners should be made bound to ply more vehicles on each route.

{"idx": "27393", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The story of the Democratic Party -- at least during those times when the party has advanced progressive causes -- has been a story of expanding the franchise. From the time of Andrew Jackson, when Democrats eliminated the property requirements for white male voting; to the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the labor movement, which together brought millions of new Eastern and Southern European ethnics to the polls; to the civil-rights revolution of the 1960s, the party's electoral fortunes have swelled whenever it's been able to enlarge the electorate. That was certainly the story behind Barack Obama's triumph in 2008, when record numbers of black, Latino, and young voters went to the polls, and behind the Democrats' 2010 senatorial victories in Western states with growing Latino populations.\nOften, enlarging the electorate has required changing the laws on voter eligibility -- something Democrats in the ages of Jackson and Johnson (Lyndon) clearly understood. Which is why the Democrats' current inability to secure the legalization of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, or even just the college students and members of the armed forces who would have won legal status under the DREAM Act, is so maddening.\nEven absent statutory changes to the immigration laws, of course, the Democrats are profiting from the surge in Latino voting. But it's increasingly apparent that the Republicans are eating the Democrats' lunch in the battle to reshape the electorate for partisan advantage. Faced with the prospect of millions more Latino Democrats, congressional Republicans -- even those like John McCain who had once supported immigration reform or Orrin Hatch who had formerly co-sponsored the DREAM Act -- shifted their stance to one of universal opposition to legalizing any of the undocumented.\nSuccessfully opposing immigration reform is just one element of the larger campaign to shape the electorate to the GOP's benefit. Republicans have long sought, through all manner of statute and subterfuge, to keep minority voters from the polls, and those efforts, if anything, are intensifying. With Republicans now in control of more statehouses, it's a safe bet that the GOP will craft more legal roadblocks to voting -- requirements to present photo IDs at the polls, for instance -- before the 2012 election rolls around.\nThe other major element in the GOP's campaign to create a more sympathetic electorate is the drive to remove unions from the political battlefield. Republicans' success at blocking the enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) during the last session of Congress ensured that the long march of private -- sector unions toward extinction -- they now make up just 6.9 percent of the private-sector workforce -- would continue apace.\nNow Republicans are training their fire against public-sector unions. Newly elected Gov. Scott Walker's campaign to deny collective-bargaining rights to Wisconsin's public-sector unions is, I fear, just the opening gun of a sustained drive to weaken unions throughout the industrial Midwest, long a union stronghold but now, in many states, under right-wing Republican control since last November's elections. Using the budget woes of their states as a pretext, GOP governors are seizing the opportunity to destroy the unions that run the Democrats' biggest and best voter-registration and turnout campaigns. If Walker were truly as concerned about Wisconsin's fiscal plight as he professes to be, he wouldn't exempt the state's police and fire"}

But he also offered caveats that leave plenty of room for doubt and suggested the Fed won\u2019t raise interest rates at least until September.\nIn a speech in New Jersey, Dudley said he expects U.S. growth to slow to 1% in the first quarter from 2.2% in the final three months of 2014. He pointed to a string of soft economic reports, including a mediocre 126,000 increase in U.S. jobs in March that was only half as large as Wall Street expected.\nThe latest batch of weak data reflects a U.S. recovery that has been \u201cdisappointing compared to historical patterns,\u201d Dudley said.\nDudley attributed the recent slowdown mainly to three factors: harsh weather, a stronger dollar and the negative effects of cheap oil on the vibrant U.S. energy industry.\nBy looking at the amount of snow and the population of the areas affected, New York Fed researchers found that the weather in January and February was 20% to 25% \u201cmore severe\u201d than the five-year average, Dudley said.\nA 15% spike in the value of the dollar since last year, meanwhile, poses \u201canother significant shock\u201d to the economy by making U.S. exports more expensive, he said.\nDudley also said the huge drop in energy prices, while a longer-term boon for consumers, has caused oil drilling and exploration to fall off sharply in what was a fast-growing domestic energy sector, one of the few stars in the nearly six-year-old U.S. expansion.\nThat\u2019s had a \u201cmeaningful drag\u201d on the economy, Dudley said.\nStill, the New York Fed president believes growth will rebound as the weather improves. He said the benefits of lower gasoline prices will filter through the economy and spur more spending. What\u2019s more, the surge in job creation over the past year is likely to generate stronger wage gains as companies compete more to attract workers.\nHigher incomes might even be enough, Dudley said, to support the economy even if hiring tapers off from 2014\u2019s breakneck pace that was the fastest in 15 years.\nYet the Fed\u2019s expectations seem at odds with the behavior of consumers and businesses since the U.S. exited recession in mid-2009. Consumers are not spending as much as they used to or buying lots of homes despite ultra-low interest rates. Indeed, the U.S. saving rate has actually increased sharply since last fall and it rose in February to a 26-month high even as gasoline prices sank.\n\u201cHow much this energy windfall boosts consumption will depend, though, on how much is spent versus saved,\u201d Dudley conceded.\nNor are businesses investing all that heavily even though profits had been surging until 2014, when they dropped for the first time in six years. A key measure of business investment known as core durable-goods orders, for example, has declined in six straight months as of February.\nRead William Dudley\u2019s speech on the health of the economy.\nThe message: The Fed will continue to keep short-term rates near zero until they are convinced the economy is on firm footing.

Email, search, e-commerce, social networking sites \u2014 hundreds of millions of people use them every day. But the original internet was a very different world. Designed in 1973, the idea was to enable the US Defence Department to integrate computers into its command and control system. Of course, it was also immediately adopted by its academic developers for their own uses!\nMany people often confuse the internet with the \"web\". In fact, the \"web\" \u2014 the pages you and I see when we are online \u2014 is one of many applications supported by the internet. Since the commercial availability of the internet in 1989, the percentage of the world's population going online has increased dramatically. Current estimates indicate that one-sixth of the world's population is now online. Given this level of growth, it is not beyond reality that we may see over three billion people online by 2010 \u2014 that's nearly half of the world's population!\nThis anticipated growth can be attributed to two main factors \u2014 mobile technology and the increased localisation of content. With approximately two and a half billion mobile users across the world (many more people than have access to a personal computer), the scope for internet access via the mobile is huge. It also gets around the problem of access to a fixed line, which in the developing world is often limited to the wealthy few in urban areas. According to estimates by the World Bank, more than two-thirds of the world's population lives within range of a mobile phone network.\nBut what really matters is local content and local services. There are currently around 22 million internet users in the Middle East and North Africa. We're now providing services like Gmail and Google News in Arabic, and we have other services in the pipeline. Of course a lot of the information on the web will still appear in languages such as English and Spanish. That is why we are investing in translation tools which, while not perfect (even our own!), do help Arabic speakers to make use of this content. The best way to make the internet more useful to particular language speakers is to include more content in these languages on the network. We hope that our Arabic speaking colleagues will respond to this need by contributing Arabic language material online.\nI've heard people argue that the internet is controlled by the United States of America, and that it's yet another way of increasing that nation's influence and the hegemony of the English language. The vast expansion of local content made available by local ISPs suggests otherwise. Indeed, even the core technical architectures of the internet are decentralised and managed by local actors across the world. It is true that many of the top-level domain names that we are most familiar with (.com, .org, .net) are handled by registries incorporated in the United States. But country-level domains such as .uk, .eg and .mx are handled by locally-based, locally-governed internet organisations. The second-largest top-level domain is .de (Germany) with 10 million registrants. All registries are overseen \u2014 not controlled \u2014 by ICANN, the self-regulatory coordinating body that ensures proper representation across all countries.\nNinety-nine percent of the internet's infrastructure is controlled by private entities and organisations, and at the end of the day local content tends to be of most interest to internet users. So every organisation, American or otherwise, has an interest in providing services in lots of languages if it wants to make the most of the opportunities the internet offers.\n"}

Studies off the California coast have shown that low-frequency noise has doubled every decade since 1960. This human-made noise could be having a devastating effect on underwater life, by interfering with whales\u2019 calls or damaging creatures\u2019 bodies.\nNow new noise forecasting techniques are being used to help track the effect that noisy human activity is having on sea life. This information could eventually be used to reroute ships to safeguard vulnerable marine species.\nWhales are particularly at risk because they use low-frequency calls to communicate across thousands of kilometres. Unfortunately, these frequencies, in the 20 to 2000 hertz range, overlap with major noise pollutants, chiefly ships\u2019 propellers and the air guns used to prospect for oil beneath the seabed (see \u201cThe din beneath the waves\u201d).\nOne result may be that whales are losing contact with one another and with their prey. Baleen whales, including the endangered humpback and right whales, are particularly vulnerable, says Leila Hatch, a marine ecologist at Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in Scituate, Massachusetts.\nA study in the bay of Fundy, Canada, showed that right whales appear to be issuing louder calls to make themselves heard over the noise. This saps energy that could otherwise be used for finding food or mating, Hatch says. It was also reported this year that shipping noise can \u201cpulp\u201d the ears of squid and octopuses, making it hard for them to balance in the water and move (New Scientist, 16 April, p 15).\nThomas Folegot, founder of Quiet-Oceans in Brest, France, has developed a computer model called Quonops that analyses maps of the sea floor and predicts how sound will behave as it propagates through water of different salinities, temperatures and depths. Folegot presented his system at the 2nd International Marine Conservation Congress in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, last month. He has used Quonops to make noise pollution maps of roughly 18 cubic kilometres of ocean in the middle of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nThe identity, location and speed of all ships over 300 tonnes can now be tracked using a system called Automated Identification System (AIS). Quonops can use this information to identify ships with the noisiest propellers and predict how this noise will propagate through the water.\nTo determine how those noises overlap with the sounds produced by marine animals, Hatch placed recorders on the sea floor in the 2200-square-kilometre Stellwagen sanctuary. From these recordings it was possible to map nearby marine mammals by their calls and calculate the distance over which the whales\u2019 voices can be heard against any background noise. The team\u2019s preliminary results show that right whales have lost, on average, 80 per cent of the area they would normally be able to communicate over. The recordings also helped to validate computer-derived noise forecasts from systems similar to Quonops.\nShips\u2019 propellers generate continuous low-frequency noise, as their churning action forms cavities in the water that pop loudly as they collapse. \u201cA really cavitating propeller is a bad propeller,\u201d says marine ecologist Leila Hatch. To reduce noise, propeller blades can be redesigned to minimise cavitation. Military and cruise ships already use less noisy propellers.\nAnother source of underwater noise is the guns that fire shots of compressed air at the ocean floor to"}

{"idx": "27401", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In health care, not only is the number of sellers deliberately and artificially restricted (manipulated), but the number of buyers is uncontrolled and virtually infinite. Moreover, the ever-increasing number of buyers have no \u201cfreedom of exit\u201d from health care, as everyone is forced to engage at some point in their lives: \u201cYou can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave\u201d, (Hotel California, The Eagles). These factors along with extreme asymmetry of information, the monopoly power of hospitals, and the inherently non-uniform (customized, personalized) nature of health care are clear violations of the \u201cperfect competition\u201d requirements of any \u201cfree market\u201d.\nIn a free market economy, price is supposedly established through daily interactions between buyers and sellers. That is, neither buyers nor sellers have absolute control of price. But the market forces of supply and demand fail to establish either price or quantity for health care because demand is price-inelastic. In other words, sellers control the price absolutely and buyers have little or no choice but to engage.\nThus, health care professionals draw greater incomes by forcing more and more consumers out of the market while charging higher prices to those who are able and willing to pay. This is what economists refer to as \u201cmarket failure\u201d, because the market itself fails to establish price and quantity. Health care providers become price-makers, not price-takers, and health care consumers have little or no choice or voice in the matter.\nThese conditions characterize the inherently non-market nature of health care, and cannot be corrected through any sort of \u201cmarket\u201d reform. In fact, \u2018market failure\u2019 is the \u2018pre-existing condition\u2019 of the health care industry before insurance companies ever get involved. The inherent function of insurance corporations is merely to exploit the market failure of health care and to exacerbate it as much as possible in order to maximize shareholder value. By direct contrast, the function of government intervention could (and should) be to regulate price and to provide a guaranteed quantity of supply \u2014 primarily by flooding the health care industry with increased competition, i.e. a continuous supply of new doctors and other health care professionals.\nHowever, since the Demand curve for health care is essentially vertical, it can never intersect with the Price axis at Quantity demanded = zero. Therefore, I think it\u2019s a serious mistake to assume the measures outlined above could ever possibly convert health care to a free market commodity. Rather than implementing a mere \u201creform\u201d agenda, it seems government intervention must eventually \u201creplace\u201d the existing dysfunction by 1) regulating the price of US health care 2) providing the greatest possible access to US health care education, and 3) providing guaranteed health care services to every US citizen. While single-payer doesn\u2019t address all of these issues, it would certainly be the most genuine start in the right direction, especially in terms of removing the corruptive influence of insurance corporations.\nIn the meantime, the current health care reform debate doesn\u2019t address any of these issues \u2014 and as usual, most of the American people are passive spectators, not active participants, in their own democratic system. More and more viable solutions keep getting swept \u201coff the table\u201d of discussion, as general interests and \u201cspecial interests\u201d are directly opposed. The American geniuses who understand this general principle find themselves at odds with the American boneheads who don\u2019t. So instead of engaging in adult-level discussions about health care, we, the people, find ourselves standing in the streets with picket signs and automatic weapons, shouting obscenities at each other, like a bunch of developmentally disabled social rejects, trying to drown out any possibility of reason.\nI certainly feel your pain"}

Washington has also recently decided to strengthen its missile-defense posture in the Pacific in response to Pyongyang\u2019s continual threats to launch ballistic missile attacks against US targets in the region and targets as far away as the US mainland.\nOn 8 March and again on 26 March, the United States dispatched B-52 bombers from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to overfly South Korean territory as part of the ongoing joint US-South Korean Foal Eagle military exercise. These flights were, according to US Department of Defense sources, routine flights intended to demonstrate America\u2019s capability of maintaining a \u201ccontinuous bomber presence\u201d in the region.\nIn a third demonstration of US airborne might, two F-22 Raptor stealth fighters were deployed to Osan Air Force Base in South Korea from their base of operations in Okinawa on 31 March. A US Forces Korea (USFK) announcement referred to this deployment as a routine mission in support of Foal Eagle and not a response to North Korean threats. The Pentagon\u2019s decision to send only two Raptors to South Korea appears to be Washington\u2019s attempt to cultivate a razor-thin balance between demonstrating America\u2019s commitment to regional allies and limiting the potential for provoking a confrontation with Pyongyang. This deployment is the fourth time the US has deployed F-22 Raptors to South Korea and it appears these two aircraft are now being used primarily as a centerpiece in a static display.\nSailing out of its berth in Hawaii on 23 March, the US Military Sealift Command\u2019s Sea-based X-Band Radar vessel (SBX-1) embarked on what the Department of Defense (DoD) claims to be routine sea trials, but is believed to be enroute to the Pacific as additional radar defense to counter potential North Korean missile launches. The SBX-1\u2019s active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar is mounted on a Russian-built fifth generation CS-50 twin-hulled semi-submersible drilling rig designed to function in the type of adverse conditions often encountered in ocean operations.\nA US land-based X-Band Radar system, positioned in northern Japan, has been operational since 2006 and a second installation is scheduled to be emplaced in central Japan soon, but is not likely to be fully functional for several more months to come. The land-based systems have been tasked with monitoring missile launches in the region, but lack the mobility of the SBX-1.\nThe SBX-1 is part of the US Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) project and forms a vital link in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The SBX-1 can locate, identify, and track suspicious missiles at a range of 4,700 kilometers while feeding targeting data to land-based and seaborne anti-missile batteries. Traveling at an average speed of nine knots, it takes approximately 16 days for the SBX-1 to reach the western Pacific.\nThe USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) is also believed to be prowling the waters of the region after completing a training mission as part of the Foal Eagle exercise.

{"idx": "27414", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Looks like* Rock Band* isn't the only thing Harmonix has up their sleeves: today, a rhythm game for iPod made by the MIT music geeks showed up on iTunes. Phase, which sells for $5, leans heavily on the company's past work to create a music title that works with the small screen and limited controls of Apple's player.\nSimilar to the recently released Musika, Phase creates game data from any song you choose on your iPod. But Harmonix's game actually turns your music into a rhythm-based game in which you press buttons in a pattern to the beat of the song.\nIn that way, it differs from Musika. That game's creator Masaya Matsuura told Wired at the time that while they were technologically able to create rhythm-based gameplay on the iPod, \"the player can't concentrate on gameplay within a mobile environment... if they concentrate to play a very strict type of rhythm-based game, it would be too much.\"\nHarmonix would seem to have no such worries \u2013 or if they do, they weren't enough to steer them from creating a rhythm game. Phase is quite similar to all of the company's past efforts: the 3D musical interface that shows the notes you must press looks identical to Frequency, and Guitar Hero for that matter. The game plays just as you'd expect \u2013 when the green notes hit the bottom of the line, you press the appropriate button (the left and right sides of the click wheel, and the middle button).\nThere's one other input \u2013 when you see the blue lines of tiny dots, you run your finger over the scroll wheel gradually to sweep them all up. Do well on each section that the songs are split into, and you'll earn points and Stars (with graphical shorthand straight out of Rock Band) that measure your score; miss too many notes and you'll lose the Hearts that keep you alive.\nIt's not an especially complicated interface, but the addition of the sweep commands mean that you do have to practice a little to adjust. A variety of songs are included in the game (including one from friend-of-Game|Life Jane Pinkard's band), but the real appeal is of course using your own tracks to generate the game's levels.\nBut this is where things get a bit tricky. Before you can do anything, you'll have to upgrade to iTunes version 7.5. Why? Because Phase doesn't generate tracks on the fly. When you download it, a new Playlist will appear in your iTunes window on your PC, and you have to individually drag tracks over to it. ITunes will then analyze and generate gameplay data for each track individually, which takes five to ten seconds per song (you'll see the progress bar).\nHaving done that, you'll need to re-sync your iPod, making sure you sync Phase and the playlists. If the stars align correctly, you should be able to load up Phase and get playing, either choosing individual songs or a Marathon mode that gives you a series of increasingly difficult tracks.\nBut how does it play? Quite well, considering the limitations of the iPod. The three-key gameplay patterns are rendered rather well; playing \"Highway Star\" I was sometimes surprised by how naturally the patterns matched up to what was going on in the music. The iPod's controls rarely failed me either on the rhythmic pressing or the sweeps.\nPlaying the game on the hardest difficulty level is pretty hard \u2013 I didn't win any of the songs I tried on it. The patterns get complicated, and since the patterns are generated proced"}

Two years ago the IMF also called for fiscal stimulus. Today, the Financial Times concurs with the IMF that high public debt levels are a major risk, and could have disastrous consequences.\nLest we forget, two years ago the Financial Times and a number of experts called for policymakers to consider helicopter money\u2014a fiscal expansion directly and permanently financed by central bank money creation\u2014a truly desperate policy measure for desperate times.\nTwo years ago, the IMF forecasted average global growth for 2018-2021 of 3.8%. Today it forecasts\u20263.8%.\nWith the same global growth outlook, two years ago we were told that governments would be crazy not to leverage to the hilt in additional public debt, and today we are told that governments have been crazy not to reduce public debt. With the same growth outlook.\nIt appears that we have learnt to stop worrying and love austerity.\nI suspect this happened because of two misguided biases in the economic policy debate.\nThe first is that anything the current U.S. Administration does attracts immediate outsized criticism: if it chooses fiscal stimulus, then fiscal stimulus is bad, period. This attitude is irresponsible: credible economic analysis should be honest and consistent, not partisan.\nThe second is an unshakeable headline-grabbing pessimism. In 2016 global growth was \u2018too slow for too long\u2019; today it is \u2018cyclically stronger but structurally fragile\u2019, to use the IMF catchphrases. When the IMF admitted in January that we are experiencing the strongest and broadest synchronized upswing since 2010, with U.S. business confidence at record highs, I thought they would let us enjoy these good economic times for a while. Clearly not.\nThis belated rediscovery of the virtues of fiscal rectitude should certainly be celebrated\u2014even if reached for the wrong reasons. It can allow us to finally focus on the real drivers of economic growth. Durable strong economic growth, the kind that lifts average living standards for a prolonged period, comes from investment, innovation and hard work. Here the latest IMF analysis does bring an important contribution with its focus on labor force participation, manufacturing employment, and the cross-border diffusion of technological know-how.\nThe next step should be to bring these issues front and center of the public debate on economic policy, in a common-sense way that everyone can understand.\nIn its latest litany of risks, the IMF highlights the surge in populism, which it blames on rising income inequality. Inequality certainly played a role\u2014though it is disingenuous to ignore how inequality has also been driven by Quantitative Easing (QE), which inflated asset prices (as the rich own a dispro"}

His pitches were sharp most of the night except for after a second delay of 14 minutes that caused pitches to escape the strike zone and load the bases.\nBefore the first delay began with one out in the sixth, Sabathia had struck out seven straight Mariners, one shy of the AL record.

Also unlike others working on no-hitters and perfect games, Sabathia said he knew since he was pitching from the stretch virtually all night.\nAfter softly getting the final two outs of the sixth, Sabathia maintained perfection by getting Ichiro Suzuki for his 12th strikeout. Then he reached his first 2-0 count and on the next fastball, Ryan lined it cleanly into left field for Seattle\u2019s first hit and first ball hit into the outfield since Ichiro lined out to center in the first.\nIt ended his longest stretch of perfection, surpassing the 17 straight he retired at Minnesota on Sept. 2, 2005.\n\u201cWithout the delays, there was no doubt in my mind, he was going to get a no-hitter,\u201d Eric Chavez said.\nSabathia continued mowing the Mariners down by getting Dustin Ackley for his 13th strikeout and setting a career high with his third strikeout of Miguel Olivo, who saw 12 pitches.\nA 14-minute delay halted play during the seventh inning stretch and when Sabathia returned for the eighth, he had his first three-ball count and second baserunner when Justin Smoak walked.

And this evolution is far from complete, for large areas of the human mind are still shrouded in darkness.\"\nWell, as one of my friends is fond of saying, there you have it.\nSuch dark thoughts arise in these dark international times because it\u2019s not always just the unknown, the unconscious, that is shrouded. A few years ago I was discussing nuclear armaments in the world with one of my hawkish friends. I argued in favor of on-going reduction to elimination of nuclear weaponry among the super powers as the first step to persuading less powerful nations to abandon their nuclear arsenals. It is unreasonable, hypocritical and impractical for any powerful nuclear armed kingdom to ask a weaker nation (India, Pakistan, Israel or those shadow nations lacking geographic boundaries or even coordinates that are presently terrorizing the world, for instance) to forego nuclear weaponry. I argued that it is always the powerful and strong who set the example by which the weaker model their actions and values. My friend the hawk, his memory of history as well as the foundation of his moral high ground shrouded in darkness, argued that weaker countries couldn\u2019t be trusted but that the U.S., morally superior to and the protector of the rest of the world, could handle being the possessor of superior levels of nuclear weaponry because, among other reasons, \"\u2026 we would never be the first to use the atomic bomb against another country.\"\nIn the context of a debate between friends, I enjoyed pointing out his invalid argument and reminding him that the U.S. already has been the first to drop an atomic bomb on another country\u00betwice; but that reminder and its larger point was disturbing, not at all enjoyable. His consciousness had completely blocked out the realities of history in the interests of a particular military/political and, in reality, economic belief system. My friend, an honest man, was good enough to rethink the point and recognize that perception and comprehension are more frail than any political/military/economic dogma would have us believe. None of us ever perceives anything fully or comprehends anything completely. One of the many problems with the linear path of thinking that comprises any dogma (religious, political, social, economic or even personal) is that it tends to ignore or relegate to insignificance or the realm of demons whatever won\u2019t fit on the line.\nHowever, lines are inherently narrow and, as Gertrude Stein observed so succinctly, \"There are no straight lines in nature.\"\nThis includes the nature of man"}

{"idx": "27431", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Growth of the Apple iPhone and Google's Android mobile platforms are cutting into the market for devices based on Windows Mobile and will continue to do so, according to a global survey of developers.\nThe survey, conducted by Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Evans Data Corp., found that fewer developers are using the .NET Compact Framework -- 33 percent, compared with 40 percent six months ago. But on a global basis, it is still more widely used than tooling for other mobile platforms including the iPhone, Android, Research In Motion's BlackBerry and even Nokia's newly acquired Symbian platform, according to the survey.\nA study based on the survey findings, released Monday, is the latest data point to suggest that Microsoft's aging Windows Mobile platform is suffering the effects of growth from rivals, notably the iPhone. Sales of the iPhone for the third quarter outpaced those of devices based on Windows Mobile, market researchers Gartner and IDC both reported in December.\n\"Is Windows Mobile going away? No, we don't think it's going away, but its growth has been abated by some of the new entrants in the market,\" said John Andrews, president and CEO of Evans Data.\nDespite the overall falloff, the study found that 40 percent more developers plan to target Windows Mobile than the iPhone, while 46 percent more expect to target the .NET Compact Framework than the Android platform. Many developers are awaiting Microsoft's widely anticipated refresh to Windows Mobile, which includes a release of Windows Mobile 6.5 to be followed by Windows Mobile 7.\nIndeed, some analysts believe Apple's accelerated growth over Windows Mobile may already be leveling. Apple last week said it shipped 4.4 million iPhones in the fourth quarter and it remains to be seen whether it still outsold devices based on Windows Mobile. \"My initial instinct is that Microsoft shipped more devices,\" said IDC analyst Ryan Reith.\nPlatform issues are being dictated by factors other than technology, the Evans Data study also found. Only 15 percent said the openness of the mobile platform was a key issue; revenue and marketing opportunities are driving decisions.\nThe study, which Andrews said was not sponsored by any specific vendor, is based on a survey of 400 developers, 60 percent of which are commercial while the rest enterprise. Given the proliferation of devices based on multiple platforms, no OS is likely to be dominant within enterprises, most analysts say.\nLess than 50 percent of enterprises even have formal policies for mobile application and device management, according to Philippe Winthrop, director of wireless research with Boston-based Strategy Analytics. \"While IT departments may prefer one platform over another, the reality is there continues to be individually liable purchasing of devices,\" Winthrop said.\nDespite cutbacks in IT spending, 94 percent of developers surveyed by Evans Data said mobile development projects will increase or at least stay on track.

The basic question posed by the case was whether the FCC had the authority to disregard what looked like a clear statutory command to treat Internet cable modems like a phone service. For broadband operators, being a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d in the words of the 1996 Telecom Act, basically means having a duty to let any ISP sell its services to your customers.\nTo summarize, the court decided Monday to let the FCC do what it wants, and that means deregulation. The FCC has been trying to deregulate broadband for almost a half-decade now, while it watches countries like Korea, Japan, and even Canada leapfrog the United States in broadband usage. The court today in essence says, \u201cOK, FCC, we don\u2019t really know a thing about broadband, so let\u2019s see if you can get us out of this mess.\u201d Carpe diem, or something like that.\nTwo things were sacrificed along the way to this result. First, the companies that are called \u201cindependent ISPs\u201d in the industry and \u201cAOL\u201d by everyone else, are left without much of a future. Already not the world\u2019s healthiest, these companies needed tighter rules to have a chance to sell ISP services directly to broadband consumers. Now the court has effectively cut their lifeline.\nThe second sacrifice is the coherence of administrative law. You might retort that administrative law was already incoherent. But after Brand X I think there may not be anyone who fully understands the doctrine of deference to agencies that the court calls the Chevron/Mead doctrine. The general idea is that Mead is supposed to determine, based on criteria no one understands, when an agency\u2019s decisions gets more (Chevron) or less (Skidmore) deference. Got that? Neither does the Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 opinion in Brand X just skips Mead altogether and also manages somehow to evade the textual commands of the 1996 Telecom Act. And just to show you how bad things are, Breyer\u2019s concurrence accuses Scalia of misstating, in dissent, the meaning of Mead, from which Scalia also dissented. It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so confusing. Thank goodness I don\u2019t teach administrative law.\nIn his dissent, Justice Scalia reprises a favorite role\u2014the principled textualist standing firm against consequence. His performance might be more convincing if he hadn\u2019t wholly abandoned that part when faced a few years ago with President Clinton\u2019s efforts to call tobacco a \u201cdrug delivery device.\u201d Both that case and Brand X were \u201cplain language\u201d cases, but only this time around does Scalia say that the plain language really does end the case.\nPolitically speaking, Brand X will have various consequences. With some of the skirmishing with independent ISPs out of the way, U.S. broadband deployment may actually speed up. Meanwhile, the decision will also increase the pressure on Capitol Hill and perhaps at the FCC for what are called \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d rules. Those are consumer-protections rules designed to prevent cable and DSL providers from blocking their customers from using whatever services or attachments they want\u2014think Voice over IP or Wi-"}

Wide array of file format and sharing options.\nMoleskine is essentially synonymous with notebooks, and the Moleskine Smart Writing Set ($199) brings the classic journal brand firmly into the twenty-first century. The Smart Writing Set is an analog-to-digital note-taking solution that consists of a Paper Tablet notebook, a Pen+ smart pen, and the free Moleskine Notes app. Similar to the Wacom Bamboo Spark, Moleskine's solution allows you to take physical notes on real paper with an ink-equipped pen and sync them to your phone or tablet. You can edit notes, transcribe handwritten words into digital text, and share files with yourself and others through a variety of apps and cloud services. The set boasts several advantages over the Spark, however, such as writing color options, automatic page detection, and a pen that takes standard ink refills. It's certainly a bit pricey, but all of these features add up to our Editors' Choice for digital note-taking devices.\nThe Paper Tablet looks a lot like your standard Moleskine notebook, the type you expect to see an artist hunched over, scrawling their latest idea in the corner seat of a caf\u00e9. It's a hardcover journal that measures 8.50 by 5.25 inches (HW), with an elastic strap to keep it closed. The design differs from a standard notebook in that the pages stick out about half an inch beyond the cover and have curved edges, which Moleskine says is meant to mimic the design of a tablet. Inside, the pages are covered in a dotted grid pattern embedded with technology that recognizes the smart pen's position on the page.\nUnlike the Bamboo Spark, which has a smart panel that can use any type of paper, the pages in the Paper Tablet are all firmly bound, and you can't swap in a regular sheet of paper and expect it to work the same. You get 173 usable pages in the notebook (counting the front and back pages), so you won't run out of room quickly, but you will need to purchase a new Paper Tablet ($29.95) when you do. The Spark is similar in size at 8.2 by 5.8 inches, but Wacom has some alternatives available as well. The Wacom Bamboo Slate is a clipboard-style device (we reviewed the larger 12.9-by-10-inch version, but it also comes in a smaller size).

Look in your average classroom and around one in five children are on free school meals. Look at your average Oxbridge lecture hall and that drops to 1 in 100. And we must never forget that this gap between poorer and richer children hurts everyone. Every parent knows that, when a handful of children can\u2019t keep up, it holds back the whole class. And when they can\u2019t fulfil their potential, it costs the whole country too. On one estimate, if these children could make the most of their abilities, if we brought the low performers just up to the average, by 2050 we could increase GDP by an estimated \u00a3140bn.\nThe odds can be beaten.

{"idx": "27452", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Does The New Math Add Up?\nMath education experts nationwide have hailed California's efforts to reshape the way its schools teach mathematics as a breakthrough in the push for higher standards. But the changes aren't going over too well with some of the people who might be expected to welcome them the most: parents.\nIn the past year, well-educated parents in at least nine communities around the state have formed grass-roots organizations to fight the program. They charge that with its emphasis on higher-level thinking, California has abandoned the basics. Their immediate objective is to halt the use of textbooks based on the latest version of the state mathematics frameworks, adopted in 1992.\nThe parents' concerns echo some of the recommendations made last fall by a task force appointed by state schools superintendent Delaine Eastin. The panel called for more basic-skills instruction but stopped short of recommending that the state abandon the frameworks' emphasis on higher-level thinking.\nThe state legislature passed a bill last year that required future state frameworks and instructional materials to stress, among other things, basic computational skills and testing of those skills. The process of adopting new state frameworks is scheduled to begin this fall.\nLeaders of the grass-roots groups support the state-level efforts to emphasize the basics but believe that process is too slow. \"Even if they make changes, we are looking to sometime in the next century before the consequences take shape,'' says Paul Clopton, a leader of a San Diego parents' group.\nIn the past year, publishing companies have begun issuing the first round of textbooks based on the California frameworks, which in turn rely heavily on the standards adopted in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The state frameworks, like the national standards, place greater emphasis on conceptual understanding, problem solving, and communicating about mathematical ideas.\nLast spring, parents in Palo Alto formed a group called Honest Open Logical Debate to oppose a middle school math curriculum based on the frameworks. Since then, groups have sprung up in San Diego, Santa Barbara, and at least seven other communities. Most of the parents making the noise are middle-class or affluent professionals, and they use e-mail and the Internet as tools in their highly organized campaign.\nThough the complaints have been loudest in California, the debate over math standards isn't limited to the West coast. \"It may have started there a little earlier, and the volume may be a little higher, but it is popping up everywhere,'' says Glenn Kleiman, a senior scientist at the Education Development Center, an educational research organization based in Newton, Mass. Similar battles, he says, are being fought in other states, such as Iowa and Texas. Like their counterparts elsewhere, parents in California believe their state's frameworks do not set clear goals and do not emphasize the need to learn and practice essential mathematical skills.\nFor Clopton, a statistician with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in San Diego, it all began one evening last fall as he watched his 7th grade daughter struggle with her homework. Her Algebra I class was using a new text grounded in the principles of the state frameworks. Although the girl was getting an A in the class, she made many simple errors, Clopton says. Not long after that, he, Mike McKeown, an engineer at the Salk Institute, and several other parents founded a group called Mathematically Correct and began lobbying the San Diego schools to abandon the program.\nWhen they learned that the district was preparing to adopt frameworks-based textbooks for the rest of the K"}

We are very worried about what the rest of the year holds,\" Piper said.\nPiper said around 140 aid projects by donors were destroyed, including more than 200,000 euros worth of EU investments, while some 600 people had lost their homes and about 2,000 their livelihoods.\nIn doing so, he said, Israel was forcing Palestinians away from some parts of the West Bank as more Israeli settlements appeared there, even though building them on the land Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East was against the law.\n\"The EU needs to reflect on its strategy and how it's going to respond ... This can't be left unaddressed. It's a provocation,\" Piper said.\nPiper challenged the Israeli military's justification for the demolitions, saying Israel did not give the Palestinians living there a real chance to obtain building permits.\nPiper said that, while there was much diplomacy going on behind closed doors, there was a need for more public statements on the matter, adding that the EU could also deploy diplomats to the sites affected to send a political message to Israel.\n\"We also need to talk about forms of seeking financial compensation or restitution by the occupying power,\" he said.\nThe 28-nation EU approved in March its first aid package for the Palestinian Authority in 2016, earmarking 252.5 million euros ($287.62 million) to help Palestinian refugees and develop health and education services, among others."}

He's helping Peruvians cultivate a healthy respect for marriage, fertility, and new life, through natural family planning.\nThe Mary Bloom Center, in the highlands city of Puno, near Peru's Lake Titicaca, is named after Fr. Bloom's mother. He began the center's work during his years as a Maryknoll priest associate in Peru, in conjunction with the Canadian lay missionaries Denis and Liane Bruneau.\nThey wanted their work to pass on what Mary Bloom taught her son about valuing \u201cmarriage, family, children, and faith in God.\u201d The center began in 1994, while Mrs. Bloom was still alive.\nShe died in 2000, but her legacy continues to inspire her son's efforts to promote authentic women's health care. Although he is now a parish priest in the state of Washington, he remains president of the center, and leads a group from the Archdiocese of Seattle to volunteer every year.\nWOOMB international, which teaches the Billings Ovulation Method of fertility awareness and natural family planning, has partnered with the center to educate married couples, as well as medical workers and young adults.\nFr. Bloom explained to CNA that the center's work began when Denis and Liane Bruneau introduced a local obstetrician and midwife, Luz Marr\u00f3n, to the Billings Method of natural family planning.\nMarr\u00f3n had been trained to \u201chelp\u201d women through conventional means of birth control, which pose serious health risks and can cause septic abortions. But she soon wholeheartedly embraced the natural methods that the Bruneaus showed her, and now serves as the Bloom Center's director.\nFr. Bloom teamed up with the Bruneaus, to give spiritual and moral grounding to their practical instruction. According to Fr. Bloom, many residents of Puno's rural villages understood the logic of natural family planning better than more educated and cosmopolitan Catholics elsewhere.\nFor the farming families of Puno, that understanding of cycles and fertility throughout nature \u201cled into the basics of the Billings method and how to use self-observation\u201d to observe fertility within marriage.\nWhile proponents of artificial contraception praise its apparent convenience, advocates of natural family planning point to the increased communication their method promotes between men and women. Circumstances in Puno allowed Fr. Bloom to observe this phenomenon in a remarkable way.\nThis family planning and women's health clinic is a far cry from other Peruvian organizations that might describe themselves in the same terms.\nFr. Bloom mentioned that other forms of artificial and dangerous \u201cfamily planning\u201d have received significant U.S. government funding, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Those methods, he said, are based on a mechanistic concept of the body, that strips sexuality of its meaning.\nFr. Bloom noted that no population could possibly stand to benefit from policies that treat fertility as a disease, and new life as an inconvenient byproduct. He explained that natural family planning, besides being practical, also expresses a larger \u201cphilosophy of life\u201d that affirms women as they were created.\nAlthough the Mary Bloom Center's primary purpose is to strengthen families by helping them appreciate and manage fertility, its donors and volunteers partner to meet a number of other needs among the population of Puno \u2013 including medicine, food, clothes, scholarships, and school supplies.\nJust as their concern for children goes far beyond safe birth, their work in women's health encompasses the broadest range of needs.

We still believe that games like Jurassic: The Hunted, Guitar Hero: Van Halen, James Cameron's Avatar: The Game and the like may be the most fruitcake-like releases of the last year or so, for they could easily be mistaken for other, better games, Kotaku readers had their own opinions.\nOne of the better suggestions was Wii game Wipeout: The Game, a title based not on the futuristic racing game series, but the TV game show. It's a title that could lead to some confusion and an unhappy Wii owner.\nNeed For Speed: Hot Pursuit for the Wii was also lumped in with the fruitcake crowd, a version that is not as beloved as its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterpart.\nAnother video game fruitcake that's not a video game at all is the Game Boat for Kinect Adventures. That's nothing more than an inflatable raft designed to complement the Kinect experience. Or cash in on it.\nSome readers said that simply getting Kinect at all would be on par with finding a fruitcake in your stocking. Many said that Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II would be the lowlight of Christmas morning, a stark contrast to the well-received original.\nSonic the Hedgehog games were mentioned, which is not a bad suggestion. How many fans of Sega's mascot will be unhappy to open what they thought would be a copy of Sonic Colors next month, only to discover Sonic Unleashed staring back at them?\nMost Kotaku readers were content to share their own gift receiving sob stories.\nReader HJSoulma tells this sad tale of parental game buying choices: \"For years and years and years I asked [my dad] for video games, and he never bought me any because he thought it was an unsavory hobby. Then like... part of the way through high school, around the time I just stopped asking people for presents, suddenly he started buying me every terrible video game ever made. I'm in grad school this year, and what did I get for my birthday? Sonic and the Black Knight. *siiiiigh*\"\nXazi2003's brother is intentionally malicious when it comes to gift giving: \"Well, my brother specifically got me one last Christmas on purpose. He walked into Gamestop, asked for the worst PS3 game they had and in return got Beowulf The Game to give to me.\"\nSome video game fruitcake receiving experiences have happy endings, though. \"In 2003,\" writes Cabamacadaf. \"I wanted [Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy] but I got Knights of the Old Republic. I was disappointed at first but then I played it and it was awesome.\"\nGift givers, take heed. Do not buy these games for people!\nKotaku readers, your continued suggestions are more than welcome."}

One-third of those children live in extreme conditions where some days they go hungry.\nAnd it\u2019s worse here than in most parts of the country. Missouri ranks fifth in the number of homes with unstable food supplies. Kansas comes in 12th.\nEducators and social workers see the faces of childhood hunger every day. The elementary school student in Kansas City, Kan., who tucks part of her lunch into her pocket so she can eat it that night. The teenager in Kansas City who, embarrassed, reveals that there\u2019s no food at home. The kid in Warrensburg, Mo., who asks every week if he, too, can get a Harvesters backpack of food for the weekend.\nSchools on both sides of the state line are feeding breakfast to a record number of children each morning. More kids are on free and reduced lunch, and their families rely on food pantries as if they were grocery stores. Teachers keep stashes of granola bars and crackers, knowing that a hungry kid is a distracted kid who struggles to learn.\nRelief workers, even churches and small towns, are doing what they can. But they\u2019re haunted by it not being enough.\nThat\u2019s why this holiday season The Kansas City Star has partnered with Harvesters to host a virtual food drive for hungry children. The goal is to raise money to support the BackSnack program, which provides weekend food to children in 269 schools across 26 counties.\nHarvesters estimates that 30,000 children in the six-county area need that food to tide them over to Monday, yet the agency can afford just 10,000 packs each week.\n\u201cThat\u2019s 20,000 children (in the metro area) we know who could use a backpack and aren\u2019t getting one,\u201d said Ellen Feldhausen, Harvesters\u2019 director of communications.\nIt\u2019s time, experts said, that communities realize no one agency, church or school district can feed all the hungry children.\nOver the next two weeks, as the food drive continues, The Star will share stories about kids who go to bed hungry and who get excited not about candy, but about a can of corn or a loaf of bread. One little girl\u2019s letter to Santa asked him to bring food.\nOther stories will show how communities, churches and regular people have stepped up to feed our kids.\nThe challenge is for more people to do the same.\n\u201cPeople talk about us being in the heartland, being the farmland of this country,\u201d said Jeanna Repass, director of Kansas City missions for Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, which is in its second year of a ministry to help feed the area\u2019s hungry children. \u201cWhen people used to homestead, whole communities would come out and raise a barn together. If someone had sickness, they helped with the crops.\nFeldhausen breaks down the numbers on the sheet of paper in front of her.

Yet the lies have been getting harder to tell, ever since Xi Jinping\u2019s police state embarked upon measures so extreme and tyrannical that it\u2019s become harder for the regime to keep the truth from getting to the outside world.\nHundreds of thousands of Uighurs , perhaps a million people in all, have been detained for weeks and sometimes months at a time in a network of indoctrination camps. At first, the Chinese government denied that the camps even existed. But as evidence has mounted \u2014 eyewitness accounts, the Chinese government\u2019s own documents, satellite photographs, construction blueprints \u2014 the party line has changed.\nChinese officials are now describing the camps as \u201cvocational education facilities,\u201d training centres and residential schools where petty criminals are housed while undergoing \u201crehabilitation and reintegration.\u201d Former inmates who have managed to escape China describe the camps as hellholes of torture and forced labour. Internees are required to learn Mandarin, sing patriotic songs, memorize government propaganda and recite florid loyalty oaths.\nXinjiang\u2019s Uighurs, Tajiks and Kazakhs have tended to see themselves as peoples apart from the Han Chinese cultural hegemony that the Communist regime has imposed in the region in recent years. Separatist sentiment has waxed and waned, and radical Islam has occasionally found a place for itself in the region. The Communist Party line is that extraordinary measures have been necessary to eradicate \u201cideological diseases\u201d in the region, particularly among the 10 million Uihgurs. Devout Muslims are classified as mentally ill.\nIn Xinjiang\u2019s towns and cities, population movements are closely controlled. Surveillance is ubiquitous. The Communist administration is employing biometric data, experimental voice-recognition and facial-recognition technology, house arrest, DNA data banks and digital tracking to closely monitor and control the public. Travel is severely restricted. Over the past two years, hundreds of thousands of special police have been deployed to newly-built stations and temporary checkpoints.\nAs grim as all this is, the gross human rights abuses in Xinjiang are at least beginning to emerge as subjects of closer global scrutiny. On Monday, in an unusual move, Michelle Bachelet, in her first speech as the UN\u2019s new High Commissioner for Human Rights, singled out Beijing\u2019s mistreatment of Xinjiang\u2019s Uighurs for special notice. The former Chilean president specifically referred to \u201cdeeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang\u201d.\nBachelet called on Beijing to reverse its closed-door policy and allow the UN Human Rights office complete access to Xinjiang and all other regions of China. That would be a good start.\nIn Washington, meanwhile, a bipartisan initiative in Congress has begun to push the Trump White House to \u201cswiftly act\u201d and trigger the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to sanction Chinese government officials and entities directly complicit in the Xinjiang abuses.

The Arizona Cardinals, for example, cut Tyrann Mathieu and turned around to sign Mike Glennon and Sam Bradford. The Indianapolis Colts decided to play it conservatively on the market despite droves of cap space.\nAs far as player movement, it was odd to see Jordy Nelson trade Green Bay Packers colors for the silver and black of the Oakland Raiders\u2014or Legion of Boom leader Richard Sherman ink a deal with the San Francisco 49ers.\nThese surprises manifest in different ways. The dark-horse outcomes entertain the most, based on a mixture of money, individual player preferences and misconceptions about what a team is or isn't willing to do.\nFor now, before the league plays the tag game, each of the top impending free agents has a viable dark-horse destination that will only make sense well after the transaction occurs.\nGiven the importance of the position and the scarcity of the upcoming free-agent class (the initial draft outlook doesn't look great either, but it rarely does in January), Teddy Bridgewater is bound to have a bigger-than-expected market.\nAfter all, his competition in free agency is Tyrod Taylor, Josh McCown, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Robert Griffin III, to name a few.\nOf those names, Bridgewater might be the only guy with franchise-passer potential. Before he suffered a brutal knee injury with the Minnesota Vikings in 2016, he completed 65.3 percent of his passes with 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 2015\u2014and he's still just 26 years old.\nBridgewater's proven production and franchise-passer upside should appeal to a team like the Washington Redskins, who have a clear need at quarterback.\nThe Redskins could be content to sit on their hands with Colt McCoy and Josh Johnson while praying Alex Smith can make it back. But boasting some of the league's best trench play on both sides of the ball, a strong running game and overall defense, the Redskins might decide to pursue a bidding war for Bridgewater's services. If nothing else, a new potential franchise quarterback could spark poor attendance numbers.\nWashington has been known in the past to splurge (remember Albert Haynesworth?). This move would make sense for a Redskins team that could then turn around and use premium draft assets on lacking skill positions such as wideout.\nIt seems obvious that Le'Veon Bell will land with a win-now team like the Indianapolis Colts or join a rebuilder like the San Francisco 49ers or New York Jets and bask in the glory of helping spur a turnaround\u2014not to mention cash.\nBut what about a return to the Pittsburgh Steelers?\nThe Steelers have plenty of reasons to make it happen, especially with the drama that surrounds Antonio Brown. James Conner faded over the second half of the season and isn't as dynamic a talent. Losing Bell and Brown in the same offseason would be a crippling blow for a team that is trying to win in the last few seasons of Ben Roethlisberger's career.\nESPN.com's Adam Schefter reported in November that the two sides made \"late pushes\" for a deal before the deadline.

Griffey Sr. is a prostate cancer survivor.\nMen Who Speak Up launched one year ago, but Bayer is constantly adding new elements to the ongoing campaign.\nIn the U.S., prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men. Bayer has made the disease a priority focus for its oncology franchise, which includes Xofigo, a treatment approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nMen Who Speak Up was born when Bayer, with the support of its AOR Cohn & Wolfe, approached leading oncology patient organization CancerCare to spearhead the formation of the International Prostate Cancer Coalition (IPCC).\nWith support from Bayer and its member organizations, the IPCC commissioned the International Prostate Cancer Symptoms Survey to learn how symptoms impact men and their loved ones. Over 1,300 men with advanced prostate cancer and caregivers across 11 countries participated, making this the largest known survey to date on advanced prostate cancer.\nBayer used these survey findings to build Men Who Speak Up.\n\"The primary goal of the campaign is to activate patients around the symptoms of advancing prostate cancer and amplify the critical need for a shift in the conversation taking place between patients and their doctors relative to symptoms,\" explained Steven Immergut, VP and head of communications, pharmaceuticals at Bayer. \"Early on, we made it clear that Men Who Speak Up should raise the collective voices of those living with and affected by advanced prostate cancer, including patients, caregivers, doctors, and advocacy groups.\"\nWith help from Cohn & Wolfe, Bayer sought to forge partnerships to raise publicity for the campaign, execute an effective social media campaign using branded channels, and engage a prominent influencer as a spokesperson.\nAfter the global survey fielding wrapped in mid-summer 2015, Bayer and the IPCC launched the survey results and campaign at an international media event at the European Cancer Congress (ECC) in Vienna.\nLast November, Bayer forged a partnership with American Cancer Society\u2019s Coaches vs. Cancer program, which involved Men Who Speak Up being named the title sponsor for a college basketball tournament. During the tournament series, Bayer delivered program materials directly to the patient community attending the games.\nTournament coaches mentioned the program in online promo reels, and courtside signage increased visibility among television and YouTube viewers.\nTo commemorate World Cancer Day on February 4, 2016, the PR team announced that Ken Griffey Sr. and his son Ken Griffey Jr. would be joining the campaign as spokespeople. This announcement included a PSA with advocacy partner Zero \u2013 The End of Prostate Cancer and embargoed stories in The New York Times and USA Today.\nIn addition, the announcement coincided with Griffey Jr. activating a \"takeover\" of the Bayer U.S. Instagram handle.\nThis summer, campaign efforts featured a satellite media tour featuring 28 TV and radio interviews with Ken Griffey Sr. and urologist Dr. Neal Shore -- both of whom shared their support"}

Last night, dozens of them gathered to plot strategies for giving money away, to those who need it.\nThis year, organizers did not wait for the annual campaign to begin; instead, they convened analysts and representatives from the charities a week before Thanksgiving. The campaign begins each year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Their goals were to raise more money and to make more of those who earn a living on Wall Street aware of the realities of poverty.\n''It's often said that the distance between Wall Street and 125th Street is much more than 10 miles, but we're trying to build a suspension bridge,'' said Philip Coltoff, the executive director of the Children's Aid Society.\nUnder one of the analysts' plans, that bridge would take their colleagues, via a van, out of the financial district and into neighborhoods where people worry about having enough food or enough money to pay the rent. They would tour the mobile health vans, homes for the elderly and day care centers that receive money from the Neediest Cases Fund.\nIt is meant as research-made-easy for men and women who often spend more than 80 hours a week investigating businesses before they advise their clients to invest in them.\n''I want to find out what these agencies really do, instead of just reading their literature,'' said Jonathan Hunnicutt, a 23-year-old analyst at Merrill Lynch.\nSo representatives from the charities aided by the Neediest Cases Fund explained their programs, and organizers explained that since The Times pays the fund's administrative costs, every dollar donated goes directly to programs serving people who need help.\nThe analysts, many of them Ivy League graduates wearing crisp shirts and shiny shoes, listened carefully and took notes as the directors of the charities told them about a working family of three who lived an entire year in a terminal at La Guardia Airport. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies helped that family establish a new permanent home in New York City.\nDavid Jones, director of the Community Services Society of New York, discussed his agency's efforts to help working single mothers who do not earn enough to support their families.\nIn recent years, Mr. Jones said, many of New York's financial executives have moved out of the city and channeled their charitable efforts into surrounding suburban communities, leaving needy city residents behind.\nLast night, though, after looking out over the assembled crowd in the Executive Amphitheater at the Salomon Smith Barney offices at 7 World Trade Center, he said he felt a surge of hope that the young analysts might follow the example of some legendary local philanthropists."}

When a family lives in an area dominated by one gang, it avoids going to an area controlled by a rival gang.\n\u201cThe control the gangs hold over their territories has never been so complete. It is without precedent,\u201d said Carlos E. Ponce, a criminologist and former adviser to the National Civilian Police.\nAs the gangs deepen connections with regional organized-crime groups involved in drug, weapons and human trafficking, they present a direct challenge to state control over the tiny Central American nation, Ponce said.\nThe chaos also provides an incentive for Salvadorans to try to flee north for the safety of the United States. Experts trying to explain the huge increase in children and teens who\u2019ve arrived in the United States say anecdotal evidence points at least in part to the hold that criminal gangs have in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\nAs insecurity extends across El Salvador, gang bosses reach for younger and younger kids to fill their ranks.\nIn Ilopango, a poor sprawling district southeast of the capital, the local government has set up programs to offer training to young people in driving and speaking English. But district authorities have found they have to duplicate some programs, one for areas controlled by the Mara Salvatrucha and another for Barrio 18 areas.\nHernandez said the two gangs had different clothing and hairstyles, even different vocabularies.\n\u201cIt sounds ridiculous but there are things that Mara Salvatrucha gang members won\u2019t say. They never say eight or 18,\u201d he said, for fear of referring to the rival gang.\nWhile flight to the United States might be one way people are trying to escape the violence, there\u2019s an ironic symmetry: El Salvador\u2019s gang problem has its genesis in the United States, from the time of the country\u2019s civil war, which also sent tens of thousands of Salvadorans fleeing to the United States.\nFor young people, that war _ which wracked El Salvador from 1980 to 1992 and left at least 75,000 civilians dead _ is ancient history. But by the time peace accords were signed, the gangs were on the rise, formed by gang members who\u2019d been deported from Los Angeles.\nSalvadoran leaders have tried different tactics to rein in the gangs, beginning with a 2003 program, known as \u201cStrong Hand\u201d and followed by \u201cSuper Strong Hand\u201d years later, that swept thousands of gang members into prisons.\n\u201cThe \u2018Strong Hand\u2019 program only attacked the gang members who were on the street. It filled the jails. But it didn\u2019t touch the leaders,\u201d Ponce said.\nIn 2012, the government _ with the help of the Organization of American States _ brokered a truce between leaders of the two gangs that edged the nation\u2019s homicide rate down from 12 killings a day to around five. But that truce fell apart earlier this year and homicides are back up. One recent weekend tallied 31 violent deaths.\nNow the citizenry widely ridicules the truce.\n\u201cMost people say it didn\u2019t do any good.

But Mr. Barbour earned their respect and even affection and was credited with heading off a number of crises in American-Israeli relations and smoothing over others.\nHe remained at the post through the Administration of President Johnson and, passing up an appointment by President Nixon as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, served three successive Administrations in one foreign country - no mean feat in a diplomatic world of ever-changing assignments and time enough to become intimate with most of Israel's wielders of power.\nHe played a quiet and unobtrusive role but did so with determination. Among his most taxing assignments was an effort to make Prime Minister Levi Eshkol understand how embarrassed and angry the Johnson Administration was at a retaliatory Israeli air strike on Beirut International Airport in late 1968. It had come just hours after the White House announced a decision to send Israel 50 modern warplanes.\nWalworth Barbour was born in Cambridge on June 4, 1908. A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard, he started his career with a vice-consulship in Naples in 1932.\nUntil after World War II Mr. Barbour concentrated on southern European and Mediterranean affairs, serving as political officer in Cairo during the war. He was posted as Minister-Counselor in Moscow in 1949.\nHe returned to Washington in 1952 to direct the Office of East European Affairs and later to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. He became Minister to London in 1956. It was from there that President Kennedy sent him to Israel.\nMr. Barbour, who avoided social functions when he could, was a bachelor who scheduled parties during visits by his sister, Ellen Barbour, so she could act as his official hostess. His sister, also a resident of Gloucester, is his only immediate survivor."}

On paper, retiring in style looks as easy as one, two, three -- save money, invest it, and reap the rewards.Simple, right?\nUnfortunately, it&apos;s rarely that simple. Unexpected expenses and that thing we call \"life\" often turn our straight road to retirement into a winding one full of speed bumps and hazards. You might buy a home, change jobs, get married, have kids, send those kids to college, or experience a death in the family. Life-altering events like these can affect your cash flow and your resolve to keep your retirement planning on track.\nStock market tips for retirement planning One of the most critical steps in saving up your \"retirement number\" is investing in the stock market. It may not be the first investment vehicle workers or pre-retirees turn to, considering the nearly 55% drop the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered between 2007 and 2009. However, over the long run, the stock market has significantly outperformed inflation, as well as other investment tools such as CDs, money market accounts, bonds, and precious metals like gold.\nThat said, here are a few important stock market tips for retirement planning that you should implement in order to keep your retirement on track.\n1. Accept that the stock market moves in both directionsEven though the stock market has been proven to be one of the best wealth-creators on the planet, it doesn&apos;t move in a straight line. Recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle, and it&apos;s important for investors to dissociate their emotions from their investing decisions. In markets both good and bad, our instincts and emotions can be our worst enemy. Take the financial crisis of 2008-2009 as an example: Investors who panicked and sold at the market&apos;s lows realized huge losses, while those who held on to their investments and weathered the storm have since enjoyed several years of gains.\nAs an investor, you can&apos;t control where the stock market heads next. Accepting this fact is the first step on the path to a financially secure retirement.\n2. Think long-termThe stock market works best for investors who hold companies over the long term. It&apos;s impossible to predict stock market tops and bottoms with any consistency, even if you have moments of success from time to time. Just missing out on a handful of the stock market&apos;s most robust gains can cost you dearly over the course of decades.\nAccording to data from Edward Jones, if you had stayed invested for the full 10-year period from Dec. 31, 2004 to Dec. 31, 2014 -- which includes the Great Recession -- you would have earned an annualized return of 7.6%. However, if you had missed just the 10 best days of that decade, you would have earned a paltry annualized return of 0.5%. If you had missed the best 20 and 30 days, you would have suffered losses of 3.7% and 7.2%, respectively.\nInstead of timing the market, to use a Warren Buffet-ism, buy stocks as if the market were going to be closed for the next five or 10 years.\n3. Seek out dividend-paying companiesOnce you&apos;ve accepted that you can&apos;t control the stock market and that your best bet for success is to hold over the long"}

The city now accounts for about one-third of India\u2019s total bulk drug production, or the chemicals that go into making a drug.\nAvailability of trained manpower, especially in chemistry and active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing, good ecosystem of talent, infrastructure, funding agencies and public infrastructure are chiefly the reasons behind Hyderabad\u2019s dominance in the pharmaceutical sector.\nThe city is also among the favourite destinations of information technology (IT) firms.\nAndhra Pradesh, of which Hyderabad is the capital, has the fourth largest IT sector in the country, largely due to government sops, infrastructure facilities and availability of a large talent pool graduating from its record number of engineering colleges.\nIt is not surprising, then, that the state attracted investments worth Rs25,173 crore in 2006-07, second only to Gujarat and surpassing Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, according to a August report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\u201cAndhra Pradesh has vast opportunities to attract additional investments of Rs10 lakh crore by 2012,\" says Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, or Assocham.

Prasad, vice-chairman and CEO of Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, India\u2019s second largest pharma company by revenue.\nPrasad says the cost of setting up infrastructure is a major deterrent, and the lack of support from the administration and its inability to solve issues arising out of archaic legislation, such as land ceiling Acts, are a threat to the industry. Andhra Pradesh needs to take advantage of the opportunities that the pharmaceutical industry offers to the growth of its economy and development through setting up of industrial corridors, industrial parks and special economic zones with good hard and soft infrastructure, he adds.\nIn its biannual industry survey from October 2007 to March 2008, CII\u2019s southern region has expressed concern for the state\u2019s pharma industry. \u201cPoor quality and irregularity of power, besides inadequate supply of diesel to run power generators, affect the industry\u2019s performance. The delay in processing of duty drawback claims is concerning especially small manufacturers,\" CII said.\nThe IT sector in the state, though, is largely content with the government policies and the pace of development in Hyderabad.\n\u201cThe region has many premier engineering institutes and management schools which assures IT companies of the availability of a sizeable talent pool. The city is also developing at a fast pace. The physical infrastructure available in Hyderabad is much superior to that of other IT happening cities in India,\" says G.

Work zones are estimated to contribute 10 percent of all congestion in the United States. According to the FHWA, as congestion builds within and approaching work zones, crash rates increase. Additionally, the safety of workers in work zones is of primary importance. Roadway workers are killed at a rate nearly three times as high as other construction workers and eight times higher than general industry workers.\nThe need for continued focus on work zone safety becomes more apparent because of the current emphasis on system preservation rather than construction of new facilities. In 2000, the share of capital funds used for system preservation was 52 percent and this percentage is expected to continue to rise. Thirteen percent of the National Highway system is under construction each year, during the peak summer work season (Wunderlich and Hardesty, 2003). This section provides information on the various countermeasures that have been effective in addressing work zone collisions. Working with safety practitioners will be important in choosing the most effective approach.\nSingle-vehicle crashes accounted for one-half of all work zone fatal crashes.\nAlcohol was involved in 39 percent of fatal work zone crashes in 2003 (National Work Zone Safety Information Clearinghouse).\nDesign future work zone capacity into new or reconstructed highways and make work zone considerations an explicit tradeoff on decision-making for new construction and reconstruction (T, $$$$).\nImprove visibility of work zone personnel and vehicles (varies, $$).\nImprove work zone safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and heavy-truck drivers (T, $$$).\nFrequent and visible enforcement is generally accepted as highly effective in gaining compliance with traffic laws and regulations in work zones.

This university hosts a wide variety of up-and-coming musicians on the cusp of breaking through. Use this list as a roadmap of sorts for navigating the musical maze of both the school and the city.\nWith winter raging on, you need to stay warm. This is where Jesediah\u2019s \u201cStove On\u201d comes in handy. The track is smooth and bouncy, filled with crisp synths and punchy percussion. A junior in the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Jesediah (also known as Jesse Sgambati) has been on a roll recently, accumulating both listeners and clout. His raps come off effortlessly and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s got something to prove. When chilly weather hits hard, listen to Jesediah\u2019s instructions and keep that \u201cStove On.\u201d His other tracks like \u201cG.O.A.T.\u201d and \u201cLonzo\u201d are also definitely worth checking out. Be sure to keep an eye out for his live performances around the city. The rapper brings an infectious intensity to the stage that can\u2019t be missed.\nElectronic music maestro and sophomore studying Music Business at Steinhardt, Pedro Ca\u00f1as is back at it with a brand new track, \u201cUpscale Horror.\u201d Ca\u00f1as has been releasing music left and right as of late. This track serves as not only a follow up to his recently released \u201c16-bit//POW-r2\u201d EP, but a precursor \u201cJust You,\u201d to his upcoming project and biggest release to date, which drops on Feb. 15. \u201cUpscale Horror\u201d is an undeniably brutal tech house tune, but in the best way possible. It\u2019s a driving machine composed of metallic synthesizers and clanky percussion. Ca\u00f1as\u2019 sample choice also serves to bolster the tune\u2019s dark and brooding nature. This track might not be for the kids, but it\u2019s most certainly fit for the dance floor.\nAlso cooking up some heat is Master Swami (also known as Marcus Harley), a junior in the Silver School of Social Work. Coming through with consistent releases, his persistence and presence has quickly become hard to miss. Swami\u2019s latest offering is titled \u201cM\u00c5D\u201d and is proof that the man refuses to be stopped. The sample-heavy beat is vibrant. His lyrics bounce confidently off the kicks and are full of variety both in their pacing and content. With tracks like these, Swami is without a doubt an artist to watch. As Master Swami continues to put out music, his progression is both evident and hard to ignore.\nFor the more pop oriented, Julian LaMadrid, a sophomore in Tisch Performance Studies, won\u2019t disappoint. Another artist in relentless pursuit of success, LaMadrid is a 19-year-old singer from Dubai who already has a catalogue of Billboard worthy bops. His most recent offering is the single \u201cWarm.\u201d The tune is filled with a dreamy keyboard melody woven with a hyponic beat.

Here in the region that perfected drive-through banking, drive-in restaurants and drive-by shootings, people do almost everything with their cars.\nEverything, that is, except park them.\nBy the millions, Southern Californians routinely leave that task to others. In a city where the phrase ''service economy'' is taken for granted, valet parking thrives, and not just at restaurants, hotels and airports, where the service is increasingly popular around the country. Here you can leave the keys with Jeeves at hospitals and mini-malls, movie theaters and grocery stores, the occasional Starbucks and at least one gym, not to mention practically every fancy private party for 20 people or more. The Yellow Pages features 45 listings for Parking Attendant Service.\n''Angelenos are lazy,'' said Chuck Pick, owner of Chuck's Parking Service, who has been parking cars for 40 years and provides valet service at special events for his third generation of Hollywood society. ''No, not lazy,'' Mr. Pick quickly amended himself. ''Service-oriented. But when I ever write a book, it's going to be how people lose their feet and legs when they go to a party. Suddenly, they can't walk.\nTo be fair, there are so many cars in greater Los Angeles, and so many neighborhood parking restrictions, that valet parking is often the most efficient way to cram cars into a limited space. This is, after all, a city that had more than one car for every two residents as early as 1925, and where married couples still invariably arrive at workday movies or restaurant dates in separate cars and where the affluent often provide separate station wagons just for their nannies.\n''People have grown to accept and expect it,'' said Herb Citrin, 77 and the chairman of Valet Parking Service. Mr. Citrin pioneered the industry here beginning in 1946 when he opened the parking concession at Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills, which he still serves today, along with about 60 other restaurants and hotels like the Regent Beverly Wilshire, plus the Burbank Airport. Mr. Citrin's business has 1,600 employees, many of them recent Hispanic immigrants, who earn an average of $6 to $7 an hour.\n''Today, it's a major, major necessity,'' he said.\nIn fact, valet parking is so common that drivers of $70,000 luxury cars who would not entrust them to their own teenagers routinely hand them over to complete strangers, and sometimes assume that restaurants offer the service, even if they do not. At the Grill in Beverly Hills, the reigning power-lunch place for agents and moguls, there is no valet stand at lunch, because parking is so tight at that hour in Beverly Hills that it would cost the restaurant too much.\nMost restaurants charge about $3.50, plus tip, for valet parking. On the other hand, even nonvalet parking in downtown office towers can easily cost four to five times as much.\nIn scores of places, though, valet parking is free for at least two hours, as it is in several municipal and merchant-sponsored lots in Beverly Hills.

Neighbors use the site to announce garage sales, lost dogs, and local political happenings.\nOver the course of July, South Park residents used the site to trade information about a spate of brazen bike thefts and attempts that followed a similar pattern: a suspect would enter a backyard or garage, often during daylight hours, take a bicycle, then abandon a smaller or older bicycle nearby. On some occasions, the alleged thief would return to the same home the next day to recover the abandoned bike, or steal another.\n\"Apparently he's switching bikes all over the place,\" said one neighbor who got involved in tracking the suspect's actions. She says she spotted him in front of her house, peering into her parked car. When she confronted him, he reportedly said \"I didn't take anything. Your windows were down but I didn't take anything.\"\nA second neighbor said she heard a noise from her garage around 11 p.m. one recent night. \"I opened the kitchen door and he had my bike, and dropped it when I yelled,\" she said.\nAnother said, \"I was gardening when I first noticed there was a bike on its kickstand in front of my house.\" When he noticed the bike was still there hours later, he decided to put it in his garage until he could determine who it belonged to. \"That's when I noticed my own bike was gone,\" he explained.

Since authorities brought charges against him, Visinescu says people in the street have shoved him to the ground and called him a criminal. He has pleaded not guilty and calls himself a scapegoat.\n\"I only followed orders. They should ask those that gave the orders,\" he told the AP on Friday. \"I am convinced they will do anything to take revenge.\n\"Why didn't they put me on trial in 1964?\" when the political prisons closed \"or after (Communist leader) Nicolae Ceausescu died? Why now?\"\nHe contests the number of deaths that prosecutors say happened under his command and denies mistreatment happened under his command that led to prisoners' deaths. The word \"criminal\" is scrawled on the outside wall of the building where he lives in a shabby one-room apartment, full of old photographs of him in uniform and as a young boy. Born into a family of peasants, Visinescu said his father died the year he was born.\nHe seems more resigned than he was a year ago when he cursed and lunged at reporters after hearing charges against him and says he expects to go to prison. Another former prison guard was charged in 2000 with aggravated murder, but died before his trial could get underway.\nFormer ministers, diplomats, army officers, farmers, priests and workers considered a threat to the Communist regime were locked up in prisons from 1948 to 1964. Historians say one-fifth of the 500,000 who were incarcerated died. Bjoza says there were 40,000 political prisoners when communism ended with only 3,000 alive now.\nFormer prisoner Valentin Cristea, who was incarcerated in Ramnicu Sarat while Visinescu was commander, communicated by Morse code in the grim lockup where prisoners were mainly kept in solitary confinement and banned from communicating.\nCristea, 84, said he learned that the inmate in the neighboring cell, former army officer Jenica Arnautu, had gone on hunger strike to protest mistreatment, was being force-fed with a tube down his throat. In November 1959, three days after the tapping on the wall stopped, Arnautu, who was 36, died, Cristea said in an interview from his home in Campina, 50 miles north of Bucharest. Visinescu denied knowledge of the case.\nProsecutors say 14 people died under Visinescu's command, and said corpses showed signs of malnutrition according to doctors who signed the death certificates"}

The dispute involved the rights of public-sector unions to charge nonmembers fees to cover the cost of collective bargaining \u2014 something they will now continue to be able to do in states that permit it.\nUnions already had begun to prepare for an adverse decision after oral arguments in January. During those arguments, several justices, including Antonin Scalia, showed a willingness to hold that the mandatory fees violated the First Amendment rights of teachers who disagreed with their union. The court appeared on the verge of ruling that collective bargaining itself was an inherently political activity that nonmembers could not be forced to subsidize.\nWhile the identities of the justices on each side were not revealed in the ruling, the outcome suggests that as the result of Scalia's unexpected death last month, government-employee unions narrowly escaped a ruling that had the potential to cripple their finances and reduce their impact on the political scene.\n\u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession,\u201d said National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, whose union represents about 3 million teachers.\nThe result could also have an immediate effect on the standoff between President Barack Obama and Senate Republican leaders over filling Scalia's vacancy. The case is the first high-profile one since Scalia's death in which the court announced it was equally divided, which is certain to fuel the arguments of Democrats and the White House that the GOP stance is causing some gridlock in the legal system.\n\"Today\u2019s divided ruling from the Supreme Court establishes no national precedent while leaving open the possibility that the issue will come before the court once again,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. \"Such an outcome only emphasizes the importance of a court that can operate with a full complement of nine justices that can resolve important legal questions from lower courts once and for all.\"\nBut some Republicans continue to say the court can function just fine with a panel of eight, according to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cWhen you consider that two judges have said that we\u2019ll be able to operate with eight people, and when you consider the fact that [Associate Justice Elena] Kagan has had to recuse herself on a third of the cases before the Supreme Court because she was solicitor general, I think it proves that the court is going to be able to operate,\" he told POLITICO after a town hall meeting Tuesday in Iowa.\nGrassley also said that moving on Obama's nominee \u2014 D.C.

As if being the world's biggest exporter of oil was not enough, the desert kingdom is now looking to conquer the refining sector, as it has quickly become the fourth largest refiner in the world.\n\"Saudis have moved into the product business in a big way,\" said Fereidun Fesharaki of FGE Energy. With Saudi Arabia's refined fuel contributing to the global supply glut, what will be its impact on the refining markets especially those in Asia.\nHow will Saudi Arabia Capture Market Share Downstream?\nGross refining margins measure a refinery's success. The gross refining margin is nothing but the difference between the value of the refined products and price of the crude oil. In case of Saudi Arabia, the price of crude oil would be extremely low. \"The crude is so cheap it's pretty much free for them, the margins are going to be massive. It makes trade flows in products very different,\" said Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects.\nThere is little doubt then as to why the Saudis are shifting their focus to domestic refining. Along with acquiring a controlling stake in Korea's S- Oil, the desert kingdom is commissioning a new refinery in Jizan that would have a capacity of around 400,000 barrels per day when it begins operations in 2017. Jizan will come on top of Saudi Arabia's two other 400,000 bpd- refineries at Yasref and Yanbu, and will turn the country into a major global player in the downstream sector, expanding its campaign for market share beyond just crude oil.\nIs Saudi Arabia likely to win a potential price war against Asian producers of diesel?\nBy offering almost 2.8 million barrels of low-sulphur diesel to Asian and European markets, the Saudis are directly competing with Asian refiners, potentially sparking a price war. In fact, at $5.60 the Asian refining margins have fallen by almost 50 percent from June this year and expect to drop by a further 30 percent.\n\"We see refining margins weakening on worsening diesel fundamentals, particularly east of Suez, though gasoline should be supportive. A lot of diesel will be trapped in the Far East and this will lead to run cuts in places like Japan and South Korea as the arbitrage to the west will be closed by growing Middle Eastern supplies,\" said Robert Campbell of Energy Aspects.\nOn the other hand, it will not be easy for Saudi Arabia \u2013 Chinese refiners are also producing more gasoline, for which demand is still strong. Moreover, Indian refiners are now moving away from Saudi Arabia, that was previously India's largest crude oil supplier. Indian refiners are now buying more crude oil from Nigeria, Iraq, Venezuela and Mexico. As a result, it forced Saudi Arabia to offer discounts on its heavy and sour grade of crude oil to its Asian customers.\nStill, Saudi Arabia can likely wait out the competition. Just as they have kept their crude oil production levels intact, it is possible that the Saudis will maintain their current refining output in spite of falling refining margins and eventually end up winning the price war against Asian producers.\nHowever, one cannot easily neglect the Indian and Chinese refiners. Let us consider the case of Indian private refiners Essar and Reliance, which are among the most complex refineries in the world (refineries that are capable of processing"}

According to Clemson associate athletic director Graham Neff, the policy insures approximately $1.25 million but includes a $215,000 premium and a $425,000 deductible.\nClemson could exceed the deductible before the midpoint of the basketball season. If the football team reaches the College Football Playoff semifinal for a fourth consecutive season, Swinney will earn a $200,000 bonus. Each of his 10 assistant coaches will receive $50,000.\nThe insurance policy would cover any remaining bonuses, up to $800,000.\n\"Obviously, it's impossible to project what our actual payout will be, but the insurance gives us a way to cap our exposure,\" Clemson associate athletic director and CFO Eric George said. \"We know our maximum cost will be the premium amount plus the deductible, and we can use that figure as we plan the rest of our departmental budget.\"\nClemson purchased a similar policy before the 2016 season, but only for football. It saved the department $1.3 million in bonus payments after the Tigers won the national championship.\nClemson did not secure insurance last season. Swinney earned $400,000 for winning the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and reaching the Playoff. Men's basketball coach Brad Brownell earned $80,000 for advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.\nClemson administrators included men's basketball in the insurance policy this season, after agreeing to a six-year, $15 million contract with Brownell.\nIf the football and basketball teams rise to last season's watermark, Clemson would owe $1.2 million in bonuses to both staffs. However, only $937,500 of that total would be insured.\nThe policy Clemson purchased this season does not cover the football team's achievements outside the Playoff. Bonuses offered for winning the ACC and reaching a non-CFP bowl game are not included.\nSwinney could also earn another $75,000 for winning ACC and national coach of the year awards.

I met this former Professor of History, who was attached to the Colombo University in the eighties, when he was holding the post of Education Officer at the Commonwealth Secretariat in London.\nProf. Perera had taken an interest in Sinhala culture and the language from the time he was an undergraduate at Peradeniya University. Having identified the traditional history of the Sinhala language dating back to the 9th century, he became mindful of the fact that the Sinhala language had been in touch with and influenced by \u2018Vedda\u2019, the original language of the pre-Aryan population of Sri Lanka (Veddas).\nI managed to \u2018pick his brains\u2019 on the history of teaching the Sinhala language in London at the SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies of the London University), which dates as far back as the beginning of the 20th Century where many Sinhala scholastic mentors had taken their turn to pass on their knowledge to post and under-graduates who showed an interest in the Sinhala language in England.\nDr. D.M.D. Wickremasinghe who took the initial plunge, between 1916 and 1932, to visit England to teach Sinhala has been regarded as \u2018the grandfather of teaching Sinhala in the UK\u2019. He has been succeeded by Prof. M.D. Ratnasuriya till 1944. A line of lecturers such as Dr. C.E. Godakumbura (1944-47), M.B. Ariyapala (1947-1950), P.E.E. Fernando (1950-53), E.W. Adikaram and P.B.S. Wijeratne (1932 \u201d 1933) and 1944 \u201d 1946) etc.\nAttracted by the rich literature spinning over one thousand years, an Englishman by the name of C.H.B. Reynolds mastered the Sinhala language. He subsequently became an expert and took over the responsibility of teaching the language from Sinhala lecturers who arrived in the UK as visiting lecturers at the SOAS. Consequently Reynolds spent a considerable amount of time (from 1953 to December 1987) discharging his committed duties until his retirement.\nTeaching Sinhala at the SOAS has always been associated with Pali and Theravada Buddhist studies. Pali and Theravada are still a living academic and religious tradition in Sri Lanka. For staffing considerations, however, SOAS had to link Pali and Buddhist studies on a \u2018half-post\u2019 basis with Burmese.\nUnlike students in Sri Lankan universities those who were studying at the SOAS had the opportunity to reach and study within the context of linguistic methodologies applied to a wide range of Asian and African languages. Nowhere in the world was the study of Sinhala done to the same extent as in the SOAS within the broad spectrum of linguistic studies, especially to a greater advantage of scholars from Sri Lankan universities.\nThe sudden decision to cutback in universities in the UK, coinciding with the impending retirement of C. Reynolds in 1987, showed the way to the proposal of terminating the teaching facilities of Sinhala at the SOAS. This"}

Earlier, this week the news ran out that the startup providing data backup and recovery services at both cloud and on-place environments is likely to raise an investment around $150 million and $200 million.\nAccording to the sources, the round was led by the IVP which also includes Lightspeed and Greylock in the round. IVP is a big-name VC firm that backed certain major tech brands like Snap, Twitter, Slack, Domo, and Dropbox. The company co-founder Bipul Sinha says that the funding started to arrive after the company hit a $100 million run rate in the January of the current year. Rubrik has significant traction and they are trying to double up in order to capture the market demand they were experiencing.\nLast year, the company was $600 million when it raised the last round of $60 million investment. While the company is not profitable yet, it generates enough cash to fuel its growth. Bipul Sinha says that the company has not utilized the funds received in the last round yet and is getting strong interest from it. The company is now planning to utilize the funds on boosting up its marketing and engineering strategy.\nMainly, the data management startup\u2019s services run on the appliance that they use to back up, restore and index data. The company, earlier this week released a product that runs natively on cloud platform eliminating the need for the appliance. Sinha tells Techcrunch that this is exactly what shows the future direction of the company. He added that the company is tending to build more cloud-based products to excel their current work.\nRubrik has many competitors like Druva, CommVault and EMC but the giant got successful in pitching itself to the group of large enterprises. The chief reason behind it is its unique and efficient approach to an old problem. Rubrik, the data management startup has made a remarkable story for the people to look forward to an interesting field to choose for a start-up. Sinha being a person of VC-world was always looking for hunting subsequent opportunities in the market and here he is.\nThe company employs around 330 people currently and is counting 70 to 90 people more on-board in a quarter from now. It will expand largely in engineering and product, sales and marketing and customer support service. The advancement of Rubrik from starting as prospects to now converting almost 75% of them into paying customers is really surprising. With this speed of adoption, we have our eyes on the how would the company excel with the received funding."}

Her friend, who protested about the treatment, has her head shoved downwards by a second authorised officer, who tells a policeman attending the incident: \"I don't care, the skank's not getting another chance to spit on me.\"\nA year later, two youths at Springvale train station are repeatedly sprayed in the face with capsicum foam by Protective Services Officers after one of the youths tried to avoid paying a fare. One youth is charged with assault but, as ABC's 7.30 reported, a magistrate last month acquitted him after finding there was no evidence to support the allegation. Instead, the magistrate found some allegations and evidence presented to the court by one of the PSOs was false.\nThese aggressive responses by transport security officers have been shown, by the Victorian Ombudsman in the first instance and the magistrate in the second, to be indefensible. They were certainly grossly excessive given the risks posed, and they raise fundamental questions about the training of transport officers and the culture that permeates their ranks.\nThere is no doubt that officers who patrol the network, whether Metro's authorised officers or Protective Services Officers, face challenging circumstances in their duties. They are often faced with belligerent and occasionally physically hostile members of the public. But gratuitous force is neither an acceptable nor effective response. Indeed, as Ombudsman Deborah Glass says in her report published last week on the incident at Flinders Street, the use of excessive force serves to damage, not buttress, the public's confidence inthe transport system's officers.\nYet force remains \"a continuing feature\" of the relationship between transport officers and the public; Ms Glass notes Metro's authorised officers made 640 restraints on the Melbourne network last year, resulting in 11 reported injuries. The duty of authorised officers and PSOs is to reduce the threat to the travelling public and, in the case of authorised officers, to ensure the integrity of the ticketing system. There are a thousand ways to handle the myriad confrontations that might arise from petty ticket disputes but they should not involve violent take-downs unless there is a genuinely extreme and immediate threat to safety. Nor should transport officers resort to abhorrent and demeaning language in dealing with the public.\nThe focus, as the Ombudsman says, should be on defusing and de-escalating conflict. To that end, Ms Glass has made an important recommendation about which organisation should be responsible for training Metro's authorised officers. While Protective Services Officers come under the ambit of Victoria Police, authorised officers have until now been trained by the Department of Transport. The Ombudsman has recommended, and both the department and Public Transport Victoria have agreed, that PTV should conduct the training of authorised officers.\nWe suggest that, properly done, this may be a route to cultural change. At present, Metro's authorised officers resemble militaristic brigades that are itching to launch, puffed-up and pack-like, on minor transgressors. Their mere presence on trains and stations can serve to intimidate rather than reassure the public. But if PTV can train authorised officers to consider their primary duties as being the service, safety and comfort of customers, then the attitude that engenders anxiety and occasional confrontation with the public might end."}

Many online banks and credit card companies allow you to download recent transactions (checks, deposits, credit card charges.) into a file in the Quicken Interchange Format (QIF), so that you can import these transactions into your Quicken account. The problem with this approach is that typically the bank has no way of assigning meaningful categories to the transactions. So, if you care about categorizing your Quicken transactions, you must go through each transaction you have just imported in Quicken, and add categories. QIF Master automates this process. QIF Master also handles investment transactions. Although recent versions of Quicken for the Macintosh have allowed investment transactions to be downloaded into Quicken, in many cases the downloads are incomplete and sometimes wrong. An alternative approach is to use QIF Master to extract QIF from your investment firm's transaction history web page and import that QIF into Quicken. Investment information is not produced in QIF format by the investment firms; to get QIF you must use QIF Master to convert the transactions on the web page into QIF. QIF Master will also convert comma-separated value (CSV) files into QIF, and optionally produce its output as CSV or tab-separated values.\n\"Wouldn't convert QIF files into other, older formats.\"\nI wanted a program that would convert QIF files into formats compatible with Quicken 2005.

Who could have imagined hearing magazine vendors in New Delhi's Khan Market or in Colaba, Bombay, talking of a man from Hardanahalli? So they did, I assure you, when Hardanahalli Deve Gowda emerged out of the blue to wrest the crown of India. The man with thirteen heads!\nThe latest Newsweek puts Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the forerunner for the crown. Most opinion polls say so too. So will the golden Mont Blanc come out at Rashtrapati Bhavan again? Well, I wouldn't bet my last shirt on it.\nI'd still take a look at the most likely ones in the race, though there are so many of them that it is quite a menagerie. Even so, to begin with the remotest possibility, I would once again start off with Hardanhalli! He has never given up hope of winning back the crown, and I really like that.\nOne of the first questions one remembers being asked soon after Deve Gowda became prime minister was: 'Does a PM have to know what CTBT is?' It was a veteran MP who had asked the question, and for a moment I could not make out what he was talking about. It had taken me a while to understand what he was getting at: the prime minister did not seem to have the foggiest idea what CTBT was all about when he first encountered that abbreviation.\nBut the question arose: does a PM have to be a know-all? If so, why would he need so many wise ministers and mandarins to help him? Not a very fair question to ask, I had decided. 'Give the new man a little time,' I had said. Wasn't Deve Gowda himself saying all the time what a long way he had come -- from a petty PWD contractor to the country's top job?\nSure enough he would pick up, one thought, if he only tried. And could anyone say he was not trying? He was sleeping so little that he was falling off to sleep at quite the wrong places, at the wrong time. There was the story in a tabloid on the growing problem of sleeping: 'Sleepless in the Capital', screamed the headline and atop it, by way of illustration, was a picture of Prime Minister Deve Gowda snoozing away at a public meeting.\nOne had given full marks to the man from Hassan. The picture only showed how hard he was trying to be the prime minister of a problem-ridden country. One had thought the friend sitting beside him, the Marxist leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet, ought to have been more sympathetic to the man instead of smiling so sardonically. Which PM before him had so many masters to serve? And such bizarre men at that -- from Laloo to Surjeet to Ram Vilas to Mulayam to god knows who!\nThere was, of course, first the Sahib P V Narasimha Rao, to be kept happy, for not only was the entire Deve Gowda circus dependent on the old man's goodwill but there was also the personal gratitude he had to show to his former 'guru'. Without the blessings of the wily old fox, Hardanhalli could never have become prime minister.\nPoor Deve Gowda may want to be the prime minister again, for the job provides such great foreign junkets for the whole Deve Gowda clan, but does he remember how he was forever on the razor's edge?

During this time, I always found it rather interesting that the vast majority of organisations would invest millions of dollars into enterprise software marketed by the big three \u2013 Peoplesoft, SAP, and Oracle (before it bought PeopleSoft).\nAt the time, there was a constant stream of companies building business cases to make large investments in IT transformations.\nNow, these projects were not easy; they were often delayed or not delivered at all. This is not surprising given that enterprise software is a complex beast.\nBut things have moved on since those days of client/server computing. Everyone\u2019s moving to the cloud and delivering services to their highly mobile user bases.\nFor the most part, the likes of SAP and Oracle have struggled to keep pace with this change. This begs the question: Are these ERP dinosaurs on the road to extinction?\nThe release of the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens, reminds me that there\u2019s a new force that has woken up and we are now seeing a fresh class of apps that are attacking what was impregnable territory.\nVinnie Mirchandani discusses this in his 2014 book, SAP Nation 2.0: an empire in disarray. We are seeing pure cloud players such as Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday, and Ramco, taking on the ERP behemoths.\nWe\u2019ve reached a tipping point as these new cloud and mobile-enabled solutions \u2013 which operate \u2018capital free\u2019 at third-party cloud service providers \u2013 gain in popularity.\nMost enterprises started using cloud (to cut costs) and mobile (forced by BYOD). There also was a shift within these organisations towards customer experience and digitalisation.\nThis shift has been kick-started by many organisations that use cloud services for storage (through AWS and Microsoft Azure, etc) and CRMs such as Salesforce.\nThese are key core enterprise systems, not subsystems. Such change is not going to happen overnight as enterprises have made significant investments and are slowly depreciating old assets.\nBut there are compelling reasons to stop and look at an alternative world.\nClearly if you were starting a new business, you would have to think long and hard about using a dinosaur and instead start with one of the new breed of cloud apps.\nIt is not a point solution but a fully integrated \u2018platform-as-a-service\u2019 that provides rich functionality just like SAP and Oracle.\nWhere it starts to separate itself from the big boys is that it is also quicker to implement and cheaper \u2013 we are talking months not years of effort.\nBut for me the biggest factor was the design, which has mobility built in and it\u2019s not an add-on.

Between all Google features and the search giant's YouTube subsidiary, more than 90% of all internet searches are taking place through the company.\nAccording to Jumpshot (via SparkToro), a marketing analytics firm that licenses anonymous ClickStream data from hundreds of millions of users, about 62.6% of all searches online are through Google's core function.\nTogether, Google holds onto an impressive 90.8% market share of web, mobile, and in-app searches - though it should be noted that the above source does not include iPhone data at scale yet.\nHow does Google keep up such a massive market share, and why can't a real competitor in search emerge?\nThe answer has to do with platforms and apps. Google's strategy is to go where the users are, and to ensure that wherever they go, a Google search is not hard to do.\nOver a decade ago, this meant being the home page on every internet browser - but more recently, it's taken the form of internet browser market share (Chrome), mobile OS market share (Android), owning the dominant video platform (YouTube), and even venturing into your dwelling with Google Home.\nAs a result of these efforts, whenever users are searching, Google has never been far away.\nThere are competitors that dare to pluck away at Google's market share in search and ad revenue.\nMicrosoft's Bing is the most known one, and it has the advantage of being integrated into Microsoft products all over the globe. Meanwhile, DuckDuckGo is another name worth mentioning - the privacy-focused search engine doesn't have anywhere near the same kind of financial backing as Microsoft, but it does differentiate its product considerably.\nYet, here's a picture of U.S. search ad revenues. Bing is small, but others are smaller. DuckDuckGo doesn't even register.\nWhy can no one match Google?\nPart of the reason lies in the math. Google operates at an insane level, processing 3.5 billion searches per day. To get millions of people to try a different search algorithm is expensive - and to get them to keep that behavior permanently is even more expensive.\nThe only way such change becomes feasible is if a product comes out that is 10x better than Google, and at this point, such an event seems unlikely - at least in the current ecosystem."}

And the good news is that almost everyone invested in a pension will get something.\nWhether directly, or indirectly through a fund or other collective investment, it\u2019s almost certain most of us own a stake in Rio Tinto, Legal & General, SSE, Prudential, GlaxoSmithKline, Diageo, Barclays, Royal Dutch Shell (the largest company on the London Stock Exchange), and Lloyds Banking Group, the UK\u2019s most widely-owned share.\nThis is a strong reminder that London is home to some of the world's best income stocks. These blue-chip dividends are not only among the most generous, but they are also affordable and sustainable, easily covered by profits and cash flow from operations.\nThere have been question marks around Royal Dutch Shell. It paid a total of $15 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2016, but the plunge in oil prices from over $100 a barrel to below $30 hit profits. However, the oil major has not cut its dividend since the Second World War, and chief executive Ben van Beurden had been borrowing to maintain that record.\nBut, after buying BG Group and completing over half its target for $30 billion of asset sales, Shell did generate enough cash over the past 12 months to cover both the dividend and reduce debt.\nIt\u2019s also great to see Lloyds Banking Group and Rio Tinto back as serious income plays. Both have undergone major transformations following the financial crisis and collapse in commodity prices, and now yield 7% and 5% respectively.\nAfter a six-year break during the financial crisis, Lloyds has successfully repaired its balance sheet and returned to the dividend list in 2015. It\u2019s now expected to keep growing the dividend, and any increase in UK interest rates would be a significant boost to the lender\u2019s profit margins.\nRio Tinto has staged an impressive recovery since the commodity sector crash finally ended 18 months ago, and streamlining the business has provided firepower to increase its latest interim dividend by 144% in dollar terms.\nBarclays presents shareholders with a problem. As the only UK bank share in negative territory in 2017 so far, down over 14%, it\u2019s the cheapest high street lender out there, trading at a discount to book value. Its restructuring is complete, too, but PPI and other conduct issues may continue to cap share price gains.\nHowever, if City estimates are correct, the dividend will more than double in 2018 and give a forward yield of over 4%.\nWith interest rates at a record low, there are currently few asset classes that match equities for income generation potential. The global economy is ticking along nicely, company profits are improving and valuations do not appear stretched among this crop of blue-chips.\nIn the absence of any market event that significantly shifts the dial, it\u2019s likely investors will continue to benefit as companies return those profits to shareholders.\nBTL relief restriction \u2013 the Budget's biggest misfire?"}

Be sure to read Part 1 and Part 2 as well.\nHow Greece becomes a pawn in the hands of investors. How the European Central Bank goes astray. Why the world no longer makes sense to the Greeks. How the Maastricht bet goes bad.\nIn October 2009, Marko Mr\u009anik's analysts at rating agency Standard & Poor's computed that Greece's debt would increase to 125 percent of economic output in 2010. On the same day, it became more expensive to hedge Greek bonds against default. The default insurance instruments, known in market jargon as credit default swaps (CDS), were an indicator of how bad things stood for Greece. It was now costing $189,000 a year to hedge a $10-million Greek government bond against default. For major investors, it was a signal to get out of Greece.\nA few people had also become nervous at the headquarters of the Pacific Investment Company (PIMCO) in Newport Beach, California, about an hour's drive south of Los Angeles.\nPIMCO is by far the world's largest investor in government bonds. The company lends governments money by buying their bonds. When PIMCO stops buying a country's bonds, it's a clear sign that the country is on the verge of crisis and possibly even bankruptcy.\nPIMCO controls more than $1.3 trillion (\u00801.05 trillion) on behalf of its customers. It is an absurd number, even in these times of superlatives, times of bailout funds and banks being supported with billions upon billions in taxpayer money. Though far from a household word, PIMCO has four times the German national budget to invest.\nThat's why almost all governments maintain close ties to PIMCO. They send their finance ministers, the heads of their central banks and sometimes even their national leaders to see CEO Mohamed El-Erian and convince him to buy their government bonds.\nIn the last few weeks of 2009, PIMCO sold all of its Greek bonds. El-Erian says the company wanted to get out before everyone else noticed that the numbers weren't adding up. The company never relies on outside assessments. Instead, it employs hordes of analysts, some of whom used to work at the International Monetary Fund, where El-Erian began his career.\nThe analysts spend all of their time digging through large quantities of data and the financial statements of nations, re-calculating, preparing projections and feeding numbers into computers. When they don't like what they see, PIMCO gets out.\nWhen Greece was accepted into the euro zone, it was one more reason for PIMCO to buy Greek bonds. El-Erian says the sentiment at PIMCO was that if the Greeks were being granted membership in such an elite club, then Athens would follow the rules -- or the government would be severely sanctioned if it didn't. But that didn't happen. Instead, political concessions were made and the rules were ignored. That, El-Erian argues, is what brought the cancer into the euro zone.\nSo why didn't the financial markets penalize Greece earlier? Why was the same yardstick applied to Greek government bonds as to German"}

Specifically, in the first decade he proposed savage cuts in aid to the poor, but he also proposed huge tax cuts for the rich \u2014 and the tax cuts for the rich were bigger than the aid cuts for the poor, so that the specifics of the plan were actually deficit-increasing, not deficit-reducing.\nSo how did he claim otherwise?

Former Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas is visiting Pittsburgh today. That news was reported by Alain Poupart, lead writer of the Dolphins\u2019 team site. He tweeted the news out a little while ago.\n.@Michael31Thomas is visiting the Pittsburgh Steelers today.\nThomas has been known as an elite special teamer for several years while still carving out a niche role defensively. We wrote about why the Steelers should target him in our free agent wishlist.\nAt the time, here is what I wrote.\n\u201cI love Thomas, though I don\u2019t see him as a fit to be a starting FS the way Boston or Tandy could. Thomas is more of a Swiss army knife. I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019d do with him. But there\u2019s a lot I could try. He\u2019s played strong safety, a little free, a hybrid player, nickel corner, and top level special teamer.\nThe special team aspect really makes me want to sign him. Using Pro Football Reference\u2019s Play Index, from 2014 to 2017, he has racked up a ridiculous 46 special teams tackles. Here they are year by year.\nIn addition to his special teams ace status, he played 151 snaps on defense in 2017. In 24 career starts, he has one interception, which came off Tom Brady in 2013, his rookie season. Which you can see here, in all its glory.\nAdding Thomas would be a great replacement for Robert Golden, a special teams leader who the team released at the start of the new league year. We floated the idea out again at that time.\nSteelers should go look to sign Miami\u2019s Michael Thomas. Elite special teamer to seamlessly replace Golden. SS/dime value. Should be relatively cheap.

Robbie Bach is retiring as chief of Microsoft's entertainment group, and J. Allard, seen as one of the visionaries behind the successful Xbox platform, is also leaving the company.\nRedmond has its share of problems in the rapidly evolving consumer tech market. While Microsoft continues to dominate in its two core, and highly profitable, software markets with Windows (desktop operating systems) and Office (productivity software), it has failed thus far to match the success of key rivals Apple and Google in the mobile arena.\nThe market share for Windows Mobile OS is dwindling fast: According to the most recent comScore estimates on U.S. smartphone usage, Microsoft's market share fell to 15.7 percent in January 2010 from 19.7 percent in October 2009. Conversely, Google's share rose significant during that period--to 7.1 percent from 2.8 percent--a solid indication of the growing popularity of Android-based mobile devices.\nWindows Phone 7 is coming...but what's taking so long? Microsoft's upcoming mobile software, a dramatic iPhone-like overhaul of the company's smartphone OS, has garnered mostly positive buzz from pundits thus far. Problem is, Phone 7 devices aren't slated to appear until later this year, long after the expected release of the next-generation iPhone, as well as countless rollouts of new, cutting-edge Android handsets. Even if Phone 7 lives up to its pre-release hype, will it be too late to reclaim mobile market share for Microsoft?\nTablets won't use Windows 7: The latest version of Windows is very good--but only for desktop and laptop PCs. It's not built for touchscreen-controlled devices, however, nor was it ever designed to be, regardless of whatever touch-friendly layers Microsoft may add to it. Redmond's PC industry pals know this, which is why they're passing on Windows 7 for their tablets. Dell's upcoming Streak slate, for instance, will run Android. And HP reportedly bought Palm for its WebOS software, a sophisticated mobile OS that's nicely suited to tablets and other portable devices.\nMicrosoft's Courier tablet looked fantastic as a conceptual gadget, but a slickly produced video does not a shipping product make. The dual-screen device, which unfolded like a book and featured both touch and stylus input, could have been a contender. Then again, it's unclear whether Redmond was really ever serious about bringing Courier to market.\nZune is a dead duck: As a handheld media player, Zune was quite good. But it never stood a chance against the iPod touch, primarily because it couldn't compete with Apple's App Store bonanza \u2014 200,000-plus apps and counting. Which media player would you buy?\nWill managerial reshuffling help Microsoft become a player in the mobile market?

And while the experience can vary wildly from device to device, there are still a handful of services and apps I always make sure I have right off the bat.\nIt's the latter that has increasingly become the most important thing I use day to day. For those of you unfamiliar with Evernote, it's a primarily a note-taking app. You jot something down on your iPhone, and that note syncs over the Internet to all your other devices. Your laptop. Your tablet. Even your refrigerator.\nIt goes beyond that though. Evernote has a suite of apps like Skitch, which lets you annotate images with arrows and text, and Hello, which lets you scan business cards and sync them with your LinkedIn account. (Hello is about to be spun into the regular Evernote app.) And there's another, new part of Evernote's business: physical products. Evernote now sells items ranging from messenger bags to notebooks, all the non-digital stuff people would need to remain productive.\nI keep everything in Evernote. Transcriptions of interviews with my sources. Story ideas. Photos of receipts for lunches or trips I need to expense. And all that stuff is instantly available on all the gizmos I use every day.\nIf you don't use Evernote, you should.\nI had a chance to sit down with Evernote's CEO, Phil Libin, a few weeks ago to dive a bit deeper into what's going on at the company.\nWhen I met Libin, he was wearing an Evernote t-shirt under his blazer, like a proud geek dad wearing a t-shirt from his kid's college. Libin is soft-spoken, but has a lengthy, intelligent answer for just about any question you throw at him. And he doesn't get flustered when I asked him annoying business reporter-type questions like \"When are you going to IPO?\" or \"How much revenue do you bring in?\"\nIn an era when it seems like many startups are striving for a quick exit, Libin says Evernote is in it for the long haul. He uses the line the line that Evernote is a \"100-year startup\" in just about every interview he's given, but if you dive a bit deeper, you can tell he really means it. Evernote is more than just a company that helps you jot down notes. The long-term goal is to be the company that provides everything productive people need. You can already see that in the diversity of its products today, and Libin says he feels like Evernote is well-equipped to handle whatever changes technology may bring to the way we work.\nThat's part of the reason why unlike most app companies, Evernote has a version of its service on just about everything that runs on electricity, from household appliances to smart watches. The idea is for Evernote to be omnipresent, even if only a few people adopt a particular product.\n\"We're not in the business of predicting who's going to win and who's going to lose,\" Libin says. \"We get a lot of knowledge designing for everything. It's an intentional decision to stretch people as much as possible.\"\nThe next logical step, of course, would be an IPO, which Libin says is two to three years away. Evernote has raised over $250 million in funding so far and is valued at well over $1 billion. Libin wouldn't give me specific revenue numbers, but there is growth.

Booksy co-founder and CEO Stefan Batory tells me adoption of the app has been shown to improve customer loyalty and frequency of bookings. Part of the reason for this is simple: by using Booksy, businesses are able to accept bookings outside of working hours for the first time.\n\u201cMost of them work with their hands, so they can\u2019t answer phone calls when they have clients in and don\u2019t want to answer them when out of work,\u201d says Batory. \u201cOn the other hand, clients want to book appointments 24\u00d77 (up to 60 per cent of appointments are made outside of working hours of our businesses). We help both sides to take the hassle out of that process and book when it\u2019s convenient for clients and at the same time, make life easier for businesses\u201d.\nIn addition to scheduling, Booksy provides businesses with a number of other features designed to support and enhance their processes, such as a CRM, marketing automation, inventory management, point-of-sales, reports, the management of commission for employees, and (soon) in-app payments.\nUnlike competitors, however, Booksy isn\u2019t a marketplace and, therefore, doesn\u2019t get paid per booking. Instead, its SaaS model sees it charge a simple monthly subscription, with a number of tiers dependent on the size of the business.\n\u201cWe have local competitors on every market,\u201d explains Batory. These include StyleSeat in the U.S., Treatwell in the U.K., Vaniday in Brazil, and LadyTime in Poland. \u201cThey are all marketplaces and charge for appointments. That discourages businesses to push their clients to these platforms. They are happy to do it with Booksy though, because they know we will not send their clients elsewhere, to monetise that\u201d.\nAlong with Batory, Booksy\u2019s other co-founder is Konrad Howard.

The Madison Chain is centered around the Wisconsin state capital of Madison, which borders three of the lakes and is connected to the other two lakes by the Yahara River. The lakes that make up the \u201cChain\u201d include; Lakes Mendota, Monona, Wingra, Wabesa, and Kegonsa. All of these lakes, with the exception of Lake Wingra, contain very good to excellent crappie and bluegill fishing. Lake Wingra has bluegills, but they are very small in size and I\u2019d concentrate my fishing efforts on the other four lakes. All of these lakes also have very good gamefish populations, but this article is about the productive and consistent panfishing (crappies and bluegills) that they have during the spring and summer. The tips and information I give can be applied to most bodies of water in the upper Midwest.\nAfter a mild winter with varying temperatures and not much snow, the Chain is finally starting to produce the quality panfish that has many panfish anglers flocking to southern Wisconsin. This spring has had up and down weather with snow and cold into April. Crappies and bluegills have been biting periodically in April and early May, but the constant up and down weather with frontal systems moving thru the state regularly has prevented any consistent pattern and made catching fish difficult at times.\nBut now, the weather looks warmer and that is all that is needed for productive panfishing. Come springtime, both crappies and bluegills will actively seek out the warmest water that they can find. All species of panfish prefer stable weather and water warming into the mid 50\u2019s for crappies to spawn and the mid to upper 60\u2019s for bluegill spawning.\nIdeally, crappies and bluegills will always look for warm and slack or quiet water in out-of-way locations in spring. Back bays with dark bottoms of mud or muck, warm quicker and get the food chain in motion earlier than any other areas of the lakes. This is why you should try to fish smaller lakes early in the fishing season because smaller waters warm faster than larger bodies of water and get the metabolism of the fish moving in the right direction. Lake Wabesa and Kegonsa are the smaller lakes in the Madison Chain and I suggest you start fishing these lakes before you switch to the larger and colder Lake Mendota and Lake Monona which warm up weeks later.\nThis time of year, most fish species will be in water that is less than 8 feet deep and shallower. On a warm and sunny spring day, it is not unusual to find crappies and bluegills in water that is only 2 or 3 feet deep. Crappies will spawn weeks before bluegills, but they both will often occupy the same areas of any lake and crappies will remain in their spawning locations for an extended period of time even after spawning. One must remember that these fish are coming out of water that only a month ago was in the 30\u2019s, so warm water and stable weather will keep both crappies and bluegills in the shallow water areas. Two other important factors to remember are that warm nights and warm rains can also help spring fishing and help keep the fish active in shallow water. Cold fronts will push fish back to deeper water and make any fishing more difficult. Rarely in the"}

And they failed miserably.\nRicky Gervais, host of the 2016 Golden Globe Awards.\nThe phrase \u201ctransgender tipping point\u201d has been bandied about a lot since it was first introduced on the cover of Time, alongside Laverne Cox, back in May 2014. Generally, it\u2019s used to point out the rapidity with which trans issues\u2014if not yet acceptance\u2014have entered the mainstream consciousness. But at Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globe Awards, I think we reached another trans tipping point, this one having to do with cheap trans-themed jokes. Host Ricky Gervais began his monologue with a \u201cBruce Jenner\u201d jab, in the process flippantly commiting at act of \u201cdead-naming,\u201d and he continued with some riffing on what Transparent star Jeffrey Tambor does with his testicles while in costume as Maura.\nBut as I say, I\u2019m going to be nice tonight. I\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year she\u2019s had. She became a role model for trans people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\u2019t do a lot for women drivers, but you can\u2019t have everything, can ya? Not at the same time. \u2026 Yes. Yes. That is the level. An old man pulling me off. Again. Um, at least Jeffrey tambor did it in a dress. Um, what a year he\u2019s had. Oh. What an actor, what a role. Every day, he has to put on all that women\u2019s clothes and the hair and makeup and let people film it. That takes balls. So, I don\u2019t know how he does it. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen his balls. They are huge and long. I don\u2019t know he tucked them in the bra, that thing push them out the back and let them hang out, like a bulldog? No one knows. I love Jeffrey Tambor.\nGervais is clever enough to temper the outright offensiveness of these jokes with seemingly politically correct followups and praise (as well as an arguably fair dig at Jenner\u2019s involvement in a car accident earlier this year). But the fact remains that the crux of the humor lies in something being \u201cfunny\u201d about trans-ness or its fictional representations.\nOr at least, it would have been had anyone found the jokes funny. Hearing Gervais, my cringing at his comedic choice faded into a modicum of relief when it became clear that very few in the room were laughing. And when the camera cut to Tambor\u2014who has been more or less impeccable on trans issues since starring in Transparent\u2014he responded with a grim look of disbellief rather than a smile. Gervais clearly felt that \u201cmen in dresses\u201d and genital conjecture was a strong place to start his little routine\u2014but, thankfully, his feeling was clearly wrong. Of course, Gervais\u2019 trans jokes falling flat doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t still add yet more anti-trans sentiment to the world Sunday night, but hopefully the dour response will dissuade anyone else from following in his smarmy footsteps on a national stage in the future."}

The next largest location is at Hechinger Mall in Northeast, at 62,000 square feet. That means that the proposed renovation of the Petworth Safeway will put it in third place in terms of size, at 60,000 square feet. My final thought on all of these numbers is this: I don\u2019t really care which neighborhood\u2019s store is bigger, as long as the produce is fresh, the products are priced fairly and the service is good. I don\u2019t shop at the large grocery store that is two blocks away from me because it fails on all three of those counts.

I usually don\u2019t drink their coffee (Filter and Baked and Wired, holla!), but I also don\u2019t notice that they are the chain in Safeway (or Target, for that matter); the only time I paid attention to their presence was when I realized that since the Safeway in Georgetown is open 24 hours a day, it would\u2019ve made an odd, yet comforting place to pull all-nighters when I was in school.

That was an increase of 7.4% from its November delivery total, and more than enough to beat its own guidance for the month and the full year.\nDecember's total put NIO at 11,348 deliveries of its ES8 in 2018. The ES8, an upscale battery-electric three-row SUV positioned as a domestic Chinese alternative to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model X, went into production in late June. Deliveries have ramped up more-or-less steadily since.\nData source: NIO.

He said the company will continue to focus on market penetration in 2019, emphasizing service as a differentiator.\nWhile CFO Louis Hsieh said he was \"pleased\" with NIO's production ramp and delivery totals in 2018, he noted that the company's strong year-end total was due in part to a reduction in government subsidies for electric vehicles that took effect at the beginning of 2019. He also hinted that an \"overall challenging automotive market\" in China could put a damper on NIO's growth for a while.\nNIO delivered 11,348 ES8 units in 2018. Image source: NIO.\n\"Challenging\" is the right word for China's new-car market right now. Sales of passenger vehicles in China fell 19% in December versus the year-ago month. A stock market slump and ongoing trade-war concerns have dented Chinese consumers' confidence, driving passenger-vehicle sales sharply lower in recent months. For the full year, passenger-vehicle sales in China fell 6% from 2017 levels, to 22.7 million units.\nNIO may also face a second set of pressures in 2019: Its much larger Silicon Valley rival appears to have secured a foothold in China. The Chinese government said in December that it will temporarily lower import tariffs on U.S.-made light vehicles to 15% from 40%, a move that will make imported Teslas somewhat more affordable to Chinese customers right away.\nChinese buyers may find Teslas even more affordable in another year or so: The company broke ground on a new factory in Shanghai last week that will produce inexpensive versions of the Model 3 and Tesla's upcoming Model 3-based Model Y SUV. Because they'll be built in China, they won't be subject to tariffs.\nThe Model Y in particular could throw a wrench into NIO's plans. NIO is looking ahead to the introduction of its second mass-market model, a five-passenger SUV called the ES6, in June. NIO is counting on the ES6 to take its sales up a notch, and on paper at least, the ES6 seems likely to give the company a boost.

These are just some of the important life skills that children learn from art education, but the subject is being sidelined in our schools, according to the woman named as the world\u2019s best teacher.\nIt was this passion and dedication that resulted in Ms Zafirakou, 39, being awarded the US$1 million (Dh3.67 million) Varkey Foundation annual Global Teacher Prize at a star-studded awards gala in Dubai in March.\nAs the school term draws to a close, she sat down with The National to reflect on a remarkable year. She has just returned from Geneva, where she accompanied Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to the opening of an exhibition on girls' education at the Palais des Nations.\nMs Zafirakou was selected in March from thousands of applicants around the world in recognition of her work at Alperton Community School, an impoverished, inner-city school in Brent, London. One of the UK\u2019s most deprived boroughs, more than one-third of the children in Brent live in poverty, criminality is rife and gangs stalk the school gates.\nOrganisers of the award praised Ms Zafirakou for \u201c[transforming] her school\u2019s approach to reach often isolated young people so that they can engage in school life and perform to the best of their abilities\u201d.\nOne of her signature achievements has been a complete redesign of her school\u2019s art curriculum. It is something she had to fight for, she says, given the trend to cut art budgets in schools in favour of subjects like maths and science.\n\u201cEspecially in the UK, arts are not a priority,\u201d Ms Zafirakou says. This is a real problem which will have a ripple effect in the workplace, she warns.\n\u201cArt teaches things like resilience, creativity, curiosity, teamwork, social skills, communication skills. It also teaches children how to fail and persevere until they succeed.\nMs Zafirakou says she is immensely proud to be an art and textiles teacher, and says it is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to see the effect her teaching has on her students.\nWith her prize money, she is hoping to further promote the arts in education. \u201cIt [the $1m award] is quite a pressure, but it\u2019s a beautiful pressure to have,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis award has been given to me for what I do in my school community. So it is important to think about what I can do with it to have a platform for what I think is vital in schools.\nRaised in Brent, Ms Zafirakou is dedicated to her local community and has taught at Alperton school for the entirety of her 12 year teaching career. The school is very ethnically diverse, with a large number of the students coming from deprived migrant families. Some speak very little or no English when they first arrive.\nIn an effort to build bridges with her pupils, Ms Zafirakou learned how to welcome them in many of the 35 different languages spoken at Alperton. These include Hindi, Arabic, Romanian, Tamil, Polish and Somali. She also helped launch a Somali choir.\nShe is quick to dismiss praise for these initiatives, however. Born to Greek-Cypriot parents, she says she remembered how it felt to turn up at school and struggle to communicate, so she simply wanted to do her bit to make life easier for children in a similar situation.\n\u201cImagine them arriving from God knows where, they\u2019ve come into this country, they enter"}

{"idx": "27618", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Is a prepaid card right for you?\nPrepaid cards have come a long way. Once considered a pretty niche product, the cards were mostly marketed to low-income people with few or no banking relationships. The cards were expensive, carried many fees, and, because they offered few protections, were risky. Prepaid cards were last resort for consumers who really didn\u2019t have a choice.\nBut some prepaid cards have changed for the better, as our latest report, \"Prepaid Cards: How They Rate 2014\" (PDF) and Ratings of 23 cards show. Fees on some prepaid cards are very low, cheaper even than checking accounts. What\u2019s more, today\u2019s prepaid cards more often offer the kinds of features that can help with good money management.\nThese improvements for the better have not been lost on consumers. Prepaid cards are the fastest-growing segment of the payments market. About one in four American households use them, not necessarily as a bank-account substitute but as an adjunct. Who might use them?\nA parent of a college student might give his son a prepaid card as a way to keep a check on spending, for instance.\nA mom might load a younger child\u2019s allowance on a card every week to teach her about money management.\nYoung working adults can manage cash flow by having their paycheck loaded onto their card.\nPeople who worry that a credit card could make it too easy to overspend can still enjoy the convenience of shopping online and paying bills electronically.\nOur Ratings rank prepaid cards for use as a substitute for a bank account and as an addition to a bank account. Click on the links to download the charts.\nCheck our tips for using a prepaid card, and stay on top of the personal finance news.\nConcerns remain for prepaid cards. Prepaid cards lack the federal consumer protections that come with debit cards linked to bank accounts. If your card is lost or stolen, you\u2019re out of luck (although all of the cards we reviewed voluntarily offer protection against loss and fraud). Fees can be tough to pin down, and some costs, such as when using an out-of-network ATM, can be hard to figure out ahead of time.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to close some of these gaps when it issues proposed prepaid card rules, though any federal rules are not expected to be final for some time.\nDifferent cards offer different features, so be sure the prepaid card you choose does what you want it to do, including: paying bills and having a paper check sent, managing your account by mobile phone and even depositing checks digitally, and linking your prepaid card to your savings account and possibly earning interest on balances. Our top-rated cards have all or most of the features you could want."}

Data from 2017 reflects the fourth-lowest violent crime rate since 1980 and the lowest property crime rate ever. This report was released on the heels of a brand new neighborhood policing division formed in March.\nOne Pacific Beach resident said the new neighborhood policing division is already paying dividends with the quick removal and clean-up of a homeless encampment along Rose Creek in May (before and after photo).\nI surveyed city council offices, planning group members, social media, and individual residents about what they hope from the new division.\nOverwhelmingly, transients were mentioned most often. Theft, reckless driving, vandalism/graffiti, and illegal dumping/litter came up next most often.\nA Tierrasanta resident said reckless driving has been the number-one complaint; cars and motorcycles race down Tierrasanta Boulevard and Clairemont Mesa Boulevard late at night.\nTo the news that her neighborhood had no more homeless people, one Midway resident said, \"I count at least thirty on my way to get coffee every morning.\"\nAccording to Scott Wahl, captain of the new policing division, concerns will be addressed neighborhood-by-neighborhood. Wahl said since his officers won't be answering radio calls, it will allow more flexibility in addressing chronic concerns. The entire division has the option of focusing on one issue or one neighborhood on any given day.\nEven though illegal dumping/littering was a top-five concern city-wide, police data showed only 26 reported incidents last summer.\nOne Pacific Beach resident said the new division is paying dividends with the quick removal and clean-up of a homeless encampment along Rose Creek (Mission Bay) in May.\nA decrease of 19-percent in the city's homeless population was reported in May from the count done in January. The census tract (65) for the Midway District (Point Loma) counted zero homeless people. To this, one Midway resident said, \"I count at least thirty on my way to get coffee every morning.\"\nTheft was the second most mentioned concern. Armed suspect from February robbery downtown.\nAn Allied Gardens resident called transients \"more prominent than ever,\" while a North Park resident lamented the messes they leave behind making it embarrassing to invite guests to her neighborhood. San Ysidro residents are concerned with transient-related loitering and littering, while Point Loma residents are more concerned about aggressive transients. Northwestern neighborhoods (includes Carmel Valley) expressed no transient-related concerns. A Mira Mesa resident had some, but acknowledged they don't have it as bad as other areas.\nReckless driving was the third most mentioned concern. In January, an intoxicted driver crashed into this building for underserved youth.\nEven though transient-related concerns are high, police data from mid-May to mid-August 2017 show transients involved in less than four percent of incidents (Downtown and Point Loma had the most). Disturbing the peace was the top transient-related incident.\nVandalism and graffiti were the fourth most mentioned concern.\nA homeless man took residence under my neighbor's kitchen window in April. He told me \"the canyon is full.\" I witnessed him refusing help from the homeless outreach team. The officer told me that 98 percent refuse help.\nW"}

This question became only more urgent after reports of Russian meddling in the French election and with Donald Trump straining the Atlantic alliance after a disastrous trip to Europe last week.\nIsaac Chotiner: How unprecedented is the current, weird state of U.S.\u2013Russia relations, and how would you define it?\nWilliam Taubman: I\u2019ve done some thinking about whether or not we are in a cold war, and I think we are. If you ask yourself what are the main characteristics of a cold war, these characteristics are right before us. Each side sees the other as entirely at fault, and sees the conflict as based on ideologically sacrosanct principles rather than geopolitical differences, which might be more readily negotiated. Each side believes the cold war can\u2019t end unless the other side fundamentally changes or collapses. Each side sees any agreements between them as basically tactical or temporary.\nGod even knows what Trump\u2019s interests are because he clearly doesn\u2019t see Russia at fault. But how do you view Putin\u2019s recent actions, and exactly what he is trying to accomplish?\nI think Putin was looking to ease this new cold war. He doesn\u2019t like the sanctions. He would like Russia to be accepted both as a great power and him as a great leader. He would like to have his cake and eat it, if possible, but have better relations with the West. I think he saw Trump as somebody who, for whatever Trump\u2019s reasons, might play ball. What else did the praise Trump was heaping on him in the campaign mean, and the praise that Putin was heaping on Trump?\nI\u2019d go even further than that. I think that some sort of deal between the two of them would have been in the interests of both countries, or could have been in the interests of both countries, and of the world. There was one point when the London Times published I guess as a rumor that there would be an early summit between Trump and Putin, and it would be at Reykjavik. My heart leapt, mainly because of my study of Reagan and Gorbachev at Reykjavik, but also because I was trying to imagine the deal they might make there.\nI\u2019m not a policymaker but what I imagined was that part of the deal was that Trump would de facto affirmatively accept the Russian annexation of Crimea, which can\u2019t be altered or reversed anyway I think, and maybe he would begin to ease the sanctions, if he could get the Europeans to go with him, which would probably be all too easy. In return, Putin would back off on Ukraine. Exactly how, I don\u2019t know the terms of that, but in a sense he would let Ukraine be Ukraine, and maybe pull troops out of that part of Ukraine, and pull back from exercises on the Baltic borders.\nOne thing that really disturbs me these days is that you can\u2019t read a statement of an American senator or congressman that mentions Putin without seeing that his name is prefaced by the words murderer and thug. I said he\u2019s a sh"}

People need to compare and contrast these candidates and look at their actual experience and qualifications. Neil Kester has already shown leadership weakness by saying he will hire retired Staunton chief Butch Wells to help him run the department. He speaks of no supervisory experience, or budgeting experience. Donald Smith is immature, inexperienced, and it shows every time he speaks. I supervised him, and I can assure you what he portrays to the public is not how he truly is. Many deputies are afraid to weigh in on this race because of him. Both of these candidates have had to clarify statements, which should make people question just what they are actually saying.\nDerek Almarode claims leadership in community policing, and K-9; Todd Lloyd asserts supervision in narcotics investigations, and warrant service. The community policing division has only one deputy, which is Almarode himself, and when I left in 2014 the K-9 units were assigned to work for patrol sergeants. Lloyd was one of two supervisors in the narcotics task force that had multiple people from different agencies assigned to it. He now serves as the sole supervisor over a warrant service team of at least four deputies, one of which is a K-9 handler.\nLloyd has worked in or with every division of the office, and supervised two. He has people that actually work under his direction, and he has working relationships with federal, state, and local agencies. Rest assured we need a sheriff who will be in control of the department, one who knows through experience how the department works and the knowledge to move it forward.

The restaurant is very small and looks much more like an art installation than a typical dining establishment. There are bits and pieces of kitsch and art objects all over the walls. Radio Habana serves traditional Cuban dishes like picadillo, a mixture of ground beef with peas and raisins. It is served alongside black beans, yellow rice and salad. There are also fried plantains and ropa vieja, a braised beef dish served with rice and beans.\nEl Nuevo Frutilandia has been serving Cuban and Puerto Rican food in the Mission since 1974. The brightly colored restaurant is small and family owned with a few wooden tables and images of Cuba and Puerto Rico lining the walls. The menu consists of tapas like fried green plantains, ceviche, empanadas, and guava salad. The main dishes include specialties like picadillo, slow-roasted marinated pork, ropa vieja and the popular Cuban sandwich. All of the main dishes come with taro chips and rice.\nMedia Noche restaurant is the Mission\u2019s fast food answer to Cuban cuisine.

It also outpaced past campaigns in the district, according to county records.\nIn the race for Division 4, the drought and shrinking water supply have been the focus and those issues have generated more than usual attention to campaigns.\n\"I think we're pretty much on target for what our original plan was,\" Spandrio said of his campaign.\n\"I think money is important especially if you're going up against somebody that's an incumbent.\"\nThere was no high pressure move to raise money, he said.\nPeople could donate through his campaign website.

But it's unclear whether the unnamed feature would be integrated with your Google Voice account, because you will not need a Google Voice phone number to use the new service.

While the interface for the new service is similar to that of Google Voice, direct dialing through Gmail would be a VoIP solution -- something that Google Voice is not. It's unclear, then, whether the two services would be integrated.\nIt's also not unusual for Google to duplicate functionality especially when it comes to communications. You can, for example, send SMS messages through Google Voice, but Gmail also has a separate SMS service.\nNevertheless, the whole point of Google Voice is to bring your voice mail, SMS messages, and calling history into one place. So Gmail Chat and Google Voice integration would make a lot of sense.\nIf the speculation is true, Gmail is about to become an even more indispensable Web-based productivity app than it already is."}

Add in the time and money demands of holiday shopping, and you may be tempted to keep a therapist on speed dial.\nWhile you may not be able to avoid difficult relatives or the annual end-of-year trip to a client you\u2019d rather not see, it is possible to reduce holiday shopping stress.\nWith that in mind, here are three holiday shopping tips that are sure to help.\nYou have no idea where to start or what to buy: Kate Campbell, a former buyer for Dillard\u2019s, suggests starting with a search of hot lists or top-pick lists. Campbell currently serves as the director of the Fashion Marketing & Management program at The Art Institute of Tampa, a branch of Miami International University of Art & Design. Whether it is toys, apparel or electronics, major retailers and brand-specific websites are publishing \u201chot holiday lists\u201d and top picks for almost anything.\nBlum adds that novelty gifts are also a great way to make an impact and a good place to start. She challenges shoppers to step away from the large retail stores and buy from privately owned businesses like local boutiques and mom and pop stores.\nLooking to save time and money: If you\u2019re constantly on the go and prefer to rely on some preliminary shopping via your cellphone or mobile tablet, many apps can make shopping a bit more organized and convenient.\n\u201cThere are apps for apparel such as Wanelo and Wish, and major retailers or brands also have their own apps such as Pink Nation for Victoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d Campbell said.\nNeed to keep track of all your online purchases? There\u2019s an app for that! The larger shipping services like UPS and FedEx have their own apps, but you can also try the Slice app or the Posted app depending on your needs. Campbell warns that shoppers should plan for extra time on their delivery schedule when purchasing online or via an app.\nBlum recommends surfing products online for a cost difference from store prices. If you print out the shopping cart you intended to purchase, and bring it in store, the retailer will often honor the price savings. Knowing and shopping the promotions before you go to the store is a different way of couponing.\nWant additional savings? Blum recommends the Amazon app for your smartphone. Just scan the in-store item\u2019s barcode and the app will tell you if Amazon has the same item for less. She cautions that the Amazon app doesn\u2019t work with generic brand items.\nComplete your shopping in one place or in one day: Pick and choose where you think you may spend the majority of your holiday budget, and join the loyalty programs for coupons and reductions.\n\u201cBe choosy and make sure you register with the loyalty programs that will really deliver savings and unique purchases as opposed to spam mail,\u201d Campbell said.\nThe key to holiday shopping is to avoid impulse buying. Make a list, and start early. Go online or ask your loved ones and friends about their hobbies. Stress relief and savings are the result of doing the homework. If you don\u2019t, the worst will happen \u2013 you\u2019ll force yourself to buy out of desperation."}

Kvitova earned five break points in the first set, which she could not convert, and saved three championship points in the second, which she ultimately was unable to capitalize on.\nOsaka refused to fade away. Later, as the Rod Laver Arena crowd celebrated Osaka\u2019s 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-4 victory, Kvitova looked around to congratulate her opponent \u2014 and couldn\u2019t find her anywhere.\nEvery little thing Osaka does on the court inexorably draws the eye to her, but take the racquet out of her hand and she visibly shrinks from the spotlight. Born in Japan and raised in the United States by a Japanese mother and a Haitian father, she was asked in an interview on Australian television if she was ready to become the face of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\nHow can they not? Osaka came into this tournament last year ranked No. 72. When the new world rankings come out Monday, Osaka, the reigning U.S. Open champion, will become the first singles player, male or female, from Japan to reach No. 1.\nRetired Chinese star Li Na might as well have been passing a torch when she presented Osaka with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup in the on-court trophy presentation. Li, a two-time major winner, rose to No. 2, behind Serena Williams, shortly after winning the 2014 Australian Open. For five years, no singles player from Asia had climbed higher.\nOsaka, the first woman since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to win her first two major titles back to back, does not appear to be going anywhere but forward.\nWhen Osaka defeated Williams in the U.S. Open final in September, she was the eighth different woman since the 2017 Australian Open to win a grand slam title. By consolidating her victory in New York with her performance in Melbourne, Osaka demonstrated that she has staying power.\nOsaka\u2019s victory over Williams, in retrospect, seems to have represented a coronation of sorts, one queen ceding the throne to her successor. That idea got lost in that final\u2019s chaotic finish, when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, warned Williams about a coaching infraction, setting off a chain of events that thrust Williams into the spotlight and Osaka into the shadows.\nKvitova, 28, was the same age that Osaka is now in 2011 when she won her first Wimbledon title. It took her three years to return to a Grand Slam final, and she took the title again at Wimbledon in 2014.\n\u201cI probably wasn\u2019t really ready to win it, to be honest,\u201d said Kvitova, who spoke of struggling to adjust to increased expectations \u2014 and not just from the public.\nOsaka also expects a lot of herself. It is what drove her in the past year to create more spin on her forehand, which produced eight winners in the deciding set Saturday. She has also worked on the placement, and not just the pace, of her serve, also to great effect; she recorded nine aces in the final to finish the tournament with 59, which was 22 more than the next-highest woman.\nAnd against Kvitova, Osaka was able to corral her emotions after the second set got away from her, which hasn\u2019t"}

Weiss' Star Wars film series reportedly takes place during the Old Republic, and the first installment is said to begin filming in the fall. This year, the biggest event in the Star Wars franchise is the premiere of Episode IX, which concludes the ongoing sequel trilogy and the Skywalker saga as a whole. But as one era for the property ends, another begins. Lucasfilm is actively developing two separate film trilogies from Rian Johnson and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff & D.B. Weiss. Both of these are completely disconnected from the Skywalker story and will look to expand the canon in a number of ways.\nOf course, these movies have yet to secure release dates, so information about them is rather limited. The creative forces behind the two trilogies have kept busy working on different projects recently; Johnson is in post-production on his mystery-thriller Knives Out, while Benioff & Weiss have of course been overseeing the final season of Game of Thrones. But with HBO's fantasy hit coming to a close this year, the two will be turning their attention to the galaxy far, far away soon. And now, fans may know what they have in mind for their films.\nAccording to Star Wars News Net, Benioff & Weiss' trilogy will be set during the days of the Old Republic, \"hundreds of years prior to the Skywalkers.\" Their source described it as \"Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings\" and stated filming will commence this fall. Of course, this is just a rumor for the time being, so fans should keep their grains of salt handy.\nEver since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 and unveiled plans for new movies, the Old Republic has long been a time period viewers have yearned to see on the big screen. Should this information pan out, Benioff & Weiss read as the ideal pair to bring these films to life. Their experience on Game of Thrones proved they have the ability to handle iconic and beloved mythology, presenting it in entertaining and compelling ways. They'd also be in their element working within the confines of a fantasy epic. The notion of Star Wars blended with Lord of the Rings brings to mind imagery of big-scale battles a la Helm's Deep or Minas Tirith in a galaxy far, far away setting. That has the potential to be unlike anything fans have seen in a Star Wars movie before, and it'll be exciting to see what Benioff & Weiss come up with. Hopefully, this means Darth Bane could be a key figure in the series.\nThe other interesting bit here is the targeted filming date of the fall, which implies there will be official updates on this project within the next several months. Perhaps Lucasfilm will reveal some information about their future plans at Celebration Chicago, taking place in April. While the primary focus of the convention will be on Episode IX, it would be nice if the studio shed some light on what's ahead. There are a number of rumors and reports about the next slate of Star Wars movies and TV shows, so a little bit of clarity would be greatly appreciated. Many expected Star Wars to take a short break post-Episode IX, but maybe they'll just keep chugging along."}

Pocono Mountains Municipal in Coolbaugh Township, whose district includes Coolbaugh, Tobyhanna, Paradise and Pocono townships and Mount Pocono Borough. Stroudsburg-Pocono in Smithfield Township, whose district includes Smithfield, Middle Smithfield and Stroud townships and East Stroudsburg Borough.\nBarrett Township became the first of the 12 municipalities to receive a copy of the ordinance from the commission.\nThe ordinance grew out of the Pennsylvania Airport Hazard Zoning Act, or Act 164. Passed in 1984, the act involves a partnership between the Federal Aviation Administration and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in efforts to reduce the risk of tall structures interfering with aircraft navigation.\nFor years, municipalities resisted the act, and it could not be effectively enforced, PennDOT spokeswoman Erin Waters said. That was until the 2007 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in the case of Chanceford Aviation vs. Chanceford Township in York County, Waters said.\nLevere and Loretta Baublitz started Chanceford Aviation, a private airport, in Chanceford Township in 1979, prior to the township's adoption of a zoning ordinance. The couple in 1991 notified the township of its obligation to adopt an Act 164 ordinance, but the township did not do so.\nAfter Levere Baublitz's death in 2000, Loretta Baublitz continued efforts to get an ordinance adopted. The matter went to trial in York County Court in 2004 and Baublitz won. The township successfully appealed. Baublitz then appealed in state Supreme Court, which upheld the county court decision.\nThe Supreme Court ruling now makes it harder for Pennsylvania's airport district municipalities to ignore their obligations to adopt such an ordinance, Waters said.\nSome of the 12 municipalities here have airport district provisions in their zoning ordinances, Meinhart said.\nThe restrictions vary with each municipality, but the municipality should ensure provisions impose proper height restrictions on any future construction, Meinhart said.\n\"The farther away you are from the airport, the lesser the height restriction,\" Basila said."}

The raises, ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent, were based on performance reviews \u2014 a system Pedri implemented last year.\nThe average raise among those employees was 2.48 percent, though that number does not include employees who received no raise at all. Pedri told council the total expense of the raises, $176,268, came in more than $22,000 under the budgeted maximum.\nThat sent some council members scrambling to figure out how that was possible, since the amount council allotted for the raises during last fall\u2019s budget process was intended to equal 2 percent of the wages for all non-unionized positions included in this year\u2019s budget, according to McGinley.\nThe answer appears to be that a significant number of those positions were not eligible for merit-based raises.

Activities will include the provision of food, water, sanitation services, emergency healthcare, psychosocial support, job opportunities, and protection for ambulances and monitoring of the humanitarian situation. Beneficiaries are Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Assistance will be provided also to some 1,500 refugees from Iraq still living in camps in Jordan and in \"no-man's land\" on the border. The funds are directed through the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) to United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and non- governmental organisations.\nCommissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Poul Nielson, said: \"As stability in the region is jeopardised by an upsurge of violence and political tensions, Europe must continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and protect those who are most vulnerable\". He added: \"Deteriorating living conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories, resulting from lack of access to food, water, basic services and economic opportunities, are the direct consequences of the escalation of violence. Only a lifting of the closure policy and of the constraints faced in implementing aid programmes can help reverse the situation.\"\nAbout two million people, almost 60% of the population of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, live below the poverty line on less than \u20ac2 per day. Two-thirds of those in the Gaza Strip depend on international humanitarian assistance. Nearly half of Palestinians of working age are unemployed. Some 40% of the population does not have secure access to food, and individual water consumption is half the level recommended by the World Health Organisation. According to the United Nations, the construction by Israel of the \"security barrier\" in the West Bank and around Jerusalem has already cut off more than 200,000 people from health and education services, water resources and livelihoods. Once completed, it could directly harm 680,000 people. The psychological impact, especially on children, is dramatic.\nFood aid: More than 480,000 people, including 30,000 highly vulnerable Bedouins, will receive emergency food rations. 240,000 impoverished workers will also be provided with food in exchange for agricultural and community works. In areas where the barrier is being erected and in isolated West Bank villages, the autonomy of households totalling 16,000 individuals will be boosted through food production and agricultural training.\nWater and sanitation: An increasing number of families in the West Bank depend on water brought in by tankers. More than 150,000 people, including in areas affected by the barrier, will be provided with water for drinking and agricultural purposes. Some 220 household and 20 community water cisterns will be built in the south of the West Bank. New distribution systems will provide safe drinking water to 15,000 Palestinians living in unofficial settlements in northern Lebanon, while in the south 4,400 Palestinian households will be connected to improved sewerage networks.\nHealth care: Chronic malnutrition has reached 10.7% on average in the occupied Palestinian territories.

Naloxone reverses only the effects of opioid overdoses.\nSarah Blyth, executive director of the Overdose Prevention Society, estimates that her site had 25 to 30 such overdoses in the past two weeks, including five at one time.\nMark Lysyshyn, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), said a sample of down \u2013 the colloquial term for an opioid such as heroin or fentanyl \u2013 recently collected at the supervised-consumption facility Insite and sent to Health Canada for laboratory testing contained etizolam. Family doctors have also reported etizolam turning up in urine drug screens, and B.C.\u2019s provincial toxicology lab has identified it in several overdose deaths.\nIn emergency departments, victims of such overdoses receive naloxone, but remain unconscious, slumped in chairs and monitored by staff.\n\u201cPutting this all together, we do feel that this etizolam is potentially contaminating the drug supply, although we can\u2019t be sure to what degree it is etizolam and not some other benzo, because there have also been instances where true benzos have been added to drugs,\u201d he said.\nThe scope of the problem is difficult to measure because drug-checking methods offered locally do not detect etizolam.\nDana MacInnis experienced one of these overdoses in February.\nFortunately, Mr. MacInnis was at Ms. Blyth\u2019s overdose-prevention site, where staff revived him. Mr. MacInnis saw on security-camera footage that before he collapsed, he had been stumbling around, with friends helping him try to walk. He then fell unconscious for about 45 minutes.\nBenzodiazepines act on the same receptors as alcohol and produce similar effects, such as memory loss, slurred speech and difficulty walking, said Keith Ahamad, medical director for the regional addiction program at VCH.\n\u201cPeople typically don\u2019t overdose and die on benzos alone, but when you combine them with alcohol or an opioid, they are super dangerous,\u201d he said.\nDr. Ahamad said St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in downtown Vancouver had multiple overdoses of this kind every day last week.\nVancouver police say they have not found etizolam in any seizures to date.

{"idx": "27658", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress voted unanimously to declare independence from Great Britain. Approximately 20 percent of the members of Congress were opposed to separation, but some did not vote, so that Congress might \"speak with one voice.\" The Declaration was necessary for concrete as well as symbolic reasons: the colonies needed foreign aid to keep fighting, but to obtain foreign aid it had to seek more than reconciliation with Britain, it had to proclaim itself a nation.\nThomas Jefferson became the author of the Declaration when John Adams declined, thinking it soon would be forgotten. \"After all,\" writes biographer David McCullough, \"who remembered the Declaration of Rights and Grievances that he had authored for the initial Congress of 1774\"?\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\nJefferson did harness the revolutionary spirit on paper, but also included statements with which Congress was uncomfortable. Nearly a quarter of the document was cut during editing. Although the paragraphs that remain espouse the ideals that spawned the Revolutionary War, much of the document comprised a litany of grievances against King George III. Among George's crimes: the \"horrors of the human slave trade.\" The irony wasn't lost on Adams that the Declaration of Independence, which trumpeted freedom for all men, was written by a slave owner. (Jefferson was far from the only slave owner in the Continental Congress; a full third of the delegates, from both North and South, either currently or had owned slaves, while Washington, who commanded America's army, owned over 100.) Nor did the British let this contradiction go unnoticed. Queried Samuel Johnson: \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty from the drivers of Negroes?\"\nOn July 4, only John Hancock, the president of the Continental Congress, and Charles Thomson, the secretary, signed the Declaration. Then it went to the printer. The other delegates would sign on August 2, a date that faded not only from public memory, but from that of Adams and Jefferson also. As old men, they both insisted the signing \u2014 an act of treason against Great Britain \u2014 had occurred on the fourth of July.\nFollowing the Declaration's publication in the Pennsylvania Evening Post, celebrations swept the nation. In New York, writes historian Benson Bobrick: \"... Washington had the army brigades drawn up at six p.m. to hear 'the United Colonies of America' declared Free and Independent States.\" Later that day, a jubilant crowd toppled the gargantuan statue of King George III that towered over Broadway. It would eventually be melted down for its metal and turned into 42,000 cartridges fired by the American army. Congress refrained from publishing the Declaration of Independence with a list of the signers until six months later when America won its first great victory in the war.\nWrote New Jersey delegate Richard Stockton, \"The man to whom the country is most indebted for the great measure of independency is Mr. John Adams of Boston,\" whom he called the \"Atlas of Independence.\" But Jefferson would be history's hero.

A proposal to that effect was presented to the US senate and is backed by Iraq\u2019s Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani.\nThe \u2018Kurdish Question\u2019 is also creating tensions between Iraq and its neighbours.

The move prompted harsh criticism, with some in Congress accusing President Barack Obama of jeopardizing the safety of the country with the exchange.\nWhile the military typically follows the recommendation from the preliminary hearing known as an Article 32, it\u2019s not unheard of for a general to make a different decision, said Walter Huffman, a retired major general who served as the Army\u2019s top lawyer.\nHuffman was surprised the more serious general court-martial was chosen, but he said the approach will allow the court to thoroughly consider the case with all punishments available.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of: \u2018Let\u2019s let the system decide.

Legal databases and media accounts turn up only a few misbehavior cases since 2001, when fighting began in Afghanistan, followed by Iraq less than two years later. In contrast, statistics show the U.S. Army prosecuted about 1,900 desertion cases between 2001 and the end of 2014.\nBergdahl hasn\u2019t talked publicly about what happened, but over the past several months, he spoke extensively with screenwriter Mark Boal, who shared about 25 hours of the recorded interviews with Sarah Koenig for her popular podcast, Serial.\nBergdahl\u2019s attorney, Eugene Fidell, said politicians and others have been using Bergdahl as a talking point to push their own agendas for months. The more the public can hear Bergdahl\u2019s own words, the better, Fidell told The Associated Press this month.\nIn one episode of Serial, Bergdahl said he walked off his base to cause a crisis that would catch the attention of military brass. He wanted to warn them about what he believed were serious problems with leadership in his unit. And he wanted to prove himself as a real-life action hero, like someone out of a movie."}

The debate over evolution vs. creationism -- once largely confined to the United States -- has arrived in a country known as the cradle of mankind.\nNot killing it fast enough, alas.\nFollowers of creationism believe in the literal truth of the Genesis account in the Bible that God created the world in six days. Bishop Adoyo believes the world was created 12,000 years ago, with man appearing 6,000 years later. He says each biblical day was equivalent to 1,000 Earth years.\nI'd love to know his scriptural justification for that last comment.\nThe museum, which attracts around 100,000 visitors a year, is taking no chances.\nTurkana Boy will be displayed in a private room, with limited access and behind a glass screen with 24-hour closed-circuit TV. Security guards will be at the entrance.\nInsurance coverage could run into millions of dollars, she added.\nIt's the damn missionaries fault. Evidently, not enough of them wound up in cooking pots.\nfalse beliefs in Africa.They're just to blame for the last few hundred years of such nonsence.\n12,000 years? Sigh. It's a rare occasion that I see that. I may be a creationist, but at least I am one of the home-grown-six-literal-days-6000-years-ago fanatic type of ones. I mean, if you are going to believe God had to take 1000 years to make light, then you might as well be an evolutionist.\nThe 6000/12000 years thing is a man thing which means it's worthless. There is no end of the harm men have done to others in the name of religion. I'm not voting either way, but wonder if anyone has any hard evidence that we are in fact related to Apes/Chimps. Mitochondrial DNA would show a common single female ancestor. 98% the same means nothing. We also have the same, but thankfully more DNA as a worm. Mitochondrial DNA would be the absolute proof of our direct link to chimps.\nWhether or not the bishop is correct in his dating, it's great to see someone in the church taking a public stand for God's word and creationism, and against evolution. All too often we see compromise in the church.\nThe media slant in the article is typical. The first mistake is that it presents the old 'scientists against a powerful evangelical Christian movement' canard, when truly the battle is against different worldviews... secular humanism or atheism against theism, particularly Christianity. The article also describes those who believe in creationism as followers, so I suppose those who believe in evolution would be the leadership? Or could we describe those who believe in evolution as followers too?\nHopefully the rest of the world will see stand the bishop is taking and more believers will also take a stronger stand for God's word.\nAs a Christian and as"}

Or if you got wind of a new state restaurant tax that could force your caf\u00e9 to shut down? You have more power to fight back than you think.\nGovernment isn&apos;t always the enemy--think law enforcement, road maintenance and other valuable services. But good or bad, it is a fact of business life. That&apos;s why learning how to influence officials is a survival skill for all companies, especially for small firms that are vulnerable to every local fee and regulation.\nDon&apos;t believe the myth that you&apos;re powerless without a pricey lobbyist. With some patience and practice, you can become your own best advocate--not just to defend your business, but to take advantage of government resources and get a leg up on public contracts. The first step? Make sure your advocacy is targeted to the official or public body in the best position to help you.\nThe right lobbying target is as important as the right sales prospect. You wouldn&apos;t pitch your brand of skinny jeans to plus-size customers. It&apos;s just as wasteful to indiscriminately pursue every official listed on a website. Instead, put some effort into identifying and learning about potential targets. It&apos;s a low-cost, high-return investment.\nFind the right level of government. Begin by choosing the level of government most likely to handle the matter that concerns you. Sometimes, you&apos;ll find more than one. If you want to fight sales taxes, for example, there are probably different assessments levied by your state, county and town. Similarly, it can be challenging to pin down the origin of a specific employment, environmental or public health regulation.\nIdentify where your issue has the most concentrated impact. Does it affect businesses on Main Street more than others in the region? If so, your most promising target is probably at city hall.\nFollow the money. Whatever your problem, you should approach the level of government that is sending you the bill or otherwise imposing a financial obligation. There's no point complaining to a state lawmaker about a county tax, for example.\nScrutinize key documents. Government paperwork can be dense and confusing. But it's worth checking carefully for names, titles, addresses, official stamps and seals.\nUse an array of information resources, and dig beneath the surface. Many novice researchers limit themselves to government websites. But you should also take advantage of other readily accessible resources, such as media archives, community blogs and political sites. It&apos;s not hard to find out, for example, how your potential targets voted, who gives money to their campaigns, what they are passionate about and who their enemies are. The deeper you dig, the more patterns you&apos;ll find in what each official says, does, supports and opposes. Later on, this information will help you lay the groundwork for a compelling advocacy message.\nTip: Many public bodies now web-stream and archive videos of their meetings. Even if these videos don&apos;t pertain to your issue, they&apos;re well worth viewing to get a sense of your target&apos;s personality and temperament.\nIf you can&apos;t find the information you want, file a Freedom of Information request. In most cases, when any level of government collects information, you have a right to it under federal Freedom of Information (FOI) laws--whether or not officials want"}

It had spent 27 months in space collecting charged particles blown from the Sun\u2019s outermost layer. That layer is thought to reflect the composition of the gas-and-dust cloud, known as the solar nebula, from which the solar system formed, about 4.6 billion years ago.\nScientists had hoped this primordial composition would provide a baseline to understand how different planets and meteorites later evolved such a wide range of isotopes of key elements such as oxygen and nitrogen.\nBut the capsule\u2019s crash landing threw that possibility into question after dirt from Utah\u2019s salt flats entered the ruptured science canister and most of the delicate wafers on the mission\u2019s five collector arrays shattered.\nHowever, mission members picked up the pieces, literally, and sought novel ways to study the particles. Now, preliminary studies offer fresh hope for the mission\u2019s science goals. They were reported on Tuesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas, US.\nThe mission\u2019s most important target was oxygen, which exists on different planets and meteorites in bafflingly different ratios of its three most common isotopes. Because the solar wind is 99% ions of hydrogen and helium, mission planners designed an instrument to repel these light elements and trap heavier ions such as oxygen at concentrations at least 20 times greater than normally found in the solar wind.\nThis instrument used a curved, electrically charged mirror to focus the heavy ions onto a target made of several ultra-pure materials. But because different isotopes of the same element react differently in an electric field, they segregate in different concentrations at different places on the target. So to get an accurate measurement of all the isotopes, this separation effect needed to be calibrated.\nResearchers used neon from the solar wind, a noble gas that is rare on Earth, to try to understand exactly how this separation worked. At first, the neon observations did not line up at all with predictions made before the samples were returned. \u201cWe were quite scared,\u201d says planetary scientist Rainer Wieler of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.\nResearchers were also anxious to know how well the samples collected by Genesis actually traced the composition of the early solar system.

{"idx": "27680", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The rerelease of Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 black-and-white film The Battle of Algiers, recreating France's suppression of the 1950s Algerian uprising, is an extraordinary experience. Granted, the audio dubbing of gunfire sounds a bit rickety now, and the way the intertitles switch between Italian and French is eccentric, but everything else makes this a newer-than-new release. It is of its time in many ways, yet somehow more extreme, and more contemporary, than anything else around. Famously, the Pentagon arranged a special in-house screening in 2003, evidently fascinated by exactly the same qualities that have mesmerised the movie's followers elsewhere: its icy candour on the subjects of counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, and the vital importance of torture in eliciting information.\nThose torture scenes are laid out in montage for us without any self-conscious emotional affect or drama; they include blowtorching the suspect's naked torso, waterboarding, and clipping electrodes to the earlobes before hand-cranking the voltage. These scenes are presented without any of the internal humanising or dramatising conflict that would be considered vital now: they do indeed look almost like a military training film. Another sort of director, possessed of a more conventional liberal scruple, might have felt the need to show a torturer's inner pain or the torturee's hidden backstory. But Pontecorvo shows them in terms of strategy.\nThe anti-hero is Colonel Mathieu, played by Jean Martin, the paratroop commander entrusted by the French government with putting down the Algerian revolt. He is a tough, wiry professional soldier of the sort adoringly imagined by Frederick Forsyth: a veteran of the French Resistance who shrugs his shoulders at any possible irony. He is the centrepiece to the most remarkable sequence, captured on the film's poster. At the head of his troops, he simply leads a triumphalist, introductory parade down the main street, to reassure loyal citizens that the French army will crush the terrorists - and to face down the terrorists themselves. He strides easily, casually, with no sidearm on show, utterly confident in the power of the spectacle he has created. With his fatigues, beret and faintly sinister sunglasses, he looks like a cross between a top para in Northern Ireland and an IRA chief. Mathieu's face moves in and out of shadow on this sunny day: the result of the natural light that Pontecorvo is using, and integral to his \"newsreel\" effect.\nThe French authorities first license a covert bomb attack in the casbah - \"state terrorism\" before the phrase was invented - but then, under Mathieu, they embark on a disciplined campaign of isolating terrorist cells, torturing them for the names of operatives further up the pyramid-chain until the key figures at the top are obliterated. No nonsense about hearts and minds: this is a military solution to a military problem. \"The culprits are presumed to be Muslim ...\" Mathieu crisply briefs his men, and a 2007 audience holds its breath. \"... so they will be able to hide more easily in the Arab quarters.\" This film was composed in an era when Islamic identity was not as important as it is today: there are no mosques, no religion here. Then the keyword was \"Arab\" and it easy to forget that as recently as the first Iraq war in "}

I've been asked why the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is so low for the spot price (18), but climbs to 25 by April and almost 30 by the end of the summer.\nOne answer: the Fed is expected to end Operation Twist at the end of June. Historically, market volatility picks up after the Fed has exited the markets. In Operation Twist, the Fed has extended the average maturity of the Fed's portfolio of Treasuries, a way of keeping rates low without printing more money and expanding the Fed's balance sheet.\nBernanke will be peppered with questions about the end of Operation Twist and asked about the prospects of QE3. It's not that I'm expecting any new policy to be announced (he wouldn't do it in this forum). But just his posture on the economy may indicate the Fed is existing the liquidity business for good...or not.\nAnother reason volatility is higher going out a few months: the presidential election.\nOne other factor affecting volatility farther out: the higher cost of supplying insurance. Think about this: banks provide money to buy puts and calls on the S&P 500, and everything else. But capital is dear now: for a bank to sell an option a year from now is more expensive for a bank than to sell an option a month from now.

In the middle class, the share of beneficiaries falls to just 6 percent.\nMeanwhile, 88.6 percent of the top 1 percent would still get tax cuts.\nThe depths of these disparities are further clarified when examining after-tax income. While in the lowest-income households\u2014in which 44 percent of children live\u2014after-tax income would tick up by 0.3 percent without considering the cost of the cuts, they would fall by 16 percent when you factor in the costs. For the middle class: up 1.3 percent before; down by nearly 3 percent after.\nAnd for the 1 percent, you ask? Their after-tax incomes would rise 11.5 percent without considering the costs of financing the cuts. With the pay-fors, their income would still rise by 11.3 percent.\nIn short, the burden of (eventually) paying for the wealthy\u2019s enormous tax cuts falls almost entirely on the poor and middle class. Trump\u2019s trickle-down tax cuts will only serve as a further accelerant for already-crippling levels of wealth and income inequality. Over the past 34 years, as The New York Times\u2019s David Leonhardt\u2019s illuminating chart shows us, the income of those in the top 99.999th percentile has grown exponentially while the growth rate of incomes for nearly everyone else has fallen.\nThe TPC report considered two other potential scenarios for measuring the costs; the one discussed here was the most regressive.

Attention is turning now to whether Taiwan can join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) later as a normal member despite the two sides\u2019 precarious relations. The government in Taipei said joining regional organizations was its right.\nChina says the bank to be launched later this year has 57 countries approved as founding members and will have an authorized capital of $100 billion, of which China is expected to contribute about half.\nExperts say China stuck to its principle of letting only sovereign states join the bank as founding members. Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, not as a separate country. Wu Chung-li, a political science research fellow with Taipei-based institute Academia Sinica, said allowing Taiwan to join would have sent a message.\n\u201cIf the Beijing government lets Taiwan be a founding member, it might give an impression Taiwan is a sovereign state, and then how about Hong Kong and Macau?\u201d asked Wu.\nHong Kong and Macau are ruled by China but with a degree of autonomy, and many in Hong Kong are pushing Beijing for more self-rule.\nBeijing\u2019s new institution, which is set up like the World Bank, will provide funding to power plants, transportation projects and urban redevelopment in emerging parts of the 4.3 billion-person continent. The infrastructure bank is also seen as an extension of Beijing\u2019s global clout. The United States, and some rights groups, has expressed reservations about policies governing the bank's loans, saying they may lack the similar safeguards for protecting human rights and the environment that govern the World Bank's projects.\nTaiwan President Ma Ying-jeou said last week participation in the infrastructure bank would give Taiwan\u2019s construction industry a chance to expand by winning contracts around the region.\nThe rejection has hurt President Ma\u2019s image at home, where his approval ratings already hover below 20 percent in many surveys. Taiwan\u2019s chief opposition party said the government was rushed and irresponsible in asking to be a founding member of the infrastructure bank.\nBut Taiwan\u2019s governmental Mainland Affairs Council says it will apply again to become a regular member of the infrastructure bank as long as Beijing treats it with respect, including a name that does not imply both sides belong to one country. China said Monday it would be open to the application.\nLin Chong-pin, a retired strategic studies professor in Taiwan, said the two sides can probably work out a deal.\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s attitude is to welcome Taiwan to join later, not as a founding member. The question is what name. These options can be worked out, because there has been precedent,\u201d said Lin.\nThe two sides are expected to agree on a membership name for Taiwan that neither implies statehood nor suggests it is part of China.

As USA Today has noted, \u201closers\u201d is Trump\u2019s go-to epithet. He\u2019s applied the term to the Standard & Poor\u2019s credit-ratings agency, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, George Will, Cher, Salon, Huffington Post, Karl Rove, Graydon Carter, Marc Cuban, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, the Club for Growth, Ana Navarro, The New York Daily News, a Scottish farmer who tried to keep him from building a golf course, and the Republican Party, among others. Maybe the term will prove effective in undermining the aura of rebellious cool that attracts some young Muslims to ISIS, as my Atlantic colleague Uri Friedman suggests, although I have my doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to arbitrate what young Muslims find hip.\nBut regardless of the label\u2019s efficacy, calling ISIS \u201closers\u201d says a lot about Trump. America\u2019s leaders speak about jihadist terrorists a bit like they speak about Adolf Hitler. Since both are synonymous with evil, politicians identify them with whichever attributes they find particularly odious. (Thus, for the NRA, one of Hitler\u2019s most salient characteristics was his support for gun control.) Since 9/11, every American president has emphasized a different aspect of jihadist depravity. In his speech to a joint session of Congress nine days after September 11, George W. Bush called the 9/11 hijackers \u201cenemies of freedom.\u201d That\u2019s not a particularly accurate description of their motivations. Al-Qaeda\u2019s primary beef has always been with American foreign policy, not America\u2019s democracy. (Otherwise why not attack Costa Rica?) But for Bush, who wanted to use the attacks to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the association was useful. Defining the hijackers as freedom\u2019s enemies accentuated the values he held dear, and the agenda he wished to pursue.\nPresident Obama tended to define al-Qaeda and ISIS less as purveyors of tyranny than of bigotry and unreason, a scourge he believed extended beyond the Muslim world. In a 2014 speech at the United Nations, Obama called jihadist terrorists people who \u201cpeddle only fanaticism and hate\u201d and argued \u201cthat humanity\u2019s future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or sect, race or religion.\u201d If Bush was trying to link al-Qaeda with Saddam Hussein, Obama was linking it to militant Jewish settlers in the West Bank, Marine Le Pen, and Dylann Roof.\nIn selecting the term \u201closers,\u201d Trump considered and rejected an alternative: \u201cmonsters.\u201d He explained that, \u201cI won\u2019t call them monsters because they would like that term. They would think that\u2019s a great name.\u201d I suspect that\u2019s wrong. While monster is a reasonable description of people who purposely kill children, it\u2019s not the way ISIS terrorists view themselves.

The authors estimate that without government intervention, the total number of deaths could double by 2050.\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, identifies particulate matter as the prime pollutant leading to premature mortality. Particulate matter, a substance formed as a combination of different materials released into the air, is thought to be harmful to human health once it exceeds 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Researchers also identified ozone as a contributor to dangerous air quality.\nThe causes of air pollution vary dramatically from place to place. In India and China, the study says, emissions from residential heating and cooking drive air pollution by creating unhealthy quantities of smoke. Overall, residential heating emissions cause one third of air pollution-related deaths worldwide.\nIn highly regulated areas, like the United States, Europe and Japan, emissions from agriculture tend to be primary contributors to air pollution. Fertilizer used in agriculture releases ammonia into the atmosphere, a process that creates harmful particulate matter. Globally, air pollution from agriculture kills more than 600,000 people annually, the study finds.\nThe findings are consistent with a 2014 report from the World Health Organization that suggested that 7 million deaths occur annually due to both indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nThe study\u2019s conclusions give a sense of urgency to efforts to reduce air pollution but present challenges because of difficulty regulating heating activity in people\u2019s homes, according to study author Jos Lelieveld. People who live in the most affected areas should be provided with information about less toxic heating methods, he said.\nAir pollution contributes to a variety of ailments that eventually lead to premature mortality like lung cancer, stroke and heart failure, according to the study. Another study published this week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reached similar conclusions showing the devastating effects of pollution on individual health. Researchers found that chronic exposure to particulate matter increases the chance of early death by 3%. That risk is especially high for heart disease; the chance a person will die of heart disease increases by around 10% with chronic exposure to particulate matter.\nResearchers found that the number of deaths is expected to double by 2050 without new government policies. Nearly all of the increase will occur in Asia, according to the report."}

As fear intrudes in our holiday planning and security guards keep a round-the-clock watch on our national icons, it seems the political-correctness police are building a case on Santa.\nThis week some Victorian kindergartens decided that since Santa is the concoction of one cultural-religious arm of Australia, it may be best to stop the jolly bloke from potentially crushing feelings of the others.\nSeveral said they would ban him from their premises.\nBut as the kinder-management umbrella group Kindergarten Parents Victoria suggested yesterday that the need to respect all religions and cultures meant it was better to go without Santa this year, no less a Christmas spokesman than the Prime Minister stepped in to defend him. John Howard told listeners to Neil Mitchell's 3AW radio show that he was pro-Santa.\n\"I believe in Santa . . . I'm no longer a child but I believed in Santa when I was a kid and Santa is for children, so therefore I believe in Santa,\" he said.\nHe said the anti-Santa lobby \"is being foolishly slavish to political correctness. I cannot for the life of me understand that any canon of tolerance in this country requires us to abandon Santa\".

It's a ridiculous overreaction.\"\nIn a veiled reference to Mr Howard, Mr Crean said later: \"We encouraged our children to believe in Santa Claus but like most children they grew beyond it. It seems some never did.\"\nJohn Dalziel, of the Salvation Army in Victoria, which hands out 80,000 Christmas gifts to needy families, said it was wrong that the image of Santa caused discomfort to people other than white Christians.\nHe said Santa was a symbol of an Australian tradition, and that many Australian Muslim families made use of the Salvation Army's Christmas help to be a part of that tradition.\n\"It's an Australian cultural event, and is celebrated in two parallel ways: the first is as a cultural event, and then as a Christian event.\n\"But I have to confess that it's first a cultural and then a Christian event.\"\nHe said Father Christmas was not a religious invention, \"he's just the spirit of Christmas\". He had been criticised by religious people for having Father Christmas appear at Salvation Army events. \"My answer was exactly the same: he's the spirit of Christmas.\"\nThe corporate affairs spokesman for one of Santa's primary employers, the Myer Grace Bros department store chain, agreed.\n\"Santa is a symbol of Christmas, which is as much about family and community, and in most cases that goes beyond religious borders or boundaries,\" said John Gillman.\nAnd nurse Lyn Crellin, the care manager and liver transplant coordinator at the Royal Children's Hospital, confirmed that children from all backgrounds got a lift from Santa.\n\"I've worked a lot of Christmas days because it's such a great day - it just gives the children a huge thrill, and anyone who's seen the look of joy on the children's faces when he comes around wouldn't even think of banning it.\"\n\u2022Christmas presents for needy families can be donated to the Salvation Army at any Kmart or Salvation Army store."}

{"idx": "27721", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Once there was a band and a little girl who desperately wanted to play the drums. The band was the Beatles, and I was the little girl. My love of the drums was directly proportionate to my love for Ringo, the drummer who had been dubbed the \"shy one.\"\nI was in grade school at the time, and the school offered free music lessons before school to any student with a signed permission slip and his or her own instrument. My sister had started taking flute lessons the year before, but I had no interest in learning to play any instrument I couldn't sing along with. Besides, I wanted to be like Ringo. The drums were my obvious choice.\nWhen I asked my parents if I could sign up for drum lessons, they told me that little girls didn't play the drums. Even my grandmother, who usually wanted me to have anything I wanted, was horrified at the idea of her dear little granddaughter playing a \"masculine\" instrument. She said that some instruments, like flutes and clarinets, were \"feminine\" and other instruments, like trumpets and drums, were \"masculine.\" Apparently the piano fell into the \"unisex\" category, because she had already taught me to play the piano and she also encouraged my male cousins to take piano lessons.\nMy parents told me that they'd be happy to sign me up for band lessons if I would choose the appropriate instrument. I said it was the drums or nothing. I got nothing.\nSometime later I sneaked into the room where the band lessons were being given with the excuse of seeing my sister. In the corner a boy was learning to do a drum- roll. He had no drums, only drumsticks, and since the lessons were given in the cafeteria, he practiced drumming on the table. I watched closely and listened to the teacher, and when I got back to my class I practiced on my desk with two pencils.\nAs I grew older, I became more and more interested in singing. Judy Collins and Peter, Paul, and Mary were popular, and I could easily imagine myself as a folk singer. I collected notebooks full of folk songs and decided I needed more training. I auditioned for the school choir, and although my voice wasn't particularly strong, the director was pleased with me and said they could always use another alto.\nI rushed home to tell the folks, but they weren't as pleased as the director was when I told them I was an alto.\n\"No, you're not, you're a soprano,\" my mother insisted. \"You and your sister have always been sopranos.\"\n\"That was when I was little,\" I explained. \"Now I'm an alto.\"\n\"Girls sing soprano,\" my father said. \"Only boys sing down low.\"\n\"Well, I'm a girl and I sing low,\" I defended.\n\"It isn't right,\" he said. \"Everyone knows girls are supposed to sing soprano.\"\nThey didn't actually forbid me to join the choir, but I had a scheduling conflict with another class. That, plus their disapproval, made me decide against joining the choir. But still I kept singing on my own.\nOn my 19th birthday, when I was away at college, I asked for and got a set of bongos from my parents. They were so easy to play that I didn't need any lessons, and I found to my delight that the drumroll I had learned so long ago with two pencils sounded great when I played it with my fingers on the bongos.\nOne of my greatest joys in college"}

A thin LED that runs horizontally along the center of the bottom panels illuminates the lower part of the speaker system according to whatever mode it's in.\nThe front panel consists of a dark gray, metallic speaker grille, with the Sony logo in the upper left corner. Along the top panel is a battery status LED, a speakerphone button, volume control, and a lock/release switch for the built-in kick stand.

That represents a gain of almost $871 billion since the third quarter of 2016. Most homeowners recognize that having more equity in their homes is a good thing, but do they know how to leverage it \u2013 and capitalize on it?\nSavvy homeowners are leveraging this jump in home equity through home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. A HELOC is a line of credit extended to a homeowner that uses the borrower's home as collateral. Borrowers are pre-approved for a certain spending limit based on the equity they have accrued in their home and can draw against this limit for various uses.\nThis kind of loan option is particularly popular for those who are financing home repairs after the long, harsh winter and for those who are looking to renovate their homes and outdoor spaces for the warmer summer months. In fact, TD Bank\u2019s recent Spring Home Lending Survey found that property values have increased over the last 12 to 18 months for 69 percent of respondents, and close to half (42 percent) said that they are somewhat, very or extremely likely to apply for a HELOC within the next 18 months.\nCompared to borrowing funds from short-term loans or using a credit card, one of the reasons HELOCs are attractive is because they\u2019re one of the lowest-cost borrowing options for a homeowner. They also give borrowers the freedom to choose between a fixed or variable interest rate option.\nA fixed-rate option can save customers money by not only dropping their interest rate, but also allowing them to pay off the debt in a time frame they choose. HELOCs can also be helpful in consolidating debt at a lower interest rate. Borrowers have immediate access to low-interest funds, which can be useful for those who are looking to pay off debt.\nFollowing a tough winter, many homeowners are dreaming of updating their patio furniture, putting in a pool or adding a garden, and are leveraging the boom in home equity to do so. TD\u2019s survey also found that the most popular uses for HELOCs were home renovations and repairs (53 percent), major home purchases like appliances (28 percent) and debt consolidation (26 percent). An added benefit for those financing a home renovation with a HELOC is that some of the costs may be tax deductible.\nFor those who are using a HELOC to finance repairs and renovations, the most common updates needed are window replacements (35 percent), and heat or air conditioning system replacements (33 percent), and structural repairs (32 percent). The top three cosmetic renovations are bathroom updates (37 percent), kitchen updates (36 percent) and exterior painting (26 percent).\nHELOCs are also a sensible option for those looking to increase their home\u2019s value to sell during the summer homebuying season. More than one-third of respondents looking to renovate said they\u2019re doing so to increase the value of their home. Potential sellers should get smart on what can derail a home inspection, however, like a leaking water heater or a loose shingle on the roof, and consider leveraging a HELOC, which can then be paid off at the closing table during a sale.\nHomeowners have seen equity increase,"}

It's not ready for routine use, as more work is needed to verify its accuracy. But it also may prove valuable in finding more at-risk babies to study what causes the developmental disorder.\n\"There are subtle signs of autism at one year if you just look for them,\" said neuroscientist Karen Pierce of the University of California, San Diego, who led the study. \"Let's just get these kids detected early and treated early.\"\nRecent data suggest about 1 in 100 U.S. children has some form of autism, which ranges from mild to severe problems with behavior, communication and socialization. The American Academy of Pediatrics already urges autism screening during regular doctor visits at ages 18 months and 24 months. Yet a 2009 study found that on average, children aren't diagnosed until they're 5.\nExperts say early therapy can lessen autism's severity, even if they don't know exactly what types will prove best. \"The earlier you start, the better,\" said Dr. Lisa Gilotty of the National Institute of Mental Health, which helped fund the study.\nHence the interest in younger screening.\n\"This is very exciting work, to think we may be able to identify children with autism this early,\" said Dr. Susan Hyman of the University of Rochester and a pediatrics academy autism specialist, who wasn't involved in the new study.\nBut, she cautioned, it's not clear how best to do that: \"I don't think screening for autism at 12 months is ready for prime time.\"\nThursday's study uses a 24-question checklist written in easy-to-understand terms that parents can answer in about five minutes. It was developed a few years ago to detect broader signs of language or developmental delays. Pierce signed up 137 pediatricians to use the questionnaire during every 1-year checkup and refer babies who failed for further testing. Those youngsters were re-evaluated every six months to age 3, when a diagnosis could be certain.\nOf 10,479 babies screened, 184 who were sent for further testing followed through <0x2014> and 32 eventually were diagnosed with autism, Pierce reported Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.\nThat's consistent with expected rates of detection that young; Rochester's Hyman said some forms of autism don't become apparent until age 2 or even later.\nNumerous other children were diagnosed with language delay or some other developmental problems, so that in the end, the screening accurately predicted some problem in 75 percent of those kids, Pierce calculated. But there were false alarms for 1 in 4, who had no problems.\nThe children began treatment at around 19 months. In addition, Pierce's program does MRI scans and other tests as part of broader research into autism's biological underpinnings, studies now limited by the few numbers of babies being identified as at risk when they're so young.\nOne big"}

Her aesthetic is often futuristic, but she also appears to have come from a bygone age when getting dressed was considered a demanding form of self-expression, rather than an opportunity to wallow in spandex-enabled comfort.\n\"Once, in Malibu, she lost a nineteen-thirties Cartier bracelet in the sand; after searching for it in vain, she remarked to a friend, insouciantly, that someone with a metal detector would have the find of his life.\"\nThe change in Guinness' life wrought by her 2000 divorce from Greek shipping magnate Spyros Niarchos, whom she had married at 19, was significant. Says a friend (who should probably be familiarized with the New Yorker's own Stop That Metaphor department): \"She had been in this jewelled Faberg\u00e9 cage, which turned into a pressure cooker, and then she came out of it like Venus on the half shell.\"\nGuinness' family background is aristocracy times money to the nth degree. She is the daughter of Jonathan Guinness, who is a baron and an heir to the Guinness beer fortune, and his second wife, Suzanne Lisney. Jonathan Guinness' mother was Diana Mitford, the writer, translator, and notorious Nazi sympathiser and lifelong Fascist. Daphne was close with Mitford's second husband, the politician (and founder of the British Union of Fascists) Sir Oswald Moseley: \"I used to go and stay in Paris with him, and I would sleep in his dressing room, and he would treat one like a complete adult \u2014 there would be these fascinating conversations around the dinner table about books, politics, art, whatever. He was a very, very clever man.\" She was also close with her grandmother, but was apparently disgusted by her politics.\nShe remains dismayed that Diana never publicly recanted her admiration for Hitler, whom Diana had got to know in the thirties after travelling to Germany to visit her sister Unity, who had become part of der F\u00fchrer's inner circle. \"My grandmother had grown up in the countryside, and she hadn't been to school, and then she goes to Germany, and Unity is there, and then she becomes very friendly with him,\" Guinness said. \"I can't imagine he was charming \u2014 he's the most uncharming person I've ever seen, Hitler.\" She recalled discussing the matter with Diana. \"I said, 'Granny, it just can't be right,' and she just said, 'He didn't photograph well.'

Her family has been in the area for more than a century, Bayley Clough said.\nHer idea is to boost buying from the co-op to supply her restaurants, offering better prices and more business to local lobstermen. Deed covenants on the co-op building prevent further expansion anyway, she said.\nBut William Hamill, a clammer and member of the town\u2019s shellfish conservation commission, worries that a sale could eliminate one of the only local places that fishermen have to sell a catch, buy and store bait and find reliable parking.\n\u201cIf the bait cooler was to go away and it was to cease being a buying station for clams and lobsters, it would make Pine Point much more difficult and less appealing to fishermen,\u201d Hamill said.\nFor Hamill and others, the situation mirrors contests playing out on the Maine coast as traditional marine businesses compete with new commercial development for scarce waterfront real estate.\nPortland recently established a task force to mediate conflicting waterfront uses, and there is a drawn-out battle over proposed zoning plans to allow new hotels and tourism in Boothbay Harbor. Smaller skirmishes over waterfront access and aquaculture are being waged across the state.\nThe restaurants that Bayley Clough and her husband own have increased traffic and changed the character of the neighborhood, Hamill said, and he\u2019s concerned about more changes.\nThe co-op got its start when the town gave land to a fishermen\u2019s association in 1964.

With the continued growth of their national lender member network, TMC has increased the size and scope of their engagement programs to offer even more opportunities for their members to network and collaborate.\nEarlier this year, TMC released their newly enhanced TMC Benchmark platform, a free monthly solution that collects the 45 production, operating, and performance metrics deemed most vital by their members and offers a dashboard report. The dashboard displays their data alongside a summary comparison for other members in the network, enabling a member to see how they stack up against others in the industry, as well as their peer group within it.\nParticipating members can see their data broken down by retail, wholesale, and correspondent channels (if applicable), giving TMC members access to the mortgage industry\u2019s only monthly data benchmarking solution as part of membership.\nTMC\u2019s Collaboration Labs have continued to expand since the spring of 2017. The \u201cdeep-dive\u201d networking sessions with peers of similar size and scope are immensely popular among TMC lender members. Participants discuss strategic initiatives important to each participating firm. Member interest has driven the expansion of existing Labs to include additional members. Over 40 percent of TMC lender members have participated in a Collaboration Lab thus far in 2018 and more are planned in Q4.\nAdditionally, TMC\u2019s Working Groups, an initiative that connects like professionals within the network, has also seen tremendous growth. TMC members meet via regular conference calls and at industry events to connect and collaborate on the important issues facing the mortgage industry. The initiative currently includes a CRA Working Group, Women\u2019s Networking Group, Servicing Professionals Working Group and Marketing Working Group, with plans for a Capital Markets Working Group to start later this year.\nFor more information on any of the programs above or the other benefits of membership within The Mortgage Collaborative, contact TMC COO Rich Swerbinsky at rswerbinsky@mtgcoop.com.\nBased in San Diego, The Mortgage Collaborative was founded in 2013 to empower mortgage lenders across the country with better financial execution, reduced costs, enhanced expertise, improved compliance, and to help its members access the dynamic and changing consumer base in America.\nThe association is managed by its founding members: John Robbins, CMB; David Kittle, CMB; Gary Acosta, CEO of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP); and Jim Park, former chair of the Asian Real Estate Association of America (AREAA).

A fierce wind of -20C blights the winter, there is a third as much oxygen in the air as in Moscow, and the two-month arid, nightless summer is plagued by relentless mosquitoes that seem to turn your arm black as they swarm. Yet its hardships are matched by its profitability, and are endured by 18,000 workers harvesting for the Russian state the biggest natural gas reserve on earth.\nBeneath this expanse of sand and marsh straddling the Arctic Circle are an estimated 4.5 trillion cubic metres of gas, enough to meet UK demand for about 45 years. Zhenia Nemyikin, a 24-year-old technician who came to the Urengurskoye complex from a small Siberian town to earn \u00a3400 a month, swats the mosquitoes away. \"It's never that nice here,\" he grins, checking the valve on one of the pipes that extends 3km down into the gas reserve. \"But working for the state here gives us a guarantee. Our wages are regular.\"\nThe field's 16 gas wells are owned by Gazprom, a state-controlled behemoth that is slowly mopping up much of Russia's erratically privatised energy resources, and much more besides. As if the USSR had not collapsed but instead hired management consultants and issued shares, Gazprom runs the regional city Novi Urengoi with martial efficiency.\nThe town is closed to foreigners now as it was in Soviet times because of its \"strategic significance\", stuck out here in the brutal tundra as a base for further Arctic energy exploration, and to ferry Russia's mammoth reserves to the open market. \"The psychology here has not changed too much since Soviet times,\" says Nikolai Tucha, deputy head of social development at the plant. \"People think they work for the state.\"\nIgor Vegera, head of extraction point one at the Urengurskoye complex, points to a map on his office wall, showing how a pipeline network already takes the gas from his plant across western Europe. \"In principle, the empire already stretches to Spain,\" he jokes. Britain will soon be a major recipient, as Russia positions itself as a key energy supplier to the west.\nIn a world where oil and gas will become increasingly precious commodities that dictate global alliances, the Kremlin hopes plants such as Urengurskoye can restore its Soviet geopolitical might. Last month President Vladimir Putin announced a \"Northern European\" gas pipeline, to run from the pan-Russian gas network to the Baltic Russian port of Vyborg and then on to Germany, that will supply by 2010 about 55 billion cubic metres a year. By then it should have been extended on to the UK, bringing Urengurskoye gas to your kitchen hob.\nYet at the same time as the west is buying into Russia, some argue that Putin is driving his country down a profoundly undemocratic path, quietly reasserting the sort of centralised Kremlin control reminiscent of the Soviet era. When Putin made his G8 debut in June 2000, he was the polished ex-KGB agent, the smooth reformer, to many in the west a safe pair of hands with whom they could finally do business.

It passed unanimously with the declaration \"that secrecy in government is inherently inconsistent with a true democracy \u2026 that the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for them to know.\"\nNow, in the name of sensitivity to the families of homicide victims, the Connecticut task force, by a 14-3 vote (I was one of the three), is recommending to exempt from disclosure homicide crime scene photos and 911 calls.\nThe legislature's leadership appointed the 17-member task force with a built-in majority favoring privacy and secrecy.

That\u2019s a 10% jump since 2012. However, few consumers identify the practice as \u201cTV Everywhere\u201d -- a term and logo the Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM) adopted last year in a bid to unite all the services under one identifier. Only a quarter of consumers ages 13-64 had even heard of the expression, about the same as in 2012.\nYet the practice continues to grow, with 42% of consumers having used TVE offerings from their service providers, and 46% having used TV network services and apps. The connection between provider and access isn\u2019t being made in the minds of consumers, Tice says. A little push might help that along.\nStill, there are still barriers to widespread TVE usage, Tice says. In particular, the authentication needed to use the service continues to discourage some adopters, he says.\n1 comment about \"Consumers Use 'TV Everywhere,' Don't Know What It Is\".\nCTAM TVE from CTAM, December 18, 2015 at 2:44 p.m.\nLet's clarify. TV Everywhere is the category name the industry chose to describe the experience of watching TV on multiple mobile and connected devices as a benefit of the pay-tv subscription. The intention was never to build it as a highly-recognized consumer brand, but rather to create an umbrella term to connect the myriad content and MVPD brands in the marketplace to a singular viewing experience. That said, we agree there is more work to be done to build consumer understanding and reduce the barriers to usage -- and we're doing that work.\nIn terms of measuring progress, CTAM and our member companies more closely monitor consumers' aided awareness of the experience as described vs. recall of the category name. Last summer HUB Research pegged aided awareness among MVPD subscribers at 57% and usage a minimum of once/month at 43%. We can't predict the time of the next significant increase, but remain bullish that there will be one."}

And today, the Belgian Post Group, also known as bpost, announced its latest move to bulk up its operations in North America. It has acquired Radial, the fulfilment company formerly known as eBay enterprise, for $820 million.\nThis is important because Radial is considered to be Amazon\u2019s largest competitor for fulfilment in the U.S., tapping into deliveries not just from huge retailers but hundreds of smaller businesses and startups, accounting for around 20 percent of all eCommerce orders that flow between the U.S. and E.U. today, the company said.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of this acquisition that represents a great leap forward for bpost, promoting us as a leading player in the e-commerce logistics business in the Benelux, Europe and throughout the world,\u201d said Koen Van Gerven, CEO of bpost, in a statement.\nNotably, though, $820 million is not actually a great exit for Sterling Partners, which had been the group most recently backing Radial. When eBay enterprise was first divested by eBay and sold to a Permira-led consortium in 2015, its value was $925 million, which itself was a pretty significant drop compared the $2.4 billion eBay paid when it first acquired the basis of eBay enterprise in 2011.\nWhile many think of Alibaba out of China, or the world\u2019s biggest employer and retailer Walmart out of the U.S., when they consider who might be Amazon\u2019s closest rivals in the world of e-commerce, this deal underscores another area where the company is competing hard. E-commerce and retail industries are putting a lot of effort into fulfilment and logistics to improve operations and margins.\nBpost, which has around $2.9 billion in revenues annually, has been on an acquisition spree in the last year and a half, buying a number of smaller delivery companies both in freight and last-mile delivery both in North America and Europe to expand its economies of scale. They have included buying somewhat anonymous-sounding but actually huge companies like Freight Distribution Management, as well as more consumer-focused businesses like Matt\u2019s Express and Apple Express. It also tried but ultimately backed away from buying PostNL, the Dutch incumbent postal service.\nBpost has also entered into some deep partnerships with the likes of DHL and started its own small startup-style efforts (such as Bringr, an app to let you find delivery services) to build out its efforts.\nRadial will essentially bolt on a lot of scale to that business, and specifically in the U.S..

Rowling herself, the films are set many years before the Harry Potter series and follow Newt Scamander, a British wizard who studies magical creatures. The first film was released in 2016, and the second, \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d is in theaters now.\nAmong other things, the films delve into the backstory of Albus Dumbledore, who serves as a mentor to Harry Potter throughout the original series. The films also introduce Gellert Grindelwald, a powerful dark wizard often compared to Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort.\nSince I\u2019ve read all the Harry Potter books and seen all the original movies, I knew I had to check out \u201cFantastic Beasts.\u201d In my opinion, the prequel series doesn\u2019t come close to the quality of the original, but my real disappointment isn\u2019t with the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies. It\u2019s with the books.\nIn case you haven\u2019t seen them, Rowling has released two \u201cbooks\u201d to accompany each of the already-released \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies, but they aren\u2019t really even books. They\u2019re essentially the movies\u2019 screenplays presented in book form.\nI first discovered this disappointment in 2016 after seeing the first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movie in theaters. When I heard \u201cthrough the grapevine\u201d that Rowling had released a book to go along with the movie, I rushed to the bookstore and grabbed it off the shelf, expecting a typical novel.\nOnce I flipped through the pages and realized it was the screenplay, I couldn\u2019t have been more frustrated. Maybe I should\u2019ve done more research on the book before going to the bookstore, but I never expected to make such a disappointing discovery.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m sure many die-hard Harry Potter fans have bought the screenplays and read them cover to cover. But I don\u2019t quite see the point in watching the movie, then reading the same thing in book form.\nNow, if Rowling had written actual books based on the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies, I would\u2019ve been all for that, as I suspect many other fans would. Rowling did publish a \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d guidebook in 2001, but it also isn\u2019t a traditional book, and it doesn\u2019t cover the wide breadth that the films are expected to cover.\nKnowing a little about Rowling\u2019s writing process, I\u2019m almost certain she had enough material to write traditional novels to go with her \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies. I can\u2019t guess at her reasons for not writing them, but I will say I believe she missed a great opportunity to reenergize her fan base."}
{"idx": "27772", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The U.S. is preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan over the next year, but may leave a corrupt and highly dysfunctional country in its wake.\nIf the Obama administrations wants to show that the Afghan security forces and the Afghan government can survive the U.S. troop withdrawal scheduled for 2014, it may need to do more to address the rampant corruption that endangers Afghanistan and, ultimately, U.S. interest there.\nThe U.S. has recently staged two major events on Afghanistan. First, on July 7, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Afghanistan would be officially designated as a \"non-Nato ally of the United States\" which makes it eligible for priority delivery of military hardware and U.S. help in buying arms and equipment. But the U.S. has thus far failed to indicate what level and kind of troop support -- or what type of other security capabilities -- will be available for Afghanistan after the hand-off.\nSecond, on July 8, the U.S. joined in an announcement of the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework under which 70 international donors pledged $16 billion dollars over the next four years to make up Afghan fiscal shortfall and to improve institutions and services in the country, with up to 20 percent supposedly conditioned on Afghan progress in addressing corruption and creating better governance.\nBut the framework document bears little resemblance to a nation that Transparency International designates the third most corrupt in the world (176 out of 178), that the World Bank gauges the world's eleventh poorest, and that has absorbed more than $80 billion in non-military aid from the U.S. in the past 10 years with few concrete, let alone durable, gains. As Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies writes, \"The lack of transparency and credibility has been a critical problem ... particularly in the almost total lack of credibility in reporting on the impact of aid, quality and integrity of governance and presence of a functioning justice system.\"\nBut neither the U.S \"ally\" announcement nor the donor announcement candidly address the fundamental question: Can Afghanistan survive as a fighting force and national government after 2014? Will ethnic rivalries among the Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, and other groups; will renewed military pressure from the Taliban; will subversion by Pakistan; will the weakness and corruption of the central government lead to a civil war, a coup, a Taliban resurgence, or a territory run by tribal leaders and local militia? Such post-2014 developments could even allow a recidivist Afghanistan to again serve as a sanctuary for world terrorism -- a true tragedy in light of nearly 2,000 American killed, 16,000 American wounded, 12,000 Afghan civilian deaths, and U.S. expenditures of $400 billion or more to date.\nThe recurrent riddle of Afghanistan is that an effective Afghan Army and security effort depends on developing a legitimate Afghan state that can somehow command the allegiance of the disparate ethnic groups, develop accountable institutions, and nurture an economy that does not depend on opium and can help government pay its bills without significant foreign aid. Yet that goal seems as much a chimera today as it did ten years ago. And a critical preserve and adverse factor preventing development of a legitimate Afghan state -- given all the tribal and ethnic decentralizing forces -- is the endemic and corrosive corruption that has bedeviled and baffled the Americans.\nThe litany of corruption issues in"}

Comtois, commander of the 919th SOW. \"This particular aircraft has almost 24,000 flight hours and has been through a number of pretty significant missions.\"\nThe aircraft was flown for 47 years and arrived at Duke Field in 1995, he said.\n\"The hair on my neck is standing up just being next to this airplane,\" said George Ferkes, a retired Air Force pilot who flew the plane for more than 20 years. \"We flew this plane from Norway down to Africa. When I saw it again, it was like, 'Whoa, I'm back home.' \"\nThe aircraft is best known for leading the air commando assault on the Son Tay prison camp in 1970 during the Vietnam War to try to rescue American POWs.\nAlthough the prisoners had been moved before the raid, the mission has been considered a success based on its execution and use of military assets.\n\"It's bittersweet as we celebrate the end of the legacy,\" said Col. Buck Elton with the 8th Special Operations Wing at Cannon. \"It's also exciting because there are new aircraft coming behind it.\"\nDuke Field will retire all five of its remaining MC-130s by late 2013. The planes will be replaced by twin-engine, high-wing, light mobility aircraft, Comtois said.\nThe actual planes Duke will receive have not been announced, he said.\nAfter the MC-130 arrives at Canon, Lt. Col. Leon Franklin, the pilot during the Son Tay raid, will help turn it off for the last time.\nMoments before the MC-130 lifted off, Ferkes stood beside it and let the past roll over him.\n\"There are lots of memories with this old baby,\" said Ferkes, who plans to travel to Canon to see it. \"This is not just a piece of metal. Each plane has its own personality and has had different experiences and different missions. There is an amazing history with this airplane.\"\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 Northwest Florida Daily News.

{"idx": "27776", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Because false positives and false negatives are common, it's recommended that children only undergo allergy tests when absolutely needed.\nA clinical report in the journal Pediatrics warns against overuse of allergy tests. Because positive tests offer only circumstantial evidence that a child has an allergy and false positives are common, unneeded allergy tests can end up doing more harm than good.\nThe report is designed to give pediatricians more guidance regarding when allergy testing is called for and when it isn't. The guidelines in the report will be useful for parents as well.\nThe purpose of an allergy test should be to help confirm a suspected allergy, not to look for an allergy in a person or child that doesn't show any symptoms of one. Allergy tests are simply one weapon in the arsenal used to find out if a suspected allergy exists. They should never be used as standalone evidence that a child has an allergy. Yet too often, they are.\nAre Hypoallergenic Dogs Just Hype?\nFor example, in children with moderate to severe asthma, an allergy test could be helpful. That's because asthma is often triggered by an allergy to cockroaches, pets, dust mites, pollen, or other substances. But testing for an allergy to these substances in a child without any symptoms is basically a fishing expedition.\nMost allergy tests look for production of specific antibodies after exposure to a substance like peanuts or pollen or dogs. Skin prick tests look for a swelling or weal after scratching a test substance onto the surface of the skin. Blood tests measure the amount of specific antibodies circulating in the blood after an injection of the suspect substance.\nAllergies can have serious medical consequences. Sensitivity rarely has any consequences at all.\nIt does someone little good to find out that they're sensitive to peanuts, pets, or pollen if it doesn't cause a medical problem. But it could cause people to lose a pet, avoid the outdoors, or change their diet needlessly.\nAllergy tests to peanuts turn up positive in up to eight percent of children, yet only one in eight children who test positive turn out to have a peanut allergy. It's a case where a little knowledge can do more harm than good.\nChronic rhinitis is another condition where children might benefit from an allergy test. Rhinitis is a catch-all term for irritation, swelling, or congestion in the nose. Sometimes it's due to an allergy, sometimes it isn't. An allergy test can help point a finger at an allergic cause. But taking an allergy test simply to see if one is allergic to pollen isn't recommended.\nAnother drawback of allergy tests is that they can give false negatives as well as false positives. And while a strong positive reaction (large weal or very high blood antibody reading) is suggestive of an allergy, especially to foods, it shows no correlation with the magnitude of the possible allergic reaction -- whether it would be a mild one or a severe one.\nFor children who are suspected of having a food allergy, an oral food challenge, which tests for an actual allergic reaction, is a much more useful test than a skin prick or blood test.\nThe report authors offer a short list of recommended and non-recommended uses for allergy tests. And while the authors are mainly concerned with allergies in children, the list applies to adults as well.\nTo help confirm a suspected allergy after observing possible symptoms of one (asthma, rhinit"}

Of course, we don't get everything right, but that's our goal.\"\nSummers is conducting both works in HGO's winter repertory at the Wortham Theater Center: Verdi's Il Trovatore (already opened) and the company's premiere production of Idomeneo, Mozart's first big hit (opening tonight).\nCultivated as a conductor by San Francisco Opera, Summers joined HGO in the 1998-99 season. His first production was Verdi's La Traviata in February 1999.\nGockley brought Summers here to develop the HGO Orchestra and raise it to a standard approximating that of the Houston Symphony. Summers thinks it will take 10 years to achieve the artistic maturity necessary for the meatiest repertoire, such as the operas of Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner.\n\"I'm a slow-burning fuse,\" he says. \"What is rewarding to me is a long-term relationship with singers, opera houses, directors.\"\nHe heaps praise on the HGO Orchestra for its growth. \"It's been the most rewarding part of my tenure, and I hope it continues.\"\nSummers works primarily for Houston, where he has led four world premieres. He will do guest concerts with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Ottawa's National Arts Centre Orchestra this spring. In March, he leads the finals concert for the Metropolitan Opera's national voice competition.\nBut for the most part, he prefers longer guest engagements. This summer he'll do a new production of Verdi's Nabucco at Opera Australia from mid-June through mid-August.\n\"Opera is very collaborative,\" he says. \"Compared to the symphonic world, it's very slow.\" Three to five weeks of rehearsals is the norm at HGO.\nThat allows performers to settle on a unified approach to the visual and musical sides of an opera, he says. \"Integrating music and drama has been what we've tried to do.

The impasse has prompted treaty proponents to search with growing urgency for any argument that might sway the president, leading to the new emphasis on finance.\nOn Wednesday, pro-NAFTA forces looked prescient when an errant wire service report that Canada thought a U.S. pullout was imminent erased more than $2 billion from General Motors\u2019 value in less than 90 minutes.\nThe Roosevelt Room meeting on Jan. 4 included trade advocateGary Cohn, who left his Wall Street job at Goldman Sachs to head the National Economic Council, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who shares Trump\u2019s instinctive protectionism.\nThe two aides personify the tension between the record-setting bull market, which the president considers validation of his economic stewardship, and the tough trade measures that he has repeatedly promised his blue-collar supporters.\n\u201cThe stock market is hitting one all-time record after another. . . .

It's unclear how successful they will be.\nOn a recent Saturday morning, Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg wandered the dormitory halls at Florida International University, knocking on doors.\nAhead of Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections, he had a simple message for the sleepy students who answered: get out and vote.\nThe 18-year-old survived the Valentine's Day mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school, which killed 17 students and staff members after a former student opened fire.\n\"People act like you're just supposed to move on from this. No, you can't move on from something that never should have happened,\" Hogg told CBC Radio's The Current.\nFollowing the massacre, he went on to co-found the #NeverAgain movement, which led massive March for Our Lives youth protests to press for gun control.\nSince June, survivors of the Florida school shooting have embarked on the Vote for Our Lives tour, making over 100 stops in 25 states. The tour aims to get young people registered to vote and \"elect morally just leaders who will help us end gun violence in the U.S.,\" according to its website.\n\"For some people it took them to see their best friend in a casket before they started voting. It shouldn't take that,\" Hogg said.\n\"Whatever our generation wants can easily happen within the next 10 years, if we just vote.\" It's unclear, however, whether the movement will have any discernable impact on youth voting.\nAn online poll conducted in early October by the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government suggested 18 to 29-year-olds are \"significantly more likely\" to vote in the upcoming midterm elections compared to 2010 and 2014. Forty per cent of the 2,003 survey respondents said they will \"definitely vote\" Tuesday.\nMeanwhile in 2014, 19.9 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 cast a ballot in the midterm elections, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, which characterized it as the \"lowest rate of youth turnout recorded in the in the past 40 years.\"\n\"Young people have to have that issue; that candidate that really drives them out to vote,\" said Kathryn DePalo, a university instructor at FIU's department of politics and international relations.\n\"Certainly, I think this election qualifies.\"\nIn the lead-up to the vote, Parkland students \"have kept the gun control issue first and foremost in voters' minds,\" particularly in South Florida, DePalo said. However, public support for gun control \u2014 specifically for a ban on assault rifles \u2014 has waned since the school shooting, polling data suggests.\nIn March, Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed gun-safety measures into law, which raised the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, imposed a waiting period on gun purchases and allowed some school personnel to be armed. The National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby group, filed a federal lawsuit, arguing that the measures violate the Second Amendment. That action is ongoing.\nHunter Pollack, whose 18-year-old sister was killed in the Parkland shooting, worked to get the measures passed, but he doesn't think"}

Then his son tested positive for the disease. He survived, and now father and son are building a new life.\nSaturday, the 21st of September, is a day I will never forget in my life.\nI was out working with MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders] as a health promotion officer in Foya, in the north of Liberia, visiting villages and telling people about Ebola: how to protect themselves and their families, what to do if they start to develop symptoms and making sure everyone has the MSF hotline number to call.\nLater that night, my brother called me. \"Your wife has died.\" I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Bendu is dead.\"\nI dropped the phone. I threw it away and it broke apart. We were together for 23 years. She understood me. She was the only one who understood me very well. I felt like I'd lost my whole memory. My eyes were open, but I didn't know what I was looking at. I had no vision.\nI had tried to talk to my family about the virus and to educate them, but my wife did not believe in it. I called my wife begging her to leave Monrovia and bring the children north so we could be together here. She did not listen. She denied Ebola. She was staying in the capital, Monrovia, with three of our children.\nLater that same week, I received another call from Monrovia. My brother, who was working as a nurse, had been taking care of my wife. But he became infected and died, too. Then my two youngest children were taken to the center in Monrovia, but my girls were very sick and they died. I felt even more helpless. I was breaking in my mind. I couldn't make sense of anything.\nMy eldest son, Kollie James, was still in Monrovia in the house where our family had been sick, though he was showing no signs of illness. He called me and said, \"Everyone got sick, I don't know what to do.\" I told him to come here to Foya to be with me.\nWhen my son arrived, people in the village would not accept us. They told us that our family had all died and to take Kollie James away. I was angered by their reaction. I knew he wasn't showing any symptoms and was not a threat to them, but because of the stigma, they wouldn't let us stay. We had to move on.\nThe next morning, though, I noticed my son looking more tired than usual. I was worried about him. He didn't have any symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, but he just looked tired. I called the Ebola hotline and MSF brought him to their Ebola care center here in Foya to be tested.\nWhen the test came back positive, it was a night of agony for me. I didn't even shut my eyes for one second. I spent the whole night just crying and thinking about what would happen now to my son.\nThe next day the counselors at MSF calmed me down. They told me to wait. To hold my peace. I sat with them, and we talked and talked.\nI was able to see Kollie in the care center from across the fence, so I called out to him, \"Son, you're the only hope I got. You"}

The stark reality was that the California Democrat wields political power that carries a lot of weight.\nDemocrats planned to vote Wednesday behind closed doors to nominate a speaker before a formal vote on the floor in January.\nConnecticut\u2019s Rep.-elect Jahana Hayes had a change of heart about Pelosi. Hayes announced on Tuesday that she now supports Pelosi\u2019s bid to win the top post in the House when the new Democratic-led Congress takes over in January.\n\u201cI came into Washington with an open mind. I said I want to hear all the information, and I want to cast a vote that\u2019s best for the people in my state. No one has asked me for a vote other than Nancy Pelosi. \u2026 at this point, I think it\u2019s unreasonable for anyone to expect a vote when they haven\u2019t even asked, so I am prepared to support Nancy Pelosi in caucus tomorrow when votes are cast,\u201d Hayes said Tuesday on MSNBC.\nPelosi, who last served as House speaker in 2010 before the GOP swept Democrats out of power, was poised to retake the post. She needs 218 votes from the 435 House members to become speaker again. Opposition from within the party has faded away.\nRep.-elect Hayes, who had said she would not vote for Nancy Pelosi on the campaign trail, will now support Pelosi's bid for speaker.\nHayes, who made history on Election Day to become Connecticut\u2019s first Black women to serve in Congress, vowed during her campaign not to vote for Pelosi. That was before Pelosi donated to her campaign, according to the CT Mirror.\nSeveral senior Black leaders in the House, including Georgia\u2019s Rep. John Lewis and South Carolina\u2019s Jim Clyburn, were also steadfast in their support of Pelosi.\nSome Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members made some noise about a leadership change before the 2018 midterm elections when the Democrats won control of the House. CBC chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana called for an African-American lawmaker to hold one of the top two leadership positions.\nOhio\u2019s Rep. Marcia Fudge, a CBC member, hinted after the election this month that she might challenge Pelosi. But that never materialized, partially because Pelosi\u2019s power to persuade was on display: She promised to restore a House panel on voting and place Fudge as its chair, according to the Washington Post.\nIt\u2019s also no secret that those who oppose Pelosi and fail could face retribution, including withholding her immense fundraising support and blocking the ambitions of her political enemies. One way of doing that is through her power to assign committee posts, like Fudge\u2019s. But on the flip side, any opponent of Pelosi could easily wind up on a House committee of little to no consequence.\nCORRECTION: Nancy Pelosi was misidentified as the House Speaker in an earlier version of this article. The text has since been updated to reflect the correction."}

This premium on presentation means that the most important skills for building mobile apps are more likely to be found in your Web developers than your Objective-C coders.\nBest of all, a single PhoneGap app can be deployed across the widest range of devices you can imagine: Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Symbian, WebOS, and Bada. Naturally, there's a cost to PhoneGap's ease and cross-platform compatibility -- PhoneGap creates Web apps that seem native, but don't really qualify.\nBut if you're looking to extend data-driven Web applications to a broad range of mobile devices, PhoneGap strikes an excellent balance between developer effort and application functionality. It lets you create capable apps that can be extended with plug-ins to mimic native UI look and feel, or to add functionality such as push notification or PayPal integration, but without the skills and effort associated with native coding. And it's free.\nPhoneGap: Mind the gap Note that the PhoneGap SDK is a bare-bones framework. You'll find no prefab code widgets or bells and whistles for user interface development. Nor does PhoneGap provide middleware for connecting devices with back-end servers, such as the enterprise-level sync infrastructure offered by Rhomobile.\nYou'll need to use a native tool chain to code your app. For Android, you install Eclipse, the Android SDK, and the Android Development Tools (ADT) plug-in. You may also install Git if you want to target specific platforms and minimize the footprint. If you want your app to run on iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry as well, you can use Adobe's PhoneGap Build cloud to create packages for all of these and other supported platforms. PhoneGap Build is free for open source projects, and it starts at $12 per month for private applications.\nGetting started with the Android SDK required a bit of code tweaking: defining an Android project, importing the PhoneGap libraries, pointing the starting Java file to PhoneGap, and modifying the base class to extend DroidGap. You also have to change setContentView to load the URL of your app's HTML-based home screen, which also must be manually created.\nIf any of that seems off-putting, you might consider using one of the PhoneGap-based IDEs, such as AppMobi or Tiggzi, which put a visual front end on the framework. Adobe Dreamweaver CS 5.5 also works well with PhoneGap.\nUsing PhoneGap with Xcode on the Mac is more seamless, with Xcode generating all assets and providing a graphical front end to help configure options like splash screens and device orientation. Still, it was easy enough to configure my target Android device (Android version, screen resolution, storage device, and so on) in Eclipse, and I could stub out a basic app pretty quickly. The API methods are well documented and peppered liberally with example code snippets.\nIn addition to easing development, PhoneGap's browser-based approach offers the advantage of delivering more predictable results across varying device form factors and pixel densities. On the downside, there's still a lot of hand coding involved that isn't managed by Xcode or Dreamweaver. This is where cloud-based tools like Tiggzi come in handy. In addition to supporting drag-and-drop interface construction, Tiggzi provides a graphical interface for wiring service calls, mapping these calls to the UI, and testing the results. In PhoneGap, all of this is done by typing in code.\nPhoneGap: A tool on"}

Since 2008, EMA has been asking network managers to identify the broad IT initiatives that drive their priorities. Server virtualization has dominated their responses year after year. Cloud and software-defined data center (SDDC) architectures have always been secondary or tertiary drivers.\nIn 2018, this pattern has finally broken, according to EMA\u2019s \u201cNetwork Management Megatrends 2018\u201d research. This shift in drivers is also leading to mainstream focus on software-defined networking (SDN), network virtualization and software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN).\nBefore there was vCloud, OpenStack, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or even ESXi, there was simply VMware ESX. At its outset, VMware\u2019s server-virtualization technology allowed enterprises to run more than one application on an x86 host, which allowed data center operators to consolidate workloads onto a smaller number of servers. Virtualization allowed enterprises to remove hardware, save rack space and drive efficiency in power and cooling. Virtualization also facilitated the decomposition of monolithic applications into multi-tiered application architectures, where different layers of an application could run on separate virtual machines.\nThis consolidation of workloads and the decomposition of applications that followed had profound impacts on networks. Bandwidth demand at the server access layer expanded, and the amount of traffic traveling east-west between servers exploded. Network engineers have spent the last decade reacting to this, building flatter, leaf-spine networks and replacing spanning tree protocol with equal-cost multi-pathing schemes.\nThat is why network managers have told EMA over and over again since 2008 that the broad IT initiative that most drives networking is server virtualization by a wide margin.\nWhile server virtualization remains influential on networking in 2018 (35% of network managers), it is no longer the top driver. This year, several other initiatives moved into a virtual tie with it, which indicates that mainstream enterprises are asking the network to support next-generation technologies. EMA asked network managers to identify all broad IT initiatives that were driving their priorities. The top driver in 2018 is SDDC architecture (37%). Other leading initiatives are infrastructure as a service (35%) and private cloud architecture (35%). Note that all these newly influential initiatives are ideas that draw on server virtualization as a foundational technology.\nThis data suggests an inflection point. For years, technology companies anxious to sell next-generation solutions have claimed this inflection point had already arrived, despite limited supporting evidence. Finally, EMA sees this shift in the numbers. Network managers are turning their focus away from east-west traffic optimization in the data center to programmable, software-defined technologies.\nNetwork teams will naturally adopt new technologies to support these next-generation initiatives, and EMA research affirms this. In 2014 and 2016, network managers told us that network security and WAN optimization were the two most important networking initiatives they were dealing with.\nSecurity is always a major concern, since the threat landscape is always evolving and challenging the security team. But WAN optimization is by no means a technology of the future. Its popularity always suggested that enterprises were focused on extracting more value out of their high-priced and bandwidth-constrained MPLS networks.\nNetwork teams tasked with supporting cloud and SD"}

The funding covered development, eight prototypes and upgrades to 83 production vehicles, as well as spares.\nThe need for the capability was directly attributed to Russian aggression, and the move would provide the Strykers overmatch to Russian weapons systems.\nThe Army developed and then sent to Europe earlier this year the new Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon, not only to respond to the urgent need but to help the service assess how it might shape its future lethality upgrades within medium-weight, infantry-centric brigade combat team formations.\nThe Army also outfitted Strykers that went to Europe with Javelin anti-tank missiles, typically fired from a man-portable system.\n\u201cWe just completed our 2nd Squadron fielding in Germany,\u201d Col.

She is saying that women should stop \"leaning back\" from their careers once kids come along. The fact that Sandberg has tons of domestic help and a husband whose job allows him to manage a lot of their family responsibilities goes mostly unmentioned in her line of argument.\nIn her new book, \"Lean In,\" Sandberg has set her sights on European women, and, in fact, all women around the world, with her plan \"to create a global community dedicated to encouraging women to lean in to their ambitions.\"\nAt the same time, Yahoo!'s CEO Marissa Mayer's \"no more working from home\" edict set off a storm among American working moms, so much so, that some are saying the actions of Sandberg and Mayer have created an elitist two-front assault on working moms.\nThere's nothing wrong with encouraging women to live up to their professional potentials or saying that there are times when employees -- men and women alike -- need to make an appearance in an office setting. But the tools of choice in these latest developments to impact working parents aren't good ones, and they all create a twinge of guilt it's hard to get past.\nWhile Sandberg suggests that there are public policy barriers to the professional advancement of women, the theme of her book isn't subtle -- she wants to hold women accountable for their professional shortcomings by pushing them to spend less time with their kids, get their spouses to shoulder more of the family burden and acknowledge that women are their own worst enemies in the workplace. That's some serious guilt to pass on to working women who are trying to keep work and family in some sort of balance.\nMayer's recent workplace edict -- though it only applies to a few hundred Yahoo! workers -- sets the stage for other companies to roll back flex-time options for beleaguered working families. I suspect Mayer's custom-built nursery next to her Yahoo! office is something most working women with newborns would be excited to have as a workplace perk.\nMom guilt is almost always in the air for America's working women. Sandberg and Mayer -- who recently said that having a baby and continuing to work \"has been way easier than everyone made it out to be\" -- make it sound like they understand the work/life problems of the average American mom. But it's hard to ignore that they live in a penthouse atop the San Francisco Four Seasons (Mayer) and a 9,000-square-foot mansion (Sandberg) and hold positions of power that allow them to leave their offices at 5:30 p.m.\nYoung working women without children in America might view the two managers as modern leaders of the feminist movement, charging head-long into a new wave of professional empowerment.

People with MS who smoked pot reported less pain and spasticity - or muscle tightness - but it came at the expense of their cognitive abilities, the study found.\nPICTURES - Medical marijuana: Which 16 states permit pot?\nAccording to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, spasticity refers to the stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms that are indicative of the disease. It can range from mild spasticity, which may feel like tightness, to severe spasticity, which produce painful sudden movements of the extremities, typically the legs, although it can occur in any limb.\nFor the new study, researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine enlisted 30 participants to see whether smoked marijuana could impact the spasticity in people who don't respond to existing treatments. Participants were an average age of 50, more than half were female, and more than half needed walking aids (20 percent used wheelchairs); they were randomly assigned to smoke marijuana or a placebo.\nTypically marijuana studies use a synthetic marijuana pill, such as dronabinol (Marinol) to test the effect of the drug's active ingredient, THC, tetrahydrocannabinol. This study, published in the May 14 issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, sought to see if smoking marijuana made a difference.\nThe researchers found participants in the smoked cannabis group experienced on average a one-third decrease in score as measured by a spasticity test called Ashworth scale, compared with participants given a placebo.\n\"It's a modest effect,\" Corey-Bloom told HealthDay of the point reduction. \"It also reduced the patients' perception of pain,\" she added, with a 50 percent decrease in perceived pain.\nMontel Williams has been an outspoken advocate of medical marijuana to relieve pain caused by MS since he was diagnosed with the disease in 1999, HealthPopreported.\nWhile marijuana showed benefits for plasticity, it apparently made participants perform worse on a test that measured cognitive function and focused attention, compared with those in the placebo group.\n\"Although generally well-tolerated by our participants, smoking cannabis was accompanied by acute cognitive effects.\"\n\"Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don't necessarily work for everyone,\" Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society, told Reuters. \"But smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\" he said, adding that people with MS are already at risk for cognitive changes, which raises more concern about pot's long-term effects.\nCorey-Bloom also told Reuters that the study had limitations when it came to \"blinding\" participants to the treatments, since 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo. She said more long-term research is needed to determine long-term effects.\nMedical marijuana is currently legal in 16 states and Washington D.C.\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord, causing painful attacks or symptoms that can last for days, weeks or months.\nWebMD has more on multiple sclerosis."}

Along with that report, it released the companion volume, \u201cSelected Issues\", that delves deeper into, well, selected issues. The government was pleased with the report. The \u201celephant\" metaphor has been unleashed again. It is not just lumbering but may even be picking up pace. The economy, in real terms, is projected to grow at 7.3% in the current financial year ending March 2019, and, in the next financial year, it will grow at 7.5%. So far, so good. The interesting stuff is always in the details.\nIn 2007, when optimism about the Indian economy was rife\u2014the elephant had actually morphed into a cheetah, according to some\u2014India\u2019s potential growth was estimated at 8%. Take a look at the Article IV assessments for the years 2007 (February 2008) and 2008 (June 2009) to notice the drastic change in tone. From one of backslapping all around in 2007, it had turned into virtual panic in 2008. In 2007, the IMF had attributed the dream run of strong growth and macroeconomic stability to sound policies and past structural reforms. Some of us had warned that India\u2019s high growth was neither sound nor structural. That the tributes were ill-founded was exposed by the fact that by 2012, the IMF had reduced its estimate of India\u2019s potential growth to 6.5%. Now, in the report for 2018, the IMF upgraded its estimate of India\u2019s potential growth to 7.3%, with the possibility that it can rise to 7.75%. For all the missed opportunities, this government has improved India\u2019s economic growth potential. That must count as an important achievement.\nBut that is not a given because, even after the crisis of 2008 ended and India\u2019s growth rate rebounded, as late as 2012, the IMF had maintained that India\u2019s potential growth estimate was 8-9%. Notwithstanding fancy econometrics, such estimation methods are backward looking and probably attach a higher weight to recent growth performance. In this context, it is worth noting that the risks to the economic growth forecasts for 2018-19 and 2019-20 are entirely on the downside, and that is fair. The monsoon may have recovered but global asset market and economic growth risks are rising by the day, not to mention the risks of geopolitical conflicts. For a permanent and sustained improvement in potential growth, India\u2019s savings rate has to increase and the IMF\u2019s projections for India\u2019s savings rates in the years to come do not bode well. Improving the savings rate is an endogenous problem and the chain of answers to the problem of low savings is long and extends well beyond economics.\nOn other fronts, the good news is that of the estimated recapitalization needs of the banking sector at 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), only 0.6% was raised in 2017-18. Completing the recapitalization plan in the current financial year based on performance and future growth prospect will further enhance credit growth prospects. The government has claimed that recovery rates from the steel sector will be higher than provisions and, hence, positive. But that does not take into"}

For the next hour, the water flooded the intersection, flowed around parked cars and poured into basements.\nBy 9 a.m., firefighters had pumped most of the water out of flooded homes. Red Cross officials reported offering help to 10 families, and the Fire Department said two buildings were flooded seriously, but residents said the damage left by the receding waters was more extensive.\nAs the floodwaters eased, residents of the picturesque block, who are more used to television film crews recording the vivid colors of their immaculate row houses than news media crews filming the aftermath of a minor disaster, missed work to try to dry out their homes.\nSoaked towels lined iron fences.

Judlau was installing a new 20-inch main, which will go over a 72-inch main that will be installed this year. The company installed part of that new 20-inch pipe on Monday, then capped the ends of the pipe temporarily, said Matthew Monahan, a spokesman for the city's Department of Design and Construction.\nThose caps held, but a joint in an older, adjoining section of the pipe slipped some time after 3 a.m., sending water into the street and into basements, said Geoffrey Ryan, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection.\nWorkers began shutting different valves to find out which pipe was leaking and stem the flow of water, said another spokesman for the environmental protection department. The leaking pipe was fully shut an hour after the break was reported.\nThe floodwater left a layer of mud in the first-floor offices of Dr. Jairo Rendon, a dentist, and destroyed the towels, toothbrushes, gloves and cups he had stored in the basement."}

Taking time to \u201cpause for people\u201d has afforded me positive engagement and insightful conversations with the Coast Guard\u2019s most talented and dedicated employees\u2014many of whom I am pleased to include on my DCMS team. Everywhere I visit, I come away struck by the passion, pride and professionalism of our people.\nIn my Commander\u2019s Intent, I emphasize our Duty to People through my \u201cEngaged Leadership\u201d priority. My second priority is \u201cEfficiency through Innovation\u201d and as our most valuable resource, it is our people who will ensure we innovate to create the efficiencies required to support Coast Guard operations. My third priority is \u201cStandard Service Delivery,\u201d which we will achieve through application of our successful business model. The accompanying video illuminates the DCMS priorities within my Commander\u2019s Intent.\nWhile walking around the Coast Guard Yard and the Surface Forces Logistics Center, SFLC, up in Baltimore, I witnessed many success stories that demonstrate how our DCMS people, through creative and innovative solutions, have achieved efficiencies and delivered value that maximizes operational impact. For example, the SFLC is working toexpand their Push Parts model for major cutters with plans to establish forward deployed inventory at Coast Guard Bases and other maintenance points. SFLC is beginning the approach with pilot projects at Base Boston and Base Alameda, California, focusing on pushing depot level parts for medium endurance cutters, high endurance cutters and national security cutters. In addition, the SFLC has centralized cutter boat pooling and has thereby increased the operational availability of boats, reduced unplanned casualty expenditures, and relieved tasking on busy cutter crews, saving more than 200 man-hours. At the Yard, we saw an operation that delivers such exceptional value and service that they have become the preferred service provider performing work for joint, interagency and international partners. These are just some of the ways we are demonstrating our mission support excellence and I am pleased to see similar successes throughout DCMS.\nServing the Nation is a privilege, and being part of the Coast Guard is an honor. More than any time in history, we have an opportunity within DCMS to shape the future of the Coast Guard in fundamental ways. Together, we will set our proud Service on a course that will make it more relevant, more respected, and better prepared to meet the challenges of the next century.\nAs always, I am interested in your thoughts\u2014we want your feedback. After you watch the video, feel free to reach out to me at askDCMS@uscg.mil and I will do my best to address your comments, answer your questions, and consider your suggestions.\nThis is our Coast Guard.

Tyler Hoechlin will return as Superman.\nWhile \"Elseworlds\" is likely just a clever title for the crossover, its use opens up a number of interesting possibilities. One scenario could be that Batman, whose existence has been implied but never directly stated on the Arrowverse shows, could be somehow replaced by or transformed into Batwoman. This would give a plausible explanation for the lack of Batman in the Arrowverse despite a story that will head to Gotham and feature Bat-concepts like Mister Freeze and Arkham Asylum.\nOne of the most popular Elseworlds series, 2003's Superman: Red Son, is providing some of the story for the upcoming season of Supergirl. There is no indication that the Supergirl story will be tied directly to the crossover, although that is theoretically possible. We have speculated in the past that the Batwoman series seems likely to be set on Supergirl's Earth.\nOther popular Elseworlds stories inlude Justice League: The Nail, in which the world develops entirely without Superman after Jonathan and Martha Kent never find the baby Kryptonian; Kingdom Come, which sees the classic generation of DC heroes come out of retirement to whip their ultra-violent replacements into shape; and Gotham By Gaslight, a Victorian mystery featuring Batman which was recently adapted as a feature-length animated movie."}

But she does it with a certain creative risk and measured execution that makes her show worthy of having Anna and Suzy sitting front frow. The question is, how is she going to evolve the very specific look she's established (doll-like bustle skirts and dresses) in a way that feels original new? This season, she's answered that by marrying her very old Elizabethan shapes with very now fabrics and textiles such as yellow python and black pony skin. It's a move that stops her exaggerated shapes from looking like costume, while keeping the theatrical flair that her fangirl wants. By and large, the most wearable pieces are the black ones, prim coats and dresses decorated with frills, in bonded wool and twill. But it's the python skirt suits, as wild and outlandish as they are, that demand to be bought and worn. Yes, I just said that. There's something unrealistic about it -- outside of Fashion Week, I can't think of too many occasions in which yellow snakeskin ruffles would make sense.

{"idx": "27843", "prompt": "Continue the following text: I have boxes of different nails in my workshop because all nails are not alike. For instance, there are general-purpose nails used primarily in woodworking and specialty nails for jobs involving concrete and masonry.\nI would never use a roofing nail to install trim on a piece of furniture I was building. Even if I pre-drilled, I would split the wood, and how would I hide the head of the nail below the surface of the wood? Conversely, if I used a finishing nail to attach roof shingles, I couldn't guarantee that they would not break free in a strong wind.\nAnd just as not all nails fit every job, not all hammers fit every nail. You should have more than one hammer.\nA glossary: Common nails are thick and heavy-duty, with large flat heads, and are used in framing carpentry and other rough work. Finish nails are used to fasten trim and cabinets when you don't want the heads to show; carpenters put a steel tool called a nailset into the nail's cupped head to hammer the head below the surface of the wood. Wood filler masks the hole.\nCasing nails are like finishing nails but used for heavier-duty work; the nails themselves are thicker and heavier. Brads are very small finishing nails, usually no more than an inch long, and they are thinner, too.\nCut flooring nails are rectangular with blunt tips that won't split the wood as they go through the edges. Roofing nails -- used to hold roofing felt, shingles, shakes, and materials of that sort -- have large heads and ringed shanks so the material won't come away from the sheathing easily. Masonry or concrete nails are made of thick, hardened steel with a grooved or fluted shank that can be round, flat, or square.\nGutter spikes are 6- to 8-inch nails used to secure gutters. Drywall nails have large heads and ringed shanks for attaching drywall to studs. Most professionals use them; most do-it-yourselfers use drywall screws. Duplex or scaffold nails have two heads -- one that is driven against the material to hold it in place, the second for easy removal. These are usually used to fasten work temporarily.\nTacks have short shanks and are used to fasten upholstery or carpet.\nNeed to know: Most nails are made from steel or stainless steel. Nail length is measured in inches or designated by the word penny, which once referred to their price per hundred. A tenpenny nail (known as a 10d) is 3 inches long, a twopenny is 1 inch long, a 60d is 6 inches long. Nail diameter typically increases with length.\nBe sure to ask: Are the nails galvanized to prevent rusting? That is extremely important if you are doing an outdoor project, such as building a roof or deck. Galvanized nails are coated with zinc either through electroplating, which makes them shiny, or hot dipping, which leaves a dull finish.\nDon't do this: Don't try to use a nail in a way it wasn't intended. For example, don't use barbed or ringed nails if you plan to remove them; their sharp-edged ridges are designed to lock into the wood, and if you try pulling them out, you'll do damage.\nBad advice: \"Drive nails through thicker pieces of wood into thinner ones.\" Actually, it's the other way around.

The rejection of their confirmation stemmed from a controversial investigation of Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans by the Government Accountability Board, the agency that preceded both commissions.\nHaas said he had little to do with that investigation and had achieved a record of success since GOP lawmakers and Walker disbanded the GAB in December 2015 and created his agency.\n\"Rather than celebrating that success and taking credit for it, some have focused on settling scores with imaginary ghosts of the Government Accountability Board. My appointment was a casualty of that obsession,\" Haas wrote in his letter.\nSenate Republicans had argued that by rejecting confirmation for Haas on a party-line 18-13 vote they had essentially fired him. But Haas had initially disagreed with the GOP lawmakers' interpretation of the law and had been considering fighting to stay in his job.\nBut such a battle would have been difficult and might have imperiled the commission's work, Haas wrote in his letter. Instead, Haas said he would move for a short time into a staff counsel job at the Elections Commission and then leave the agency entirely.\nThe Elections Commission is expected to vote Friday on whether to name assistant administrator Meagan Wolfe to fill Haas' position in an interim capacity.\nAlso Tuesday, the Ethics Commission voted 4-2 to name ethics specialist Colette Reinke as the interim replacement for former administrator Brian Bell, who also resigned after the Senate rejected his confirmation. Reinke will serve for 90 days and not apply for the permanent job.\nRepublicans Katie McCallum and Pat Strachota voted against Reinke's appointment, with Strachota saying afterward that she had wanted more candidates to consider.\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald of Juneau said last month that his fellow Republicans had lost faith in the Ethics Commission and Elections Commission because they continue to employ people who worked for the GAB during the probe of Walker and Senate Republicans. That sweeping investigation was shut down in 2015 after the state Supreme Court concluded nothing illegal occurred.\nFitzgerald also said last month he wants the Legislature's budget committee to cut the positions for two other former GAB employees with greater job protections known as civil service status \u2014 Nathan Judnic, counsel at the Elections Commission, and David Buerger, counsel at the Ethics Commission.\n\"I wish they'd all resign,\" Fitzgerald said last month of former accountability board employees.\nRep.

For a few hours, there would be license to turn our attention away from Hillary\u2019s famous flaws and celebrate her intelligence, her drive, her compassion, her experience, and her fierce commitment to others.\nThere was, of course, no triumph. The Wellesley field house, decked out in stars-and-stripes bunting and provisioned with an abundance of finger food, wine, and beer, looked at the beginning of the night like a vast wedding held at a parade grounds. By the end, it had gradually transformed into something closer to a slumber party at a bomb shelter. As the hours stretched on, the youngest women sprawled on the ground in front of an enormous projector screen showing CNN, while the older ones sat grim-faced in chairs behind them. But there was still a celebration, before the evening took its grotesque turn.\nThe feeling in the huge room was jubilant and electric, one of camaraderie, friendship, and pride. That is something that should be noted and remembered not in spite of the election\u2019s outcome but because of it. Everywhere people were hugging and talking and laughing. Hillary buttons were stuck on T-shirts printed with the words \u201cWELLESLEY EFFECT.\u201d Madeleine Albright, Class of \u201959, Skyped in, to cheers.

Terra Nova star Jason O\u2019Mara has been tapped to co-star in the project, joining Dennis Quaid, Michael Chiklis and Carrie-Anne Moss.

O\u2019Mara has fielded multiple pilot offers since Fox cancelled Terra Nova two weeks ago. Set in the 1960s, the untitled Ralph Lamb project, written by Goodfellas writer Nicholas Pileggi and Greg Walker and directed by James Mangold, chronicles the true story of Ralph Lamb (Quaid) \u2013 rodeo cowboy turned longtime Sheriff of Las Vegas \u2013 and Johnny Savino (Chiklis), a Chicago mob fixer whose entrepreneurial vision for transforming Las Vegas collides with the law-and-order mandate of Sheriff Lamb. O\u2019Mara will play Ralph Lamb\u2019s younger brother Frank, the diplomat in the family.\nMichael Reilly Burke, Michael O\u2019Neill and James Russo. Burke will play A.D.A. Katherine O\u2019Connel\u2019s (Moss) boss, D.A. Reynolds, an alpha prosecutor with a burning ambition for power. O\u2019Neill will play Vegas Mayor Bennett, a man with a vision. He has been bucking the state\u2019s Governor, who wants to move Vegas\u2019s power and money up north to Reno. Russo will play Big Tuna, an old-world gangster who runs Vegas for his Chicago bosses. The first two roles were originally listed as regular but have been scaled back as guest-starring/recurring partly because of the big names the pilot was able to land for the four main leads. It is likely that at least some of the three roles will be upgraded to regular if the pilot goes to series. Pileggi, Mangold, Walker, Cathy Konrad and Arthur Sarkissian are executive producing the CBS TV Studios-produced Ralph Lamb, with Quaid and Chiklis co-executive producing. O\u2019Mara is with UTA and the JTWAMM law firm. Burke, who recurs on ABC\u2019s Revenge, is with Domain and Levine/Okwu/Erickson. Ralph Lamb is the second high-profile pilot to sign an actor from Terra Nova in second position, along with NBC\u2019s Matthew Perry-starring comedy Go On, which cast Allison Miller. For O\u2019Mara, this would mark the third consecutive series project set in the past, following the ABC 1970s drama Life On Mars and Fox\u2019s Terra Nova."}

The sanctuary was only open to the public a few times a year, but Hart persuaded the owners to let her take a look, and she ended up spending eight hours there on her first visit. Inspired by that experience, Hart ultimately visited 10 sanctuaries over the course of a year, taking powerful, intimate portraits of the lucky animals that have survived harrowing experiences. She donates a portion of her print sales to those sanctuaries.\nIn this way, Hart had some pretty interesting encounters. At Safe Haven Farm Sanctuary in New York, she met Duncan, a goat who\u2019d escaped a live meat market with another goat. Duncan \u201cseemed like a mischievous little brother\u201d and immediately stole Hart\u2019s mittens out of her back pocket.

The fourth month looks a little less certain.\nStocks shot higher right before the closing bell Friday after fluctuating on a mix of economic data. Analysts said the surge was the work of short-sellers who had bet that stocks would fall and then had to rush to buy when those bets turned out to be wrong.\nA jump in commodities prices, which came on expectations that an improving economy will lift demand for raw materials, also fed the advance.\nEven though Wall Street ended May with a big win, it was the shakiest month of the spring rally that started in early March with the first signs that the economy's slide was slowing. When trading resumes Monday, investors are expected to show more of their recent skepticism about how strong the recovery will be once the recession has ended.\nNew worries are weighing on investors including climbing interest rates and a weaker dollar. Crude oil prices recently hit a six-month high above $66 a barrel, while the dollar on Friday sank to its lowest level in months against the euro and British pound. Some analysts say these developments are simply the consequence of a recovery in the economy and the financial markets, but others say the trends could threaten the economy's health in the long term.\nAnother more short-term obstacle is General Motors Corp.'s expected bankruptcy filing on Monday. The market has been factoring in the likelihood of a GM bankruptcy for months, but investors still are unsure what the fallout might be for auto suppliers and other companies.\nAll three indexes rose sharply for the week and, more importantly, had their third straight monthly gain. The Dow is up 4.1 percent for May, the S&P 500 index is up 5.3 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 3.3 percent.\nWall Street's advance since it hit 12-year lows on March 9 has been stunning, even with the unsteadiness the market has shown in May.\nThe Dow is up 29.8 percent, while the S&P 500 index is up 35.9 percent and the Nasdaq is higher by 39.9 percent.\nEven with those gains, stocks are still down from their peak in October 2007, two months before the start of the recession.

There were also some disappointing purchasing manager indices from the US and China. But this was partly outweighed by a number of reasonable corporate results, including Netflix and Travelers in the US.\nIn the UK, the star performer was Arm, up 103p to 972p or nearly 12%.

The Berliner Zeitung described the film as a new \u201chope for German cinema\u201d and declared England! to be \u201cthe most remarkable film this year\u201d.\nEngland! tells the story of Valeri, a young Ukrainian, who dreamt in his childhood of travelling to England with his friend. For the two of them England was a synonym for freedom and happiness, the homeland of the Beatles, an incredible island, inhabited by people who for some reason could not swim. Coming from the Ukrainian cultural backwater this at least was how they imagined things to be.\nFollowing the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they finally have the possibility of travelling to the country of their dreams. Valeri first travels through Poland by bus until he reaches the Oder River, which he crosses, using an inflatable raft, and enters Germany. In Berlin he is in danger of sharing the same fate as his friend before him\u2014stranded as an illegal immigrant. In the search for his friend, whom he had arranged to meet in Berlin, all he finds is a gravestone. It turns out that both men had been contaminated with lethal radiation poisoning during clean-up operations following the disastrous accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986.\nWhen asked by a doctor in Kiev what he expected from life, Valeri replied: \u201cThe sun shines, birds sing, life is beautiful and exciting. What more could I hope for?\u201d He exhibits a charming naivet\u00e9 in everyday life. Maria, who loves him, says, \u201cHe is a good man,\u201d but nonetheless she remains with her husband Shurik, who has both feet firmly planted on the ground.\nLike the \u201clittle prince\u201d, or a good-natured troll, Valeri wanders through the world, in which, as Pavel the painter explains, \u201cEveryone only bothers about their own thing\u201d, a world in which job centres are the \u201ccathedrals of modern times\u201d.\nOn the bus Valeri begins a conversation with a young girl who also wants to go to Germany. She shows him an advertisement placed by an older man seeking a wife, a computer specialist in Hannover. \u201cI hate computers,\u201d she declares. Valeri is shocked that she seriously wants to marry this old man, a step which will ruin her life. He attempts to change her mind. Later they meet again by accident in Berlin. She has changed her mind about the older man. The new young man at her side seems to be as much in love and as happy as she is.\nValeri\u2019s ability to make other people conscious of their own worth strengthens their longing for a different life. This can also be seen in the development of Shurik. On the one hand, he wants to be a normal father to his son, but at the same time he finds shady types of employment for people coming to Berlin from the former Soviet Union, and he himself always carries a weapon.\nFor those such as Pavel and Maria who have regretfully resigned themselves to social realities, Valeri seems to be someone both fragile and precious.

It comes on the heels of a 9th Circuit Court ruling against the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to deny federal funding to cities where local police do not take on federal immigration enforcement duties. The Texas bill, SB 4 passed the state Senate in February. Lawmakers from both chambers must agree on final language before the bill heads to the governor\u2019s desk. Shannon Young has more.\nAfter 16 hours of heated debate that ran until 3 a.m. Thursday, the Republican majority of the Texas House of Representatives pushed through SB 4, known as the \u2018anti-sanctuary city\u2019 bill. It prohibits cities and counties from enacting laws that prevent the use of local resources for immigration enforcement. During the hearing phase of the bill, even police chiefs and sheriffs spoke out against it, saying that it will undermine public safety.\nFrank Sharry, Executive Director of America\u2019s Voice Education Fund, says the bill is a radical measure in the national context.\n\u201cThis is a dramatic enabling of a federal strategy with a now coerced, local cooperation to make undocumented immigrants and their families so terrified of staying that, if they\u2019re not picked up and deported that they pick up and leave on their own,\u201d Sharry says.\nSB 4 not only mandates collaboration between federal and local police, but an amendment tacked onto the bill could allow for the removal or criminal prosecution of elected officials or law enforcement who refuse to comply.\nIn addition to its substantial population of immigrants with legal status, Texas is home to 1.5 million undocumented residents, according to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute. The state is also one of four so-called \u2018minority-majority\u2019 states, where people of color outnumber whites.\nJose P. Garza, Executive Director, Workers Defense Project says SB 4 is the latest example of a bill that marginalizes members of the state\u2019s demographic majority.\nThe counties in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas are the most heavily Latino in the United States, with 9 in ten residents identifying as Hispanic according to U.S. Census data.\nThe ACLU is already seeing dash cam footage of Texas Department of Public Safety troopers detaining people for more than an hour during traffic stops so that immigration agents can check their status. While legal permanent residents can show a green card, for citizens the documentation can be bulkier.\nWhile cities in California double down on resisting the Trump Administration\u2019s anti-sanctuary policies, Texas\u2019 SB4 is putting the Lone Star state and its large immigrant population on the front lines of a 21st century civil rights battle."}

The suit also names BankTrack, an organization that monitors the financial activities of commercial banks, as a defendant, as a result of its involvement in a recent movement to divest from banks that financed the pipeline-construction effort.\nMembers of the #noDAPL movement who spoke to Grist note that the complaint ignores the fact that the anti-pipeline effort was indigenous-led. The environmental groups primarily offered solidarity and some support \u2014 Greenpeace, for example, donated a solar array to the protest camp.

As reported by Grist and The Intercept, TigerSwan portrayed the #noDAPL movement participants as, in Sheehan\u2019s words, \u201can armed enemy that is threatening their physical facility.\u201d That framing, he says, helped local law enforcement see protesters as violent adversaries.

However, he says, \u201cthey were nowhere to to be seen\u201d at Standing Rock.\nTara Houska, a tribal attorney and national campaigns director at the indigenous environmental nonprofit Honor the Earth called the complaint an example of a \u201cSLAPP suit,\u201d which stands for \u201cstrategic lawsuit against public participation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a way to try to silence free speech by trying to cost the defendant \u2014 organizations or movements or individuals, sometimes \u2014 money,\u201d she says.\nOnly people who think you should be able to say with impunity anything, about anyone no matter how false would think this is a frivolous suit.

Precious few of those predictions have come true, which is only to be expected: Throw enough darts, and you\u2019ll get a bull\u2019s-eye eventually, even if you\u2019re wearing a blindfold.\nPredicting the future is a mug\u2019s game, anyway. If the future can be predicted, then it is inevitable. If it\u2019s inevitable, then what we do doesn\u2019t matter. If what we do doesn\u2019t matter, why bother getting out of bed in the morning? Science fiction does something better than predict the future: It influences it.\nThe science fiction stories that we remember\u2014such as Frankenstein\u2014 are ones that resonate with the public imagination. Most science fiction is forgotten shortly after it\u2019s published, but a few of those tales live on for years, decades\u2014even centuries in the case of Frankenstein. The fact that a story captures the public imagination doesn\u2019t mean that it will come true in the future, but it tells you something about the present. You learn something about the world when a vision of the future becomes a subject of controversy or delight.\nIf some poor English teacher has demanded that you identify the \u201cthemes \u201d of Mary\u2019s Frankenstein, the obvious correct answer is that she is referring to ambition and hubris. Ambition because Victor Frankenstein has challenged death itself, one of the universe\u2019s eternal verities. Everything dies: whales and humans and dogs and cats and stars and galaxies. Hubris\u2014\u201cextreme pride or self-confidence\u201d (thanks, Wikipedia!)\u2014because as Victor brings his creature to life, he is so blinded by his own ambition that he fails to consider the moral consequences of his actions. He fails to ask himself how the thinking, living being he is creating will feel about being stitched together, imbued with life force, and ushered into the uncaring universe.\nMany critics panned Frankenstein when it was first published, but the crowds loved it, made it a best-seller, and packed the theaters where it was performed on the stage. Mary had awoken something in the public imagination, and it\u2019s not hard to understand what that was: a story about technology mastering humans rather than serving them.\nWhen Mary published Frankenstein in 1818, England was getting completely upended by runaway technological innovation in the Industrial Revolution. Ways of life that had endured for centuries disappeared in the blink of an eye. William Wordsworth would soon write mournful letters and poems about railroads ruining his beloved countryside. Ancient trades disappeared without fanfare; new careers appeared overnight. Every constant was unmade; the maps were redrawn; and the old, steady rhythm of life stuttered and pulsed erratically. Young Mary, 18 years old when she started writing Frankenstein, felt revolution in the air.\n2. Anything that\u2019s invented between when you\u2019re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.\n3. Anything invented after you\u2019re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.\nDep"}

The firm also owns a 29.7 percent stake in Debenhams, which has issued three profit warnings this year.\nAnalysts have speculated that Ashley might want to put the two department store groups together.\nEarlier on Wednesday Debenhams shares rose over 9 percent after Simon Bentley, who prior to the conclusion of Sports Direct\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in central London had been the firm\u2019s senior independent director, was asked if its board had talked about the possibility of combining House of Fraser and Debenhams.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed,\u201d he told reporters.\nBut Bentley said Sports Direct was currently busy with its latest acquisition.\n\u201cIf any of you had the job of handling House of Fraser right now, I think you might have your hands full, and incidentally we\u2019ve also got Sports Direct,\u201d he said.\nBentley later issued a clarification statement.\n\u201cI made no mention of any merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams, nor did I intend my answer to infer that,\u201d he said.\nAmid the confusion, after the market closed Sports Direct issued a statement to the London Stock Exchange, saying it did not intend to make an offer for Debenhams. Under UK takeover rules that effectively rules out Sports Direct from making a bid for six months, subject to various caveats.\nEarlier this week Debenhams rushed out a trading statement and denied it was actively planning major store closures.\nAhead of the investor meeting Sports Direct announced that Bentley was retiring as a director of the company, having served on the board since 2007, and would not seek re-election.\nSports Direct also said its under-fire chairman Keith Hellawell was stepping down after nine years in the role.\nAhead of the meeting three shareholder advisory groups - Pensions & Investment Research Consultants, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co - had urged investors to vote against the re-election of Ashley and Hellawell, over Sports Direct\u2019s alleged poor corporate governance and continuing concerns about employment practices.\nHellawell, a 76-year-old former police chief constable, has previously battled to keep his job at the retailer in the face of criticism of its working practices and his own ability to control Ashley.\nHe will be succeeded as chairman by non-executive director David Daly, a former Nike executive.\nThe re-election of Ashley, who unexpectedly attended the meeting, was opposed by 9.78 percent of votes cast. Ashley did not speak.\nThe meeting, attended by about 30 shareholders, lasted about 10 minutes with no questions asked by investors.\nSports Direct said earlier on Wednesday its trading was in line with previous guidance.

According to that measurement, LBX is 78 percent leased and is in negotiations for an additional 9 percent of the space.\nDespite the closure of Orchard Supply Hardware, it will remain leased under a contract and the owners of OSH will find a new tenant.

The groups also wanted prospective candidates to appear before the entire School Board and the community before one is appointed.\nPassing motorists honked their horns in support of the demonstrators. And by the time the business meeting began at 5:30 p.m. in the auditorium of the Buffalo Academy for the Visual and Performing Arts, angry members of the public carried their rallying cry right to board members.\n\u201cWhose schools?

Today, they are a bastion for print publishing, holding fast against the ever-rising digital tide. Perhaps no one is more responsible for the ascendency of comics than Fran\u00e7oise Mouly, Art Editor of The New Yorker. Along with her husband, comic book luminary Art Spiegelman, author of best-selling \u201cMaus,\u201d Mouly brought comics from the fringe underground of basement bookstores to the haute-couture of The New Yorker covers and museum retrospectives.\nThursday, Mouly will give a Penny Stamps lecture in which her love of print publishing and the comics medium will serve as focal points to encourage future generations to push boundaries and recognize opportunities to keep print publishing thriving.\nLike many French kids, Mouly grew up with children\u2019s comics, so when she moved to New York at age 19, she thought there would be no better way to learn English than through captioned illustrations. Yet there were no comics in the mainstream bookstores or on the newsstands. A friend introduced her to the underground cartoonist Art Speigelman, and she fell in love with the artist\u2019s advocacy for his medium \u2014 and later with the artist himself. Through the 1980s, the two co-edited RAW magazine, an annual anthology of the year\u2019s best and most progressive work in the comics genre.\n\u201cI wanted to make an object that showed all of the possibilities of how comics could function to tell stories, to illustrate articles, to show very different styles,\u201d Mouly said in an interview with The Michigan Daily. \u201cThat this wasn\u2019t just science fiction or superheroes, but it could be literature; it could be art.\nRAW was quite a DIY operation: Mouly was its publisher, designer, production manager and printer, using her own printing press located in their Soho loft. Mouly and Spiegelman chose the comic strips together, resulting in editorial diversity.\nThe same is true of Mouly\u2019s work as the Art Editor of the New Yorker.\nMouly sees The New Yorker as a publication that values not only the aesthetic merit of comics and cartoons, but also the medium\u2019s power to make a statement, political or otherwise.\nMouly\u2019s process of choosing a New Yorker cover takes the form of an ongoing conversation with the artist to come up with the right image at the right time. As a weekly general interest magazine, The New Yorker has a quick response time to current events, but isn't expected to cover everything that happens. Mouly\u2019s New Yorker cover can either stand on it\u2019s own as a stylized illustration of seasonal/cultural themes or can serve as a timely commentary on a breaking issue of the day.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a dialogue with the artists so what I try to do is to encourage them to use this cover of a magazine as a forum to address the concerns that they might have \u2026 I actually believe that those cartoonists and those graphic storytellers should be telling the story of our times,\u201d Mouly said.\nShe famously edited the controversial cover in 2008 depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as closet militant revolutionaries in Arab garb fist-bumping their election to the White House \u2014 a caricature of those who really believe it.

Rather than pay hefty shipping fees and import taxes, sellers can simply arrange for a sold product to be printed at whatever 3D printing facility is closest to the buyer.\nSuch 3D printing services may not be limited to specialty shops or companies in the near future. Staples stores plan to offer 3D printing services in the Netherlands and Belgium starting in 2013.\nBusinesses won't be alone in benefiting from 3D printing's print-on-demand-anywhere capability. The U.S. military has deployed 3D printing labs to Afghanistan as a way to speed up the pace of battlefield innovation and rapidly build whatever soldiers might need onsite. NASA has looked into 3D printing for making replacement parts aboard the International Space Station and building spacecraft in orbit.\nMost 3D printers don't go beyond the size of household appliances such as refrigerators, but 3D printing could even scale up in size to build objects as big as a house. A separate NASA project has investigated the possibility of building lunar bases for future astronauts by using moon \"dirt\" known as regolith.\nBut 3D printing still has its limits. Most 3D printers can only print objects using a specific type of material \u2014 a serious limitation that prevents 3D printers from creating complex objects such as an Apple iPhone. Yet researchers and commercial companies have begun developing workarounds. Optomec, a company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has already made a 3D printer capable of printing electronic circuitry onto objects.\nA .22 pistol assembled using a 3D-printed receiver part.\nThe 3D printing boom could eventually prove disruptive in both a positive and negative sense. For instance, the ability to easily share digital blueprints online and print out the objects at home has proven a huge boon for do-it-yourself makers.\nBut security experts worry about 3D printing's ability to magnify the effects of digital piracy and the sharing of knowledge that could prove dangerous in the wrong hands. Defense Distributed, a Texas group, has already begun pushing societal boundaries by working on the world's first fully 3D-printable gun."}

Here's what we think based on our first drive.\nThe 2018 Hyundai Kona adds a compact crossover to the Hyundai lineup that capitalizes on the popularity of these miniaturized SUVs. Offering the best of both worlds, compact crossovers combine the flexibility of an SUV in a smaller size that\u2019s well-suited to city streets and those without large families. They\u2019re also more affordable, which makes them an appealing option for anyone on a tight budget.\nHyundai has long been known for building affordable vehicles, but more recently it\u2019s established a reputation for providing high quality and affordability. Whether it\u2019s a sedan, SUV, or crossover, Hyundai has a knack for creating solid vehicles with the right combination of features at its price point.\nThe 2018 Hyundai Kona continues this trend as a stylish, attractive crossover with a low price. Crossovers often have quirkier styling than their full-size counterparts. The Kona manages to put just enough edginess into its design without going overboard. Especially from the front, the Kona looks aggressive and fun without going too far.\nThere are four trim levels to choose from, starting with the base Kona SE. It starts at only $19,500 with standard features including Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, and remote keyless entry. LED headlights and LED daytime running lights are standard on every Kona. The SEL adds features including blind-spot warning and heated front seats from $21,150. The Limited adds more features, and it has a more powerful engine with a starting price of $24,700.\nPricing tops out at $27,400 for the Kona Ultimate, which bundles in standard features including an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with navigation, wireless device charging, and heads-up display with key safety features such as lane-keep assist and forward-collision warning with pedestrian detection. It also includes heated leather seats, Hyundai\u2019s Blue Link connected car services, and rain-sensing wipers. If you\u2019re looking for a value, then the Kona is a smart choice.\nThe base SE and SEL come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 147 horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. Limited and Ultimate trims feature a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 175 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all-wheel drive is available on every Kona.\nWe spent our time with the more powerful turbocharged engine. The Kona is peppy, but it won\u2019t set any records. A crossover isn\u2019t so much about power as it is about versatility. Yet, the Kona is fun to sling through the corners on a twisting road. There\u2019s a sport mode that gives a slightly more aggressive drive that\u2019s best when you\u2019re going all out. In slower traffic, it holds gear shifts too long and the engine noise is droning.\nOnce you get some open road, the Kona\u2019s handling makes it a great car to drive.

The Triangle Transit Authority has changed its name twice since 2006 \u2013 and staffers still struggle with their new identity, Go Triangle, when they answer the phone.\nAnd Wake is developing its second transit plan since then. The last plan called for light rail from Morrisville to downtown and North Raleigh \u2013 plus a separate commuter-rail line, with locomotives pulling standard train cars, from Durham through RTP to Garner.\nThe new idea is that diesel multiple units can provide service every 15 minutes from RTP to downtown, and pointing north from downtown to Highwoods.\nHe said the same trains could be extended in future years to run every 30 minutes during weekday rush hour \u2013 north to Wake Forest, east to Garner and Clayton, and west to Durham, where a planned light-rail line will connect to UNC-Chapel Hill.\nIf the county commissioners settle on a transit plan this year, they could schedule a referendum in 2016 on a half-cent sales tax that would help pay for transit improvements. Planners would like to have the trains running by 2026 \u2013 if the county decides to include trains.\nWake\u2019s transit committee will deliver four different transit scenarios \u2013 two with trains and two without \u2013 for public comment on May 11.\nLight rail\u2019s lighter trains use narrower rails that, for safety reasons, must be built farther away from freight tracks. That means more land acquisition and bridge construction would be needed than for DMU trains.

But DMUs are getting the nod here for the same reason they were favored by Triangle Transit, aka Go Triangle, in 2000.\nThey can use existing railroad corridors, mostly the N.C. Railroad combined with some CSX tracks. The tracks run through most of the Triangle\u2019s major employment and activity hubs, from Duke University and downtown Durham through RTP, the State Fairgrounds, N.C. State University and downtown Raleigh.\nDMU trains are doing urban and suburban transit duty in Oregon, Colorado, Texas, south Florida and southern California.

The field is the home field for Yorktown H.S. It is used for a wide variety of sports and school events.\nThe current artificial turf field at Greenbrier Park uses a surface containing re-cycled crumb rubber. The new artificial turf field at Greenbrier Park will use an alternative infill, EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer). EPDM is a vulcanized rubber material that County staff believes resembles and plays like crumb rubber, but is not made from recycled materials.\nArlington should be commended for deciding to replace the crumb-rubber-based artificial turf field at Greenbrier Park.\nArlington County currently has one indoor and 14 outdoor fields with synthetic turf. Thirteen of these 15 synthetic turf fields use styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). This is crumb rubber made from recycled tires. These fields are: Barcroft Park (two fields), Greenbrier Park, Gunston Park (two fields), Long Bridge Park (three fields), Rocky Run Park, Thomas Jefferson Community Center, Virginia Highlands Park, Wakefield High School and Washington-Lee High School.\nMontgomery County, MD passed a unanimous Council vote to ban crumb rubber and implement the use of plant-based alternatives such as coconut fiber, cork and rice husk blend. Hartford, CT, Los Angeles Unified School District and the New York City Parks Departments already have banned the use of crumb rubber.\nThe federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not yet definitively banned synthetic turf fields that use re-cycled crumb rubber. But, Arlington need not wait for EPA\u2019s final conclusions. Instead, Arlington should follow the lead of Montgomery County and other jurisdictions by committing to replace all of its artificial turf fields that currently use re-cycled crumb rubber when the useful lives of those fields end.\nArlington County staff currently believes that one of the key arguments in favor of artificial turf is that, although the upfront cost of installing artificial turf is far higher than installing natural turf, it is so much cheaper to maintain artificial turf that artificial turf is overwhelmingly more cost-effective. A Forbes magazine article casts serious doubt on this argument\u2013certainly enough doubt to warrant re-examining it. As part of this re-examination, Arlington should consider a ban on future use of EPDM as has Hartford, CT.\nThe artificial turf industry lobby in this country is large, well-financed, and eager to maintain or increase the industry\u2019s market share. The artificial turf industry lobby knows how to market its product to local municipalities. Given the potential health risks and dollars at stake, Arlington should appoint a special citizen-led task force to re-examine where Arlington should go from here on the artificial turf issue.\nHealthy Paws: Pet First Aid & Emergencies, Part II \u2013 When to Worry?"}

The PBoC\u2014which, unlike many central banks, is very much controlled by the central government\u2014generally cuts rates only as a last resort to boost growth.\nThe government has been rigorously using less broad-based ways of lowering borrowing costs (e.g. cutting reserve requirement ratios at small banks, and re-lending to certain sectors).\nThe fact that the government finally cut rates suggests that these more \u201ctargeted\u201d measures haven\u2019t succeeded in easing funding costs for Chinese firms. The push that came to shove might have been the grim October data, which showed industrial output, investment, exports, and retail sales all slowing fast. Those data suggest it will be much harder to get anywhere close to the government\u2019s 2014 target of 7.5% GDP growth, given that the economy grew only 7.3% in the third quarter, its slowest pace in more than five years.\nBut wait. Isn\u2019t the Chinese economy supposed to be losing steam? Yes. The Chinese government has acknowledged many times that in order to introduce the market-based reforms needed to sustain long-term growth and stop piling on more corporate debt, it has to start ceding its control over China\u2019s financial sector. Things like, for instance, setting the bank deposit rate artificially low, which generally punishes savers to benefit state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\nBut clearly, the economy\u2019s not supposed to be decelerating as fast as it is.\nTellingly, it\u2019s been more than two years since the central bank last cut rates, when the economic picture darkened abruptly in mid-2012, the critical year that the Hu Jintao administration was to hand over power to Xi Jinping. The all-out push to boost growth that followed made 2013 boom, but also freighted corporate balance sheets with dangerous levels of debt. But this could only last so long; things started looking ugly again in 2014.\nUp until now, attempts to buoy the economy have mainly focused on helping out small non-state companies, says Mark Williams, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note. Often ineligible for state-run bank loans, small firms have mostly been paying steep rates for shadow financing.\nSince the benchmark rate cut affects official loans given out by mostly state-run banks, today\u2019s cut will mainly benefit SOEs, hinting that the authorities \u201capparently feel larger firms are now in need of support too,\u201d writes Williams. In addition, lowering the amount banks charge for capital makes them less likely to lend. Though that should in theory be offset by the lowering of the deposit rate, savers have been shunting their money into higher-yielding wealth management products, making deposits increasingly scarce.\nOn top of all that, the amount of investment it takes to produce a single unit of GDP growth has ballooned in recent years. That means it might take a lot more easy money than a rate cut will provide to keep the economy growing above the 7.0% mark."}

Steve Jobs to become board member at Disney.\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) - Mickey Mouse and Nemo are now corporate cousins. Walt Disney has announced that it is buying Pixar, the animated studio led by Apple head Steve Jobs, in a deal worth $7.4 billion.\nSpeculation about a deal being imminent raged on Wall Street for the past few weeks. Disney has released all of Pixar's films so far, but the companies' current distribution deal was set to expire following the release of this summer's \"Cars.\" The merger brings together Disney's historic franchise of animated characters, such as Mickey, Minnie Mouse and Donald Duck, with Pixar's stable of cartoon hits, including the two \"Toy Story\" films, \"Finding Nemo\" and \"The Incredibles.\"\nSteve Jobs, the CEO of Apple and Pixar, will become a board member of Disney following the closing of Disney's purchase of Pixar.\nIs Pixar worth the $7.4 billion that Disney will pay?\n\"Disney and Pixar can now collaborate without the barriers that come from two different companies with two different sets of shareholders,\" said Jobs in a statement. \"Now, everyone can focus on what is most important, creating innovative stories, characters and films that delight millions of people around the world.\"\nAs part of the deal, Jobs will become a board member of Disney, the companies said. And John Lasseter, the highly respected creative director at Pixar who had previously worked for Disney, will rejoin the House of Mouse as chief creative officer for the company's combined animated studios and will also help oversee the design for new attractions at Disney theme parks.\n\"The addition of Pixar significantly enhances Disney animation, which is a critical creative engine for driving growth across our businesses,\" said Disney CEO Robert Iger in a written statement.\nDuring a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Iger said that acquisition discussions had been going on for the past several months. Jobs added that after a \"lot of soul searching,\" he came to the conclusion that it made the most sense for Pixar to align itself with Disney permanently instead of trying to distribute films on its own or sign with another movie studio partner.\nAccording to the terms of the deal, Disney (Research) will issue 2.3 shares for each Pixar share. Based on Tuesday's closing prices, that values Pixar at $59.78 a share, about a 4 percent premium to Pixar's current stock price. Shares of Pixar (Research) fell slightly in regular trading on the Nasdaq Tuesday but gained nearly 3 percent in after-hours trading. The stock has surged more than 10 percent so far this year on takeover speculation.\nDisney's stock gained 1.8 percent in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange and was flat after-hours.\nPrior to the deal's announcement, some Wall Street observers had speculated that Disney may be paying too much for Pixar. A source tells FORTUNE that some Disney board members also thought the price was too high.\nTo that end, Disney chief financial officer Thomas Staggs said during the conference call that the deal would reduce Disney's earnings slightly in fiscal 2006, which ends this September, as well as fiscal 2007.

Almost by definition, the answer is no.\nAs the monetary authority, the central bank is the master of the printing press. It can literally conjure up money at will, and arguably did exactly that when it bought about $2 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasurys to push down borrowing costs and boost the economy.\nThe Fed's unorthodox steps helped it generate record profits in 2010, allowing it to send $78.4 billion to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nBut its swollen balance sheet leaves the central bank unusually exposed to possible credit losses that could create a major headache at a time of increasing political encroachment on the Fed's independence.\nAsked about the issue of potential losses during congressional testimony on Friday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested the risks were minimal.\nIf liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet were to exceed its assets, it would only be so because of rising interest rates in the context of a thriving economy, he suggested.\n\"Under a scenario in which short-term interest rates rise very significantly, it's possible that there might come a period where we don't remit anything to the Treasury for a couple of years. That would be I think a worst-case scenario,\" Bernanke said.\nCustomarily, the Fed submits surplus profits from its operations back to the Treasury's coffers.\nBut the Fed's newfangled policy steps and the potential for credit losses raises, for some experts, the prospect that the Treasury may actually be forced to \"recapitalize\" the Fed \u2014 economist-speak for what others might call a bail-out.\nThat would be a strange role reversal given the Fed's efforts to ease monetary policy by buying the Treasury's debt, and it could raise a political firestorm from lawmakers who believed all along the Fed was putting taxpayer money at risk.\nVaradarajan Chari, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota and a consultant to the Minneapolis Fed, says that at some point during its exit from easy monetary policies, the Fed actually may go broke \u2014 at least on paper.\n\"The most obvious exit strategy is, when inflation starts to pick up, to stop and reverse asset purchases,\" he said. \"That's likely to include requiring the Fed in an accounting sense to see a significant accounting loss.\"\nThe Fed now holds just over $1 trillion in Treasurys, Chari noted, and if inflation rose by a couple of percentage points, it would dent the value of those holdings by about 10 percent, leaving the Fed with a $100 billion loss.\n\"I'm sure it will have some negative political fallout,\" Chari said. \"But not economic consequences. Their ability to print money means it (insolvency) doesn't mean anything.\"\nMany economists argue that the potential cost to the taxpayer from the Fed's policies is far smaller than the threat of a prolonged period of economic stagnation that would result from a less proactive approach.\nWith the U.S. unemployment rate at 9.4 percent and only tentative signs that businesses are beefing up hiring,"}

I'm not really sure what their concern is,\" the 20-year-old told reporters after the quarter-final victory.\n\"I'm not trying to take away someone's speed.

Over a period of years, modern racket technology has developed powerful, light, wide-bodied rackets that are easier to wield than wooden rackets were and have a much larger effective hitting area, often called the sweet spot,\" it read.\n\"From the spectators' point of view the game has become one-dimensional so that even on fast courts 90 percent of the matches are baseline contests,\" it said, adding that on slow surfaces matches were \"tedious and even boring\"."}

And the Cleveland decision eliminated some of the competition for Napoli, potentially giving the Rangers more leverage to do a shorter deal. In addition, Napoli was not offered a qualifying offer by Cleveland, meaning the Rangers would not have to give up a draft pick to sign him.\nRangers GM Jon Daniels, who makes a policy of not commenting on external free agents, did not comment.\nNapoli hit .239 with 34 home runs for Cleveland last year, helping to lead the Indians to the AL Championship.

Imagine if they had the chance to outsmart two of the nation's top daily newspapers, a highly respected weekly magazine, and several political analysts. That's an opportunity the media literacy course taught by Joanne McGlynn and Beth York has given 11th graders at Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire-and the students have proved themselves to be more than a match for sloppy journalists.\nConcord High is no stranger to the media machine. Reporters descended on the campus when one of the school's social studies teachers, Christa McAuliffe, was chosen to ride the space shuttle Challenger in 1985-and again, after the shuttle exploded. It's not surprising, then, that when the English department restructured its curriculum three years ago, a committee of teachers decided to create a required course for juniors that teaches students to think critically about messages delivered through radio, print, television, and the Internet. McGlynn and York served on the committee (York led it), and now, the two teach the new course, along with five other instructors.\nLast fall, as the all-important New Hampshire primaries approached, York, McGlynn, and a committee of students from their two classes invited the presidential hopefuls to speak to Concord High students about violence in schools. Visits from Republican candidates Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch garnered barely a mention in the press, but Al Gore arrived with reporters and news crews in tow. During his talk, Gore recounted a story from his days in Congress in the 1970s. A teenage girl from Toone, Tennessee, wrote him expressing concern about contaminated drinking water, he said, and her letter sparked an investigation that ultimately led to the Love Canal hearings. The problem in Tennessee \"was the one you didn't hear of,\" Gore said, \"but that was the one that started it all.\" The students left the auditorium inspired by the idea that a peer could exert so much influence.\nBut the next day, a student came to McGlynn's class abuzz about Chris Matthews' coverage of the speech on CNBC's Hardball the previous night. The political analyst had misquoted Gore as saying, \"But I was the one that started it all,\" and then ridiculed the vice president for exaggerating his personal achievements-a criticism first raised earlier in the fall when Gore was quoted as claiming to have invented the Internet. Later, a friend showed McGlynn a similar report from Katherine Seelye of the New York Times.\nAs other reporters began to disseminate the misquote, York and McGlynn turned it into a new lesson. In the weeks prior to Gore's visit, York had impressed upon her students the importance of word choice. \"Word choice shapes our perception. It's hard to make students understand the effects of that on the perception of reality, and this piece reinforced that idea,\" she says. McGlynn recalls her class spent a great deal of time discussing \"who is telling the story and what impact that speaker has on how the story is being told.\"\nAs other reporters began to disseminate the misquote, York and McGlynn turned it into a new lesson.\nThe two teachers assembled the committee of students that had originally invited Gore to determine how to react. They phoned Matthews and Seelye to correct the misquote, but it had already begun to snowball. Ceci Connolly of the Washington Post wrote a story similar to"}

Another is the music industry, in which innovation saw compact discs replace vinyl records now compact discs are under threat from USB flash drives and music downloads by smartphones, tablets and computers.\nIn the taxi industry owners and operators are constantly experimenting with different types of minibuses and establishing new routes to maximise profits. But the transformation required of the transport industry should be holistic and not limited to individual operator survival strategies.\nWhen the bus operator Putco abandoned its Mamelodi operations, the taxi industry immediately assumed, rightly or wrongly, that it should take over where Putco left off.\nTaxi operators believe the bus route is a lucrative one that they are entitled to serve or from which at least to derive a share.\nThis expectation is consistent with general business practice and it is only fair that any competitor should want to capture the market share of a struggling rival. But in the case of public transport, this may require that taxi operators take practical considerations into account.\nKey among these is the financial viability of taking over bus routes. Part of the reason Putco abandoned its contract of about 70 buses in Mamelodi was that the operation was not financially viable, despite public bus operators being subsidised.\nBus commuters are generally low-income earners who live far from work as a result of apartheid spatial segregation. Buses provide scheduled services and generally operate on the low-volume routes that take commuters directly to their destination rather than to stations where commuters connect to other means of transport.\nTaxi operators are less likely to be able to carry the costs of operating along traditional bus routes without a subsidy. Because taxis have limited carrying capacity, operating on these routes will increase running costs, rendering their operations even less viable than those of buses. Recouping the costs by increasing fares will be limited by the low income of the commuters.\nFor the government and the public, the social and environmental costs of replacing 70 buses with minibus taxis will also be large.\nTaxi operators have compelling reasons to be concerned about their diminishing dominance in the transport industry. The Gautrain and bus rapid transport, for instance, could dramatically reduce the taxi industry\u2019s market share.\nThe taxi industry wields substantial bargaining power because of its control of the low-income market, sometimes even standing in the way of reform. As public transport systems are expanded and commuters vote with their feet, it will be under immense pressure to adapt or die.

Children born in England also tend to have more birth anomalies \u2013 such as congenital heart defects \u2013 than in Sweden.\nThe study, published in the Lancet, used medical data from the NHS and the Swedish health service to compare births from 2003 to 2012 and track the children\u2019s health and death records up to their fifth birthday.\nThese records included information on the mother\u2019s age, the family\u2019s socioeconomic position, the length of pregnancy, the child\u2019s birth weight and gender, and whether the child had any birth anomalies.\nOverall, the study included more than 3.9 million English births, with 11,392 deaths, and more than a million Swedish births and 1,927 deaths.\nBetween two days and four years old, the child mortality rate for England was one and a half times higher than for Sweden (29 deaths per 10,000 children in England, compared with 19 in Sweden). If the child mortality rate had been the same, there would have been 607 fewer child deaths per year in England, equivalent to 6,073 in total over the period.\nThe differences were mainly driven by differences in mortality among children under one.\nLead author Dr Ania Zylbersztejn of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said: \u201cWhile child deaths are still rare, the UK has one of the highest child mortality rates in western Europe.\nThe higher frequency of adverse birth characteristics such as low birth weight, pre-term birth or congenital anomalies in England were the main reasons for the excess risk of death compared to Sweden, accounting for 77% of the excess risk for newborns and 68% for those under the age of one.\nSocioeconomic factors explained a further 3% of excess risk in newborns, and 11% in those under the age of one. Combined, they said, these factors fully explained the difference in survival for under-fives in England and Sweden.\nGood maternal health \u2013 including maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding chronic illnesses such as diabetes and avoiding high blood pressure, psychological stress and infections \u2013 and healthy behaviours such as eating a balanced diet and avoiding smoking, drugs and alcohol are associated with healthy foetal development during pregnancy.\nThe UK has one of the most unequal distributions of wealth of all western countries. From 2003 to 2005, the most deprived 20% of the UK\u2019s population had a sevenfold lower income than the least deprived 20%, while the gap in Sweden was only four times.\nThis suggests many more people in England are socioeconomically disadvantaged, which is associated with pre-term births, low birth weight, birth anomalies and poor maternal health, reflecting circumstances and behaviours linked to poverty and stress.\nProf Anders Hjern"}

Furthermore a new law on energy effectiveness is important in identification of energy savings. Certain changes were made even in the area of immigration law related to double citizenship rules.\nIn spite of the corporate tax dropping from 23 percent to 22 percent it is still far from the original 19 percent. Unfortunately, the decrease made by the government is compensated through the introduction of tax licenses. The newly introduced license fee is paid by enterprises irrespective of whether they make a profit or not. Even though such fees are tax deductible, they do not contribute to simplification of the business environment. Mandatory electronic VAT records introduced for VAT-payers will allow fighting of carousel fraud by accepting monthly and quarterly VAT records only in electronic form.\nIntroduction of specific rules related to whistleblowers are very critical since it sends a signal to the public at large that the government is ready to fight corruption. The introduction of transfer pricing rules, even between two domestic companies, is a very important tool for the tax office to fight tax evasion. Under the new legislation, even domestic entities will be forced to demonstrate that the prices applied in their mutual business transactions, including prices for services, credit and loans; do not differ from the prices used by non-related entities in comparable business transactions.\nAllen & Overy Bratislava: In our view, two pieces of legislation governing arbitration and capital markets which were adopted in 2014 were particularly encouraging and will have a positive impact on the business climate.\nFirst, a major amendment to the Arbitration Act has aligned the Slovak framework with the modernised 2006 UNICTRAL Model Law and will, undoubtedly, facilitate the settlement of commercial disputes by arbitration. At the same time, an entirely new Act on Consumer Arbitration will regulate an alternative method for resolving consumer disputes. The clear separation between commercial and consumer arbitration will benefit both by introducing greater flexibility in commercial arbitration and more robust protection in consumer arbitration. These changes will send a strong signal that Slovakia wishes to be recognised as an arbitration-friendly and welcoming jurisdiction.\nSecondly, the Slovak capital markets have been modernised by an amendment to the Act on Bonds. Slovak legislation now expressly recognises established concepts such as bondholder meetings and joint trustees. The adopted measures may facilitate the development of the Slovak capital market and bond financing by Slovak issuers.\nFinally, an important piece of EU legislation was also adopted in 2014 \u2013 the Directive on Damages for Competition Law Infringements. Once implemented into Slovak law, this legislation will facilitate claims for damages brought by consumers or businesses on the basis of anti-competitive conduct, such as cartels or bid-rigging.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Urban (TU): We believe that adoption of the Whistleblowing Act deserves to be marked as a breaking point and an important step in the corruption-fighting effort within Slovakia.

His object was to express his abomination of all ceremonious modes of utterance, to cry down any religious feeling which might be excited, not by the sense, but by the sound of words, and in fact to insult the cathedral practices. Had St Paul spoken of rightly pronouncing instead of rightly dividing the word of truth, this part of his sermon would have been more to the purpose; but the preacher\u2019s immediate object was to preach Mr Slope\u2019s doctrine, and not St Paul\u2019s, and he contrived to give the necessary twist to the text with some skill.\nI am pretty sure I know what an evangelical is \u2014 someone who believes and worships as I do.\nDon\u2019t press me too hard on this point.

Sadly the world has not been persuaded of the merits of these arguments. Nor do I expect my suppositions on who is an Evangelical to be the final word.\nThe Rev. Billy Graham for one, as tmatt has reported at GetReligion, will not define an evangelical. One of tmatt\u2019s more frequent story lines is \u201cdefine evangelical. Give three examples.\u201d He also has devised a test, the tmatt trio, that places a Christian on the spectrum of belief, that many argue (tmatt disagrees) roughly corresponds to evangelical belief.\n(2) Is salvation found through Jesus Christ, alone? Was Jesus being literal when he said, \u201cI am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

That density could one day lead to RGB grids on a case door or front panel with far more granularity than today\u2019s LEDs.\nCorsair didn\u2019t create the LED technology but it did work with a manufacturer to take LED technology that normally would never be applied to a PC and had it adapted to computer applications.\nOn the top are normal SMD RGB LEDs and on the bottom is Corsair\u2019s new Capellix.\nThe LEDs are so efficient, Corsair said it will be able to use them in wireless keyboards and headphones without jeopardizing battery life. The ramifications of it, frankly, aren\u2019t known yet.\nThe first Corsair hardware to use Capellix LEDs will be Dominator RAM modules. Each will feature just 12 Capellix RGB LEDs in it for lighting. Why just 12 when Capellix is capable of being so dense? Corsair said it wanted to keep power consumption low so it can clock the modules to high levels\u2014something that can be a problem with RGB lighting.\nThe Dominator modules will be available next month but you can bet Corsair is working on just where else it can stuff more RGB LEDS into a PC.\nThis demo module shows a new Corsair Capellix LED in action.

The Israeli diamond dealers gather at their favorite pizza joint to discuss Russian women and Belgian food. The well-dressed government ministers and their attentive bodyguards pace the corridors of the Intercontinental Hotel, bumping into the equally well-dressed opposition members and the scruffy Ukrainian mercenary pilots alike. Angolan soldiers race through the dark potholed streets, looking for fun.\nThis is a sample of what faces the newly chosen president one of Africa's largest, most fragmented and embattled countries. Joseph Kabila has many tasks before him. But the major one - clearly - will be to try to unify a nation so divided that one needs a passport to travel from the western to the eastern side.\nMr. Kabila's resource-rich land of 905,000 square miles is host to the militaries of at least six countries and four different rebel groups.\nBringing peace to the Congo - or even appeasing all the fighting factions - will no doubt be a Herculean task. But it may likely be the only way he can stay in power, as the well as the reason he was named head of state.\nSome diplomatic sources here say that the situation under Joseph Kabila can actually improve. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, sweating profusely this week as he made a 72-hour swing through all the eight countries involved in the Democratic Republic of Congo war, said there is a chance for peace.\n\"We have reason to believe this is a good opportunity to begin all over again,\" confirms his spokesman, Olivier Alsteens.\nThere are a myriad of conspiracy theories swirling about over Laurent Kabila's demise. The government's official position is that a lone bodyguard shot Kabila, but that it is conducting a thorough investigation.\nAnd it's clear here that many of the various fighting factions felt they had reasons to be rid of him. Most security sources here, however, say that the Angolans, Kabila's main backers, were most likely the masterminds behind his assassination.\nHaving come into the DRC at Laurent Kabila's request, the Angolans - unlike the Zimbabweans and the Namibians - are not primarily concerned with the Congo's vast natural resources. For them, the main reason to be involved in the DRC is to ensure that the government in Kinshasa does not support UNITA - the rebel group that has waged a bush war since 1975 for control of Angola's government - as happened under former dictator Mobutu Sese Seku.\nAngola, according to security and diplomatic sources here, had in recent months begun to tire of the elder Kabila, believing he was not suiting their purposes anymore. Looking both at the increasing number of battles against the rebel factions that were being lost (and which were sucking in Angolan resources), and at Kabila's economic policies, which were, to put it mildly, not working at all, Angolans had begun to feel that Kabila would not be able to hold out much longer to challengers. Nervous, according to these sources, that the next leader may not be easy to manipulate or even work with, they decided to take control of the situation themselves.\nWhen"}

He says they publicly shot each of them dead one by one. He says that 120 families are still trapped there.\nAn official with the Anbar governor's office corroborated the account of Monday's killings. He spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief journalists.\nAnalysts believe ISIS may be trying to take revenge for the tribe siding with the American forces in the past, as well as Iraqi security forces. The killings also likely will terrify other Sunni tribes that would think of resisting the militants.\nEarlier this week, Human Rights Watch reported that ISIS executed 600 Iraqi prison inmates when they seized the country's second-largest city of Mosul in June.\nOn Friday, the Security Council issued a statement expressing \"deep outrage\" at the ISIS killings, kidnapping, rapes and torture in Iraq, saying the group's actions \"may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"\nISIS militants have overrun a large part of Anbar province in a push to expand their territory across Iraq and Syria. Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the U.S.-led coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against ISIS since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.\nSome Sunnis in Anbar supported the militants when they seized Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in December. That came after widespread Sunnis protests against the Shiite-led government in Baghdad for what they described as second-class treatment.\nSince ISIS' major offensive in Iraq, a number of Iraq's Sunni tribes have been fundamental in stalling its advance, taking up arms and fighting alongside Iraqi security forces.\nRamadi has yet to fall in part because of key Sunni tribes in the city. The Jughaifi and al-Bunimer tribes have helped Iraqi special forces protect the Haditha Dam in Anbar. In the battleground town of Dhuluiyah, the al-Jabbouri tribe has been the sole resistance to an ISIS militant takeover.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and his new government have vowed to create a community-driven national guard that would empower local tribes. Other tribes have not been won over, and have allied themselves with the militant group as a means for contesting the Shiite-led government.\nIn the vast province of Anbar, some 5,000 tribesmen are backing government efforts to take part in the fight and receive arms and financial compensation. With tribes often numbering 30,000 to 40,000 people, the effort still has a long way to go, however.\nMeanwhile Monday, ISIS claimed responsibility for two bombings on Shiite pilgrims that left 23 people dead in Baghdad a day earlier.\nIn a statement posted online late Sunday, the group said"}
{"idx": "27963", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Sarah Bareilles's debut album fails to live up to the promise of 'Love Song'.\nSara Bareilles doesn't fit into any particular music scene. An ivory-tinkler who grew up wanting to be on The Mickey Mouse Club, with the soulful croon of an American Idol starlet and a feisty, independent spirit akin to Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette, she's undoubtedly got talent, but she's also a marketing nightmare for any record label.\nLuckily, Bareilles has something pretty big working in her favour - her killer debut single, 'Love Song'. This rousing piano ballad with a whopping great chorus, written to shut up her pushy record label, has recently become a smash on both sides of the Atlantic. In fact, it's currently the most-played song on British radio.\nUnfortunately, Bareilles never manages to match it on Little Voice. The appeal of 'Love Song' stemmed largely from its jaunty pop melody, but just as important were the intriguing lyrics about refusing to bow down to record company demands. Her songwriting elsewhere just isn't as subtle or inspired.\nBy teaming up with long-time Tori Amos collaborator Eric Rosse, Bareilles inevitably invites comparisons to the 'Cornflake Girl' singer. Sadly, she has no designs on Amos's inventive and eccentric style, and too often plays it safe, spending the majority of the album weaving traditional tales of heartache and aspirational love. It's unlikely Amos would ever release a track as trite and clich\u00c3\u00a9-ridden as 'Fairytale', whose closing line goes: \"The story needs some mending and a better happy ending.\"\nComparisons between Bareilles and baroque pop singer Fiona Apple are just as wide of the mark. While Bareilles's breathtaking vocals are a match for Apple in terms of technique, she never utilises them to the same devastating effect. She should sound lovelorn and on the edge of despair on the Elton John-esque 'Love on The Rocks', but, as if often the case here, she simply comes off like a cruise ship singer.\nThere are occasional glimmers of brilliance on Little Voice, such as album closer 'Gravity', on which Bareilles delivers a goosepimple-inducing vocal that would be the envy of any diva. The stripped-back, cinematic 'City' is equally impressive. Alas, moments such as these are few are far between, serving to highlight the predictability and safeness of the rest of the record. While Bareilles may offer a different slant on the over-populated singer-songwriter genre, it's merely a new shade of grey, not a colourful evolution."}

On his journey back to Belfast, he was detained at London's Heathrow Airport under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.\nThe police action forced Mr Maskey to miss a city council meeting the following night, and Sinn Fein claimed that it was part of a plot to try to unseat him from the council.\nNow aged 50, he is married with two grown-up sons and a grandchild.\nIn the City Hall, he is regarded as the father-figure within the 14-strong Sinn Fein group.\nHe may be small in stature, but in republican eyes, Alex Maskey is regarded as a giant."}

{"idx": "27966", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Before you freak out and throw away your pills, you'll probably want to read this.\nThere\u2019s been A LOT of talk about birth control raising your risk of blood clots, especially some of the newer kinds.\nThis probably isn't news to most people \u2014 it's a well-known side effect that's been in the prescription information forever. And in the past few years, more and more studies have looked at the risk of blood clots associated with newer birth control options, like the ring, the patch, and oral contraceptives with new kinds of progestin (like Yasmin or Yaz, which contain the progestin drospirenone).\nWhen you get a cut or scrape, blood clotting is a normal thing that happens to stop the bleeding. But when a clot forms in a vein or artery, it can be dangerous and sometimes fatal. Blood clots in veins are called venous thromboembolism (VTE), which refers to two different kinds of clotting complications and affects about 300,000 to 600,000 people in the U.S. each year. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is when a clot forms in a major vein (like in your legs, arms, or pelvis). Pulmonary embolism (PE) is when a clot detaches and travels to the heart or lungs, where it cuts off blood flow.\nDoctors aren't always sure what causes a clot, but there are some things that can raise your risk of developing one.\nSome of the main risk factors for VTE are major surgery, being hospitalized for an acute illness, immobility, cancer, obesity, and trauma to your legs, ankles, hips, or pelvis, Dr. John Heit, professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiovascular Diseases at Mayo Clinic, tells BuzzFeed Life. For women, the risk of clots is also higher during pregnancy, right after giving birth, when taking hormone therapy, and when taking many types of hormonal birth control. There's also evidence that the risk of blood clots in veins is somewhat inherited, says Heit.\nYes, being on some kinds of birth control can slightly raise your risk of blood clots. But not all of them.\nThe best evidence shows that the estrogen and progestin in birth control increases the concentration of blood clotting components, which increases the risk of developing a clot, says Heit. However, the hormonal and copper IUDs have not been shown to increase your risk, Dr. Jen Gunter, board-certified OB-GYN, tells BuzzFeed Life.\nSo what about this new study that says newer birth controls give you a 4x higher risk of blood clots?! OK...let's talk about that.\nThe study results \u2014 which have been making terrifying headlines this week \u2014 found that your risk of getting a blood clot is 1.8 times higher if you take birth control with a newer form of progestin than if you take birth control with an older form. They also found that the risk of a blood clot on these newer pills is up to about 4.3 times higher than if you don't take any birth control at all. Again, that sounds terrifying. The problem is, most reports aren't actually explaining what those numbers mean and giving them context \u2014 like, you know, how many people actually get blood clots...and 4.3 times higher than what?!\nBuzzFeed Life spoke with the lead study author Yana Vinogradova, research statistician at the University of"}

The body was inclosed front, sides, and top, and carried a canvas curtain, a tail gate, and a step at the rear.\nThe capacity of the ambulance, in addition to driver and orderly riding on the front seat, was 8 patients sitting, or 4 recumbent on litters, or 4 patients sitting and 2 recumbent.\nThe ambulance was fitted with two hinged upholstered seats, which, when not used as such, were folded over into the center of the body to form a deck upon which the lower litters were carried. Each of the upper litters was carried at the front end in two spring-supported strap carriers, and at the rear by one spring-supported strap and one spring-supported hook, swiveled upon the rear center post. These general features, together with certain improvements referred to at greater length below, constituted model B.\nbodies were delivered by September 1, and the contract was not fully completed until May 11, 1918.5 This delay caused no inconvenience except for a short time for spare parts bodies. At no time during the life of this contract was there an actual shortage of bodies.\nA number of changes were made in the body and its appurtances after it was approved. These were covered by supplemental contracts. They included litter trolleys, Vehisote panels for sides and front to inclose the body, storm aprons, and various minor changes.5 The total added cost of these changes amounted to $55.92 on the bodies on which they were made.\nFIG. 19.- G.M.C. ambulance, model '16, closed type.\nfront hangers could run to the rear and back. The bars for these trolleys or tracks at first were placed horizontal; but later were so placed that the rear end was somewhat lower than the front. This arrangement permitted the hanger to gravitate to the rear, when not in use, where it would always be ready for loading. This slope of the trolley bar brought the line of thrust, in pushing the litter forward, more nearly parallel with the track. It resulted in less friction and in greater ease in loading. An entirely suitable trolley-carrying device for the front hangers was finally developed. Metal hoops were placed on the front central upright post, through which the litter handles passed to prevent side sway of the litter.\nThe lower litters were carried on a platform, formed by the seats and compartment along the inside of each of the side walls of the ambulance. The hinged seats were inverted to form this platform when used for recumbent patients. These hinged seats, when inverted, rested on metal stops attached at the proper level to front and rear upright center posts. The inner shoes of the litter ran in a channel iron of suitable size attached to the under surface of the hinged seat. This channel prevented the lower litters from slipping side-wise. The front end of the body and the tail gate prevented fore and aft motion.\nThe bodies of some of the foreign ambulances were wide enough to provide a passageway in the center, between the two rows of litters. This was for the convenience of the attendants in waiting on patients. The ambulance board, however, concluded that little attention could be given to patients when the ambulance was in motion over ordinary roads, and that the extra width offered no compensating advantages.

And then you get a lot of NBA guys coming just getting in shape. [The Jordan games] were the best games because Michael Jordan is not only the best player in the history of the game, but he also was the hardest worker in those full-court runs. He was a really hard worker.\nOne of your former teammates was just like that. I sit across from a Lakers fan and hear all about Kobe\u2019s 4 a.m. workouts.

Here, Dunn comes face to face with the criminal mastermind who caused the train accident that killed his wife: Elijah Price, also known as Mr. Glass. However, just what manner of events would unfold from this unlikely reunion\u2014and how many would lose their lives in the process?\nGlass begins with a dark and foreboding atmosphere as it reveals Kevin Crumb, played by James McAvoy (in one of his two dozen alternate personas, Patricia), talking to a group of cheerleaders who have been captured by \u2018The Horde\u2019 (the collective term for all his personalities), in order to be slain. Then it cuts to David Dunn, portrayed by Bruce Willis, who breaks into a house to attack two youths who had not long before assaulted a pedestrian at random. While reintroducing the audience to characters from its predecessors, Glass builds a near perfect setting for their individual traits to be accentuated. There\u2019s a striking equilibrium between the lighting and the scores, which holds a compelling allure to the more suspenseful and mysterious scenes.\nHowever, there are times when the movie seems rather void of music; making some of the conversations, which are rather compelling, come off as bland. Furthermore, certain transitions in this film are either rushed or disjointed, with one scene related to Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) and a few others related to Dr. Staples (Sarah Paulson), feeling as if they were of forced exposition.\nAnother noticeable weakness this film bears is poor editing. There are a number of scenes that are either slow or unnecessary, with some taking too long to discuss the specifics of psychology-related topics, while others impede the flow of the plot. This, coupled with the sluggish choreography, also makes the very few action scenes in the movie underwhelming\u2014the only compelling sights in them to behold are that of Crumb\u2019s Beast persona displaying his brilliant acrobatic skills, from scaling pillars and walls to leaping great lengths.\nConsidering the plot and direction, M. Night Shyamalan has a fine approach to the Superhero genre in this movie: there is a greater focus on the psychological aspects associated with how the main trio\u2019s traumatic pasts have shaped them into the people they are today, while also making them question the foundations of the beliefs and characteristics they\u2019ve adopted over time to deal with those events. We see glimpses into their troubled pasts and are able to understand the impact of such experiences on their minds. And the cinematography also aids in amplifying this, with the use of close-up shots that capture the characters\u2019 perturbed and perplexed expressions (though such shots are also, at times, overused in this movie).\nThe performances of the main characters are enthralling regardless of the film\u2019s flaws. However, Dunn does not receive enough screen time to shine as a leading character and is shadowed by Crumb and Glass. That being said, this movie has a rather slow buildup for Mr. Glass to take on the role of the active antagonist and criminal mastermind he\u2019s supposed to be.

The energy industry is working to solve this billion-barrel-a-year problem, and one promising alternative to risky disposal wells is reusing wastewater instead of pumping it underground.\nThe oil and gas industry has a love-hate relationship with water.\nEnergy producers need water. It\u2019s used for mud and cement to lubricate, cap and seal off wells. And oil companies use a ton of water mixed with sand and other chemicals for fracking \u2014 which is fueling the United States\u2019 recent oil and gas boom.\nWater is such a precious resource during drilling and fracking, there\u2019s often not enough to go around, says Reed Durfey, a water and technical services manager with Houston-based Newfield Exploration.\nIn the oil field, water is also a huge burden \u2014 one that comes with major economic and environmental costs, Durfey says. Water is expensive to move and store with trucks, pipelines and storage tanks. And much unwanted oil-field water is toxic, like used frack water and \u201cproduced\u201d water from ancient oceans that comes to the surface with oil and gas.\nScientists say the mass-scale pumping of that toxic water back underground into disposal wells \u2014 the government-approved, industry-standard solution \u2014 disrupts faults and has made Oklahoma a global earthquake hotspot.\nOne part of a possible solution: Find a way for oil companies to reuse that wastewater instead of injecting it into oil-field disposal wells.\nReed Durfey, a water and technical services manager with Newfield, stands in front of the containment pond at the Barton facility.\nOn an overcast day in late July, a fleet of electricians, engineers and construction workers scurries around a 40-acre site near Calumet in Kingfisher County conducting final checks and tests on Newfield\u2019s new Barton Water Recycling Facility. The facility is located in the STACK, a booming Oklahoma oil field that has drawn national attention, and is dominated by a towering cluster of tanks and flanked by several colossal plastic-lined ponds.\nThe Barton facility is designed to recycle up to 30,000 barrels of oil-field wastewater \u2014 a day. That means all the wastewater from the company\u2019s 40 well sites can be reused instead of being pumped underground, which equals less pressure on faults and fuel for earthquakes.\n\u201cYou remove that problem or hopefully or you reduce the risk,\u201d Durfey says.\nMost of the wastewater arrives to the recycling facility via pipeline. Here, it\u2019s pumped into a series of tanks, where oil and other contaminants are separated off. Chemicals and bacteria are added to the wastewater, which is piped into one of the holding ponds and pumped full of air.\n\u201cThe goal there is to feed the good bacteria to crowd out the bad, and also oxidize any iron sulfates that drop down out as solids in the bottom of the pits,\u201d says site engineer Ben Lloyd.\nThose solids wastes are eventually hauled off, but the water is pumped into a separate holding pond.

Someone with sufficient time and money, and a strong enough motive, can crack anything.\nSo the real question becomes: Is your encryption secure enough. And the answer is: If your encryption software uses a recognized and respected standard such as AES or Blowfish, and you use strong passwords and take other precautions, it almost certainly is.\nGiven enough time or processing power, any password can be cracked through a brute force attack--where a program throws words and random character strings at an encrypted file until it stumbles upon the right password. But with a sufficiently strong password, the time and processing power required is just not practical.\nTo get an idea of how quickly a password can be cracked, check out How Secure is My Password? When I tried the word password, the web site told me that a conventional PC could crack it \"almost instantly.\" On the other hand, if I used a random string of eight lowercase letters, my files would be safe for all of 52 seconds. But a string of 18 characters, including digits, punctuation, and upper- and lowercase letters, would remain safe for \"3 quintillion years.\" I think that's sufficient--even assuming the use of hardware more powerful than a single PC.\nBut back up your strong passwords with other good habits. Always be suspicious about possible scams. Keep your security software up to date. Never share a password with anyone with whom you wouldn't share a credit card account. And if a Web site offers two-step verification, use it.\nWhen you come right down to it, your security system doesn't have to be 100-percent impenetrable.

The four men and two women on the jury deliberated for about nine hours before reaching a verdict.\nAnd with an estimated 140 other fan conventions across the country calling themselves comic cons, the impact of the decision could be felt nationwide.\nAttorneys for San Diego Comic-Con, who have been quiet throughout the case, declined to comment on the victory as they left the courtroom Friday afternoon. A spokesman for the iconic comic and pop culture convention released a written statement Friday night praising the jury's decision.\n\"We have invested substantial time, talent and resources in our brand resulting in worldwide recognition of the Comic-Con convention held annually in San Diego,\" the statement said. \"San Diego Comic Convention respects the decision of the jury.

Recently, Argentina revealed they had arrested one of the main organizers of the sub building operation. The suspect, Ignacio Alvarez Meyendorff, is identified as working for the Colombian Norte del Valle drug cartel, and in charge of logistics for the submarine project. It's believed that Meyendorff was tracked down via information obtained by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI).\nEarlier this year, ONI sent a team down to Ecuador to do a thorough technical analysis of one of the two submarines found down there in the last eight months. The ONI team spent 48 hours going over the small sub, and concluded that it was more sophisticated than first thought. The outer hull was made out of strong, lightweight, Kevlar/carbon fiber that was sturdy enough to keep the sub intact, but very difficult to detect with most sensors. The hull could not survive deep dives, but this boat didn't have to go deep to get the job done. The ONI team concluded that the diesel-electric power supply, diving and surfacing system and navigational system were all in working order. Some of those who built this boat probably had experience building recreational subs. The sub builders also had impressive knowledge of the latest materials used to build exotic boats. As the ONI team assembled all their findings, it became clear that something extraordinary was happening in these improvised jungle shipyards. ONI took some samples back to for further examination, and more precise identification.\nFor several years now, the U.S. Navy, in cooperation with some Central and South American navies, have been looking for these subs, at sea and on land. While these submarines don't run very deep (less than 20 meters/62 feet), they are invisible to most sensors when completely submerged. These subs were designed to run on batteries for up to 18 hours, before having to surface and recharge. When they are at sea, they usually operate their diesel engines. These are noisy. Sonar can pick up this noise over a long distance, and now that two of them have been captured, it's been possible to run the engines and get a sound profile of this type of boat, and equip American sonar systems with this data. The ONI team calculated that the sub they examined had a range (on internal fuel) of about 12,000 kilometers. Thus the boat could get from Colombia to southern California, and back.\nThe sub was captured where it was being assembled, and a nearby camp for the builders, appeared to house about fifty people. A lot of evidence was collected, and apparently the U.S. DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) used that, and the ONI analysis of materials and components, to develop clues about who was involved. It was the DEA that put together the pieces that led to identifying Meyendorff and locating him in Argentina.\nA typical Colombian \"semi-submersible\" is a 20 meter/63 foot long and 4 meter/12.5 feet wide, fiberglass boats, powered by a diesel engine, with a very low freeboard, and a small \"conning tower\", providing the crew (usually of four), and engine, with fresh air, and permitting the crew to navigate the boat. A boat of this type was long thought"}

Thirteen others were injured.\nDuring first period at the 1,400-student high school about 30 miles south of Houston, authorities say Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a junior, entered the school armed with a shotgun and a .38 caliber pistol, walked into an art classroom, and began shooting. Witnesses said that he fired first the door to the art classroom, shattering a glass pane and sending panicked students to an entryway to block him from entering. He fired again through the wooden part of the door and fatally hit a student in the chest. He then lingered for about 30 minutes in a warren of four rooms, killing seven more students and two teachers before exchanging gunfire with police and surrendering, the Associated Press reported.\nGalveston County Judge Mark Henry, the county's chief administrator, said he did not think Friday's attack was 30 minutes of constant shooting, and that assessment was consistent with other officials who said law enforcement contained the shooter quickly. But authorities did not release a detailed timeline to explain precisely how events unfolded.\nJunior Breanna Quintanilla was in art class when she heard the shots and someone say, \"If you all move, I'm going to shoot you all.\"\nThe 17-year-old Pagourtzis walked in, pointed at one person and declared, \"I'm going to kill you.\" Then he fired.\nWhen Quintanilla tried to run out a back door, she realized Pagourtzis was aiming at her. He fired in her direction.\nAlso among the injured was John Barnes, a school district police officer assigned to the high school, who confronted the shooter, authorities said. Among them: an exchange student from Pakistan.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said explosive devices, including a molotov cocktail, were also found in the suspected shooter\u2019s home and vehicle, as well as around the school and nearby.\nPagourtzis was arrested on capital murder charges and is being held without bail in the Galveston County jail, the Associated Press reported. Gov. Abbott told reporters that the suspected shooter had obtained the two firearms from his father and that he had planned to kill himself.\nFriday\u2019s mass school shooting comes just three months after 17 students and school staff members were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\u2014a massacre that set off an unprecedented wave of youth-led activism against gun violence.

It weighs less than four pounds, and because of the innovative design, the weight of the device and the weapon are evenly distributed.\n\"We've actually tested it with the M249 and M240B machines guns. The M240B weighs 27 pounds, and we were able to show that you can take the weight of that weapon completely off of the Soldiers' arms,\" Baechle said.\nSoldiers testing the device pointed out that initial versions didn't make it possible for them to use the device and go into the prone position. But that's not an issue with the current version.\nAt a recent test with a Soldier at the Military Operations in Urban Terrain site at APG, a sergeant wore the device with an M-4 type weapon and dove into a prone fighting position from a sprint. The Third Arm provided immediate stabilization to improve marksmanship for the Soldier.\n\"Right now it's a prototype device, and it's a fairly early stage prototype device,\" Baechle said. \"It's been getting a lot of interest higher up in the Army, but also online with some of the stories that have come out. We're using some of the interest to help motivate further development of the device.\"\nBaechle said that the Army modernization priorities include \"Soldier lethality that spans all fundamentals -- shooting, moving, communicating, protecting and sustaining.\" Further documentation specifically mentions the fielding of \"load-bearing exoskeletons.\"\n\"It falls in line with the direction that the Army wants to be heading in the future,\" Baechle said. \"We get comments from Soldiers who tell us different things about the way it feels on their body \u2026 about the way it redistributes the load. Some like it, some give us tips about the ways it could be improved, and we're using that input to improve the device and improve the design so that it not only works well, but it also feels good.\"\nIn 2017, the lab conducted a small pilot study of active-duty troops using Third Arm in live-fire trials. The results showed the device can improve marksmanship, reduce arm fatigue and muscle activation for some Soldiers.\n\"We're using that small study to motivate a larger study this year with more Soldiers taking a look at dynamics, shooting scenarios,\" Baechle said. \"We're still refining the device. We're starting to look at heavier weapons.\"\nBaechle stressed that what you see now may not be what gets to future Soldiers.\n\"What we have right now is a very specific device, but we can learn from that device,\" he said. \"I hope in the future what we'll end up with is something that will help the Soldier.

Johansson kicked a 69-yard field goal, which still stands as the longs field goal in collegiate history while playing on the Wildcats' 1976 team. ACU lost the game 52-7.\nWhen Ove Johansson first saw someone kick a football 40 years ago at Abilene Christian University's practice field, he had visions of a scholarship offer.\nTwo years earlier, Johansson was a decorated soccer player at NAIA power Davis and Elkins in the hills of West Virginia. He followed his girlfriend and eventual wife, April (Bankes) Johansson, to Abilene. He didn't have the money to pay ACU's tuition. A Swedish emigrant, Johansson knew nothing about American football. But he possessed a powerful right leg.\nStill, it was impossible to envision what lay ahead. October 16, 1976, was a momentous day not only in ACU history but college football as well. Texas A&M's Tony Franklin kicked the longest field goal (64 yards) in college history. That record lasted mere hours.\nJohansson boomed a 69-yarder that stands as the longest at any level. It came maybe one hour after Wilbert Montgomery set the collegiate record for most touchdowns. Fittingly, these former Wildcats will be honored 40 years (and six days) later at a luncheon on noon Saturday before ACU's Homecoming Game against Incarnate Word. Tickets for the luncheon are $25 or $40 for the luncheon and a ticket to Saturday's game.\n'I haven't seen Wilbert since I think the 10-year anniversary,' said Johansson, 68, a successful businessman in Amarillo. 'It was a wonderful reunion (30 years ago) for me to come back and see Wilbert there with his family.\nJohansson, who spent one year at ACU and then part of a season as Montgomery's teammate with the Philadelphia Eagles, warmed up before the game with holder Dean Low. He kicked from 40, then 50, then 60 yards.\nIt was prophetic. Forty years later, it is visible on Internet sites. And Johansson, who came to this country without any knowledge of American football, is a legend among place-kickers.\nFor a guy whose entire football career lasted two seasons, his is a storybook tale. One day he was playing a semiprofessional soccer game in 1972 and was noticed by the Davis and Elkins coach, who promised to keep in touch. Johansson, who met his future wife that day ('I went up to her at halftime and in the 23 words of English I knew I asked her for her phone number,' he recalled), wanted to return to the U.S. for college but his family had little money.\nWhen the coach offered books and meals, Johnasson"}
