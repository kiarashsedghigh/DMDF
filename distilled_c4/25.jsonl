However, the national team have survived the first round of every European Championship since Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Co won the title in 1988 so there is always the possibility of another penalty shootout defeat in the quarter- or semi\u007ffinals.\nHave any players appeared in commercials or any other adverts?\nEdwin van der Sar features in a commercial for healthy mints, in which he stops penalties taken by Bad Breath, Tooth Slice and Coffee Stain. The revenues may go to a good cause.\nNot really. Van Basten\u2019s preference for Ajax reserves is suspect, while the way he stubbornly clung on to the two-winger system when there wasn\u2019t a recognised one in the squad was a bit strange \u2013 but players have recently talked him out of that. However, every Dutch national coach suffers from the nation\u2019s expectation of being entertained. Winning is not good enough, we want \u201cdream football\u201d, too.\nAre there any players with unusual hobbies or business interests?\nClarence Seedorf is the owner of a 125cc Moto GP team. He has also founded the Clarence Seedorf Stadium in Paramaribo and aims to lead Surinam to the World Cup. The Netherlands Antilles also hope to dip into the talent pool of black players in the Eredivisie, which may affect the Dutch national team in the future.\nThere is a tendency to use coaches as pundits. \u201cThis would never happen against any team of mine\u201d is always a subtext of their comments. Louis van Gaal quit during the qualifying tournament, saying he had pointed out the same mistakes in the team tactics over and over again and felt he was repeating himself. However, it is very difficult for Van Gaal to keep his opinions to himself, so when asked, he will surely turn up somewhere on the telly. As will Johan Cruyff who was simultaneously a TV pundit and an advisor to Van Basten during the 2006 World Cup. After the bad-tempered loss to Portugal in the last 16, Cruyff defended Van Basten in his newspaper column the next day and blamed the defeat on government minister Rita Verdonk, who had refused to give Salomon Kalou a Dutch passport.\nWill there be many fans travelling to the tournament?\nMost Dutch tickets are taken by sponsors, the biggest one an insurance company, who use them to reward their agents and employees. It is a new form of hooliganism. At the 2006 World Cup there were frightening stories of unsuspecting foreign fans isolated in pub corners by men dressed in orange who bombarded them with stories about life insurance, investment plans and favourable loan rates."}

I have been in the title industry since 2005, and there have been several times when I needed to step back and take a deep breath or find an outside positive influence that was rejuvenating.\nWhat do you do when you hit the wall and burnout sets in? There are many ways agents can stay motivated during these frustrating times or when they are looking for positive solutions \u2014 not only with their business but also in life. Here are three tips to help agents stay motivated and avoid the dreaded burnout.\nIt sounds like a no-brainer, but misery loves company. If you spend time in your office, you probably know the people who are a negative influence. These agents tend to be frustrated, act negative and make excuses for their lack of success.\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in their antics if you have similar frustrations or issues. One way to stay positive and block out the negativity is by avoiding these people at all cost.\nLike trying to save a drowning swimmer, working with negative agents can result in your own demise. Do your best to surround yourself with the positive people in your brokerage and ask them what they do to maintain a positive mindset.\nLike trying to save a drowning swimmer, working with negative agents can result in your own demise.\nLearning and implementing specific practices to remain centered and positive will enable a much better state of mind and help your overall business.\nHaving played sports my entire life, I can tell you that having a coach is important. Michael Jordan won six NBA Championships, but his coach, Phil Jackson, and the team\u2019s triangle offense system played a large part in that success.\nMany agents are confused about what direction to take their business or how to generate clients to get that business off the ground. These two things alone will cause a lot of frustration and anxiety.\nInvest in your business by hiring a good real estate coach who can not only help with your career but also keep you in a positive mindset. A real estate coach can listen to your frustrations and work with you to find fruitful solutions to issues that cause negativity.\nIf your marketing budget does not allow for a coach, find an accountability partner that can assist by meeting with you on a regular basis to track your progress. Knowing that business partner is there to guide your business is a great way for agents to stay motivated and on track.\nWhen people are sick or need medicine, they visit the doctor. The doctor does everything he or she can to help you get back to peak health and carry on with life. Things are no different in the real estate business.\nI find it beneficial to attend events and get a shot of motivation and inspiration. Motivational real estate conferences take place all over the country and provide helpful solutions for agents.\nTraveling to another market area and surrounding yourself with positive people over the course of a couple days and receiving these encouraging messages will get you in the right mindset to conquer your real estate business.\nReal estate is tough work. I think this is something we can all agree on, but as the thought leaders in the real estate industry, it\u2019s vital to keep a positive mindset and not get caught up in the antics of negative influences.\nIt\u2019s vital to keep a positive mindset and not get caught up in the antics of negative influences.\nWhen frustrations or negative issues start to creep in, seek motivation and assistance through positive influence, an inspirational"}

It was really nice, but more alive and exciting than the sweet house sound I associate with Dynaudio.\nThe Emit M10s unfurled a wall-to-wall soundstage with great depth as I played Brian Eno's new album, \"The Ship.\" The first track is a rambling, ambient trip, with a churning low bass foundation that I could hardly believe was coming from speakers as small as these. I was so totally sucked into Eno's slow-motion vortex of sound and texture that I forgot that I was listening to the Emit M10s; I was lost in the music.\nI also played Nap Eyes' spicy \"Thought Rock Fish Scale\" album to see how the Emit M10s handled rock, which they did with aplomb. It's hardly head-banger music, but Nap Eyes recorded these tunes to four-track tape without overdubs, and even before I knew about that, I heard the music had a refreshingly direct, less-processed and live sound than most rock albums. Nap Eyes' crazy rhythms and Nigel Chapman's vocals were right there, firmly planted between the two Emit M10s. Chapman sounds like Lou Reed at times, and the band has a Velvet Underground vibe, but there's nothing overtly retro about Nap Eyes music I can put my finger on.\nMy brief encounter with the Dynaudio Emit M10 left me with a respect for its abilities, and I expect to review more Dynaudio speakers later this year."}

But the court also ruled that a lower court went too far when it blocked the order nationwide.\nJustice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said the executive order was a legal use of the president's power. He called the 9th Circuit's decision a victory for \"criminal aliens in California, who can continue to commit crimes knowing that the state\u2019s leadership will protect them from federal immigration officers whose job it is to hold them accountable and remove them from the country.\"\n\u201cThe Justice Department remains committed to the rule of law, to protecting public safety, and to keeping criminal aliens off the streets,\u201d he said.\nTrump signed the executive order on Jan. 25, 2017, just five days after taking office, calling undocumented immigration a \"clear and present danger\" to national security. But U.S. District Judge William Orrick called the threat \"coercive\" and said spending powers belonged to the legislative, not executive, branch of government.\nOrrick's ruling was the result of lawsuits filed by two California counties \u2013 San Francisco and Santa Clara. His decision cited statements from Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, which indicated that the order could jeopardize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds. The government argued that the order only applied to three Justice Department and Homeland Security grants that would affect less than $1 million for Santa Clara and possibly no money for San Francisco.\nJustice Department attorney Chad Readler told the 9th Circuit judges that the order was limited in scope and that public statements from Trump or other administration officials should not be given too much weight.\n\"When a president overreaches and tries to assert authority he doesn\u2019t have under the Constitution, there needs to be a check on that power grab,\" San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement Wednesday. \"The courts did that today, which is exactly what the framers of the Constitution had in mind.\"\nThe administration's fight against sanctuary cities also suffered a setback last week, when a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the city of Chicago's lawsuit over Sessions' efforts to force cooperation with federal immigration enforcement officers.\nIn September, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber issued an injunction against Sessions' order that required police to cooperate with federal agents or risk losing federal law enforcement grants.

Coverage can be provided through a stand-alone policy or as an endorsement to a personal lines policy.\nProperty coverage under the Boatowners base form is provided on an open perils basis for eligible watercraft identified on the declarations, plus boating equipment and newly acquired watercraft, the last up to a built-in sublimit for 30 days.\nProperty coverage is subject to standard exclusions (war, nuclear hazard, etc.) plus additional exclusions applicable to marine insurance. The latter include exclusions for loss due to marine life, marring/bubbling/delamination (considered to be matters of maintenance), and business use, except for the entertainment of clients.\nLiability coverage extends to use of all declared watercraft, motors, and trailers, plus non-owned boats except for those rented or regularly available to the insured.\nAny boatowners policy that includes liability coverage automatically includes coverage for removal of a wrecked boat up to 25 percent of the liability limit for bodily injury and property damage. Such a policy would also automatically provide uninsured boater coverage up to a base limit established in the manual; higher uninsured boater limits are available.\nPersonal watercraft, such as \u201cJet Skis,\u201d are covered under the program if identified on the declarations, or if they are acquired during the policy term; liability coverage for use of them can be effectively excluded by endorsement. (The endorsement modifies the definition of \u201cboat\u201d so it does not include personal watercraft.) Coverage for personal watercraft is limited to within 10 miles of the U.S. coast; coverage for other insured watercraft extends to 100 miles.\n\u00b7 An optional endorsement implementing an agreed value settlement provision in place of the actual cash value loss settlement built into the policy.\nAAIS has refined the rating procedure for the Boatowners Program, but it continues to have a relatively simple procedure that standard personal lines underwriters can use with readily available information.\nThe rating territories, which continue to cover all U.S. inland and coastal waters, have been subdivided and increased in number from five to 11. This refinement reflects, among other things, disaster exposure to boats made evident by Hurricane Katrina and other coastal catastrophes.\nThe revised rating procedure also includes a new premium credit for experienced operators and a surcharge for multiple owners, in addition to other refinements.\n\u201cThis program provides a standardized package policy with a simple rating plan for insuring the most common types of family boats,\u201d says Pamela Nykaza, AAIS senior product development specialist and the principal developer of the latest AAIS Boatowners revision."}

In 2016, David Lipton discussed the backlash against globalisation. In 2017, Mervyn King explored global macroeconomic imbalances. Last year, Tharman Shanmugaratnam looked at wage stagnation and the decline of social mobility. This year I have been invited to discuss central bank independence.\nThere\u2019s a pattern here. Central banks must be in trouble.\nLooking around the world, there are signs of this trouble in many places \u2013 including advanced economies, where institutional stability can no longer be taken for granted. You will all be able to think of examples. The Bank of England has been criticised for warning about the costs of Brexit, which just shows that giving good advice in a polarised political environment is no way to make friends. As for the United States, everyone likes telling the Fed what to do, and as we have seen this urge is not confined to those without authority. Elsewhere, a conflict over the central bank\u2019s reserves has led to a Governors\u2019 resigning. And of course in South Africa, the independence of the Reserve Bank has also come under threat in recent years, which must be why you think I\u2019m the person to discuss this subject.\nTonight, I will briefly review the textbook case for central bank independence, which centres on the well-known time-inconsistency problem. It is an elegant analysis, but it only covers a narrow part of central banking. In particular, it does not apply very well to financial sector mandates, such as financial stability or banking regulation, which are core duties for many central banks. I want to argue however that the case for central bank independence goes further. The issue is actually another classic economic concept: the principal-agent problem. How can societies get their leaders to look after the public interest instead of their own short term political interests? This is one of the fundamental difficulties of government. In my experience, it has also been the main reason the South African Reserve Bank has needed its independence.\nIndependence allowed us to deliver on our mandate, as set down in the constitution. Independence ensured that the tremendous powers of a central bank \u2013 such as printing money, or licensing and supervising banks \u2013 couldn\u2019t be taken over by politically connected individuals bent on looting the state instead of serving the citizens. I\u2019m not sure exactly how this should be modelled \u2013 how we could prove the point in a large empirical study, and get a peer-reviewed article out of it \u2013 but it has been my lived experience for some years now. There is a saying: there are no atheists in foxholes. We\u2019ve been on the frontlines lately, the place where good and bad governance meet, and I promise you \u2013 in that situation, you really learn to believe in central bank independence.\nLet\u2019s start with the textbook. Kydland and Prescott showed that governments suffer from a time inconsistency problem. They\u2019d like to promise low inflation in future, but when the future shows up, they discover it\u2019s easier to tolerate higher inflation instead. As a result, lenders, firms and workers start to anticipate tighter inflation, and everyone ends up living in a world they would not choose, with a built-in bias towards higher inflation and higher interest rates. The solution to the problem is an independent central bank, with a clear mandate to control inflation. With this mandate in place, governments do not have to pay higher inflation risk premia on their debt, and society as a whole gets to enjoy a lower level of inflation"}

Opponents also believe Swiss authorities would stand a good chance of challenging the threatened German sanctions in court.\nAccepting the terms of the accord would put an unfair burden on the population living around the airport, they say.\nThe government, for its part, says failure to approve the accord would result in considerable uncertainty for Switzerland's aviation and for Zurich airport as an international hub.\nTransport Minister Leuenberger stressed that the deal was a fair compromise, because Switzerland had managed to negotiate a deadline of more than three years before the accord would take effect.\nHowever, if Germany makes true its unilateral threat, the number of flights over southern Germany would be immediately reduced to 80,000 per year.\nIn addition, the Swiss flight control authority, Skyguide, would no longer be allowed to manage incoming Zurich-bound flights over southern Germany.\nSome experts say this could weaken aviation around Zurich, turning it into a provincial port. Zurich airport sits less than 20 kilometres from the German border.\nSeveral towns in southern Germany have complained for years about noise pollution out of the airport, and have called for the use of alternative flight lanes into Zurich.\nEnvironmental groups and local authorities from within Switzerland have also voiced concerns about the planned increase in flights under the deal with Germany.\nGermany's parliament is expected to approve ratification of the air transport deal with Switzerland in coming weeks.

Why was it created?\nHistorically, Rodale had done a lot of digital initiatives in different areas. People were building products within each of the brands in a very siloed manner, but that wasn\u2019t going to bring Rodale to the next level. So this was put together to create a unified approach.\nWhat\u2019s your goal for this job?\nI think it\u2019s to take Rodale to the next level in digital, which means looking at distribution, new products, new spaces to monetize and other verticals we can grow into, potentially outside of the existing brands. I think the most exciting part of this job is being able to focus on health and wellness content in the digital space, not just as pure publishing.\nSpeaking of monetization, is e-commerce going to be a focus?\nE-commerce is certainly an area we haven\u2019t stepped into as much as we could. I also want to look more at strategic partnerships that are like sponsorships. We have a lot of data on how people use our products, so how can we work with some of the big brands to build better marketing packages for them? We\u2019re doing a lot of events, so can we do more digital events? Do we look at social gaming?\nWhen you were hired, you said that your main areas of focus would be mobile and digital video. It seems like every publisher is saying that, though. How can Rodale do it differently?\nIt depends on the brand, to be honest. What we\u2019re doing right now is building a mobile task force that\u2019s working with each of the brands to come up with their own independent strategy and helping to build a strong platform that helps us be very nimble. One of the biggest problems is the monetization strategy around mobile. It hasn\u2019t really been figured out. So I think we need to learn how to effectively use that real estate.\nWhat\u2019s your strategy for video?\nWe did a whole YouTube play back in 2012, so we\u2019ll be taking a look at that. There\u2019s not a video product person at Rodale right now who looks at programming and distribution, so that\u2019s one of the key hires I\u2019ll be making. Building a digital video studio is also a project I\u2019ll be working on.\nTech is obviously a very male-dominated space. What are your thoughts on being a female digital executive?\nThere are a few powerful women who are helping transform the digital space, which is great. But there is definitely room for more. In my free time, I try to encourage the younger generation of girls to pursue technology and computer science because there is an abundance of opportunity for them down the road.

There's also a qualitative change happening as the Web becomes more closely integrated with the real world via sensor-based smart phone applications. Web Squared is another way of saying \"Web meets World.\"\nThe first generation of Web 2.0 applications harnessed the collective intelligence of users typing on keyboards. Whether it was links and clicks (Google), articles and edits of shared knowledge (Wikipedia) or votes (Digg), the application was driven by explicit human actions. Five years in, collective intelligence applications are increasingly driven by cascades of sensor data being thrown off by devices, often without explicit human intervention. Today\u0092s smartphones contain microphones and cameras, as well as motion, proximity, location, and direction sensors. They have their own eyes, ears, and sense of touch. Revolutionary new applications connect those senses to cloud databases and programs running on massive server farms.\nThe scale, nature and speed of the data change what we mean by collective intelligence. Consider the obvious use case: internet-connected GPS applications that have built-in feedback loops, reporting your speed and using it to estimate your arrival time based on its knowledge of traffic ahead of you.\nWhere the Web Squared world gets really interesting, though, is when applications use all the senses of a device, coordinating them much like the human brain coordinates our senses, to draw conclusions that would be difficult with one sense alone. The Google Mobile Application for the iPhone detects the movement of the phone to your ear, and automatically goes into speech recognition mode. It uses its microphone to listen to your voice and decodes what you say by referencing not only its speech recognition algorithms but what it expects to hear you say based on the most frequent search terms in Google's search database. The phone also makes good use of GPS or cell-tower triangulation to detect its location. A search for \"pizza,\" for example, returns the result you most likely want: the name, location and contact information for the three nearest pizza restaurants.\nIn this sense, the Web Squared era is an era of augmented reality, arriving (like the sensor revolution) stealthily, in more pedestrian clothes than we expected. Our devices can tell us what we're seeing (like"}

Using both propane and gas gives each truck a range of about 600 miles, he said.\nEach conversion costs upwards of $10,000, but he said expected savings from less frequent maintenance and lower fueling costs will mean a payback period of nine to 11 months per truck.\nOnce the full fleet is converted, annual savings are expected to be in the five figures, he said.\n\"This is what I don't understand...why this isn't more popular than it is,\" Chamberland said.\nOne reason could be that vehicle propane fueling stations are rare in the area.

In handling trouble, I have found the first step out of it is to acknowledge it.\nPaul said, \u201cFor we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:8).\nAs you can see, trouble does come. It also came to Jesus. It came to the disciples as well. It comes to me and it comes to you. However, there is a way out of your trouble. There is a way out of your despair. There is a way out of your distress. You are a child of God, and God never intended for any of His children to be overcome by the devil.\nYou are an overcomer. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\nPaul went on to say, \u201cBut we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:9). Look where Paul\u2019s faith was. Thank God we know the One who even raises the dead.\nEven death itself has no dominion over us as believers. Eternal life beats in your breast. So, if you are in conflict and in big trouble, you know what the end is going to be.\nYou may ask, \u201cWhat if I die?\u201d There is no death because to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. It is just that quick \u2014 one moment we are here on earth, and the next we are with Him. So why should I be fearful? Why should I be afraid? Why should I be distressed? It is because \u201cgreater is He that is in me than He that is in the world\u201d (1 John 4:4).\nThink about that, beloved. God has a miracle for you. You don\u2019t have to stay in the mess you are in. There is a way out.\nThe Bible says, \u201cMany are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all\u201d (Psalm 34:19). This is talking about us!"}

These items were viewed as assets that could retain value or be sold later.\n\"We challenge the idea that people are more willing to go into debt for a longer lasting thing,\" says Sharma.\nTurns out, experiences are more likely to have a date-stamp on them than the new television or gaming console you can buy any time.\n\"Because you plan to do something at a specific time, it makes it harder to put off making the purchase until you have more money,\" says Stephanie M.

We sort of felt like we explained the polar bears. We saw polar bear cages. We saw Sawyer locked in a polar bear cage. But people were still like, \"What's up with those polar bears?\" That seems to be kind of an obsession. Libby has also been an obsession.\nLindelof: The new obsession is basically, \"How many questions are you guys going to answer?\" And people are asking us that like Carlton and I are gonna go, \"87. We're just not going to tell you which ones.\" Or, \"What percentage of the mysteries are you going to answer?\" But that doesn't take into account the fact that some people consider some things mysteries that other people don't consider mysteries at all or don't care about.

We're still doing the same thing we've always done on the show, which is island storytelling and off-island storytelling. It just now starts to take on a different form in the final season.

Along the way, we're going to tackle some of the mythological biggies, like what's the smoke monster? You'll learn more about the nature of the island.

But if a state trooper makes the arrest in Lakewood, the suspect is processed at another location and could be released to the custody of a sober adult without having to post bail.\nCleveland.com and The Plain Dealer have been advocating for bail reform through its ongoing Justice for All series that began in 2016. The series included a report on the unfair nature of bond schedules, which are based solely on the charge against a suspect rather than whether the suspect poses a risk to society.\nCarroll believes basing bail \u201csolely on the level of offense\u201d has become outdated. Someone with a mental illness or drug addiction could pose a threat to themselves or the community even if the offense they have been charged with is minor. Conversely, someone facing a more serious charge may have a responsible job and no criminal record, suggesting a strong likelihood of following a judge\u2019s orders.\n\u201cIn many cases, conditions of bond, such as no firearms or contact with the victim, continued treatment programs, and other conditions with pretrial monitoring are more effective than posting cash to get out of jail,\u201d Carroll wrote.\nCarroll said his probation department is able to provide the assistance required in some instances, but that he eventually will ask the Lakewood City Council for more money to conduct pretrial services.\nCarroll said that he or a magistrate will continue to set bonds for all felonies and for more serious misdemeanors, such as domestic violence or violation of a protection order, but that all other defendants can be released without bail.\nIf the policy dictates that bail must be set by a judge or magistrate, the police or prosecutor will be required to contact the court within 48 hours. They also must provide the judge with detailed information, such as a defendant\u2019s criminal history, driving record, issues of mental health or substance abuse, occupation and/or source of income and any active warrants or pending protection orders against them.\nCarroll said he developed his customized method of risk-assessment based on his experience and through discussions with others, including former Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ron Adrine, who spearheaded bail reform in Cleveland. The Cleveland court has adopted the well-known Arnold Foundation method for assessing whether a suspect poses a risk if released on bail.\nCarroll said he would like to adopt a formal risk-assessment program if only because the person who takes his place one day may not have his level of experience. Carroll became Lakewood municipal judge in February of 1990 and is in his last term.\nCarroll said he would like to see other municipal courts adopt bail policies similar to the one he now has in place, but that some judges like bail schedules because they view them as a deterrents to crime.

{"idx": "25073", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Tomo Suzuki is a university lecturer of accounting and professor of sustainability science at the Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford.\nThe great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has one of his characters in Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre call double-entry bookkeeping \u201cone of the finest inventions of the human mind\". His portrayal may have been ironic, but if you do bookkeeping well, you really do feel the beauty of it.\nAs businesses have grown globally, accounting has had to adapt. International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been established. If you believe the brochures, the new \u201cinternational\", \u201charmonized\" accounting standards make for \u201cefficient\" financial markets by rendering companies\u2019 performance and stability more \u201ctransparent\" and \u201ccomparable\".\nThe reality is somewhat different. Professor Shyam Sunder of Yale University, who is president of the American Accounting Association, has been openly critical of the current monopoly by accounting rule makers. At Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, we are also sceptical. Why? Because relying on any one set of accounting rules means we are presented with a particular view of corporate reality\u2014one that may not highlight the things that the majority of stakeholders want to see.\nThe corporate reality that is currently presented by IAS/IFRS reflects the values and needs of investors, in particular international institutional investors. The IAS/IFRS rules are written by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which promotes the idea of \u201cfair value\" (that is \u201cmarket value\") accounting focusing on providing information that is useful in making financial investment decisions. That\u2019s fine for global investors, but not so good for other stakeholders.\nThe average CEO or CFO, for example, is unlikely to feel that market value accounting, which is often at the mercy of volatile financial and real estate markets, reflects their company\u2019s true operational performance.\nContrary to the name, \u201cfair value\" accounting allows managers a lot of discretion in how they present their accounts, not least because most balance sheet items do not have clear and objective market values. This is one of the main reasons why Japan still objects to IAS/IFRS rules.\nThe Japanese business community fears that senior managers may lose their highly disciplined approach to financial management if the level of profit can be so easily and legally manipulated by accounting. They also fear that pressure from foreign investors with short-term goals makes it difficult for managers to focus on the long-term strategies that have historically been a key strength of many Japanese companies.\nThat is why the accounts of Japanese companies show \u201cnormal operational profit\", a measure which IAS/IFRS are about to drop from their accounting standards.\nThe voices of employees and community representatives are rarely heard in arguments about the formulation of accounting standards, despite the fact that community representatives are increasingly seen as significant stakeholdersin business.\nMeanwhile, \u201cfair value\" accounting means that tax officials and lawyers have lost access to the objective data they need to do their jobs effectively.\nAdditionally, under the current international system, politicians and other stakeholders who care about their domestic welfare and environmental sustainability have no way to measure companies\u2019 performance in these areas. Accounting used to be a means to control corporate behaviour and national economy, but politicians are now about to lose their control.\nAt Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, and in academic accounting departments around the world, pluralist and social constructivist researchers argue that there is room for multiple, competing accounting frameworks to operate simultaneously, so that different kinds of accounting can be used to present different pictures of corporate life.\nFrom this"}

O\u2019Sullivan is from the National Party which is a smallish, conservative party within the larger ruling coalition. Senator O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s proposal was that a law be passed to prevent pro-aborts from disrupting Day of the Unborn Child Masses in Australia. Day of the Unborn Child is a Catholic remembrance of the victims of abortion that was instituted by Pope Saint John Paul II and it his held in conjunction with the Feast of the Annunciation.\nAs a rule, I\u2019m against this kind of snowflakery, but sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Even in the US, we have a federal law that recognizes abortion clinics as the only places in the nation where you lose your First Amendment rights if you get too close to the front door, even if you are on public property. Australia has a similar law deifying abortion, so if someone wants to say pro-aborts can\u2019t interrupt Mass on one day a year, whatever.

It isn\u2019t Catholicism, or any religion, for that matter, that makes an unborn child a human being. Biology does that for us. But when you have no real argument to make\u2026and this is a particularly stupid argument even by the low bar of pro-abort arguments as it has nothing to do with abortion and everything to do with ensuring people can worship in peace on one day a year\u2026attack the other person\u2019s religion and claim they have no standing because they are of the wrong one of the 50+ genders out there.\nI think more of this is the way forward in dealing with the SJW idiocy we are confronting. Rather than shaking our heads, we need to embrace the idiocy and weaponize it against the left. It would be great, for instance, if obviously heterosexual males started applying for athletic scholarships as females. Not only would the quality of those sports improve\u2026except maybe gymnastics\u2026we could drive a stake through the Title IX rules that have killed a lot of collegiate sports.

I also do a lot of experimenting with various other digital marketing strategies. I\u2019m often pleasantly surprised by the results. Other days, I\u2019m wracking my brain trying to figure out what caused a website to drop many rankings overnight. If your website is at the top of the search engine results one day and somewhere near the bottom the next day, it may be that Google made one its many algorithm changes that it makes without warning.\nGoogle\u2019s intent in creating these algorithm changes isn\u2019t to keep digital marketers and webmasters second-guessing themselves. Keep in mind that Google plays fair in search results for businesses and their customers. The overall intent is to drive the best-case-scenario customers to businesses\u2019 websites and to take customers to the exact website or information they\u2019re looking for as quickly as possible. When the two meet, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nThe point is, Google algorithms are in a constant state of evolution. To keep a competitive edge, webmasters need to evolve in their knowledge about search engine algorithms in addition to tried-and-true search engine optimization (SEO) techniques. The best way to do that is to learn more about artificial intelligence, machine learning and the newest flavor of algorithms: voice search.\nIf you\u2019ve ever touched a hot stove, you\u2019d hesitate to touch one again. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a process that tells machines that something isn\u2019t quite right and it needs to gather some new information and adjust to it somehow. AI technology effectively trains computers to process large amounts of data, recognize patterns in it and change the way that a computer responds to it.\nDigital marketers need to think of Google Search as being omniscient -- or all-knowing. I read an article that suggests we should assume that Google sees and hears everything. Our job as digital marketing experts is to give it as much evidence as possible to convince Google that our site has earned a top-ranking spot.\nWhat\u2019s The Best Approach To Optimizing Voice Search?\nI recently spoke to Oleg Shchegolev, co-founder of SEMrush, who provided some sound and simple advice for optimizing voice search. He taught me that, among priorities for marketers, using long-tail keywords, claiming your company\u2019s Google My Business listing an ensuring the mobile version of your website is optimized are three of the most vital steps.\nIn my experience, I have had great results when I have used user intent and question-based search terms, such as \u201cwhere,\u201d near me\u201d or \u201cin\u201d a specific location. In one of my projects, I significantly increased local visibility for one of my branches with geo-targeted content by creating content that contains the location keyword \u201cQueens, NYC.\u201d I have created several blogs with local terms and extra pages with content related to the audience -- e.g., \u201cactivities for seniors in Queens, NYC.\u201d Furthermore, I optimized the Google My Business listing for the Queens branch, collect reviews and post updates frequently.\nRankBrain is part of Google\u2019s core algorithm, which uses machine learning to draw the most relevant results from a search query. It effectively collects and interprets sets of data -- the searcher\u2019s location, search words, etc. -- to arrive at the searcher\u2019s true intent and aim them towards the most relevant sites possible. Over time, RankBrain trains the computer to match signals to results and use the calculations to rank websites in the search engine.\nWithin seconds, the search engine can pull up all the closest taco restaurants around.

Their growth rates have been astounding. By most estimates Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all US e-commerce revenues, roughly 5% of all retail and is significantly bigger than their next 10 competitors combined. One study has some 55% of all online product searches starting at Amazon.\nThis week a report that Amazon is considering opening up to 3,000 of their Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores by 2021 grabbed a lot of attention, despite their only having opened up a fourth location a few days ago. Advocates enthusiastically tout the concept's potential ability to revolutionize shopping. Skeptics challenge the high capital cost, the reliability of the underlying technology and whether the stores really offer enough added value to take on well established players like 7-Eleven. I think both miss the larger point.\nFrom a strictly pragmatic view, Amazon is not bound by the limitations of most retailers. They have patient investors who are much more focused on growth than short-term profits. Amazon has a strong commitment to innovation and has enormous capacity to invest for the long-term. While the economics of these stores do look rather challenging, the costs are certain to come down. And besides, at least for now, Amazon is not held to the conventional ROI hurdles that their traditional competitors face.\nWhether or not the world sees 10 or 10,000 Amazon Go stores 5 years from now, what's important to understand is that for Amazon to sustain anything remotely close to current growth rates over the long-term--much less defend against Walmart, Alibaba and others--they MUST significantly expand their physical store presence. You don't have to possess a highly functioning crystal ball to see that one key to unlocking major growth in certain large product categories will require a substantial brick & mortar footprint. There are a few reasons for this.\nThe physical limitations of direct-to-consumer. Until someone invents a teleportation device (Elon, you on it?), considerable retail volume is impulsive driven, demands immediate gratification, is dependent on proximity to point of sale or is just stupid expensive to absorb the \"last mile\" delivery cost. Maybe Amazon is willing to have a robot or drone deliver a Slurpee to you, but that doesn't make it a scalable business model.\nThe difference between buying and shopping. Amazon is really good at the \"buying\" process, i.e., those occasions where the customer values a highly efficient transaction, great pricing, vast (or very specifically curated) assortment and the particular convenience of direct-to-consumer delivery. \"Shopping\" on the other hand is less search and more discovery. It leans heavily on experience, be that the ability to interact in-person with a sales associate, see first hand the quality and/or fit of the product, figure out a broader, more complicated solution (like assembling an outfit or visualizing a re-decorating project) or simply to enjoy the social or entertainment dimensions that a brick & mortar location uniquely provides. While a customer \"shopping\" journey may be digitally informed, a physical dimension is often essential to conversion and customer delight.\nWhen we understand this, it's no surprise that most \"shopping\" dominant segments not only have much lower e-commerce share (groceries, prepared foods, furniture, home improvement, luxury fashion, etc.) but many digitally-native vertical brands (Warby Parker, Bonobos, Indochino, Casper) are investing in"}

Shaped like a rugby ball with large thorns that can pierce even the most callused hands, durian stinks so badly that it\u2019s banned from airplanes, hotels and mass transit in most Southeast Asian cities. In a part of the world where rules are constantly bent and broken, carrying a durian into confined spaces is not taken lightly, punishable by scowls or eviction.\nYet aficionados like Bob and me will travel terrible distances, cancel important appointments \u2014 do anything \u2014 to scarf down globs of custardy flesh from a durian. While many Thais like their durians harvested early so the interior is still hard and can be neatly handled, I like an over-ripened durian, which has the consistency of cottage cheese. It\u2019s a very messy affair.\nThere is a long tradition of durian haters who cannot get past the smell and gooey-ness of durian, especially among Western visitors to Southeast Asia. Simon de La Loub\u00e8re, a French diplomat who came here in the 17th century and wrote with unusual empathy about the Kingdom of Siam, drew the line at durian, describing it as \u201cunbearable\u201d because of its smell.\nBut as a foreign correspondent for nearly two decades who has always sought to write fairly and dispassionately, I dispense with objectivity for a moment and attempt an ode to what the Malaysians rightly call the king of fruits.\nYes, I freely admit that when ripe it can smell like a dead animal. Yes, the fruit is difficult to handle, bearing likeness to a medieval weapon. But get down to the pale yellow, creamy flesh, and you\u2019ll experience overtones of hazelnut, apricot, caramelized banana and egg custard. That\u2019s my attempt at describing durian. But words fail; there is no other fruit like it. Bob compares it to the works of Olivier Messiaen, the 20th-century French composer: complex, dissonant, but with an overall impression of sweetness.\nThe first time I tasted durian was when I was posted in Kuala Lumpur 15 years ago. Trucks piled high with the fruit would come in from the Malaysian countryside, and I would spend evenings sitting with friends on plastic stools by the roadside sampling different varieties. Unlike the Thais, who cut durians down from trees, Malaysians usually wait for them to fall. The result is a much riper and stronger-tasting durian, sometimes slightly fermented. Durian farmers in Malaysia have been known to wear helmets: No one wants to be on the receiving end of a five-pound spike-bomb. Malaysians also believe that durian is an aphrodisiac. When the durians fall, the sarongs go up, goes a Malaysian saying.\nWe live in a time when chemists and"}

Much to my surprise, he thought the DJ group's scratch-centered set was just OK. Our opinions of the Pickles differed so much that I began to feel as if we hadn't gone to the same concert, and in a way we hadn't. The Pickles weren't on a stage, and I was close enough to where they were standing to see every scratch. Closer to the back of the crowd, my friend saw almost nothing - and enjoyed the performance far less because of it.\nHow people experience a concert often has as much to do with the way the show is presented as who actually plays. That went double for Recombinant '96, a three-city West Coast tour headlined by DJ Spooky that aimed to \"stretch the traditional concert paradigms of the late 20th century.\" Sound Traffic Control, the ISO Orchestra, and DJ Spooky all performed powerful sets, but the concert also demonstrated that it isn't easy to effectively present electronic music in a live setting. No matter how excited you are about drifting soundscapes, it's hard to enjoy \"music for airports\" in a crowded club.\nThe night started with performances from the New York \"illbient\" groups Byzar and Sub Dub, which played an interesting mix of ambient dub that would have worked far better as background music than as a stage performance. Festival organizer Naut Humon provided some visual relief for those attached to the traditional concert paradigm; he jumped around like a mad professor while conducting Sound Traffic Control, a sophisticated system that seemed to send bleeps, blurts, and other weird noises from one end of the room to the other.\nBoth the ISO Orchestra and the turntable sets by the Bay Area's Scratch Pickles and the Brooklyn-based X-Men were engaging to watch, but lost something if you couldn't. Granular Synthesis, on the other hand, was impossible to ignore. Over an intentionally disturbing mix of electronic sounds, the Viennese multimedia group projected, onto four screens, films of a woman convulsing in time with the music. Affecting stuff - though it hardly fit in with the night's emphasis on ambience. In perhaps the evening's most ironic moment, the only really recognizable star, DJ Spooky, performed his set behind those same screens. Now *that's * subverting a paradigm - I had to wonder why so few of the other acts did the same.\nBy the end of the evening, there was another source of irony: A festival essentially about recontextualization of sound was itself so dependent on the context in which it was seen. Spooky presented ambient music in the true sense of the word (without a stage to stare at, concert-goers could just dance or chill out), but most of the other acts either left the audience wondering where to look, or performed sets that lost something if people couldn't see. That doesn't mean any of the music was weak - just that our definition of a concert may need a little more stretching. If the Pickles had been a few feet off the ground, it would have been a whole other show."}

The bot is also unstable because of the heavy load it puts on the infected machine, and its frequent crashes can also be used as a signature to identify infected systems.\nSpider.io estimates that the botnet is responsible for at least nine billion of the ad impressions served by the 202 websites it visits\u2014out of a total of 14 billion\u2014and at least seven million unique ad-exchange cookies per month.

High levels of AMR are already seen in the world today as a result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics and other antimicrobials in humans, animals (including farmed fish), and crops, as well as the spread of residues of these medicines in soil, crops and water.\nIn the World Health Organisation (WHO) European Region, the resistance of some pathogens now reaches over 50% in some countries, and new resistant mechanisms are emerging and spreading rapidly. In Norway and Iceland, for example, 400,000 resistant infections are estimated to occur every year, leading to about 25,000 deaths, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nLeft unchecked, AMR is predicted to have significant social, health security, and economic repercussions that will seriously undermine the development of countries; it endangers achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Common and life-threatening infections like pneumonia, gonorrhea, and post-operative infections, as well as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are increasingly becoming untreatable because of AMR.\nFor the first time, Heads of State committed to taking a broad, coordinated approach to address the root causes of AMR across multiple sectors, especially human health, animal health and agriculture. This is only the fourth time a health issue has been taken up by the UN General Assembly (the others were HIV, non-communicable diseases, and Ebola).\nCountries reaffirmed their commitment to develop national action plans on AMR, based on the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance \u2014 the blueprint for tackling AMR developed in 2015 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in coordination with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Such plans are needed to understand the full scale of the problem and stop the misuse of antimicrobial medicines in human health, animal health and agriculture.\nLeaders pledged to strengthen regulation of antimicrobials, improve knowledge and awareness, and promote best practices. They called for better use of existing, cost-effective tools for preventing infections in humans and animals. These include immunisation, safe water and sanitation, and good hygiene in hospitals and animal husbandry.\nWHO recommends we all take measures such as good hygiene (especially hand washing), surveillance and vaccination to prevent health-care-associated infections.\nDr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, stressed, \"Antimicrobial resistance poses a fundamental threat to human health, development, and security. The commitments made today must now be translated into swift, effective, lifesaving actions across the human, animal and environmental health sectors. We are running out of time\"."}

And in that paragraph, referring to Martti Ahtisaari's roadmap to independence, while the draft switches from \"endorse\" to \"supports,\" it still \"calls for its full implementation.\" And there's the rub.\nAsked why a new draft is even being circulated at this time, Amb. Spatafora said it may be explained by developments \"elsewhere,\" not in New York. Not, of course, that there was any breakthough at the G-8 meeting. Amb.

Among the UN press corps, this is code language meaning that copies of the letter are available in the Spokesperson's Office. Several reporters converged, but were told that the letter \"had not yet been circulated by the Council.\"\nThose in the know didn't leave. They exchanged stories, of when Hariri pre-tribunal investigator Detlev Mehlis had a document mistakenly circulated with changes and the time of each change still written on it. A first edit of the report alleged that \"Maher al-Assad, Assef Shawkat, Hassan Khalil, Bahjat Suleyman and Jamal al-Sayyed\" were behind the killing of Hariri. But in the later version, this was switched to \"senior Lebanese and Syrian officials\". Maher al-Assad is the brother of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\nAt Thursday's noon briefing, Ban's spokesperson was asked if Ban had spoke with al-Assad about the passage of the Hariri tribunal resolution. \" He was traveling,\" was the answer.

The teammates are mere weeks away from leaving Earth and rejoining the rest of the human race, when Jack encounters human survivors - led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech - who tell him that he and Victoria are operating under false pretenses.\nThe first of the featurettes for Oblivion is as much an advert for IMAX as it is a promotion of the film. According to Kosinski, the film was shot with IMAX in mind, since the viewing format lends itself well to atmospheric sound design and expansive landscapes, and the director explains that it was his experiences with TRON: Legacy that convinced him to make Oblivion specifically for IMAX. To encourage audiences to see the film as it was intended, Oblivion will be the first ever film to be released in IMAX a full week before general release.\nThe \"beautiful desolation\" of Iceland's vast volcanic landscapes was also used for exterior shots in Prometheus and, as seen in the following featurette, shooting on location in Iceland enabled Kosinski to capture the naturally picturesque and highly volatile surroundings, saving him from having to create an entire world in CGI. From the way that the cast and crew describe it, the country sounds like a very rich filming location, so long as you're willing to risk treading on a geyser.\nFinally, there's a new clip from Oblivion available that shows Jack exploring the ruins of an old library, only to realise that he is not quite alone in there. We've caught glimpses of this scene in earlier TV spots and trailers and, though it's difficult to make out what Jack is being attacked by, this may be the scene where Jack finds himself kidnapped by Beech and the rest of the survivors.\nTwo versions of Earth: one blasted to pieces by aliens and one taken over by anthropomorphic food items. One certainly sounds tastier than the other, but which film are you most looking forward to?\nOblivion is out in theaters on April 19, 2013.\nCloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"}

The U.S. State Department warns about rampant street crime in Brazil, so you should avoid carrying large sums of cash there, especially at night. Be particularly careful when withdrawing cash from ATMs, as targeted robberies occur frequently.\nThe people populating the land that is present-day Brazil did not use money until the arrival of Europeans. European colonists with commercial interests in the country wanted coins for transactions, leading to the beginnings of the Brazilian banking system. The first coins were imported from Portugal but in 1694, King Dom Pedro established a mint in Bahia to produce currency in Brazil. Banknotes, introduced in 1808, did not gain in popularity until the mid-19th century. Brazil has been independent since 1889, but still uses the Portuguese name \"real\" for its unit of currency.\nAt time of publication, the Banco Central do Brasil issued banknotes in seven denominations, worth 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reais.The bills share one common side, showing the head and shoulders of a female figure intended to represent the Republic of Brazil. Each denomination shows the image in a different color; the 2 reais note, for example, is predominantly blue and gray while the 20 reais note is yellow and orange. On the reverse side, each denomination displays a different image, showing an animal or bird native to Brazil.\nAt time of publication, six denominations of coins circulated in Brazil, all with a value of 1 real or less. Each real represents 100 centavos, with the lowest value coin worth just 1 centavo. Values range upward, and you'll see coins worth 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos in your change. Each denomination shares a common side, showing the same female bust symbolizing the Republic of Brazil displayed on the country's banknotes. The plain design on the reverse sides show only the value of the coin as a number and the word centavos, along with the year of minting. The Banco Central do Brasil also issues commemorative coins worth 1 real or more to commemorate particular events, such as the 2010 soccer World Cup, the centenary of flight in the country and the death of Formula 1 world champion Ayrton Senna.\nIn 2000, the Banco Central do Brasil conducted an experiment by issuing polymer banknotes. The bank intended the polymer notes to be more durable and more difficult to copy. A subsequent survey found that the general population approved of the polymer note and thought it an improvement to its paper equivalent, but bank tellers found it more difficult to handle as the notes tended to stick together. The bank decided against issuing more polymer notes, but you might come across one in your change since, as of 2009, more than 9 million remained in circulation.\nKennedy, Rita. \"Facts About Money in Brazil.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/money-brazil-63320.html.

The Reddit user suggested the unnamed colleague was relatively underdressed, with a short-sleeved shirt, because he was not expecting an intimate audience with the president.\nThe commenter attributed the mix-up to a lack of clear communication from the White House.

In a lively Twitter discussion on Thursday, I was discussing work authorization, specifically E-Verify, the national electronic database whereby employers check prospective hires for work eligibility. Midway through this discussion, someone compared it to voter ID requirements, implying a consistent position would be to support both.\nOn its face this seems like a reasonable consideration. If you want to make sure people are legally authorized to vote, you should also want to make sure they are legally authorized to work, right? Upon futher reflection it becomes clear that these two measures aren\u2019t really very similar, and arguments based on their comparison are dubious at best.\nVoter ID is a requirement to access a public civic institution, but E-Verify is a mandate on private businesses. Employers have to screen every applicant for citizenship or work permit status before hiring them. One of the talking points of E-Verify opponents is that it makes every employer a de facto immigration officer and passes the buck of law enforcement to private entities. While actual border enforcement and maintenance of the E-Verify database would remain a federal responsibility, employers would face penalties, perhaps even worse than the unauthorized applicants themselves, for not using the system or violating it.\n(CNN) \u2013 Mike Huckabee says he\u2019s against changing portions of the Constitution that automatically grant citizenship to children of immigrants born in the United States \u2013 a position that puts the potential 2012 Republican presidential candidate at odds some of his party\u2019s most prominent figures.\nIn an interview that aired on NPR Wednesday, the former Arkansas governor and 2008 White House hopeful said the section of the 14th Amendment currently in question has long been held valid.\nI suspect my agreement with Huckabee will begin and end here.\nPHOENIX \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday, weighing in on a clash between the federal government and a state over immigration policy, blocked the most controversial parts of Arizona\u2019s immigration enforcement law from going into effect.\nIn a ruling on a law that has rocked politics coast to coast and thrown a spotlight on a border state\u2019s fierce debate over immigration, Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court here said that some aspects of the law can go into effect as scheduled on Thursday.\nBut Judge Bolton took aim at the parts of the law that have generated the most controversy, issuing a preliminary injunction against sections that called for police officers to check a person\u2019s immigration status while enforcing other laws and that required immigrants to carry their papers at all times.\nJudge Bolton put those sections on hold while she continued to hear the larger issues in the challenges to the law.\n\u201cPreserving the status quo through a preliminary injunction is less harmful than allowing state laws that are likely pre-empted by federal law to be enforced,\u201d she said.\n\u2022 The portion of the law that requires an officer make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person stopped, detained or arrested if there\u2019s reasonable suspicion they\u2019re in the country illegally.\nThose who affiliate themselves, either casually or intensely, with the right wing of the political spectrum need to seriously look themselves in the mirror as regards our policies toward our southern neighbors.\nRobinson correctly observes that Reagan would have had nothing to do with the anger and inflamed rhetoric that so often marks the immigration debate today. \u201cRonald Reagan was no kind of nativist,\u201d he concludes, noting that Reagan was always reaching out to voters beyond the traditional Republican base, including the fast-growing Hispanic population.\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that Reagan signed the 19"}

Early in 2009, when the group was still outlawed in Egypt, he met with its leaders. He made sure to invite Brotherhood leaders to attend his notorious speech to the Islamic world in Cairo in June 4, 2009.\nHe even invited Ingrid Mattson, then-president of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), to offer a prayer at the National Cathedral on his first Inauguration Day \u2013 despite the fact that ISNA has admitted its ties to the Brotherhood. The previous summer, federal prosecutors rejected a request from ISNA to remove its unindicted co-conspirator status.\nWith Brotherhood operatives so warmly favored in the Obama Administration, it\u2019s no surprise that he would want them in power in Egypt as well.

He has recalled the British parliament, which will meet on Thursday to discuss the rioting, the worst violence of its kind in Britain since race riots in the 1980s.\nLondon was relatively quiet on Tuesday night, following the deployment of around 16,000 police in trouble spots around the city. Many businesses closed early on Tuesday amid fears of unrest.\nViolence spread to an increasingly number of towns and cities around England, however, including Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, where groups of young men in hooded tops looted shops and set fire to cars and buildings. In one of the most serious incidents, a police station in Nottingham was firebombed. Violence was also reported in Wolverhampton, Leicester, Bristol and Gloucester.\nYouth have reportedly been using mobile phones and social media to organize the disturbances. In some places they reportedly played cat-and-mouse games with police, who appeared overwhelmed at times. So far police have not used heavy-duty, anti-riot tactics such as tear gas or water cannon, but some conservative and right-wing politicians have called for a harder crackdown on the unrest.\nThere were reports of residents in some cities organizing to protect their businesses and neighborhoods. In Southall, west London, local Sikhs insisted they would protect their temple against rioters. Meanwhile the leader of the far-right English Defense League, Stephen Lennon, has said his group would \"stop the riots,\" claiming the police were unable to cope with the situation.\nA murder inquiry has been launched in Birmingham after a car ran over and killed three Muslim men. The men were reported to have been part of a group that was trying to protect their neighborhood. A 26-year-old man who was found shot in a car in the London suburb of Croydon on Monday has since died in hospital. He is believed to have been shot during unrest there.\nThe authorities have been shocked by the scale of the rioting. \"This has been senseless on a scale I have never witnessed before in my career,\" commented Garry Shewan, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police.\nPolice in London said they had arrested 768 people since the rioting began, and charged 167 suspects. One arrested youth was only 11 years old. Dozens of youths were arrested in other cities, with 300 arrested in the Greater Manchester area alone. A total of 1,335 people have been arrested since the unrest began. Over 110 London police officers have been injured in the violence.\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson, who was heckled Tuesday during a visit to a damaged shopping street in Clapham, has said that plans to cut police numbers should be reconsidered in the light of the violence.\nThe riots come less than a year before London is due to host the Olympics Games. Johnson insisted that the city would be able to host the event as planned. \"We have time in the next 12 months to rebuild, to repair the damage that has been done,\" he said."}

{"idx": "25154", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The subject of DNA is very much in the headlines and news but very few have bothered to learn or understand just how this amazing molecule works and how it makes us what we are from head to toe.\nHaven't you ever asked yourself how you got your nose, eyes, ears, fingers, toes, and everything else? How did your DNA bring all this about? Before we answer that question we need to know just a few simple things about DNA.\nDNA is the abbreviated name for the genetic code and it is exactly that - a code. It is a molecular string of chemical information.\nDNA is located in the nucleus of our cells and is made up of smaller molecules called nucleic acids. These smaller molecules in DNA are arranged in a sequence, just like the letters in a sentence. The sequence of these nucleic acids tell the cells in our body how to build our nose, eyes, hands, feet, and everything else.\nThe material our body uses to build new cells comes from the food we eat. Food is not just for energy. Food is also the \"lumber\" and \"bricks\" the body uses to build new cells. When a cell multiplies it makes more cells of the same size. The only way to do this is by getting new material and that new material comes from food.\nThink about it! When we were in our mother's womb we started off as a single cell not even weighing an ounce at conception. Eventually we developed arms, hands, legs, feet and organs such as brain, heart, lungs, liver, stomach, until we had a complete body. It's true that the single cell we once were multiplied into many more cells, but where did the material come from for that one cell to multiply into billions of more cells of equal size and eventually making a body weighing several pounds from something that didn't even weigh an ounce in the beginning. The material came from our mother's food.\nWhen food is digested and broken down to its basic amino acids the various amino acids are then rearranged in a certain sequence to form cells that make up the various tissues and organs. What sequence these amino acids come together in is determined by the sequence of the molecules in DNA.\nRemember, even after all our organs are formed the cells that make up our organs are continually dying and need to be replaced. Again, the material to make more cells to replace the ones that are dying comes from food.\nThus, when you feed your dog a T-Bone steak your dog's DNA will make sure that steak is digested and rearranged to form the various parts of your dog, but when you eat the same steak your DNA will make sure that the steak is digested and rearranged to form human parts.\nThe sequence in DNA differs from individual to individual and from species to species. For an analogy think of a library where all the books are in one language. In the library there are different books on different topics and subjects. All the books share the letters from the same alphabet, but the sequence in which these letters are arranged are different from book to book. The sequence of the letters makes the difference between a book on chemistry and a romance novel!\nBecause they are accidents in the genetic code, almost all mutations are harmful. Even if a good mutation does occur for every good one there would be hundreds of harmful ones with the net effect over time being harmful, if not lethal, to the species as a whole.\nEvolutionists hope that with enough time and with enough mutations new genes for entirely new traits will be produced leading to the evolution of new biological kinds.

The fines are tied to those designations. Gonzalez has also agreed not to contest one charge of improper procedures, for which the punishment is an $800 fine.\nJohn Wiles, attorney for the state\u2019s Division of Industrial Relations, argued that a jury-rigged system for puncturing and draining aerosol gel and foam cans created a gaseous mix that surrounded workers, creating the ingredients for disaster.\nImproper workplace procedures included inadequate air-purification systems, non-compliant electrical equipment, and improper training and medical testing for respirator use.\nRaul Gonzalez, a worker who was severely burned in the explosion, testified he was told that the work conditions were safe, even for working without respiratory equipment.\n\u201cThe clothes that we wore always smelled\u201d like chemicals, Gonzalez said through an interpreter.\nGonzalez, still recuperating from burns that scarred his hands, neck and face, survived the explosion along with Susano Lopez, Cecilio San Juan and Elias San Juan, who were also severely injured. Gonzalez\u2019s brother, Jaime Gonzalez Sanchez, died Sept. 26, nine days after the accident.\nDuring testimony Terry Taylor, an investigator with the East Fork Fire and Paramedics District, said the system workers were using before the explosion defied reasonable safety precautions.\n\u201cTo me (the process) is inherently dangerous when you have all the products telling you not to do it (on warning labels), and you are manually beating the products\u201d with a mallet, he said. To empty the containers, workers physically pierced the cans with spikes and pounded the cans with mallets before the waste was drained and moved by forklift before disposal.\nTaylor said a spark from the forklift engine may have ignited heavy gases that built up on the shop floor.\nWalter Gonzalez, 46, also faces seven felony and seven misdemeanor criminal charges \u2014 including performance of an act or neglect of duty in willful or wanton disregard of safety or persons or property in connection with a fatal blast.

Kansas City entered the seventh inning up 3-2, and that's how the game ended.\n\"During the past four weeks, the Royals had reconfigured the calculus of postseason baseball. The opponent now possesses only six innings of offensive scoring opportunity. Otherwise, they must confront the three-inning Cerberus of Herrera, Davis and Holland.\n\"The trio inspires such confidence in [manager Ned] Yost. He now operates with impunity, impervious to criticism, unafraid of mistakes. Until the sixth inning on Friday, he also appeared incapable of pulling the wrong lever. At the start of the game, he rejiggered both his outfield and his lineup. Shifted into right field, Lorenzo Cain responded with two stylish catches. Bumped into the No. 2 spot, Alex Gordon smashed an RBI double in the sixth inning for his first hit of the World Series.\"\nKansas City Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie throws Friday during the first inning of Game 3 of baseball's World Series against the San Francisco Giants in San Francisco.\nA patient at-bat by Eric Hosmer yielded another run for the Royals. The Giants drove Royals' starter Jeremy Guthrie from the game in the bottom of the sixth and manufactured a couple of runs.\nBut Pablo Sandoval's groundout left San Francisco a run down going into the seventh, when the Royals' dominant chain of relievers entered the game. Kansas City is now 9-0 in the playoffs when leading after six innings.\nThe loss snapped a six-game World Series home win streak for the Giants and ruined the series debut of 16-year veteran pitcher Tim Hudson.\nGame 4 starts at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday; it's being televised by Fox.

But some parents have said they struggle to find and pay for summer camps or child care in the days leading up to Labor Day.\nThe bill represented the first intense debate in this year\u2019s General Assembly session and the final vote came after several days\u2019 worth of discussion in the Senate.\nDemocratic senators argued Tuesday that school boards struggled to meet the executive order\u2019s requirements to start after Labor Day and end school by June 15 while also accommodating snow days, teacher training days, and religious and secular holidays. They said school boards should have more flexibility regarding when to start and end their school years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about starting school before Labor Day. It\u2019s about giving local school systems the right to decide whether they\u2019re going to start before Labor Day or not,\u201d said Sen.

In this case, opinion polls erred against the liberal candidate, though they swung in his favor during the campaign\u2019s final days.\nMacron\u2019s victory reverses a political slide that began decades ago.\nFrance\u2019s Emmanuel Macron. Credit: LeWeb Photos, Wikimedia Commons.\nThe size of the Macron vote nonetheless indicates clear rejection of the far right, recalling a Japanese proverb that says \u201cYou have to approach the gate of hell to turn back.\u201d In this case, a single debate, 2 \u00bd hours, between the two run-off candidates did the trick. Marine Le Pen attacked relentlessly, often viciously, including fake news about a hidden offshore account and a stream of abuse intended to represent voters\u2019 rage. Unwittingly, she helped answer a big question about Macron\u2019s character. Young and not known as a great public speaker, he rose to the occasion, keeping a steely composure and fighting back with facts and Gallic logic. Short on facts and fuzzy on what she would actually achieve with a dual currency \u2013 a last-minute invention to allay fears over leaving the euro \u2013 Le Pen had reached her Peter Principle, revealing incompetence, or what has been mistakenly called in France her glass ceiling. For Macron, what was supposed to be a predictable but modest victory became a landslide. An 11th hour cyberattack designed to throw off his campaign, associated with Russian hacking, backfired.\nThe French don\u2019t like to be told for whom to vote, apparently.\nThe lesson for democracy is clear. Macron did better with forthright debate, openly standing for Europe, calmly debunking the multiple electoral promises of his opponent, than he had done with a less clearly defined campaign. He showed authority, addressing a fundamental anxiety in today\u2019s political democracies. Rigorous checks and balances, the rise of the media as an independent power and the advent of an individualist society may well have voided the role of politics. But there is a craving for guidance and leadership \u2013 a trend that usually favors more populist leaders. Macron, focused and assertive, defeated the trend even while critics judged him arrogant.\nHis final debate performance was previewed in another hour-long debate with aggrieved workers of a Whirlpool factory, slated by owners to relocate to Eastern Europe. Surrounded by a hostile and worried crowd, Macron began to speak, confronting jeers, and left with handshakes \u2013 accomplished without any formal promise to save jobs: he did pledge to take away any subsidies that may have been granted to Whirlpool, but explained market rules cannot work if a company is not allowed to disinvest, and made the case against punitive import taxes by citing factories nearby that export their production. Few politicians could achieve such a convincing argument, and given Macron\u2019s mandarin background and lack of electoral experience, he was least of all expected to win such a contest.\nMacron\u2019s win was decisive, yet there is a dearth of predictions on the direction he will take or how he will exercise his mandate. This is a consequence of voters\u2019 mood: They rejected the two parties that have structured French political life since 1958. Macron, like Le Pen, is a symbol"}

The non-profit environmental group, Nature Conservancy, has been working for more than four years to get people from both countries to share information on problems including pollution, siltation, and invasive species. After a visit last year, some Brazilian scientists are back in the United States. Jonathan Ahl, of the Great Lakes Radio Consortium, reports on how the two countries are helping each other to help their rivers.\nScientists and government officials from Brazil and Illinois stop alongside the Illinois River, watching different ways researchers use to count the variety and number of fish in the river. This stop is part of a week-long tour through the Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.\nEnvironmentalists have long talked about taking a global perspective to problems, says Michael Reuter, Director of the Illinois Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, the group that is hosting the Brazilians during their tour of the Midwest. He says this exchange helps put that idea into action.\n\"We're trying to shift some of our thinking here to a larger level perspective, a more comprehensive approach,\" he said. \"My sense is that we are making too many decisions based on a narrow view ... too many decisions where we are looking at one piece of the river, only one piece of the problem.\"\nThe major difference between the Pantanal region that includes the Upper Paraguay River and the Upper Mississippi River valley is that Brazil has not yet done the damage to its rivers that has happened in the United States. Pierre Girard is a scientist with the Pantanal Research Institute. He says his country has much to learn from America's mistakes. Mr. Girard says he's already learned that scientists must to work with land managers to set up programs to stop problems before they begin.\n\"We must get managers and the science people together right at the beginning,\" he said. \"We must talk and really try to understand each other and see what the objectives are and define them. We have broad objectives, but we do not have specifics yet.\"\nMr. Girard says Midwest scientists are already providing practical advice on how they can convince developers and farmers to take better care of the land near their rivers. They are already looking at the Midwest's use of buffer strips to separate farmland from the flood plain. While the Pantanal in many ways looks like the Upper Midwest of 150 years ago, local scientists say there is still a lot they can learn from Brazil.\nUniversity of Illinois scientist Rip Sparks says the Pantanal is kind of like a 150-year-old photograph of the Mississippi River valley. He says having access to the Brazilians' research can help efforts to clean up and protect Midwest rivers.\n\"Their soils haven't been disturbed in the flood plain. They haven't had the application of fertilizer that we have had here. So we get the chance to see how the soils function in terms of taking up nutrients and cleaning the water,\" he said.\nMr. Sparks says being able to share information with the Brazilians is a big deal. That's because there are no large, undisturbed river systems in the U.S. to serve as a model. But even with the free flow of knowledge, scientists from both countries say there is only so much they can do to protect their respective rivers. But ultimately, any effort to protect or restore a river will take money,\" said Mario Dentes, of the Nature Conservancy's Chapter in Brazil. \"Who is going to pay the bills? The people who made the intervention in our highland? The government? Who? We don't know yet,\" he admitted."}

Dan Flack might have fouled him, but David Burton-Jones was standing right next to him.\n\"He was not a clear last man, but there's the inconsistency in the refereeing we've had this season.\n\"I go back to the game at Rugby Town where the keeper fouled Dan Jarvis, he was the last man and it's a yellow card.\n\"But to go down to 10 men and then respond with the work-rate shows that we've got so good this season in finding a way to win with different people in different ways.\n\"We worked really hard, kept our shape and got that bit between our teeth. We showed that we're capable of doing that which is good.\n\"It's a good three points and another good result against a side who are sixth in the table.\"\nThe match marked the final appearance of the season for Deeping play-maker Dan Schiavi who is returning to America.\nSchiavi, Jarvis, Johnson and Scott Mooney were all prominent in the early stages as Deeping laid siege to the Cogenhoe goal.\nJohnson saw a third minute effort from Luke Andersen's cross cleared off the line by Alex Lowery before Hunnings had to be alert at the other end to head away Curtis Avery's long throw from close to the Deeping goal.\nThe deadlock was broken after 13 minutes when Andersen and Johnson again combined with the full-back crossing for the Clarets marksman to glance his header past Baxter.\nJarvis then fired narrowly wide from a Johnson cross before timing his run to perfection to latch onto a through ball as the same combination again clicked only for Baxter to save at close range.\nThe visitors hauled themselves back into the game after 27 minutes through Slinn's equaliser as he latched"}

Great Britain had ruled Ireland for hundreds of years, but when the Republic of Ireland gained its independence from British rule, Northern Ireland remained part of the UK.\nWhen this happened, the population of Northern Ireland was essentially divided into two groups: Unionists (or loyalists) who were happy to remain part of the UK and Nationalists who wanted Northern Ireland to be independent and join the Republic of Ireland. Unionists were mostly Protestant and Nationalists were mostly Catholic. There were fewer Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland.\nCatholics found it difficult to procure jobs and homes and began protesting. The Unionist community held their own protests in response.\nDuring the 1960s, the tension between the two sides turned violent, resulting in a period known as the Troubles. In order to deal with the conflict, British troops were sent to the area, but they came into conflict with Republican armed groups, the largest of which was the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\nThe IRA carried out deadly bombings in Britain and Northern Ireland. Armed Loyalists also carried out violence.\nAfter years of fighting, the 1990s saw a change in the region, as the IRA announced it would cease violence.\nIn 1998, after nearly two years of talks and 30 years of conflict, the Good Friday agreement was signed. This resulted in a new government being formed that would see power being shared between Unionists and Nationalists.\nA copy of the agreement was posted to every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for people to read, before a referendum was held when they could vote on it.\nIn May 1998, adults in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted in favor of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December of that year.\nBut this didn\u2019t completely bring an end to Northern Ireland\u2019s problems. There were allegations of spying and some of the political parties said they couldn\u2019t work with each other. Some people opposed to this peace process also continued to be violent.\nIn 2002, the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended and its decision-making duties were returned to the UK government. Five years later, the Assembly was given back power and in 2007, the British army officially ended its operations in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, in January 2017, the deal between the main parties in Northern Ireland collapsed and it has yet to be restored.\nThe region\u2019s political parties still disagree and are locked in a stand-off with each other. Many people hope that a peaceful, power-sharing arrangement can be reached again soon.

(Well, except for Australians it seems. In Peru, I met dozens of Australians who had somehow managed to make long-term travel a reality.) If travel is a priority for you, though, it is possible to work it into your budget. I did it through a combination of targeted saving and conscious spending.\nFirst up, using an online high-yield savings account, I\u2019ve split my money into several different subaccounts, each of which I\u2019ve named for a specific savings goal. My bank lets me name my accounts and subaccounts, so I give them titles to indicate their purpose.\nI\u2019ve designated one of these accounts specifically for travel to faraway places.

It\u2019s not possible for me to do all of these things while still pursuing my passion for travel.\nSo, I made some conscious decisions. Over the past couple of years, I\u2019ve given up cable television, opted to buy most of my clothes at thrift stores, and done what I can to walk or bike instead of drive. I eat out less often and I steer clear of comic book shops.\nBy doing these things, I\u2019ve been able to find enough cash to stash away for trips to Europe, Africa, and South America.

Do you, for example, do nice things for others but make it hard for people to do nice things for you?\nIt also matters why you\u2019re so resistant \u2014 whether it\u2019s the appearance of a gift grab, or the fustiness of traditions, or an introvert\u2019s preference for quiet, or the volatility of certain friends or relatives in the same room. A party can take on about as many forms as you can imagine, so there\u2019s room to work with your friends if you want to. And to have a really nice time with people who care about you.\nI answered a question last year from another bride under pressure to agree to a wedding shower, if you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s in two parts: This is the original advice, and this is the thought process behind the advice as explained to someone who thought it was terrible.\nThese families left the Bay Area\u2019s high housing costs and terrible traffic behind \u2013 with mixed results.\nTheir motivation could be well-intentioned: \u201cWe love our friend and want to celebrate her happiness, plus we love planning a good party.\u201d If that\u2019s the motivation, then I would try to work with them to plan something you will enjoy \u2014 a lunch, no gifts? happy hour at your favorite bar? etc. \u2014 where they can express their love for you, and which you will enjoy as well.\nI didn\u2019t want a shower. My friends and mom persuaded me to have one anyway. It was not fancy. We wore jeans, drank beer and made a scrapbook about my pre-wedding life.\nIt was great. It is a wonderful memory \u2014 and years later, the scrapbook is priceless. Think about letting people celebrate you, in a way that you\u2019re comfortable with.\nYou do need to be able to trust party-throwers to honor any downscale/offbeat wishes, which I suppose can be no small obstacle, but with that trust there are a lot of great possibilities.\nAnd the scrapbook idea is ingenious. You get access to artifacts that you might not even know about otherwise, plus it serves as a party activity to get people mixing.\nWant to see more Carolyn Hax? Follow us on Flipboard."}

Contributing Editor Alan Joch served as moderator.\nDanette Campbell from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Johari Rashad from the Environmental Protection Agency, and Marge Higgins from the General Services Administration shared their experiences.\nQuestion: Although there\u2019s been a governmentwide telework push for a number of years, OPM\u2019s latest report to Congress released last fall showed mixed results \u2014 and some steep declines \u2014 when it comes to greater adoption rates across the government. What\u2019s holding telework back?\nRashad: From my perspective, managers who don't know how to or who are afraid of managing virtual employees are the biggest obstacles to telework.\nCampbell: There could be one or several reasons why an agency has not moved forward with a substantive telework initiative. An agency may be experiencing some resistance from managers who are not completely comfortable with the idea of managing remote workers. In addition, the agency could be struggling with determining eligibility, developing a strong telework policy, determining a business model for their telework program, and providing training for teleworkers and managers.\nAnother issue agencies may be experiencing might involve performance measures that are not clearly defined. It is critical that agencies have clearly defined performance measures in place before a telework initiative is developed.\nQuestion: In terms of your own agencies, what have been the biggest cultural challenges you\u2019ve had to address with telework?\nCampbell: When we started in 1997, telework was not as mainstream an idea as it is now. As a result, the office met two major challenges: getting buy-in from management, midlevel managers and its customers, and solving technology and connectivity issues.\nRashad: The largest cultural issues in telework in EPA in my experience are lack of management support for telework; concern that teleworking employees aren't working when they're at their alternate work location; and concern about managing virtual employees.\nHiggins: GSA's experience in implementing telework has mirrored other agencies' in many ways. Although we have a long history of using the tool to accomplish the work of the agency, there have been a variety of employee and manager responses to the use of telework. In 2007, GSA's administrator announced a \"Telework Challenge,\" aimed at increasing participation across the agency and making GSA a model for other agencies. That challenge established specific participation goals over a three-year period and was followed up by a number of important actions. First, top-level support for telework participation was clear in the issuance of the challenge. That support was further demonstrated by inclusion of telework in the performance plans of agency leaders and by the establishment of a \"Telework Champion,\" who worked with individual leaders on telework issues.\nThe agency then undertook the first across-the-board eligibility review, based on criteria established"}
{"idx": "25199", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When you watch film on Laquon Treadwell, one of the first things that will jump out to you is the way he can create separation against defenders. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the corner lined up against him is in press coverage or zone, Treadwell will find a way to get open. The first thing that jumps out at me is how he dips his shoulder when he takes off on his route. Many times, I have seen him dip his shoulders on a corner, and gain at least two to three yards of separation. He does an excellent job of selling a pass play when the offense is actually running the ball. He will take off like he is running a post route, the corner bites, and he effectively takes one defender out of the play. He is also excellent at getting open and finding holes in zone coverage for his QB to float the ball into.\nSo he can get open, big deal. Can he catch the ball? In the games I watched him play in, I saw him drop the ball twice. Most of the time, Treadwell is a very reliable receiver who catches the ball with his hands. He seems to also have very strong wrists as he will win a contested ball the majority of the time. He does a great job of adjusting to the ball and has made some very acrobatic catches in his college career. The QB play was not the best this season, and so the ball placement wasn\u2019t the best either. Treadwell didn\u2019t miss a beat as he was able to adjust in the air and make the grab.\nSo, now that he has the ball in his hands, can he do anything with it? Absolutely. Treadwell does an excellent job of running with the ball after the catch. He is a very physical receiver who doesn\u2019t mind lowering his shoulder for a few extra yards. He can be a slippery receiver who can make you miss in the open field. His physicality comes into play in the run blocking game. I have never seen such a physical blocking receiver. He does an excellent job of driving his legs, staying aggressive, and knocking a defender out of the play. Treadwell knocks one defender out of the play and moves on to the next defender in line.\nThere wasn\u2019t much I didn\u2019t like about Treadwell\u2019s game, but there were two things that were worth noting. When he run blocks, or faces off against corners on his routes, he can get too careless and become too aggressive. Many times, I have seen flags thrown against him for unnecessary roughness or grabbing too much jersey. Second, I worry about whether his route tree is developed enough. For the first two years at Ole Miss, his primary routes were screen plays and post plays. This year, I saw his route tree develop some as he ran slants, hook routes, and a few in and out routes. He is no Amari Cooper when it comes to route running. From what I could tell, he is a an adequate route runner who seems to be a little tight in the hips, but I feel that is something he can work on and fix once he gets to the pros.\nI love Treadwell\u2019s potential. I strongly feel he will be a high first round pick. He has made an incredible bounce back from his horrendous injury last season and has put up some great stats and play on film this year. There are a lot of teams this season who are going to be looking for a future number one receiver, and I feel Treadwell can be that guy. He is an all-around receiver with the size, speed, catching ability, and the ability to make something happen after he gets the ball in his hands. I cannot wait to see what he"}

But how many wide receivers have a greater influence on their teams' fortunes?\nThe Redskins went 9-1 with Garcon in the lineup, as opposed to 1-5 when he was sidelined by a foot injury. The only loss was to the Atlanta Falcons in a game when Garcon clearly was playing on one foot, and the Redskins held a lead before Robert Griffin III exited with a concussion.\nGarcon never has been reliable or well-rounded enough to join the ranks of the NFL's legitimate No. 1 receivers, but his playmaking ability is undeniable. There aren't more than 20 players in the league capable of consistently stretching defenses, beating double teams and making plays after the catch.\nWith Garcon in the lineup, role players such as Josh Morgan (blocking specialist), Aldrick Robinson (situational deep threat), Santana Moss (slot receiver) and Leonard Hankerson (professional enigma) can concentrate on what they do best. When Garcon is out of the lineup, that group inevitably is stretched beyond its means, leaving the Redskins' passing game with no semblance of playmaking ability."}
{"idx": "25201", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Off-road trucks are all the rage this year. Every truck manufacturer is offering at least one special edition designed to give you real \u201cBaja ready\u201d capabilities, including impressive engine power and special off-road suspension. But if you look under the surface, you\u2019ll see that many of these are just a light shock upgrade and a skid plate. If you leave out the appearance packages, the list of serious contenders is a lot shorter. Now Chevrolet has added its entry with the 2017 Colorado ZR2, and this is a truck to be reckoned with.\nThe ZR2 package is new for 2017, and offers some substantial suspension and driveline differences from any other Colorado, including the Colorado Z71 4WD package. The ZR2 is about 3.5 inches wider in both front and rear track, thanks to strengthened front control arms and a special rear axle. Where the stock front control arms are made from stamped steel, the ZR2 uses heavy-duty cast iron units, and special ZR2 heavy-duty steering knuckles. Springs have been upgraded all around, giving the ZR2 an extra two inches of ride height over the standard Colorado. Multimatic DSSV shocks on all corners complete the suspension package.\nAlso new on the ZR2 are the driver-selectable electronic locking differentials in front and rear. By comparison, the Z71 offers an automatic locking rear differential only.\nThe ZR2 package costs about $5,845 more than the Z71, starting at $42,620 for the V6 Crew Cab and $46,120 for the Duramax turbo-diesel Crew Cab. Or choose the extended cab at $40,995 for the V6 and $44,495 for the diesel. For that money, you get a top-trim Colorado with the suspension described above, the electronic driver-selectable differentials, and a towing package with an integral trailer brake controller on the dash.\nWhere the stock front control arms are made from stamped steel, the ZR2 uses heavy-duty cast iron units, and special ZR2 heavy duty steering knuckles.\nThe ZR2 comes with great-looking 17\u00d78-inch wheels and 31-inch Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac off-road tires. The wheel design is unique to ZR2 and looks great. Optionally, you can get a bed-mount for the spare, which is a great idea if you\u2019re going to do serious off-roading. It\u2019s easier to get to, and offers less chance for the spare to be damaged when you\u2019re off-road.\nThe Multimatic shocks deserve some explanation, too. These units are critical to the appeal of the ZR2. Multimatic makes shocks for Formula One as well as various other racing and off-road applications, and their DSSV (Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve) design is serious equipment for the ZR2 both on and off pavement. The shocks provide extra suspension travel and compression tolerance for jumping and rock crawling, and at the same time, they provide enough finesse to make the ZR2 one of the best-riding trucks on the market.\nOn the outside, the ZR2 gives you a full visual package. You won\u2019t fail to notice the extra ride height, the standard spray-in bedliner, the aggressive hood and grille design, and the thick aluminum skid plates.

{"idx": "25205", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A team of 30 skilled volunteers working over six months has developed an independent model of whether it`s feasible for the city of Boulder to form a municipal utility and reduce its carbon emissions for a cost that`s similar to what customers now pay Xcel Energy.\nThe answer is yes, say the volunteers, who will present their findings at a public meeting Wednesday night.\n\"We can cut our current emissions by 50 percent and be comparable to Xcel and be more stable (in terms of rates) over time,\" said Sam Weaver, co-founder of a power conversion equipment company and one of the volunteer modelers.\nThe city of Boulder has also hired its own consultants to create a feasibility model that is separate from the volunteer effort.\nThe group used a modeling tool known as HOMER, developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, as the backbone of the technical model. HOMER was designed to help users figure out how much alternative energy -- including wind and solar -- can be reliably integrated into an energy system.\nThe group also created a financial model under the leadership of Frank Selto, a professor at the University of Colorado`s Leeds School of Business.\nAs a base case, the modelers assumed that the only renewable energy used in a future Boulder municipal utility would be the renewable energy generation that already exists locally, which includes mostly rooftop solar arrays and a little hydropower. The modelers also assumed that the rest of Boulder`s energy demand would be met by burning natural gas.\nThe result was that Boulder could reduce its emissions by 50 percent -- since burning natural gas releases less carbon than burning coal -- for a slightly lower rate than Xcel`s. For example, a residential customer who uses 520 kilowatt-hours a month would pay $61.07 under Xcel`s rates but $58.27 to a Boulder municipal utility. The model assumes that Boulder would spend $300 million in startup costs.\nThe modelers also ran a worst-case scenario that assumed startup costs would double to $600 million. The result was that the same residential customer would pay $68.80 a month.\nThe city of Boulder`s own models assume that startup costs would be slightly less than $300 million. But Xcel says the city is leaving out as much as $336 million in \"stranded costs\" from its analysis.\nThe volunteer modelers also ran a scenario with a mix of renewable energy that -- coupled with the natural gas -- would decrease carbon emissions by 68 percent. In that scenario, a residential customer who uses 520 kilowatt-hours in a month would pay a bill of $65.29, or about $4 a month more than what that person would owe Xcel.\nIn general, the volunteers say that their model is built on a series of conservative assumptions, which include having more reserve capacity -- the amount of power that can be immediately tapped in an emergency -- than is required by federal regulation.\nThe model`s assumptions have also been endlessly challenged and vetted by the members of the group over the months, said volunteer Alison Burchell.\n\"The man-hours that have gone into this is phenomenal,\" she said.\nTom Asprey, who led the technical modeling, said as a resident of Boulder and as an advocate of renewable energy, he wants to feel as confident as possible that the model he helped create is robust.\n\"Putting something out there that is going to flop does not help anyone,\" said Asprey, an engineer who has been spending 40"}
{"idx": "25206", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If a burglar can\u2019t find your safe, he can't break into it.\nWhen adding a wall safe to your home, be smart. Obvious places, such as behind a picture on the wall in the library or master bedroom, might not be your best bet. Those are likely the first places a burglar will inspect. The best rule of thumb is that the harder the wall safe is to find and the longer it takes to get to, the better your chances of the burglar leaving without locating your valuables.\nWe all probably have a piece of furniture that we dread moving -- the heavy piano or the bookshelf that can't be budged without help. Hide a wall safe behind one of these weighty items and it will surely slow down a thief. Since many thieves work alone, it will be impossible for one person to move an object like this on his own. The drawback is that it is not immediately accessible to you, but if you seldom go into your safe it is an ideal location.\nSince wall safes are typically put in the adult's bedroom or a den, a thief is not likely to look in a child's room. A wall safe hidden behind a tall etagere of stuffed animals is a smart location. Place a safe behind a ballet poster with several pair of pointe shoes hanging from the walll above. Since a burglar has limited time to get in and out of your home, this is one of the last places he is likely to look before time runs out.\nInstall a wall safe that is contained inside an electrical outlet. If added to an obvious spot at eye level right inside the home, it is probably not ideal, but when placed behind a heavy couch or a fully-stocked wire kitchen rack, it's an inconvenient place for a thief to get to. The outlet wall safe looks like a typical outlet but contains a well inside the wall in which to place valuables. Access is gained with a key and installation is easy for a do-it-yourselfer.\nIf you choose to go with the safe-behind-a-picture option, look into a device that looks like a frame but can't be removed unless you have access to a remote control with a code. The picture frame has a safe well attached on the back that is inserted between the joists of the wall. Even if the thief knows it is a safe, it's useless to him without the code to the remote. The attraction of this type of safe is the ease in which you can retrieve items from it. If you are someone who goes into your safe often, you can't beat this for convenience.\nDavis, Jill. \"How to Hide a Wall Safe.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/hide-wall-safe-51993.html.

{"idx": "25215", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: To eliminate school property taxes requires nearly $13 Billion in replacement revenues.\nPeople throughout the 48th Senatorial District have repeatedly told me school property taxes are their biggest headache and they want their elimination to be a top priority of the General Assembly. This much needed and long overdue goal recently fell one vote short when the Senate attempted to amend the provisions of Senate Bill 76 into another bill.\nA big problem in advancing SB 76 are lingering concerns with its companion: the House rejected HB 76 (59 \u2013 138) because opponents said the numbers didn\u2019t work and it was flawed.\nIn response to these concerns, Senator Argall and I worked to correct the deficiencies of HB 76. We met with opponents to hear their concerns. We studied Independent Fiscal Office analyses and dissected pages of comments from the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue on the bill as originally drafted. Prior to the Senate vote, SB 76 was further refined to ensure it\u2019s technically correct and works. It is and it does.\nTo eliminate school property taxes requires nearly $13 Billion in replacement revenues. There are just four alternatives to raise the $13 Billion to eliminate school property taxes: Personal Income Tax (PIT), Earned Income Tax (EIT), Sales & Use Tax, and/or another (new) tax. Three of these four options are incorporated into SB 76: PIT, Sales, and EIT.\nTo eliminate school property taxes, SB 76 proposes a combination of changes in Sales and Personal Income Taxes. The Sales Tax would be broadened and expanded to 7 percent and the PIT would be increased from the current 3.07 percent to 4.95 percent. Locally, schools could raise additional funds through either a local PIT or EIT \u2013 after voter approval.\nI prefer Sales Taxes to replace school property taxes because I believe people have some control over paying consumption taxes, more people pay Sales Taxes than those paying property taxes, and the Sales Tax is paid with each purchase while property taxes are large bills.\nIncreasing the Sales Tax rate to 7 percent (8 percent in Pittsburgh and 9 percent in Philadelphia) and expanding the base (food items not on the WIC list, clothing over $50, and certain services) would raise about $6 Billion in replacement revenues. Raising the PIT from 3.07 percent to 4.95 percent would raise another $7 Billion in replacement revenues to eliminate school property taxes.\nTo calculate how proposed SB 76 changes would impact you, compare what you now pay in school property taxes to what you would pay under an expanded PIT and Sales Tax. For the latter, you would need to spend an additional $14,285.71 in newly taxable items for each $1,000 you now pay in school property taxes.\nLike any tax, shifting from one tax to another has different impacts on different taxpayers. SB 76 opponents focused on this. Unfortunately, they offered no alternatives, simply promising to \u201ccontinue to offer our expertise and assistance to develop a responsible approach to address concerns where it is most needed, using sustainable and proven strategies.\u201d Opposing SB 76 with no alternatives means you support the status quo.\nTotal elimination of school property taxes is hard \u2013 especially with just four options for equal revenues. It\u2019s why elimination has proven to be so elusive for so long.\nAct 511 was passed 50 years ago to reduce the burdens of school and municipal property taxes through a myriad of other taxes, including:"}

{"idx": "25218", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Fernando Gaxiola: \"The police department understood something very simple: You cannot move a child without parental consent.\"\nWhen Fernando Gaxiola got the call, his otherwise peaceful April morning went white-knuckle. It was a mother, frantic because her baby was being flown to Mexico by University Medical Center.\nThe mother was an undocumented immigrant. But \"Baby Mejia,\" born in Tucson, was an American citizen. Now the woman was seeing her newborn dispatched to a social agency in Sonora--without her consent, she said.\nTo UMC--potentially saddled with the costs of treating a baby's long-term health issues--this was a voluntary departure. But to criminal attorney Gaxiola, it was a simple kidnapping.\nBoth he and the mother were told by UMC that the baby was being transferred for medical reasons, which he calls nonsense. \"The only problem was that no other facility in Tucson would take the child, for economic reasons, not for medical reasons. So why did they insist on a magic combination of words that were clearly a lie?\"\nBut Jim Richardson, UMC's in-house counsel, scoffs at that notion. \"The mother was from Mexico--clearly, that's where she lived--and she was in agreement with sending the infant back, up until the last minute, and that's why the baby was taken to the airport.\"\nGaxiola calls it absurd to think a mother would want her child flown to Mexico and put in the hands of a social-service agency there. \"If she had given consent, why would she be calling me?\" he says. \"That mother told me she had no choice, that the child was going to be sent back to Mexico. She said, 'I don't know what I'm going to do in Mexico. I don't have any family or friends there.'\"\nAccording to Richardson, UMC returns about 50 patients each year to their home countries. Yet there seems to be no record of written consent from these patients--in what amounts to quiet, informal deportations. While he contends that problems are rare with such returns, anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.\nNor is UMC alone. Tucson Medical Center also returns patients to their home countries, but only upon the patient's request, says spokesman Mike Letson. It appears that the Carondelet Health Network--which includes St. Mary's and St. Joseph's hospitals in Tucson--repatriates patients as well, although an official initially denied the practice when first contacted by the Tucson Weekly.\nIn a subsequent interview, Bill Pike, Carondelet's public policy director, acknowledged that his network does have a limited repatriation program. \"It happens on occasion,\" he now says, while insisting that transfers occur only with a patient's consent. \"As part of our culture, we would never just force someone out.\"\nStill, the line between gentle persuasion and outright coercion at some hospitals can be exceedingly thin. Gaxiola recalls when a client asked to remain at UMC one more day before being returned to Mexico--a request he says the hospital initially denied.\nAnother patient was purportedly being driven against his will to Agua Prieta, Sonora, when Gaxiola received a phone call. \"The guy told me he didn't want to go,\" the attorney says. \"But they put him in an ambulance, and at the port of entry, the U.S. Border Patrol asked to speak to the guy in the back.

The Jets in 2015 had the NFL's third-most effective red-zone offense. This year, they entered Sunday ranked last in the league (17 touchdowns in 47 red-zone trips). The Jets on Sunday went 2 of 7 with scoring touchdowns in the red zone. Yes, wide receiver Eric Decker's season-ending shoulder injury -- after just three games -- greatly contributed to the Jets' drop-off this season. But even beyond Decker's return in 2017, the Jets must make other upgrades -- definitely at quarterback, probably at coordinator -- if they want to again have a successful red-zone offense.\n* Bigger role for Bilal Powell in 2017? Powell did some promising things down the stretch of this season, as Matt Forte dealt with a knee injury. On Sunday, Powell's first 16 carries covered 112 yards. Powell entered Sunday with 109 carries, compared to 218 for Forte. They'll both be back next season. You'd think the Jets would split carries more evenly in 2017. Powell finished Sunday with 22 carries for 122 yards. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry this season, compared to 3.7 for Forte. Powell deserves a substantial workload in 2017.\n* Darrelle Revis' farewell? Bowles made Revis a captain before perhaps his final game with the organization that drafted him. Revis, a future Hall of Fame cornerback, fell apart this season. He finally got his first interception of the season Sunday. The Jets aren't keeping him next year with a $15.3 million salary cap figure. Even if he takes a pay cut, he'd still count $8.3 million against the cap. If the Jets cut Revis, he'd count $6 million at most. Revis, who turns 32 in July, had quite a run with the Jets, even if he fizzled out at the end, like many players do.\n* Brandon Marshall finished with Jets? Marshall (hip/shoulder) was inactive Sunday, so he didn't even get to play what could be his final game with the Jets. If the Jets are going to rebuild next season, cutting Marshall could be a wise move. It would create $7.5 million in salary cap space, with no dead money attached. Marshall turns 33 in March, and this was the second-worst season of his career. He hadn't been this statistically unproductive (3.9 catches per game and 52.5 yards per game) since his rookie year, 2006.\n* Devin Smith still invisible. With Marshall out, would that mean more"}

And as is our tradition at IT Business Edge, we provide you with a roundup of fortune-telling by some of the leading voices in the industry.\nNaturally, our first outlook will focus on the cloud, as that is the dominant trend sweeping the industry at the moment and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. In general, it seems most of the big research houses think 2014 is the year the cloud transitions from \u201cnew technology\u201d to standard operating practice, which is probably a reflection of the fact that a large percentage of the enterprise industry is up and running with some form of cloud infrastructure and is now seeking ways to leverage the technology to the greatest advantage.\nForrester, for one, says SaaS is ready to become the de facto means of purchasing new enterprise applications like CRM, while the public cloud itself will become the new backbone for the burgeoning Internet of Things. At the same time, functions like security and automation will become more centralized even as the IT perimeter becomes more distributed and therefore difficult to ascertain. Fixes for these and other issues will continue apace, but they will reside more in the cloud as opposed to the traditional enterprise model.\nFor IDC, 2014 will be a boom year for cloud services, Big Data, mobile infrastructure and a host of other functions, pushing total IT spending up 5 percent to $2.1 trillion. Spending on services from Google, Amazon and other \u201c3rd platform technologies\u201d will account for nearly 90 percent of the total IT spending, with much of that coming from newly revitalized emerging markets. In particular, PaaS seems poised for significant growth as it moves from a generic footprint to data-optimized services. As well, expect to see new workload-specialized cloud-infrastructure services that will lead to increased differentiation between cloud providers.\nFor traditional IT vendors, both the cloud and mobility pose significant challenges within longstanding channel relationships as they alter the role that IT plays in the enterprise, according to Frost & Sullivan. Both Google and Amazon have made enterprise-class services a top priority, putting them in a position to play central roles in IT development and provisioning decisions in the coming year. But that doesn\u2019t mean they are likely to get a free ride: Top telecommunications providers like Telstra are ramping up their service capabilities as they push to bring unified communications across cloud, data center, contact center and internal enterprise infrastructure.\nIndeed, every dollar spent on the cloud results in two or three unspent dollars in traditional IT systems, says Barclays. So if cloud spending does top the $10 billion mark in 2014 as firms like IDC and 451 Research predict, top vendors like EMC and IBM, as well as leading integrators like Accenture, could be in for a very rough year. In the end, it comes down to simple economics: If the enterprise is willing to adopt the cloud as a means to lower its IT budget, then someone somewhere has to feel the pinch.\nIn short, it seems that current predictions for the cloud mirror last years\u2019: More reliance on the cloud, less on traditional infrastructure; greater diversity among service offerings; and increased flexibility in pursuit of scale-out architectures to meet the challenges of Big Data, mobility, social networking and other advancing services.\nFor the cloud, then, 2014 will be more of the same - much more."}

Charlie Baker's administration on Monday canceled its plan to send Massachusetts National Guard members and equipment to the southwestern U.S. border in light of the federal government's \"inhumane\" practice of separating undocumented children from their families, the governor's office said.\nBaker announced on June 1 that he would send a UH-72 Lakota helicopter and two military analysts to pilot the chopper to the southwestern border by the end of the month in support of President Donald Trump's mission to curb illegal border crossings and drug trafficking.\nBut in recent weeks the federal government's practice of separating undocumented children from their parents when detained at the border has drawn bipartisan scorn and ignited a donnybrook between the White House and Congress. Baker, a Republican who did not support Trump, registered his disapproval Monday.\n\"Governor Baker directed the National Guard not to send any assets or personnel to the Southwest border today because the federal government's current actions are resulting in the inhumane treatment of children,\" Baker Communications Director Lizzy Guyton said in a statement.\nBaker's office said Massachusetts has no personnel or assets participating in the border mission.\nThe flight crew had been expected to deploy by the end of June to work through September with the Arizona National Guard and the New Mexico National Guard, in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to provide air reconnaissance and track illegal activity along the border with Mexico.\nIn its daily email newsletter Monday, the White House said that the \"harshest family separation policy is that too many Americans have been permanently separated from loved ones because of crime spilling across our border\" and highlighted the need for more security along the border.\n\"Illegal immigration along our Southwest border surged 230 percent in April compared to last year, according to the Department of Homeland Security,\" the White House wrote. \"This statistic reveals the lack of an orderly and fair process to manage the escalating flow of illegal immigrants. That flawed system creates both a humanitarian and a national security crisis at our border.\"\nTrump in April ordered the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security to deploy National Guard troops to the southern border to assist federal border agents, indicating at the time that he would like to see 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops called up.\nBaker's announcement that he would send the Massachusetts National Guard to assist at the border came while Democrats were kicking off their party convention in Worcester earlier this month. Jay Gonzalez, the gubernatorial candidate endorsed by that convention, visited the press riser at the DCU Center to say he would not have complied with the Pentagon's request as Baker did.\n\"If Donald Trump's Pentagon made that type of request to me I would not comply with it,\" Gonzalez told reporters hours after the News Service first reported on the National Guard's plans. \"We need to stand up to what he's doing and we've got a governor right now who doesn't do it and on this issue he not only doesn't stand up to him he helps him.\"\nOn Sunday, Gonzalez circulated a petition to supporters calling on Baker to reconsider his decision and to instead withhold Massachusetts resources from the border mission.\n\"Governor Baker's commitment of Massachusetts National Guard personnel and equipment might have been before the horrific family break-up policy was in full-swing, but it's not too late for the Governor to do the right thing and withdraw support,\" Gonzalez wrote in the email to supporters"}

Her methods are confrontational, brutal, and difficult to take.\nIn response to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Jane Elliott came up with the controversial and shocking Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes exercise. This now-famous exercise labels participants as inferior or superior based solely on the colors of their eyes and exposes them to the experience of being a minority.\n\"On the day after Martin Luther King was killed, one of my students came into the room and said, 'They shot a king last night, Mrs. Elliott. Why'd they shoot that king?' I knew that night that it was time to deal with this in a concrete way, not just talking about it, because we had talked about racism since the first day of school.\nBut the shooting of Martin Luther King, who had been one of our heroes of the month in February, couldn't just be talked about and explained away,\" Elliott said in an interview for a Frontline documentary called A Class Divided. Elliot was also the subject of an earlier documentary called The Eye of the Storm.\n\"The next day, I introduced an eye color exercise in my classroom and split the class according to eye color. And I immediately created a microcosm of society in a third-grade classroom.\"\nFirst, Elliott got the students to agree to the exercise and judge people by the color of their eyes. She then said that, since she was blue-eyed, the blue-eyed people would be on top over the brown-eyed people, especially since the blue-eyed people were better and smarter than the brow-eyed people.\nThe rules for the day were set up as follows: the blue-eyed kids got an extra five minutes of recess while the brown-eyed children had to stay in; the brown-eyed students also weren't allowed to use the water fountains and had to use paper cups. The brown-eyed people weren't allowed to play with the blue-eyed people because they weren't as good. The brown-eyed people had to wear collars so their eye color could be identified from a distance.\nAt recess, two of her students got into a fight over being called \"brown-eyed\" because it meant that they were stupid.\n\"I watched what had been marvelous, cooperative, wonderful, thoughtful children turn into nasty, vicious, discriminating little third-graders in a space of fifteen minutes,\" Elliott said.\nThe next day, Elliott turned the tables and the brown-eyed children were the ones on top, saying that she had lied the day before. Once again, chaos ensued. Of course, this kind of lesson would never fly with parents today and is probably why Elliott travels the world teaching adults about racism.\n\"Eye color and skin color are caused by the same chemical: melanin. There's no logic in judging people by the amount of a chemical in their skin. Pigmentation should have nothing to do with how you treat another person but unfortunately, it does,\" Elliott said to Oprah.\nThis is the anti-racism experiment that transformed an Oprah Winfrey Show audience. You may not agree with Elliott's methods, but they are very effective in teaching people about what racism feels like.\nIn this video, British people are the subjects of Elliott's racism exercise.\nWhen Elliott teaches, it's a lesson you're not likely to ever forget."}

Labour councils want them, Conservative councils want them. Shelter supports them. Boris Johnson has pledged to \"work to deliver them,\" and his new London Plan and revised housing strategy both refer to promoting them. The desirability of using planning and housing policy to bring about \"mixed and balanced\" neighbourhoods is rarely disputed. But why, exactly, does everybody think they're such a good idea? And are they right?\nThe core conviction is that living in a \"mixed community\" is better for poor and disadvantaged people than living in a poor and disadvantaged one, and that tailoring policy accordingly interrupts patterns of social segregation. This belief informs the prioritising of ex-service personnel and people who have jobs for social housing allocation, the logic being that doing so dilutes prevailing cultures of dependency and antisocial conduct. It also provides a moral rationale for regeneration schemes that entail rebuilding social housing-dominated estates to introduce other tenure types that better-off people can afford or just knocking them down and starting again. The same thinking underpins the view that new housing developments should have a diversity of market and \"affordable\" homes within them.\nThere is substantial evidence that areas with more mixed social composition tend to be more popular, more satisfying to live in, and have better services than poorer areas. This provides a rationale for continued intervention in low income neighbourhoods on the grounds of social justice.\nTo date the evidence is limited that neighbourhood has a large effect on individual outcomes, over and above individual and household factors. Nor is there robust evidence that neighbourhood mix per se or changes to mix (over and above other neighbourhood characteristics) is influential.\nThere is limited evidence that the new resources that may come with higher income residents (e.g. shops) either materialise or are beneficial to people on low incomes.\nThere is a strong argument in favour of greater social equality but unless there is evidence that the characteristics of the neighbourhoods in which people live make their life chances worse, independently of what makes them poor in the first place, the case for forcing neighbourhood mixing is at best a distraction or, at worst, plain wrong.\nCheshire points to findings that low income people can benefit from living in low cost areas because the shops are cheaper, the amenities may be better tailored to their requirements and the local job market, notably its informal mechanisms, can work better for them.\nIf there had to be a crude choice between traditional urban and neighbourhood renewal and mixed communities policies to address the top quarter most deprived local authorities...or even the most deprived 10% or 5% of wards, the evidence suggests the former offer more limited but better-evidenced benefits at lower costs, and are also more achievable during a recession.\nIt seems there might be better ways to spend money helping poor neighbourhoods in London and other cities than moving people who are less poor into them or moving poor people closer to more affluent ones.\nThis doesn't destroy the case for doing so in the right way to some degree, or for ensuring that new housing developments contain homes that the least wealthy can afford. Neither does it justify arguments that the poor have no \"right\" to live in expensive parts of London.\nBut it does challenge that comfortable consensus about \"mixed communities\" being the best possible answer to urban social injustice and division.

Much of the increase was attributed to the settling of a labor dispute at ports on the West Coast, which allowed a backlog of shipments to be cleared away, but some experts warned that the chronic gap between imports and exports remained an open wound in a generally improving economy.\nThe flood of imports \u2014 which far outpaced American exports \u2014 is likely to push economic activity for the first quarter into the negative range when the government issues its revised estimate this month. Last week, the Commerce Department posted an initial estimate of 0.2 percent growth for January, February and March, a feeble showing that was attributed largely to bitterly cold weather.\nSeveral Wall Street economists played down the size of the March trade gap as an outlier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so far off the wall, it can\u2019t possibly happen again,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cExporters are struggling,\u201d he noted, but he maintained that the impact was marginal because the domestic economy was fundamentally strong.\nMr. Shepherdson said he expected growth to rebound in the spring and summer. As an example, he cited a survey of the service sector by the Institute for Supply Management released on Tuesday that showed \u201cthere has been an uptick in business activity because of the improved economic climate and prevailing stability in business conditions.\u201d The index for April hit 57.8, up from 56.5 in March.

But while the flow of goods into the United States is helping pull other nations ahead, it also weighs down the economy at home.\nCompared with other major currencies, the dollar has been gaining in value, making foreign goods cheaper for American consumers to buy, while raising the cost of goods produced by United States factories when they are sold abroad.\nMs. Swonk, like many Wall Street economists, still expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from their near-zero levels in September on the assumption that the economy is already picking up speed again.

{"idx": "25241", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Combining our understanding of the basic features of magnetism, specifically magnetic fields, magnetic force, and the storage of energy in magnetic fields, we can now focus on magnetism particular to the Sun.\nOne important aspect of magnetism on the Sun is magnetic reconnection, which can be better understood if we first examine what plasma is. Plasma is a state of matter occurring at high temperatures where electrons are not bound to the nucleus. As a result, ions and electrons are free to move about the material. The free movement of charges makes plasma highly conductive, thereby causing magnetic field lines to be \"frozen\" into the plasma.\nIn reconnection, fluid motions in plasma bring together two \"frozen\" and oppositely directed magnetic field lines. These field lines then reconnect into a lower energy state. As we found out in the Magnet Acrobatics activity, magnetic fields can store energy. Energy is stored in reconnection when the \"frozen\" field lines become distorted as a result of fluid motion. Reconnection reduces the amount of distortion, which in turn causes energy to be released. This can be illustrated in the following activity with rubber bands.\nReconnecting Rubber Bands - Since magnetic reconnection occurs in plasmas, which cannot be feasibly produced in a high school lab, we will have to be content with an activity using rubber bands to model magnetic reconnection. This activity requires two people.\nHave your partner stretch out the rubber band into a rectangle using the index finger and thumb of both hands as corners.\nUse a marker to draw four arrows on each side of the rubber band rectangle. The arrows should point in the direction of a closed path traced along the rubber band. The rubber band now represents magnetic field lines.\nChoose two opposing sides of the rectangle and pinch them together. This is simulating the distortion of magnetic fields that occurs before reconnection.\nHold the two opposing sides together with both binder clips.\nTake a pair of scissors and cut the two \"magnetic field lines\" between the binder clips. This is simulating reconnection of the field lines.\nNote that energy from the rubber bands is released, which also happens during magnetic reconnection.\nMagnetic reconnection is important to solar physicists since they think that it in part is the cause of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It is also thought to be a possible heat source for the corona, which is unexpectedly hotter than the surface layers below it.\nMagnetism is also responsible for the formation of sunspots. Sunspots are small areas on the Sun that appear dark because of their relative low temperature. This low temperature is thought to be caused by magnetic fields. The magnetic field inhibits convection, or the distribution of heat, resulting in a cool sunspot (Tayler 29).\nHere's a magnetic vector field animation (19 mb mpeg) showing the magnetic field around a sunspot group on March 29, 2010, observed by the HMI instrument. In this case, the blue color represents \"north\" polarity (outward), and the red represents \"south\" polarity (inward).\nFaculae (or photospheric faculae) are bright areas above the photosphere that appear near sunspots. Although they occur everywhere on the Sun, faculae can only be seen on the limb, or edge of the Sun. This is a result of limb darkening and the different temperatures of the faculae. Limb darkening occurs because only the shallow layers of the Sun that are cooler and less bright can be seen at the limb. Consequently, the limb"}

Peter introduces a unique style of education and imagination into his writing while splashing diversity and hip-hop into it as well. Peter has recently finished his latest children's book in his educational book series, and now is turning it into a cartoon series for young children to view everywhere. Dr. Isikwe's book series is full of imagination and creativity for early readers. He's had a chance to tour across the US, Nigeria and even London for his last book while working with educators, teachers, and librarians amongst the few. Peter turned in my mortar & pestle and white coat to pursue his passion for writing children's book. For those who do not what that is, pharmacist use it to make drug products.\n\"My diverse background and cultured upbringing even my love of hip hop gave way to my interesting obsession with literacy and education. The three have been instrumental in my life. Writing has always been a passion of mind. I enjoy writing books that provoke children's sense of curiosity. Turning the book series into a cartoon series will be very exciting. Reading can stimulate imagination and adding education to it makes that event of reading more memorable for the young reader,\" Peter says.\nLeading by example for the culture was paramount for Peter growing up. The book series also helps to provide a resource to educators and parents that can be used in literacy. Diversity and culture are what Peter wanted to introduce to children's literature. Dr. Isikwe plans on doing that in his writing, more importantly he plans on giving children a new outlook on reading. Jack's Awesome Adventure is a children's book that engages emerging readers to use their imagination as they join Jack on his awesome adventure. Peter stresses that we owe it to our youth to place an importance on reading early in life.\nPeter states, \"My whole experience is interesting, because most people where kind of shocked that I'm an author. Reading and education for me, was always seen in high praise. My next book in the Jack's Awesome Adventure series comes out later this year. Breaking down barriers of misconceptions of people that look like me is a blessing; being the face of a new movement in hip-hop that not only encourages diverse intellectuals but creates avenues of spreading positive message to the youth is what I am most proud of.\"\nTo learn more about Jack's Awesome Adventure and Dr. Peter Isikwe visit his website at www.jacksawesomeadventure.com.

Originally, the Red Sox were going to start Chris Sale. But at the end of his postgame press conference, manager Alex Cora casually dropped the news David Price will start Game 5 and Sale would be available for Game 6 if it is necessary. The Dodgers are going with ace Clayton Kershaw on Sunday night.\nTrailing 4-0 after the Dodgers scored four in the sixth inning off Eduardo Rodriguez, Matt Barnes struck out Austin Barnes to end the inning. Spurred on by Chris Sale\u2019s motivational skills in the dugout, the Red Sox shook off a lethargic buzz in the seventh when Mitch Moreland launched a three-run pinch-hit homer off Ryan Madson to make it a one-run game.\nKelly worked in and out of trouble in the seventh and eighth when he didn\u2019t allow a run and stranded three runners.\nMoreland\u2019s blast only tied the score but Pearce\u2019s solo homer in the eighth off Kenley Jansen put the Red Sox ahead, 5-4, and his three-run double in the ninth stretched the lead to 9-4. It was the second straight game Jansen, the Dodgers\u2019 closer, surrendered homers in the eighth inning that flushed a lead.\nWorking with a five-run pillow in the ninth, Kimbrel gave up a two-run homer to Kik\u00e9 Hernandez that accounted for the final score.\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts, who didn\u2019t have relievers Pedro Baez and Julio Urias, defended removing Hill in the seventh and bringing a struggling Madson into the game.\nMadson hasn\u2019t done that at all. All seven of the World Series runners the right-hander has inherited have scored.\nLike every other boss in any sport, Roberts didn\u2019t concede defeat despite the long odds of his club coming back from a 3-1 deficit.

March Madness, the annual college basketball tournament, manages to bring a much different set of discussions and expectations than virtually every other kind of sports. It's a cultural event well above and beyond the drama of the games themselves.\nBrackets\u2014and gambling\u2014are one of the big reasons why. There's some kind of geometric appeal in the perfectly-formed 64-team bracket of the NCAA tournaments, albeit one that's been partially ruined on the men's side with the ridiculous play-in games. Filling them out has become a cultural event, regardless of whether you even watch the games. And with the office or classroom pool, well, a little money on the side never hurt rooting interest. The whole concept of seeding also adds an instant rooting interest for anyone who prefers to cheer on the underdog; never mind that there's not much difference between a 5-seed and a 10-seed qualitatively, just having the number there feels like there should be. Seeding and brackets also engender a narrative of predictability or unpredictability. A quick glance at any game or set of results can tell if what happened was what supposed to happen. It's superb for lazy sportswriting or message-board discussion. Terms like Upset! Cinderella! Chalk! Bracket-buster! get tossed around to describe the supposed overall narrative, when in reality, on the court, what actually happens are a bunch of college kids scrambling to make the best of a desperate situation.\nTonight's men's championship was just about the perfect game for easily-applied stories before the tipoff.

UConn was a #3 seed, Butler a #8. It's a David versus Goliath scenario, hard work and fundamentals versus talent and big-program money.

Once the game started, a new story became clear: These teams were both stinking up the joint.

When nVidia promised up to 40% better performance we scoffed, but they\u2019ve delivered.\nIn terms of tests, we threw 3DMark 2003 and 2005 at it and returned scores of 14741 and 6667, respectively, which more than lives up to expectations and proves to us that no other card can come anywhere near the 7800 at the moment.\nWhen it come to the rest of the specification, the M170 uses mobile technology, an Intel Pentium M 770 processor, which runs at 2.13GHz, delivers peak performance in the confines of a mobile chassis. The addition of a gigabyte of high-speed DDR2 memory improves performance further. Although the XPS is one of only two laptops in the test to use a mid-level 5400rpm hard drive, its 100GB capacity compensates somewhat, with ample storage for running games from disk.\nEqually impressive is the usability and configuration of the XPS. While the keyboard is small - occupying just 287mm of the 394mm chassis width - the keys are well built and allow for a highly comfortable typing action. The mouse buttons and touchpad are equally well made.\nWhat can we say? Dell may have decided to stick to a familiar case but when it runs the best graphics card in a notebook currently available who cares - this is a fantastic gaming"}

But despite the inevitable emotional moments that warm hearts, the show has been a target for all manner of negative press in the past couple of years, and now it\u2019s gone from former contestants slamming the producers for inhumane treatment to something far more official. The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department is currently investigating the show for on-set drug use.\nRumors have swirled around any illicit substances that The Biggest Loser contestants might be taking in during the production, but it\u2019s all been hearsay. Recently, The Biggest Loser: Couples 2 (Season 7) hopeful Joelle Gwynn came out with some rather explosive allegations that she was given weight-loss drugs by an assistant of current host Bob Harper, and that her attempts to blow the whistle on it resulted in the show\u2019s doctor reportedly explaining why they would help and that taking them was voluntary. Apparently Gwynn\u2019s claim, and others, has raised enough eyebrows for the actual police to get involved.\nThe Malibu/Lost Hills Station is currently conducting the investigation dealing with the unsubstantiated claims that illegal and prescription drugs were handed out on The Biggest Loser\u2019s set, according to Deadline. At this point, it\u2019s too early for answers to come out, and I imagine it\u2019ll be a hard thing to prove without it happening on camera or right in front of an officer, but time will tell.\nAs you can imagine, no one involved with The Biggest Loser is giving any drug-administering rumors any credence. Bob Harper and other crew members recently denied Gwynn\u2019s claims were true, and production company EndemolShine North American released a statement today that says the show follows a zero-tolerance policy and that illegal substances are strictly prohibited. Exactly what they\u2019re expected to say.\nLast year, a former contestant came out and explained some of the horrific things they were made to go through, including being spied on and insulted when people were unable to get through the insanely rigorous exercise sessions. And it was only a few weeks ago when a pretty convincing study came out and \u201cproved\u201d why people gain back weight that they\u2019d lost on Biggest Loser, with an explanation centered on the body\u2019s metabolism being unable to adjust accordingly to the rapid weight loss needed to stay on the show. Now that Gwynn and others have come out and said they were given pills to help them drop the last few pounds, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if the show can move onto next season on NBC unscathed."}

Banks review loans as often as every quarter, Lambros Varnavides, the bank&apos;s head of credit to the shipping industry, said in London on January 12 and January 13.\nIt is hard to avoid a breach when asset values have fallen so significantly, said Varnavides, who is global head of shipping. Assuming rates and values do not rebound in the next several months, shippers in breach of covenants will likely have to renegotiate loans, he said.\nThe Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping costs for commodities, slumped 92 per cent last year, causing at least four shipowners to fail since October.\nDemand for raw materials plunged as Europe, Japan and the US entered their first simultaneous recessions since the Second World War.\nThe ratio of losses on RBS&apos;s shipping loans has averaged about 0.03 per cent in the last 15 years and that is not going to change much in the long run, Varnavides said.\nThe bank has lent $25 billion (Dh91.7bn) to shippers, of which $18bn has actually been used.\nAbout 60 per cent is financing oil and gas tankers.\n\"We remain confident in the quality of our portfolio and there is a benefit of loans being re-priced higher,\" the managing director said.\nAbout a third of closely held coal, ore and grain shippers may also be close to breaching loan covenants, Varnavides said. Most banks will be more interested in maintaining their relationship with shippers than seeking the highest possible interest rates when renegotiating loans, Varnavides said.\n\"In many ways, it is an old-fashioned business, it has old- fashioned virtues,\" Varnavides said.\nLoans to shipowners are being made at 200 to 300 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, compared with less than 100 points about 18 months ago, Varnavides said.\nA basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point and Libor is the rate banks say they charge each other for loans.\nRBS is the third-largest lender to owners based on how many shipping loans it holds directly.\nHSH Nordbank AG and DnB NOR ASA are the biggest, Varnavides said."}

A ferry ride west brings you to Vancouver Island, the largest island off the west coast of North America. Here, on an outcrop that stretches for 290 miles between its upper and lower shores, you can stroll the 19th century streets of the provincial capital Victoria (where Butchart Gardens offers a blooming haven of flora in a former limestone quarry), watch for whales in the ocean swells, or drive to Port Hardy, a small town that enjoys pristine isolation at the north tip.\nBack on the mainland, there are further attractions still. Whistler needs little introduction, an enclave where glorious conditions for skiing have made this former logging town one of the chicest names in winter sports \u2013 as well as a haven for outdoor adventure in the summer months. In fact, British Columbia is heaven for those who like the ground beneath their feet to be slanted and stony.\nIt would be easy, on hearing those hallowed names 'Banff', 'Lake Louise' and 'Whistler', to gather up in your mind an image of pristine pistes and blistering black runs \u2013 and adopt the idea that Canada's West is a cold-weather destination, a place for winter sports enthusiasts only.\nYet Canada's south-western corner is a location for all seasons.

Come in summer and you can enjoy the bucking, kicking thrills of the rodeo, not least the unmissable Calgary Stampede, which lights up July.

It might sound like V-Sync, but it's nothing like it as DFRC stops your GPU from cranking things up internally to render 100FPS, when you're only receiving as much as your monitor can put out, which is 60Hz, or 60FPS most of the time.\nDFRC will underclock your GPU once you hit 60FPS (or whatever frame rate you choose), allowing the card to not pull as much power from the wall. AMD_Chris says that \"the power savings were mind blowing\" and we would agree, if your card is rendering 120FPS+ in a more basic game and you've got DFRC set to 60FPS, the power savings would be fairly large. We can't wait to test this new feature, that's for sure - what about you?"}

The driver of the van is in custody. One person died at the scene. Ten others were injured in this attack. And this appeared to be aimed at the city's Muslim community. It happened outside a mosque where people were observing the holy month of Ramadan.\nOmer El-Hamdoon is president of the Muslim Association of Britain, and he joins us now. Thanks so much for making time to talk with us on a difficult morning.\nOMER EL-HAMDOON: Thank you very much for hosting me.\nMARTIN: We should stress; police do not know the motivation behind this attack at this point. The driver has not yet been interviewed. But London, to say the least, is a very tense place right now. Could you give us a sense of the conversations you've been having over these last few hours with members of the Muslim community?\nEL-HAMDOON: Yeah. I mean generally the Muslim community is quite distressed about this incident because it is an incident which has attacked Muslims not only in the month of Ramadan but also as they're leaving the mosque after having offered prayers there. So they are feeling that - the sense of distress. There is a little bit of confusion as why this has happened. Although, we do know that Islamophobic attacks have increased in recent times, whether it's months or years. And obviously these increase whenever there's an incident happening there. So they are generally distressed about this.\nThere are obviously reports also coming out about, you know, why this happened or indeed what was recorded about the incident. So generally people are a little bit more alert. We are advising people to be a little bit more cautious but not to, you know, to stop their main day-to-day activities, which obviously is important as terrorists like to spread fear and prevent people from going about their daily lives.\nMARTIN: Let me ask you this. You put out a statement saying, we call on politicians to treat this major incident no less than a terrorist attack. Authorities are treating it that way, but why is that designation so important in this moment?\nEL-HAMDOON: It's important because we saw immediately after the attack that a lot of people on social media and Muslims were saying, you know, in a very sort of sarcastic way that this is not going to be treated as terror attack because the perpetrator is not a Muslim.\nAnd I think it's very important for the government and the officials to recognize that terrorism is not something that is just linked to Islam and Muslims. Terrorism comes in all different forms and sizes. It's different people. Different backgrounds can commit it. It's really a hate, evil ideology that can come from different backgrounds. And that's why it's important to see that.\nAnd it's not just that. Something that's coming - as we tend to hear, unfortunately, that all, you know, all terrorists are Muslims, and that is not the case because end of the day, this person committed an act of terror. He wanted to terrorize people."}

John Sheahan said Metro doesn\u2019t have dashboard cameras because most of an officer\u2019s interaction with the public takes place outside his or her vehicle and out of view of those fixed cameras.\nTo get the body-mounted cameras in use, however, Metro might have to first defend itself in court. The Las Vegas Police Protective Association is not backing down from its contention such cameras can\u2019t be forced upon officers without first negotiating with the union.\nChris Collins, union president, said the cameras represent a \u201cclear change in working conditions,\u201d as they add new requirements to an officer\u2019s daily routine, including downloading the camera\u2019s data. The cameras, he added, also could impact an officer\u2019s safety. Both factors, he said, mean it is \u201cmandatory\u201d for the department to include the cameras within the scope of its union contract.\nIf the department moves to buy the cameras without that contractual consideration, \u201cwe are going to take legal action,\u201d Collins added.\nSheriff Doug Gillespie could not be reached for comment. But when the Sun outlined a similar union argument in February, the sheriff replied that he didn\u2019t see body cameras as a contract matter. If the union\u2019s contention on the camera were true, Gillespie had reasoned, the department also would have to negotiate when putting lights on a police car and a shotgun inside it.\nGillespie had said he was committed to getting the body cameras, which are being used or tested at hundreds of departments throughout the country.

Pete Domenici was his boss as the top Republican on the committee. Murkowski took the position after Domenici retired in 2009 and kept Gladics and others on.\nDillon said Gladics started the pool because of his frustration with Forest Service wildfire management. The issue at the time that it began was the agency's decision to ground aging aircraft.\n\"Out of the frustration with that decision Frank started a pool on how many acres would burn each year. ... Gladics has been working for many, many years with the Forest Service to improve how they handle forest fires. Unfortunately that frustration boiled over to running this office pool,\" Dillon said.\nDillon said Gladics, who was a firefighter at one point himself, has apologized to the family of fallen Idaho firefighter Hamm for the pool.\nBut Hamm's mother, Lynnette, did not sound satisfied. She said Thursday that, given Gladics' background, \"the more he should be aware of how that would look.\"\n\"What do I think should happen to the staffers?

But the biggest losers were arguably Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his Democratic counterpart Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\nDemocrats who hear such messaging invariably roll their eyes without realizing that they are not its intended audience. Republicans made the same mistake in 2012 when Democrats seized on covertly recorded remarks from GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney which derided \"47 percent\" of Americans for supposedly being useless wards of the federal government.\nWhile the message is one the GOP has used since 2010, it's effective. Pelosi elicits strongly negative views from Republicans and lukewarm support from Democrats, giving her a less than 29 percent approval rating and 50 percent unfavorable rating as of last September. Attacking her was likely the key to GOP victory last year in Georgia, where insurgent candidate Jon Ossoff failed in his special election bid for the state's 6th congressional district.\n\u201cEvery morning I wake up and I take a moment to be thankful that the Republican Party still has Nancy Pelosi because Nancy Pelosi is absolutely toxic,\u201d Corry Bliss, executive director of a PAC controlled by Ryan, told The Washington Times in reference to the Georgia race.\nInstead of allowing the GOP to tie him to Pelosi, however, Lamb repeatedly declared that he did not support Pelosi and would not vote for her as the Democrats' House leader. He took the rhetoric an important step further, not just disowning a link to Pelosi but turning the question around to Paul Ryan. Repeatedly.\nIn a February debate, Lamb gave a much more adept response to the GOP tax cut than Pelosi, the legislative veteran, could come up with.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been for middle class tax cuts. What I\u2019m not happy about is that I think people\u2019s health insurance premiums are now going to go up and we\u2019ve added $1.5 trillion to the national debt,\" Lamb said when asked what he thought of the new tax law. \"We didn\u2019t need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working and middle class people. We now know that 85-90 percent of that $1.5 trillion went to the one percent, people who earn $700,000-$800,000 a year and to our largest corporations. I don\u2019t think that was right,\u201d Lamb said.\nDuring the debate, he also managed to turn Saccone's religiosity against him by pointing out how the Republican's claims to be caring for the \"helpless\" by opposing abortion sound insincere when coupled with his desire to cut federal spending.\nThis was an incredibly savvy move, for at least three reasons. The first is that for all the liberal anger that President Donald Trump constantly provokes, Ryan is also exceptionally unpopular. In a December poll commissioned by Politico, 36 percent of respondents said that an endorsement from Ryan would make them less likely to support a candidate.

But how you handle that uncertainty for customers is how you avoid fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\nHeart's in the right place, foot utterly in mouth. That's where some Microsoft folk must feel they ended up last week talking about changes to OneDrive in Windows 10 .\nMicrosoft's free cloud storage isn't just for Office files. You can use its rich set of features to share files, photos, and documents. Here are six tricks to help you get more out of OneDrive.\nMicrosoft's cloud storage service didn't start as just another place to store files in the cloud. It grew out of a powerful and sometimes complex sync system called Live Mesh that would copy files from one PC to another and let you log in remotely to collect files you'd left at home, long before Box and Dropbox were familiar names to everyone.\nBy Windows 8.1 it was neatly integrated into the OS; you can see in Explorer not just the files you chose to sync, but the whole structure of the files in the cloud - complete with thumbnails for images and metadata like when you created a file, even when you weren't online. That means you can look for a file in Explorer - by browsing through your folders or searching if you remember it in more detail. And if you're online you can open it by double-clicking as usual. You'll just have to wait for it to download. You can rename it without downloading too. You can send a cloud file as an email attachment or open it in Paint or compress it into a Zip file and generally - with some exceptions - treat it like any other file. If you haven't synced your files, OneDrive just acts like a slow local drive.\nIf you're offline, you can see that the file is there, and you can look at the properties, but you can't open it. So yes, you have to plan ahead before jumping on a plane, but wherever you store your files, if they're online and you're not, you can't use them.\nBut even when you're offline, you can use the folder structure you've created. You can create a new file and put it in the right folder straight away, and have it sync as soon as you got online again. So if you've made a set of folders to organise your different projects, you can add a file to the right place when you save it.\nThose advantage come with some disadvantages. Drive utilities like WinDirStat (a particular favourite of mine) get confused; instead of the actual disk space that the placeholder files were taking up, it shows your OneDrive folder as taking up as much space as all your cloud files, which doesn't make it easy to track down what's actually taking up too much space (the last time I looked, it was OneNote backups).\nSome applications like Lightroom and Windows Live PhotoGallery don't understand placeholder files and don't work well with them. Other applications like Paint and Paint.NET have no problems. While Explorer sees online files, the command prompt doesn't; so a DIR listing shows only the files you've synced. The Windows photo viewer tries to be extra helpful and if you're tapping your way through a set of online images, it not only downloads them ready for you to look at, it leaves them synced instead of cleaning up after itself.\nThose things are merely irritating; seeing placeholders in OneDrive is so useful that its fans are happy to put up with them. If Paint can manage placeholders, it's"}

(ambulances) do not typically utilize I-81 as there are few alternate off-ramps in the event of traffic accidents or back-ups. They purposely use the existing network of city streets to avoid unexpected delays that may compromise patient care.\"\nThat statement, from one of the city's biggest hospitals, is likely addressed at an argument made by Save81, a coalition of businesses and groups that oppose the grid. The group favors a new elevated highway or a tunnel through the city.\nThe Save81 group has argued that removing the raised viaduct would hamper emergency vehicles' ability to take patients clinging to life to hospitals for emergency medical treatment.\nThat's false, according to the state Department of Transportation. A community grid will not impede emergency responders movements through the city, the DOT says. In fact, DOT experts predict it would improve travel times for many emergency responders as well as most commuters.\nArguing against the community grid are suburban and rural ambulance squads whose spokespersons say a grid would slow their responses to area hospitals. A former Syracuse fire chief also favors an improved elevated highway over the grid, because he fears gridlock without an elevated highway.\nGroup pushing for new elevated highway predicts gridlocks. State says that's not true.\nThe St. Joseph's board letter said a rebuilt viaduct or a tunnel, which would have fewer connections to streets going east or west, would have a similar impact on emergency vehicles.\nA street grid and its east-west connections could remain largely intact above a tunnel, according to a private firm that studied the feasibility of a tunnel option. The tunnel is the most expensive of the three options to replace the highway.\nThe hospital board's endorsement is unique due to the hospital's location on the North Side.

{"idx": "25312", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I want to answer viewer questions again this week, because we're really beginning to have a vibrant, vigorous discussion about how to SAVE BIG. Recently on \"GMA Weekend\" and also on ABC News Now, I have reported that you can save thousands by hiring a medical billing advocate to find and fight hospital billing errors for you. Eighty percent of hospital bills contain errors, according to Medical Billing Advocates of America.\nQ: One of the biggest fallacies is on medical billing errors. Most insurances pay a flat rate for a hospitalization or procedure. The co-pay and deductible are based on that adjudicated rate -- not the total amount of the charges or bill. Therefore, if the charges for the procedure, hospital stay, etc., are $100,000, insurance contracted rate is $23,000, and the patient has a $5,000 deductible, the patient owes the $5,000. Finding an error of several thousand dollars is not going to make a difference.\nSo who's right? Me? Or Mark L.? Should Eileen bother hiring a medical billing advocate? Lucky for me, I'm the one writing the column, so I get to vote that I am in the right in this debate! Now let me back up my contention.\nMark's viewpoint -- that hospital billing errors don't matter because your insurance company negotiates a lower rate for the service and pays for it -- is short-sighted. Here's why: Millions of Americans, such as myself, have health insurance plans that charge \"coinsurance\" rather than a flat co-pay. Coinsurance means you are charged a percentage of your medical care. The most common cost-sharing arrangement is an 80/20 plan, where the insurance company pays 80 percent of your bill and you pay the other 20 percent.\nTwenty percent of a big bill for a major hospitalization is a lot of money. For example, a girlfriend of mine's husband had a heart attack and almost died. His hospital bill was $200,000. He was responsible for 20 percent of that, or $40,000. Ouch. So hiring an advocate to find and fight errors is in your interest if you have a coinsurance arrangement.\nIt's also worth it on another level. Insurance policies have maximum lifetime limits that they will pay out. Often, those lifetime limits are not as generous as they should be, and you may have no choice if you are insured through your employer and not given many options. Therefore, you want to keep your costs down as much as possible to stay away from that lifetime limit on coverage.\nAnd finally, even if you have a Cadillac plan that covers absolutely everything (lucky you, few of us do), it's just wrong to let hospitals sloppily -- or fraudulently -- overbill. They should be held accountable.\nThe great thing about medical billing advocates is that many of them work on contingency. You don't pay them a thing unless they negotiate a discount for you. That's how confident they are that they will, indeed, find errors. If they do find errors, typically you then pay them a commission of 15 to 35 percent of the savings found.\nHere are some resources to help you find a medical billing advocate."}

Here's why.\nI roll my eyes at the concept of the \"smart\" refrigerator. I don't need a 'fridge tweet to tell me I'm out of orange marmalade. Smart toaster oven? I scoff. And smart locks on the doors to your home seem like a particularly dumb idea \u2014 unless you crave the company of criminals.\nI understand why you might want a smart thermostat, such as Nest, however overpriced it may be. I can also see why someone might want a smart home video security system, especially if the property is a vacation rental or second home.\nBut a lot of smart home products feel gimmicky, such as robot vacuum cleaners, smart toaster ovens and refrigerators, and smart Crock-Pots. I'm sure they offer some utility, but do they really justify the money you'd spend to replace perfectly good \"dumb\" appliances? The benefits seem underwhelming.\nSo many smart home platforms exist today, from the likes of Apple, Google, and Samsung, along with a group of different standards, including Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee, that the whole thing is a bit much. What works with what?\n\"Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems.\"\n\"Surprisingly, there are few security apps available that can monitor Internet of Things devices, let you know about any new emerging attack vectors, and tell you about any recent compromises.\"\nAlrighty then. Let's move on to why I've eased up my smart-home resistance a tad.\nAmazon Echo has been a sleeper hit. It's a Bluetooth speaker with the built-in Alexa virtual assistant that is, in reality, a smart home Trojan horse.\nI bought an Echo in early 2015. I love how I can ask Alexa questions while cooking, play a specific song on request, or get news and weather updates. For these reasons alone, I recommend Echo. Alexa also gains new \"skills\" every week via software updates. Among them are a growing number of smart home skills.\nUsing the WeMo Switch, I can ask Alexa to \"turn on the lamp,\" and it magically turns on. It's not an enormous time or energy saver, but it is cool. And the WeMo Switch, unlike some smart home products, was a breeze to set up, it works over Wi-Fi, and it doesn't require a smart home hub to work.\nDespite my enthusiasm around Alexa, I'm still not ready to move deeper into the smart home scene just yet. Any related devices that I purchase need to have clear benefits \u2014 ones that are worth their potential security or privacy risks. Such devices need to augment what I've already purchased, rather than seek to replace something. I'm also curious to see how Google's upcoming Echo competitor, Google Home, pans out.

The current level of 8.65 million receiving Supplemental Security Income payments is more than 20 percent higher than a decade ago.\nThe disability rate, though, has been on the decline for most of the past three years, and that means more of those workers can re-enter the workforce.\n\"The opioid crisis is still costing lives and devastating communities, but its impact on the labor market is at least beginning to fade,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. \"The sharp fall in prescription rates last year suggests that the recent decline in disability \u2014 and the related rebound in labor force participation \u2014 has further to run.\"\nLabor force participation is a key job market statistic.

Gascon roots proved stronger in the end, however, and in 1985, Ariane launched D\u2019Artagnan, initially selling fresh, American-produced foie gras. Home-grown, Hudson Valley foie gras was all but un-heard of here and scandalous to French chefs, many of whom did not believe it could be done in America.\nShe proved everyone wrong, however, and today, Ariane\u2019s award-winning company, now celebrating its 25th anniversary, sells the finest foie gras, meat, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, sausages, smoked delicacies, organic game, and poultry to top restaurateurs and consumers all across the nation.\nIn early December, I caught up with Ariane, only days before her parents, Jocelyn and Andr\u00e9, and Alix, her daughter, were all jetting in to gather for the annual Gascon-style holiday family festivities.

I'm not a killer. I confessed under pressure.\" His sister Yasmin said, \"This is a country of racists. All they wanted to do was to close the file. My brother is innocent.\" On the other side of the room, Shaichat's homeroom high school teacher, Simha Gaspo, said, \"This is a day of great relief after everything that has happened since the murder. We are grateful that finally the real murderer will be sitting behind bars.\" Shaichat was killed by Anabtawi and Muhammad Khatib on July 21, 2003, while hitchhiking to his home in Upper Nazareth. The killers picked him up, strangled him and dumped his body in the trunk of their car. Later, they buried him, burned his clothes and possessions and stole his M-16 rifle. Khatib was shot to death on April 18, 2004, when he and another member of the terrorist group opened fire on a police vehicle at the Rimon junction, north of Kafr Kana, where Anabtawi and Khatib lived. Khatib's accomplice, Ala Mousa, was wounded and captured in the incident. The police also found an M-16 rifle that was traced back to Shaichat. The following day, Anabtawi was arrested. During his interrogation by the police and the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), Anabtawi confessed to having thrown firebombs on several occasions and to killing Shaichat. He later retracted his confession and claimed that Khatib had killed Shaichat. Anabtawi was indicted on August 14, 2004. According to the charge sheet, he and Khatib had conspired to kidnap a soldier, kill him and steal his rifle. They took Anabtawi's brother's car and bought a bicycle chain, which they later used to strangle Shaichat. After passing by one soldier hitchhiking at the Golani junction, they headed toward the Rimon junction, where they spotted Shaichat. Khatib moved to the back seat of the car and Shaichat sat beside the driver. On the way, Anabtawi turned off the main road. When Shaichat asked why, they told him they were going to pick up a friend along the way. Khatib even pretended to talk to the \"friend\" on his cellphone. At this point, Khatib wrapped the bicycle chain around Shaichat's neck and started to strangle him. Anabtawi stopped the car and began beating Shaichat while Khatib continued to strangle him until the soldier stopped moving. They placed the body in the trunk, drove a short way, and then Khatib fired one bullet from the M-16 into Shaichat's head. They then drove into Kafr Kana and bought a pick and a spade, dug a hole and buried Shaichat's body. They hid the rifle until April,"}

But I still want an expert to guide me on where to go and what to see.\nNearly every travel guide publisher, including Frommer's, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, Rough Guides, DK Eyewitness Guides, and even Rick Steves, publishes their content in eBook form. eBooks are great because once they're downloaded onto a device, you don't need the Internet to access the content.\nAnd many travel guides, like the Luxe City Guides, have excellent apps that combine the best of mobile technology\u2014with GPS, photos, and internet for hotel and restaurant booking\u2014while still providing expert advice.\nI don't think traditional travel content will be replaced by crowdsourcing websites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, either.\nWhile these sites are great in many ways, they're not authoritative enough to rely on alone. People often only write into TripAdvisor when they have an incredible experience or an absolutely awful experience\u2014there are few reviews in the middle. Just because one person has a bad experience at a hotel or restaurant doesn't mean that I'll have the same experience. And with all of those voices, how do you know which one to trust?\nHowever, crowdsourced sites work beautifully when compared with solid advice from a reliable travel expert. I use both sources, and find that I have a richer travel experience for it."}

{"idx": "25343", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Does Anyone Know Barack Obama?\nIf, as the saying goes, the perfect is the enemy of the good, then Barack Obama is his own worst enemy. That becomes clear in the upcoming HBO documentary \"By the People: The Election of Barack Obama,\" which is the product of many months of behind-the-scenes access to Obama during the presidential campaign. It reveals -- you will be surprised to learn -- that Barack Obama is pretty close to the most perfect person you will never get to know.\nThis is what he does not do in the course of the primary and general election campaigns: He does not lose his temper. He does not curse. He does not follow a pretty woman with his eyes or sneak a smoke. He does not dress sloppily. He is always calm and always good-natured and gets emotional only once -- the day his grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, the woman who in effect raised him, died in Hawaii. At a campaign event in North Carolina he expressed his love and gratitude. He cried and, watching, I did, too.\nI cried also at the very end of the documentary when African-Americans at one of the final campaign events cried at the imminence or the reality of his victory. But election night in this documentary is anti-climactic -- a contained, pallid fizz of emotion. Usually, a picture is worth a thousand words. These pictures, mainly of Obama's closest aides, have nothing to say. If these aides have a sense of history, they were keeping it to themselves.\nWhat's striking about this inside look at Obama is how being inside gets you nowhere. It is virtually the same as being outside. What's also striking about this movie is its lack of arc. Obama is always golden, always going to win and always does. His issue, if it can be called that, is himself. He is something new, something young, something biracial and something black, but he is not something from a political or ideological constituency. He is adored by his fans -- the directors, Amy Rice and Alicia Sams, included -- not for something he's done, but rather for something he is. So far, that has been a weakness in Obama's presidency.\nObama's lack of a bonded -- as opposed to an associative -- constituency is costing him. The political left is carping because it cannot be sure he is one of them. The right carps also but it alone knows that Obama is not one of them. He doesn't go way back with the unions -- he doesn't go way back with anything -- and the Jews are having second thoughts.\nIn a conventional movie, the hero has to change. Something has to happen -- the moment when character is revealed. Maybe he loses the girl and has to get her back. In politics, something similar is supposed to happen. You've got to have your PT 109, your Sunrise at Campobello, your walk on the beach with Billy Graham, your combat epiphany in Vietnam, your impoverished childhood, your peanut-farming family, your mission work abroad, your haberdashery that goes bankrupt.\nObama has those moments -- abandoned by his father, biracial in a world that prefers things neat, raised in Indonesia -- but they are not cited as life-changing events. None of them, at any rate, are given much importance in the documentary. Even the bitter primary fight with Hillary Clinton -- all that ugly stuff about race and Bill Clinton, of all people, being accused of playing the race card -- could have been happening to someone else. Obama observes his own life. He's not a participant."}

{"idx": "25345", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The boldest choice the production \u2014 directed by Rayna Smith and produced by Christina Lee \u2014 makes is in its casting: Antony is portrayed by a female, Kaya McRuer (\u201817). This choice speaks to gender inequity in Shakespearean plays and allows for a more feminized power dynamic between McRuer and Cleopatra (Melanie Arnold \u201816). McRuer acts with a great deal of masculine energy \u2013 in her heavy, forceful gait, her clenched jaw and her ferocious glare \u2013 and the juxtaposition between her gender identity and the language of the traditionally male Antony is fascinating.\nOf course, the play would be nothing without palpable chemistry between the leads, and, fortunately, McRuer and Arnold prove an electric pair. In their tender moments, they kiss with passion and cling to each other as if the whole world depended on their unity. In an instant, however, Cleopatra\u2019s highly jealous nature can turn the tides, and their fights are equally charged. Like McRuer, Arnold impressively immerses herself in her character \u2013 the complicated queen of Egypt, Cleopatra. Her voice can take on an edgy, caustic note when jealous, and is smooth as silk when affectionate toward Antony. Arnold\u2019s straight posture and powerful stage presence convey Cleopatra\u2019s confidence and allure, but the character\u2019s susceptibility to tremorous emotions reveals a splendid humanity within.\nAs for the production design, the set is simple enough to accommodate these two dimensions of the piece; different images and colors are projected onto white backgrounds, providing a visual manifestation of each mood. Red flashing lights, for example, accompany the play\u2019s vibrant battle scenes.\nAt the play\u2019s heart, beneath the debauchery and humor, is the evident deep-seated love between Antony and Cleopatra. They would rather die together than face the prospect of separation. At the play\u2019s end, Antony, having slid a sword into his side, holds off death long enough to make it to Cleopatra\u2019s arms. And, not long after her lover\u2019s death, she follows him into oblivion, along with her two trusty servants (Eva Borgwardt and Davis Leonard). Though this is a tragic ending, Cleopatra and Antony remain triumphant to the end. Arnold\u2019s face is downright elegant as her character dies upright \u2013 as if seated atop her throne.\nWith nuanced acting and an energetic cast, StanShakes ultimately does justice to the age-old story of Antony and Cleopatra. Though \u201cAntony & Cleopatra\u201d is a difficult play to execute for its large cast and sweeping script, the company does so with aplomb.\n\u201cAntony & Cleopatra\u201d will be playing February 24-27 in the Elliot Program Center.\nContact Madeline MacLeod at mmacleod@stanford.edu."}

Also, Barnes said there has been a significant \"cut back in the number\" of F-15 Eagle fighter jet operations by the Air National Guard's 104th Fighter Group that calls the airport home.\nOverall, Barnes said the airport saw 120,000 operations annually in the 1990s but now only handles about 42,000 flight operations annually.\n\"What has happened here is nothing new,\" Barnes said. \"It happened at Westover Air Reserve Base and Burlington, Vt..

With her term coming to an end in 2019, Mark Leonard of the European Council on foreign relations asked Mogherini about the state of European security, the future of the international order, arms control and migration, besides a broad range of other issues.\nSo far, the European Union has demonstrated an ability to maintain its unity over key issues like Brexit and the maintenance of the post-Crimea sanctions on Russia. Is this unity likely to hold in 2019, particularly given the looming EU parliamentary elections and changes at the top of the European Commission and Council?\nThe unity of our Union is much stronger than often perceived. What I see in my daily work is an EU that makes decisions jointly, implements them together and, especially in the field of foreign and security policy, acts as one. Many complain about the lack of unity. But my impression is that these complaints derive more from a comfortable clich\u00e9 that is repeated on the basis of past experiences, rather than from a realistic reflection on the situation today.\nObviously, we need to define what we mean by \u201cunity.\" It doesn\u2019t mean uniformity. We number 28\u2014soon 27, which is still a lot. With 500 million people, the EU is the largest integration project ever realised. The EU is the biggest market in the world, and the second-largest economy. It comprises many different cultures, languages and politics. History and geography have given us different backgrounds. It is only natural that this translates into different views, opinions, voices\u2014even within each of our democratic societies.\nI have always refused to use the expression \u201cthe European Union must sing with one voice\". We need to use all the different voices we have, because our plurality is our point of strength. But we need to sing the same song, in a coordinated manner, like a choir. And in my daily work, I see unity of purpose, common decisions, and coordinated action happening. I don\u2019t see this trend being challenged.\nOn the Brexit negotiations, the remaining 27 member states are more united than ever; and the decisions on sanctions with respect to Crimea have been taken, implemented, and renewed unanimously all these years. There are many other examples. Because we share the same interests as Europeans, I believe our citizens realize that\u2014beyond slogans\u2014the only effective way to achieve our objectives is to work together.\nYou have called for Europe to defend its sovereignty by, for example, creating new structures that would allow it to continue to adhere to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. Will these structures actually work, and could the special-purpose vehicle to maintain trade with Iran be used to counter other US sanctions?\nWe are working, as a union of 28 member states and with the rest of the international community, to preserve a nuclear agreement that has so far been implemented in full, as certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 13 consecutive reports. We do this because of our collective security: we do not want to see Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and the JCPOA is delivering precisely on that purpose. I start by saying this because I often hear that, on this issue, Europe is motivated mainly by economic or trade considerations. That is not the case: we do this to prevent a nuclear non-proliferation agreement that is working from being dismantled, and to prevent a major security crisis in the Middle East.\nPart of this work requires us"}

The bill would prohibit checkoff programs from engaging in anticompetitive activities or disparaging rival products or commodities.\nThe nation\u2019s 22 checkoff boards promote individual agricultural commodities such as lamb, peanuts, avocados, pork, potatoes and cotton, and are probably best known for creating promotional campaigns for beef (It\u2019s What\u2019s for Dinner), eggs (The Incredible Edible Egg) and dairy (Got Milk?). The USDA oversees checkoff programs and collects the mandatory fees from producers.\nEmails obtained through a FOIA request revealed that American Egg Board leaders and top executives in the egg industry had hoped to slow the growth of an egg-free mayonnaise competitor, Just Mayo, by working with a public relations agency and attempting to keep the product off of Whole Foods shelves. Board leaders had also discussed notifying the Food and Drug Administration about what they believed was Just Mayo\u2019s misleading name.\nThe USDA opened an investigation of the American Egg Board, which is ongoing, after the emails were released.\nAnother controversy erupted this May when House Republicans included language in the proposed 2017 House Agricultural Appropriations bill that would exempt checkoff programs from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The language was requested by checkoff programs and other commodity groups.\nThe bill would require checkoff programs to publish their budgets and would mandate the disclosure of all payments to outside contractors, as well as the purpose of those payments. Programs would be prohibited from contracting with organizations that lobby on agricultural policy and checkoff employees would be barred from participating in activities that constitute a conflict of interest. The bill would also require a routine audit of all checkoff programs every 5 years by USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General , which would be shared with Congress.\n\u201cThis bill will limit power these governmental boards have to inhibit food innovators through critical ad campaigns or by bolstering industry incumbents,\u201d Lee said in an email. \"For taxpayers this is a simple question of whether the government they are paying for is being fair and using their tax dollars appropriately.\"\nThe American Egg Board was contacted for comments on the bill but has yet to respond.

Violators could face misdemeanor charges, including up to a $5,000 fine or jail time.\nLocal business leaders have criticized the proposal, noting that weddings are a huge economic driver for the region by bringing in tourists.\nThe move is necessary, say county officials, after a growth in complaints from neighbors who cite trash, noise and traffic as the untold cost of weddings and concerts in residential areas.\n\u201cThe residents have a right to live with the reasonable expectation of peace and privacy,\u201d said Nate Beason, chairman of the Nevada County Board of Supervisors.\nCommunity development director Steve DeCamp said large-scale events that involve several hundred people pose a problem for many of the unincorporated parts that have windy and dead-end roads.\nAuthorities estimate that of the 58 wedding venues in the county, 14 are in residential neighborhoods.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office would evaluate and enforce the permits.

The ordinance has been months in the making, according to Beason.\nNevada County last year hosted 499 weddings, representing a market value of $15 million, according to The Wedding Report, a research company that tracks weddings.

The company has just made it easier to choose the best solution, as AMD\u2019s FreeSync webpage now sports the refresh rates of all the FreeSync monitors currently available on the market. This new section joins the model number, the screen size, the LCD type, the resolution, and the interface details already provided in one long, handy list.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with AMD\u2019s FreeSync setup, it consists of a FreeSync-compatible AMD graphics card, a FreeSync-enabled monitor made available by various manufacturers, and a FreeSync driver. In a normal setup, the refresh rate of the monitor (how many times the screen is rendered per second) is typically different than the output framerate of a PC game, even with VSync activated. This causes all that annoying stuttering and screen tearing. However, with FreeSync, the monitor matches the game\u2019s framerate, providing fluid visuals even if the framerate fluctuates.\nFreeSync also uses a technology called Low Framerate Compensation (LFC). This is made available through AMD\u2019s free Radeon Software Crimson Edition driver suite that promises smooth gaming down to 30 frames per second or less on AMD FreeSync displays. According to a chart provided by AMD, there\u2019s no VSync judder when using LFC, thus gamers will supposedly see smooth motion down to nearly 15 frames per second before the rate just gets too low and visual issues begin to plague gameplay.\nA good number of monitors listed on AMD\u2019s FreeSync page support LFC, such as Acer\u2019s 27-inch XG270HU, which sports 2,560 x 1,440 resolution, a TN panel, a refresh range of 40HZ to 144HZ, and a DisplayPort interface. Acer also has a larger 32-inch VA panel, the XZ321Q, that has 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, a range of 48HZ to 144HZ over the DisplayPort interface, and a range of 48Hz to 120Hz over an HDMI interface.\nWhat\u2019s great about this list is that AMD shows what types of panels these monitors use. As previously stated, Acer\u2019s XG270HU uses a TN panel, which is not only the oldest but is commonly used in displays and is good for gaming because it has a short response time. An IPS panel offers better viewing angles and better color reproduction, while a VA panel tries to offer the best of both TN and IPS panels. There\u2019s also the PLS panel that\u2019s supposedly better than IPS and costs less.\nThat said, the type of panel used in a monitor is important when hunting down a gaming solution, as well as for refresh rates. PLS technology is Samsung\u2019s baby, and you\u2019ll see that on AMD\u2019s list. The majority of monitors listed on AMD\u2019s site use either TN or IPS panels. There are a few VA panel variants like the A-HVA and the WVA+. Some of the Samsung solutions show TBA, meaning the company hasn\u2019t revealed the full specs on those units.\nAMD has certainly made it easier for customers to choose the right FreeSync monitor. Everything you really need to know is spelled out save for actual product links and pricing. The company also doesn\u2019t list which generation of protocols these monitors use: DisplayPort 1.2 or DisplayPort 1.3?"}

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, zoologists work everywhere from government agencies to research facilities to wildlife centers.\nThe median annual salary of zoologists as of May, 2010 was estimated at $57,430 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A zoologist needs a bachelor's degree with a master's degree preferred. Those with doctorates are more likely to work in research and government positions, which have a higher median pay. The median pay for research and environmental zoologists was $63,740 per year and for federal government zoologists, it was $71,110 per year.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual salary of the top 10 percent in the field as of May 2010 was $93,450 or more. This is nearly three times what the lowest 10 percent made at only $35,660. Taking the extra time to get an advanced degree pays off in additional job opportunities and higher pay. The majority of jobs with a pay rate of close to or just over six figures were located in the Pacific Northwest, with a few scattered in other areas of the country.\nOn the path to obtaining a doctorate degree in zoology, students will first obtain a bachelor\u2019s in biology or zoology. The student then has the opportunity to specialize in a specific area of zoology, such as embryology, genetics or environmental areas. Focusing on a specialty area can limit the opportunities, but also increase your overall pay, especially if you go into an area that is in high demand. According to Campus Explorer, opportunities for zoologists in the biotechnology and environmental fields are expected to expand in this decade.\nIn addition to becoming eligible for research-based zoology positions, a doctorate also opens opportunities for obtaining government grants. Zoologist Ph.D.s sometimes teach at universities where in addition to instructing students they carry out research and write for scientific journals.\nSoard, Lori. \"The Average Income of Zoologists With a Doctorate.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/average-income-zoologists-doctorate-2785.html.

It is designed to allow police to stop possible jihadists or IRA members planning bombings, as they enter Britain. It is a draconian piece of legislation: no \"probable cause\" or specific suspicion is needed. The purpose of the stop is a grave one: to assess whether someone may be involved in the \"commission, instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism\".\nMiranda wasn't a terrorist. The British authorities knew that perfectly well. He was the partner of a journalist. They suspected he was in fact carrying copies of Edward Snowden's NSA and GCHQ files, which Greenwald was engaged in researching and publishing. Their prime purpose, as they were later to admit, was simply to get hold of the files, and find out how much Greenwald knew.\nThe two police officers who rifled through Miranda's backpack and questioned him in a custody suite asked virtually nothing about terrorism. They didn't inquire if Miranda was a member of a terrorist group. Miranda says the questions he was asked \"seemed random and unfocused ... They gave me the impression that they were questioning me just to give themselves time to examine the material.\"\nDocuments obtained in the subsequent legal proceedings from MI5 explain this lack of curiosity.MI5 and the NSA decided several days earlier to have Miranda stopped at Heathrow and his documents seized.

But they seem to have been anxious not to let Miranda and his friends realise they had been betrayed.\nOn 15 August \u2013 three days before the stop \u2013 MI5 contacted the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, SO15. The agency requested detective superintendent James Stokley to have Miranda grabbed. The agency filled in what is known as a \"ports circulation sheet\" (PCS) with the official request. In a box that asked the author to confirm that possible terrorism was involved, MI5 wrote: \"Not applicable.\" Unfortunately, the police had only one power to search and seize passengers' baggage without the need to give any sort of a reason. This was schedule 7 of the act. The police pointed out the problem. MI5 redrafted the PCS form. Twice.\nIn its final version, MI5 claimed: \"Intelligence indicates that MIRANDA is likely to be involved in espionage activity which has the potential to act against the interests of UK national security ... We assess that MIRANDA is knowingly carrying material, the release of which would endanger people's lives. Additionally the disclosure, or threat of the disclosure, is designed to influence a government, and is made for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This therefore falls within the definition of terrorism and as such we request that the subject is examined under schedule 7.\"\nIt was an absurd account. It was written to mimic the wording of the language in the act defining \"terrorism\". But of course, the authors knew it was not Miranda's intention to make threats to endanger anyone's life, least of all to achieve some \"ideological objective\".\nThe definition in the act was supposedly aimed at a fanatic who threatened to blow up a plane."}

As is often the case in these Me Too incidents, the allegation against Trudeau comes from a supposed incident that took place quite a few years ago. However, when asked about it during an event on Sunday, Trudeau disputed the claims.\nThe Washington Post details that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced some difficult questions during an appearance in Regina where he was visiting steelworkers on Canada Day. A reporter asked the PM about allegations that came from a woman who attended a music festival in 2000 where Trudeau allegedly groped her.\nTrudeau says that he remembers the event in question and that he did not have any negative experiences that day. These are not brand-new allegations, as they were originally reported in 2000 in an unsigned editorial printed in a small paper called the Creston Valley Advance. The allegation is that Justin, who was a young teacher at the time, groped an Advance reporter while they were at the Kokanee Summit Festival.\nThe identity of the reporter who made the allegation has never been made public. The editorial printed at the time said that the reporter involved had felt \u201cblatantly disrespected\u201d by the encounter. She also said that Trudeau did apologize for what happened the next day, noting that he was sorry for \u201cinappropriately handling\u201d her.\nIn addition, former editor Brian Bell described the encounter as \u201cdefinitely not welcome and definitely inappropriate\u201d according to what he was told. Belle says that as far as he is concerned, there is no question that what the reporter said happened did indeed happen. However, Belle additionally said that the reporter did not seem distraught or traumatized by the situation at the time.\nWill this put the matter to rest, now that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has answered a question about the alleged 2000 incident? It looks like this is generating a fair amount of buzz on social media, and many will be interested to see if it prompts any additional allegations to emerge."}

Each cycle guide is a personalized book that guides the reader through a year in his or her life. So if you had a cycle guide, you wouldn\u2019t have had to wait to discover what will come your way in December.\nShe frowned and shook the bell harder.\nTo find out what December has in store for you, calculate your key number by adding the day and month of your birth. Continue adding until you arrive at a single digit. For example, if your birthday is October 14, your personal number is determined as follows: 10 + 14 = 24. Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the key number (6) that you will keep for life.\nThis December should be easier for you than it usually is because you\u2019re in a power month this year. Under the energy of this cycle month, you like to be in charge, so take on as much of the holiday organization as you can. Be careful, though, about being overwhelming; nobody enjoys being bossed around, even when the intention is to make everything super nice and cheery for family, friends or loved ones. Under the vibration of this cycle energy, you will reap the rewards of seeds planted several months ago, so if bonuses are part of your reality, you may find some nice surprises in that little envelope. If you are not in that world, the bonuses may be a little harder to identify, but they will be there.\nUnder the energy of this cycle month, you will likely feel the effect of the darkness. It is a time of transitions. And, aside from the end of the year, there will also be some personal endings or direction changes. The first part of the month will be wild and extremely sociable. Take good care of yourself in social situations. Be especially aware of what you say to others. Something that unexpectedly falls out of your mouth will come back to haunt you if you do not stop to think before you speak. Aside from all the celebrating, this is a time for ruthless re-evaluation of your life. Let go of what is not working for you; hanging on is futile.\nThis month, you have the energy to take on the holiday season with enthusiasm. Whereas others may flag and complain about the pressure of shopping and preparing, you have the energy to make things happen for those around you. This is a time of optimism and new beginnings, so make the most of it and tap in to the good vibrations that surround you. It is possible that you can go to the other extreme as well. As light as, your mood can be, the darkness may be just as tempting. However, under the influence of this cycle energy, you have a choice. Choose the jingle bell, and let Scrooge sleep.\nHolidays are always emotional, and this year, this extremely emotional time coincides with your extremely emotional cycle month. Be kind to yourself; try not to do things to please others if they are uncomfortable for you. Pay close attention to what you eat, but particularly to what you drink or ingest, as this is a time when you will likely be adversely affected by anything that is slightly toxic\u2014like too much sugar or chocolate. Work hard at staying healthy and your holiday season will be better for it.\nYou should be in the mood to welcome the holiday season under the influence of this cycle month. This cycle is, after all, a time to party, so it\u2019s perfect for you that you\u2019ve arrived under this influence during the holiday season.

I want to pay back her students' loan, and I want to put her in a mansion,\" Hosang explained.\nHis mother, Stacey-ann Ainsley, said she could not be more proud of her son. Ainsley, herself, is also an inspiration to her children, being that she is a single mother working as a craft vendor in Falmouth to raise her two sons, while also studying for a bachelor of Laws degree at the University of Technology.\n\"I know Hannif will go far. In fact, I would love for him to get a scholarship to further his education, and then, eventually move on to play for the Manchester United team, which has been his dream since he was five years old.

Sometimes, he walks down to the market and buys me a blouse or a pair of slippers, just to show his love,\" she said.\nHosang maintains his physical strength by sticking to a diet of mainly fruits and vegetables, along with wholesome drinks such as milk.

Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino\u2019s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.\nSince proposing several major changes to the sport\u2019s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA\u2019s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments \u2014 an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams \u2014 that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.\nThe listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA\u2019s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption \u2014 and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA \u2014 would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.\nEach of the meetings on Infantino\u2019s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer\u2019s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.\nInfantino\u2019s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.\nSome of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA\u2019s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.\nCeferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA\u2019s Champions League and add to the workload of players.\nInfantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.\nEuropean leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.\nThe vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.\nAt the last summit, in Moroc"}

Last week I had a special opportunity to visit that library and take a look at its automated book transportation system\u2014basically a roller coaster for books.\nThe Telelift conveyor system has been around since 1985, and it has a very unique history. The manufacturer, the West German Telelift GmbH, sold the main parts, the rails and the carts, to socialist Hungary in 1976. But because of CoCom regulations (export controls established by the Western bloc in the aftermatch of World War II) the library could not get them installed. The most important controlling parts were on the list of embargoed goods, and it was forbidden to sell them to the Eastern side of the iron curtain.\nThe CoCom evasion was a strategic issue for the countries under embargo. The Soviet technological and scientific intelligence created covert companies in Western or neutral countries, and then ordered the CoCom-listed products to these seemingly harmless addresses. It took nine years for the library to get all the missing parts through a Viennese company.\nThe Telelift system cost roughly one million dollars, and it was a painful process to assemble it, because the smuggled parts came without any identification note or manual. So the Hungarian electrical engineers and technicians had to put together the whole system with only the help of wiring diagrams on the back of the control panels and relays.\nThe coming decades were even harder: They had to maintain the whole system without any support from the manufacturer, which resulted in continuous alterations and improvised solutions for the emerging problems. However, the 30-year-old system is still up and running, and it\u2019s marvelous.\nThe whole system is completely analogue, there is nothing digital in it.\nThe steel rails are 3.7 miles long.\nThere are 40 stations, where books are being loaded and unloaded.\nThere are 45 control panels in the system.\nThere are 50 carts equipped with magnetic switches which guide them to the required station.\nThe carts serve 300-350 reader requests per day.\nOne ride takes approx 10-15 minutes from one of the the repositories to any reading room.\nThe carts are capable to carry circa 13-15 pounds of books.\nThe carts are driven by small BOSCh electro motors, the same motors one can find in the wind shield sweeper systems of 1994 Mercedes buses."}

The number of Allah worshippers is estimated to be anywhere from 800,000 to 1 million, so there are votes to be had by pandering against the general good.\nAs a young man, de Blasio traveled to Nicaraugua to help the Marxist Sandinistas, so that background is a hint about where he stands.\nSince 9/11, the top priority of policing has moved to prevention of terror rather than arresting the perps afterward. That means surveillance and infiltration, which are not the most comfortable ways to pursue public safety in a free society, but diverse immigration has admitted many unfriendlies into our communities and now spying is what we must do.\nOf course, the real solution is to end Muslim immigration and unwelcome the rest, since admitting potential enemies is bad public policy, period.

The worm contains its own Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail engine and harvests e-mail addresses from victims\u2019 computers, Schmugar said.\nUnlike earlier versions of Mimail, the new variant contains a message that tells recipients that their PayPal account will soon expire and that they need to re-enter their credit card information through \u201cour secure application,\u201d referring to the executable file attached to the e-mail message.\nWhen users click on the file attachment, the worm opens a window on their desktop that displays the PayPal logo and contains fields for entering their PayPal account password and credit card information, according to Chris Belthoff, senior security analyst as Sophos PLC.\nPayPal is owned by online auction giant eBay Inc. and is a frequent target of online scams.\nInformation that is entered into the fields is sent to four e-mail accounts belonging to Internet domains in the Czech Republic, Schmugar said. Typically, phisher scams use spam e-mail to drive unwitting Internet users to phony Web sites, where their information is captured, Belthoff said.\nIn July, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internet service provider EarthLink Inc. warned about a spike in such scams since the beginning of 2003.\nCoupling such scams with a self-spreading e-mail worm is a new twist and is probably designed to increase the number of potential victims exposed to the scam, Belthoff said.\nHowever, the new worm\u2019s similarity to earlier versions of e-mail, coupled with the suspicious attachment and loose spelling probably mean that Mimail-I will not create a large number of new identity theft victims, experts agreed.\nReports of the worm spreading were trailing off Friday, and experts do not expect it to continue spreading over the weekend.\nE-mail users who are worried about exposure to the new worm should update their antivirus definitions immediately and consult with their antivirus vendor for instructions on removing Mimail from infected machines, experts said."}

{"idx": "25426", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Security tools often create a certain amount of anxiety. What happens if I lose my password? Or if my antivirus deletes my stuff? The advent of two-factor authentication has created a new twist on a familiar anxiety: what happens if I can't use my second factor and get locked out of my account?\nJeremy from Capetown wrote in with a few concerns about 2FA. I've edited his letter for brevity.\nI am not too technical and want a two-factor authentication device that doesn't run into tricky complications when setting up or accessing like you encountered with the Yubikey. My biggest fear is locking myself out of my Gmail.\nIs it better to buy two keys, with one as a backup key?\nIn case you haven't heard of two-factor authentication, or 2FA, here's the gist: 2FA is a second action you take after you enter your password to verify your identity. The idea is that an attacker might have your password, but they won't have your security key, authenticator app, or SMS code. There's a whole theory and practice to 2FA that I won't get into here, but I do encourage you to read more and enable 2FA where you can.\nJeremy is in good company in his concern over 2FA. Many technically savvy and security conscious people I know continue to eschew two-factor protection because they're afraid getting locked out, and maybe losing access to their stuff forever. It's a real and valid concern.\nIn fact, I've been locked out of 2FA protected accounts before. More than once. Back in the day, one of the first companies to offer two-factor authentication was Blizzard. World of Warcraft players got access first, since they needed to protect their hard-earned loot. You may recall people walking around with WoW keychains that displayed changing digits on an LCD. Blizzard later refined the experience into a mobile app, and rolled out 2FA to all Battle.net users.\nBeing the paranoid person that I am, I enabled 2FA on my Blizzard account using the special Blizzard Authenticator app. I immediately forgot I had done this, and in the intervening months, deleted the app from my phone and forgot my password. Fortunately, Blizzard has excellent customer service. A few emails with their jovial staff had me back online in a few days. It was still nerve-wracking, though. I was so used to being able to handle my own password resets, and the idea of having to engage with an actual living human as part of that process felt, well, very odd.\nI've since gotten more used to the experience, and I've learned to be smarter about keeping my authenticator safe. I've still managed to get locked out of Battle.net repeatedly, as well as Steam and other services.\nDepending on how a company configures its 2FA offering, you might find yourself having to bend over backward to get control of your account back. As annoying as that sounds, it actually means that the service is working. You should have to jump through a lot of hoops if you don't have the authenticator. If it were easy for you, then it would be easy for a bad guy.\nFortunately, there's an easy way to prevent being locked out by 2FA: use multiple 2FA options. These can act as a backup in case you don't have access to a different 2FA option. For example, I use a YubiKey 5 NFC with my Google accounts, but"}

A trial judge agreed, throwing out Garretson\u2019s claim.\nBut Judge Michael Brown, writing for the unanimous court, said Garretson has raised genuine issues of whether the city\u2019s action \u201cmaterially impaired\u201d the right of access and, in doing so, diminished the value of his property. He said that entitled Garretson to take his case to court.\nThe issue surrounds about 36,000 square feet Garretson owns bounded by Jefferson, Madison and First streets. The property currently is used as a commercial parking lot.\nGarretson and the city did agree to provide the city a temporary construction easement on part of the property, with the value to be determined later.\nThe final project involved the city putting tracks on the south side of Jefferson Street, between the one-way traffic and the property. That also included construction of a concrete barrier on the south side of the tracks, permanently blocking the two driveways that had allowed access to Jefferson Street.\nWhen Garretson sought compensation, the city argued that it had used its authority to control access to roadways as part of its police power. That, they said, means there is no requirement to compensate Garretson for any damage to the property.\nAnyway, they said, because people still could get to the property from other streets, access had not been \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d in any way justifying compensation.\nThe trial judge, in tossing the case, accepted the latter theory.\nBrown said that is not the case.\n\u201cWhen the government eliminates a property owner\u2019s established access to an abutting street and the owner retains access from another street, the owner is not necessarily foreclosed from obtaining compensation for damages to the property under the Arizona Constitution,\u201d he wrote.\nBrown said although the facts of this case are unique, there is precedent for that conclusion.\nFor example, he cited a 1960 Arizona Supreme Court ruling involving a property along a state road where motorists going either direction had access.\nThat was replaced with a controlled-access highway. The property was still accessible but only by traveling about 1,500 feet on a frontage road.\nIn that case, Brown said, the high court said someone whose land is adjacent to a road has a property right to that ingress and egress.\nAnd eight years later, the Supreme Court said although property owners have no right to insist that traffic pass directly in front, that does not mean they cannot profit from that traffic flow.\nThat, then, goes to the issue of whether Garretson can prove he has been damaged.\nOne engineer hired by Garretson said the loss of Jefferson Street access impaired the potential to develop the property. That expert said it would decrease the potential for office space from 295,000 square feet to 125,000.\nAn appraiser said the property is in a \u201cstrategic location,\u201d being within walking distance of Chase Field, US Airways Center and Phoenix Civic Plaza. That report also noted the property was zoned for high-density mixed-used development.\nAll that, Brown wrote, entitles Brown to make his case to a jury that access to his property was materially impaired and seek damages.\nBrown said, however, the appellate court"}

Instead, the tribal leaders insisted on putting their objections in writing and continuing nonviolent protest to draw attention to their plight, with the aim of engaging the Iraqi Government in dialogue.\nAfter more than 12 months of peaceful protest in Anbar and other cities, the Government still refused to negotiate on key demands and rather harassed, arrested, attacked or even killed protesters. In December Iraqi security forces were sent to sack and dismantle the camp. Protest moved to armed resistance; the bombing of Fallujah followed, causing hundreds of civilian deaths, a new wave of refugees and widespread destruction.\nThe response to Maliki's aggressive sectarian rule was, inevitably, an aggressive sectarian response.\nISIS has been quick to exploit the divisions and piggyback on the Sunni uprising, extending its violence to northern Iraq. It is Iraq's Sunni tribes and militias \u2014 who hold little in common with ISIS and reject its extreme ideology \u2014 who could withhold the Islamists' march to Baghdad, should they have the motivation to do so.\nUnderstanding the context of today's turmoil is the key to any de-escalation of violence and a guide to the type of assistance foreign nations can bring.\nThose who have been watching Iraq the last 11 years have not been surprised by the past week's events. They point to disastrous 'divide and conquer' policy blunders by occupation forces in Iraq; the nature of the invasion and occupation itself; and support of the Maliki regime, despite its discriminatory policies, human rights violations, and violence against its own citizens, as the foundation for today's mess.\nRemoving Maliki, who did not receive the majority of seats in recent elections, could be the first step in a unification process that could ease tensions and quash the goals of ISIS insurgents. Foreign military intervention, by either Tehran or Washington, would draw in other regional players and escalate violence.\nThe attention on the deteriorating situation in Iraq and talk of possible Western intervention has provided a catalyst for renewed reflection about Australia's role in the 2003 invasion. It has also raised questions about Australia's decision-making process should the Abbott Government choose to intervene again.\nIt has prompted speeches in the Parliament this week by independent MP Andrew Wilkie calling for a royal commission into the Iraq War, and Greens MP Adam Bandt reintroducing a Greens 'war powers' bill requiring parliamentary approval to deploy Australian troops overseas.\nSuch calls have also been made by the Campaign for an Iraq War Inquiry (CIWI), of which I am a member, to ensure lessons are learnt from Australia's role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

It has 68 gates and is designed to cater for 45 million passengers a year, but has come under increasing criticism over defects in its construction that its main airline blames for flight delays, increased wear and tear on planes and which it claims pose a potential safety risk.\nAirAsia has been particularly vocal in its irritation at the issues affecting the terminal.\nTony Fernandes, the airline\u2019s group CEO and chairman of Queen's Park Rangers, took to Twitter to express his annoyance that Omar had to spend so much time at the airport dealing with the terminal\u2019s problems.\nsad that my ceo @aireenomar has to waste her time keep going to malaysia airports to sort something that should never have happened.\nAirAsia was initially reluctant to move when klia2 opened in May last year, but agreed when the Malaysian government said it would stop immigration and custom services at the old budget terminal.\nHe told Bloomberg: \u201cDo you have bumps in the airport, do you have works being done, do you have an aircraft wheel being bent?\nAirAsia was responsible for 87 per cent of klia2\u2019s passengers during its first year of operation, flying 15.2 million people through the terminal.\nThe Malaysian government\u2019s transport ministry has set up an independent audit committee to report on the terminal\u2019s issues, according to Bloomberg.

The giant trucks that carry copper ore each guzzle 819 gallons (3,100 liters) of fuel a day driving 7 miles (11 kilometers) to the surface with ever-poorer loads as ore grades decline and copper yields fall.\nChuquicamata produced 443,000 tons of copper last year, but experts say that by 2019 it will be unprofitable.\nSo state-owned mining company Codelco is trying to head off closure by taking the daring step of converting the open pit into the world&apos;s largest underground mine.\nCodelco believes the mine still has much more to give, with reserves equal to about 60 percent of all the copper exploited in the mine&apos;s history still buried deep beneath the crater. It has started digging more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) of tunnels underneath the pit in a $3.8 billion project to revive the mine.\n\"The technological challenges are enormous. We&apos;re talking about changing the biggest open pit copper mine in the world to the biggest underground mine in the world. This type of project is unique,\" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of CESCO, a Santiago-based mining think tank.\nEngineers are building four huge floors underneath the pit, in addition to the tunnels, to extract 340,000 tons of copper a year from beneath the ground. The trucks will be replaced by conveyer belts that will carry ore to the grinding machines and the smelter.\nAlvaro Aliaga, general manager of Chuquicamata&apos;s underground project, said the project will put Chile on \"the vanguard of global mining.\"\nAll over the world, the race for resources is forcing countries to spend more and drill deeper than they ever have before.

It's so hard to go through this and not be able to give these bears a good place to live,\" Churchill said. \"The community sees relocating bears as a kind of perfect solution, and unfortunately it's a really difficult proposition.\"\nColorado State Patrol Trooper Josh Lewis said two cars were involved in the accident, resulting in minor injuries to one of the drivers.\nThe first car to hit the bear was a 1992 Toyota Camry driven by Hugo Silva-Arellano, 31. Lewis said he was transported to Boulder Community Hospital with minor injuries, and his car was towed from the scene.\nThe second car was a 2002 Ford Focus driven by Kale Broeder, 22.\nReached by phone Thursday night, Broeder's father, Gary Broeder, said his son was fine but the car was totaled. He said his son was on his way to work in Louisville from his girlfriend's apartment in Longmont when the accident happened. As Kale Broeder told his dad, he was in a group of cars in the right lane of U.S. 36 when he saw a car in front of him put on its hazard lights and pull off to the right side of the road.\n\"He saw (the first car) move over to the right with flashers on, and he moved over to the left lane and that's when he hit the bear,\" Gary Broeder said. \"It was in the middle of the road.\"\nChurchill said officials were able to identify the bear by an ear tag placed on him after the brush with authorities at CU.\nThe problem with relocating the animals, she said, is that Colorado lacks a sufficient wilderness area to accommodate all of the bears that wander into heavily populated areas. And a relocated bear often views the area where it was captured as its home range and does its best to return, Churchill said.\n\"A couple years ago, there was a bear we moved ... from Table Mesa all the way to the Wyoming border, and he came back within a month,\" she said.\nChurchill said she hopes Boulder-area residents will keep Thursday's incident in mind when it comes to cleaning up trash and other items in their neighborhoods that attract bears.\n\"(With) Boulder in particular, once (a bear) hits town and they start getting to food sources in town, they become a town bear,\" she said. \"We need everybody to clean up every"}

Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (worth $83.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index), New York Times owner Carlos Slim (worth $61.1 billion), and Buffalo News owner Warren Buffett ($76.9 billion), publicly pleading poverty, are asking Congress for a helping hand in their negotiations with Google, controlled by Sergey Brin ($45.6 billion) and Larry Page ($46.8 billion).\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the Bezos-Slim-Buffett front man, David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, complained about what he called \"an economically squeezed news industry.\" The New York Times, in a column sympathetic to the effort, likened the news providers to \"serfs.\"\nMaybe Serf Bezos should have considered the economics of the news industry when he bought The Washington Post, or Serf Slim when he bought his stake in The New York Times. The idea that Congress needs to roll to the rescue to bail \"serfs\" like Messrs. Bezos, Buffett, and Slim out of bad investments just doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test.\nIn respect of the Times, it\u2019s particularly comical, because, as an editorial matter, the paper generally favors stricter antitrust enforcement. The newspaper that less than two years ago was editorializing that Congress \"should also study whether there are ways to strengthen the antitrust laws,\" now is backing the move for what its own columnist describes as \"an anticompetitive safe haven,\" \"a limited antitrust exemption.\"\nOne of Robert Bork\u2019s great scholarly insights was that if there\u2019s any logic to enforcing antitrust laws or enacting them in the first place at all, it is with a eye toward protecting consumers. The publishers make a case that news is a kind of special case because consumers are harmed by a decline in news quality. Or, as the Times quoted Mr. Chavern, \"If you want a free news model, you will get news . . . But it will be garbage news.\"\nI\u2019m a paying, seven-day-a-week print newspaper subscriber who earns a living as a journalist primarily on the basis of people\u2019s willingness to pay for news. So I sympathize on some level with what Mr. Chavern is saying. But even I can see that his argument is, to use his own term, \"garbage.\"\nSome excellent news \u2014 the CBS Evening News in its Walter Cronkite heyday, \"60 Minutes,\u201d \u2014 is and was \"free\" to consumers, who paid with their willingness to be subjected to commercials. In this past election, the prediction model of the expensive, paid New York Times was just as wrong as that of the free Huffington Post. Nate Silver had a better prediction over at ESPN\u2019s free website.\nEven if you buy the questionable idea that more expensive news automatically equals better news, it\u2019s a further, and even more tenuous, logical leap from that idea to the notion that Congress ought to interpose itself on one side of a set of business negotiations to make it easier for the publishers to make their news more expensive to consumers, or their ads more expensive to advertisers.\nThe Google-Facebook world has taken advertising and subscription"}
{"idx": "25444", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Those who dabble in learning a new language sometimes find that alcohol \u2014 in moderation \u2014 helps them speak more fluently. In a way, that makes sense: It\u2019s been shown that a beer or a glass of wine can lower inhibitions, which may make it easier for some people to overcome nervousness or hesitation.\nBut on the other hand, alcohol has also been shown to impair cognitive and motor functions, negatively affect memory and attention, and lead to overconfidence and inflated self-evaluations. So do people really speak non-native languages better after drinking, or is that just their liquid courage talking?\nTo answer that question, British and Dutch researchers conducted an experiment, published this week in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. And it turns out, people in the study really did speak more fluently after a low dose of alcohol \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t think so themselves.\nThe study included 50 native German speakers who were studying at Maastricht University, located in the Netherlands near the border with Germany. All of the people in the study said they drank alcohol at least sometimes, and, because their classes were taught in Dutch, had recently passed an exam demonstrating proficiency in the language.\nEach person was asked to have a casual, two-minute conversation with an interviewer in Dutch. Before that chat, half were given water to drink, while the other half were given an alcoholic beverage. The amount of booze varied based on the person\u2019s weight, but for a 150-pound man, it was equivalent to just under a pint of beer.\nThe conversations were recorded and then scored by two native Dutch speakers who weren\u2019t aware which people had consumed alcohol. The participants were also asked to self-score their own performances, based on how fluently they felt they\u2019d spoken.\nUnexpectedly, alcohol had no effect on the speakers\u2019 self-ratings; those who\u2019d had a drink weren\u2019t any more confident or pleased with their performances than those who\u2019d had water.\nBut they did perform better, according to those who listened to the recordings. Overall, the native Dutch speakers rated people in the alcohol group as having better fluency \u2014 specifically better pronunciation \u2014 than those in the water group. Ratings for grammar, vocabulary and argumentation were similar between groups.\nThe authors point out that the dose of alcohol tested in the study was low, and that higher levels of consumption might not have these beneficial effects. After all, they write in their paper, drinking too much can have the exact opposite effect on fluency and can even lead to slurred speech.\nThe study\u2019s findings should also be replicated in other groups of people, they add, to show that the results aren\u2019t unique to native German speakers or to people learning Dutch. At least one other paper supports this theory, though; in a 1972 study, small doses of alcohol improved Americans\u2019 pronunciation of words in Thai.\nWhile the study did not measure people\u2019s mental states or emotions, the authors say it\u2019s possible that a low-to-moderate dose of alcohol \u201creduces language anxiety\u201d and therefore increases proficiency. \u201cThis might enable foreign language speakers to speak more fluently in the foreign language after drinking a small amount of alcohol,\u201d they conclude."}

I've come to see that rejection by a college is a blessing. I have spent years tracking college applicants, first as a journalist and then as an alumni interviewer for Brown University. I've watched dozens of kids agonize after being rebuffed by brand-name schools from Princeton to Stanford. And yet when I check in with them a year or two later, inevitably they're blissfully settled at their second- or third-choice school.\nMost recently, while working on a book about high school seniors and their college applications, I watched a top student at a public school deal with the shock of being rejected by five Ivy League schools as well as Oxford, the University of Chicago and Amherst.\nHe was admitted to New York University's Stern School of Business but initially didn't want to attend because it was half an hour from his house--too close to mom and dad. Now he's finishing his first year at Stern and can't imagine being anywhere else.\nLast year I interviewed a great kid for Brown: curious, athletic, with a transcript chock full of Advanced Placement classes. I urged the admissions office to take him. Brown admitted 13% of its applicants in that cycle, and he didn't make the cut.\nRecently his parents told me he ended up at the University of Virginia and loves it. He can't imagine being anywhere else.\nThese days, accomplished students at high schools everywhere don't learn much about failure, or even setbacks. Parents like me make sure of it: We get them the best tutors; we make sure they're not off to the side of the stage in the school plays; we let Saturday-morning soccer coaches know we're watching.\nYet we're preparing to launch kids into a world where companies are downsized, where jobs shift across the borders, where IRAs and mutual funds implode. Being rejected from a dream college and then learning to triumph? That's a vital lesson at age 17 or so.\nWhile writing a series of articles about college applicants for Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, I had an epiphany. Applying to college isn't about SAT and ACT scores. It isn't about numbers.\nInstead, when it's done right, it's a process of self-discovery. While touring schools and writing essays, kids realize who they are. They figure out their priorities when they consider nearby campuses vs. faraway ones; they learn time management when they craft short-answer responses late at night; they learn responsibility when they have to commit to paying some expenses that parents won't handle.\nApplying to college, in other words, is not about the end result; it's not about the thick envelope or the e-mail that says \"Congratulations.\" Instead, it's about starting a journey toward adulthood.\nDavid L. Marcus, a reporter at Newsday, is the author of Acceptance: A Legendary Guidance Counselor Helps Seven Students Find the Right College -- and Find Themselves.

Intended for both kids and adults, this nature documentary brings a warm perspective to the cold life of penguins in Antartica.\nNarrated by Ed Helms (\u201cThe Office,\" \u201cThe Hangover\u201d), the film follows Steve, an awkward yet relatable Ad\u00e9lie penguin. In contrast to the majesty that Morgan Freeman brought to the famous tale of emperor penguins in \"March of the Penguins,\" Helms\u2019 narration brings goofiness and warmth, providing a humorous balance to the harsh reality of the cold and challenging environment the Ad\u00e9lie penguins face in Antarctica.\nLike many previous Disneynature films, the \"Penguins\" film crew spent four years immersed in the elements of Antarctica, collecting hundreds of hours of film that would then be used to tell the 76-minute \u201ccoming of age\u201d story. Through the cinematography, the audience gets a chance to experience up close the competing grace and awkwardness of the Ad\u00e9lie penguin as it unfolds both on land and in the sea.\nThe result is an endearing documentary, capturing both the wonder of Antarctica and the drama of the everyday life of penguins. Some parts of the movie drag a bit, and at times Helms' bounce between scientific narrator and first person voice of Steve is a bit awkward.\nOverall, kids will enjoy the story's humorous moments punctuated by a couple barf jokes \u2014 always popular with the under-12 crowd.

And as the 25th anniversary approaches, it is clearly a memory that Egypt does not want a new generation to forget.\nA four-day ''silver jubilee'' that began today will feature a military parade, the first in 17 years. On Oct. 6, the anniversary of the day the war began, radio stations are to rebroadcast Communique No. 1, announcing that Egyptian troops had stormed across the Suez Canal.\nAnd to kick off the festivities, the Government staged a mass wedding of 250 couples tonight in the shadow of the Great Pyramids, and broadcast it on television, in the clear determination that October might be remembered for years to come.\nThe blend of war and romance has made for a passionate mix.\n''I am very proud that the happiest day of my life, which is my wedding, is the same day of the Israeli defeat, shame and sadness,'' said Iglal Adley, a 22-year-old law school graduate who was one of the brides taking part in the pageant.\nIn fact, the outcome was equivocal enough that Israel also calls it a victory, after it rebounded from the initial Arab attack, which came as Israel marked Yom Kippur. But no one disputes that the war was a turning point in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nAfter the humiliations of 1948, 1956 and 1967, Egypt and its allies managed, for a short time, to regain the upper hand with a sudden thrust across the Suez that military historians have described as a masterpiece of planning and strategic surprise.\nIn the first days of battle, Egypt on the south and Syria on the north advanced into Sinai and the Golan Heights, the territory that Israel had captured from them six years before. And while Israel regained control of those territories by the time of cease-fire, the war did prompt the first real consideration of the concept of land for peace.\nIn Egypt's recent history, only the 1952 revolt that toppled the monarchy and the 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal are remembered with nearly as much zeal.\nA satellite city outside Cairo and a bridge that spans the Nile both bear the name 6 October, while in the capital itself, the first three days of battle (but, conveniently, not the ones that followed) are re-enacted in miniature at the October panorama.\nBut some of the glow has faded with time. It was at a parade in honor of the anniversary in 1981 that Islamic militants assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat, and in the years since, the country's main preoccupation has been with internal problems.\nAnd so officials planning the 25th-anniversary celebration said they wanted to reach out to those too young to remember the war itself.\nDazzled by their free wedding dresses, flowers and the lavish entertainment -- all laid on by the Youth Authority and business sponsors -- many couples said that without this help that might not otherwise have been able to marry.\nIn rural villages, mass weddings have long been embraced, and the Government has seemed to encourage the idea, even staging a 1992 wedding of 200 couples at Cairo Stadium, until tonight the largest that"}

She was 91.\n''Artist's wife'' is not a category widely used by art historians, but Mrs. Newman was among the great ones of 20th-century American art, bringing an unusual combination of fierce loyalty and independence to her calling.\nUnlike many American artists' wives, including Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Sally Avery, Marguerite Zorach, Helen Torr (wife of Arthur Dove) and Dorothy Dehner (wife of David Smith), Mrs. Newman had no artistic ambitions of her own, but she didn't exactly shrink into the shadows, either. Instead, she provided her husband with essential financial and moral support to a degree that makes it difficult to imagine his accomplishment without her.\nAnnalee Greenhouse was born in Jaffa, Palestine, in 1909. Her parents were from Russia and on their way to the United States, which they reached when Annalee was 9 months old. The family settled in Akron, Ohio, and moved to Forest Hills in Queens when she was a teenager. She attended Hunter College, where she majored in French and studied to be a teacher.\nIt was as a teacher, at a teachers' meeting in 1934, that she met the erudite, loquacious Newman, who was four years her senior and working as a substitute art teacher.\nThey made an urbane, voluble couple, living in apartments on the Upper West Side or briefly in Brooklyn, rather than in lofts, although Newman always had studios in lower Manhattan. Mrs. Newman's unshakable faith in her husband's talent saw him through periods of low productivity and despair (in the early 1940's) and critical isolation (like the 1950's), when many people in the art world, including some prominent Abstract Expressionists, were put off by the stringency of his abstraction.\nAfter Newman had an artistic breakthrough in 1948, the couple decided that he should devote all his energy to his art. They lived almost entirely off Mrs. Newman's teaching salary until the late 1950's, when Newman's paintings began to sell consistently. Low points included visits to a pawnbroker and Newman's attempt to find work as a tailor's fitter, which lasted until his wife canceled his appointment for an interview. Throughout, she maintained a detailed archive of his work that ultimately grew to 40 file cabinets.\nMrs. Newman, who leaves no immediate survivors, retired from teaching in 1964. After her husband's death in 1970 she moved to an apartment in River House on East 51st Street. Until she suffered severe smoke inhalation during a fire in her building several years ago, she regularly attended parties and openings and was an avid opera fan, often traveling throughout Europe and the United States to attend rare performances. In the early 1980's she established the Barnett Newman Foundation, which holds his archive and library, has published several catalogs on aspects of his work and planned a catalog raisonne, by the art historian Yves-Alain Bois, for 2001."}

For the first time, Wales have a prime seat at the table - among the top seeds for the European section after a remarkable rise under manager Chris Coleman has put them 10th in the world.\nWales are, of course, in pole position to qualify for the Euro 2016 finals as leaders of qualifying Group B, with the next European matches in early September comprising Cyprus away then at home to Israel.\nThis form has given Wales elevated status at a draw in which Brazilian World Cup winners Ronaldo and legendary Italian winning captain Fabio Cannavaro are among the ''assistants.''

But while the technical merits are subject to debate, the recent NAB Show in Las Vegas left little doubt that a lot of work is going on behind the scenes to make Ultra HD TV the next big thing.\nThe theme of this year's NAB Show, and Sony's press conference, was clear.\nConsumers have yet to tune in to 4K or Ultra HD TV yet. No wonder. There\u2019s little content available, the cable and satellite companies aren\u2019t ready to deliver it, and even if they were, only a handful of homes actually have 4K TVs (last year around 80,000 UHD sets were sold in the U.S.).\nAll of this has led to talk that 4K could be the next 3D, a technology that was meant to drive a fresh wave of TV sales but instead fizzled out. But while the technical merits of 4K are subject to debate, the NAB Show in Las Vegas earlier this month left little doubt that a lot of work is going on behind the scenes to make UHD the next big thing.\nAlthough the terms are used interchangeably, Ultra HD and 4K are not exactly the same. UHD, at 3840x2160, has four times the resolution of Full HD or 1920x1080. These are display resolutions used in high-definition TVs, as well as PC monitors and laptop displays. By contrast the 4K specification was developed for digital cinema. It has a resolution of 4096x2160 or four times the 2K standard of 2048x1080. In other words \u201c4K\u201d TVs do not actually have four thousand vertical lines and it would perhaps be more accurate to refer to them as 2160p\u2014just as Full HD displays are known as 1080p--but don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon.\nThe bottom line is that four times the resolution means lots more information needs to be captured, transferred and stored, produced and distributed. That requires new cameras and production equipment, better compression, more advanced broadcast standards, and upgraded set-top boxes and TVs. All of that was on display at the National Association of Broadcasters\u2019 annual get-together earlier this month, which attracted nearly 100,000 people and more than 1,700 exhibitors.\nThe selection of video and digital still cameras capable of capturing 4K video is growing. Sony already has a broad line of CineAlta 4K production cameras (the F5, F55 and F65) which seem to be very popular. Sony\u2019s released its first 4K \u201cprosumer\u201d camera, the FDR-AX1, along with a professional version (the PXW-Z100) last fall. Earlier this year the company announced its first true consumer 4K camera, the smaller FDR-AX100 that costs around $2,000. At NAB Sony announced the Alpha NEX A7s, a new version of its mirror-less interchangeable lens camera with a 12-megapixel full-frame sensor designed to shoot 4K.\nCanon already has a hybrid digital SLR, the EOS-1D C, which can capture 4K video as well as a professional cinema camera, the EOS C500.

Mary E. Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the spill, said such a burn might be conducted as soon as Wednesday.\nA joint government and industry task force has been unable to stop crude oil from streaming out of a broken pipe attached to a well 5,000 feet below sea level. The leaks were found Saturday, days after an oil rig to which the pipe was attached exploded and sank in the gulf about 50 miles southeast of Venice, La. An estimated 42,000 gallons a day are now spilling into the Gulf of Mexico.\nOfficials said Tuesday that wind projections indicated that the oil would not reach land in the next three days, and it was unclear exactly where along the Gulf Coast it might arrive first.\n\u201cIf some of the weather conditions continue, the Delta area is at risk,\u201d said Charlie Henry, scientific support coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nAdmiral Landry said a final decision had not been made yet about whether to burn the oil.\n\u201cWe fully understand there are benefits and trade-offs,\u201d she said.\nBut she also noted that with the spill moving toward land the impact on the shoreline had to be considered. That part of Louisiana contains some 40 percent of the nation\u2019s wetlands and is spawning grounds for countless fish and birds.\nControlled burns have been done and tested before, Admiral Landry said, and had been shown to be \u201ceffective in burning 50 to 95 percent of oil collected in a fire boom.\u201d The downside, she said, was a \u201cblack plume\u201d of smoke that would put soot and other particulates into the air.\nThe consideration of burning was raised as the spill seemed to enter a direr phase. Short-term fixes have been unsuccessful, and political reaction has intensified.\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they were expanding the government\u2019s investigation of the explosion that caused the oil rig disaster. The inquiry will have subpoena power and will look into possible criminal or civil violations by the operators of the drilling rig, Transocean, a Swiss company, and related companies.\nAdministration officials also met Tuesday with top executives of BP, which was leasing the rig and is required by law to pay for the cleanup. Last fall, as the federal government was weighing tougher safety and environmental rules for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, BP objected, saying its voluntary programs were successful.\nBP engineers have not been able to activate a device known as a blowout preventer, a valve at the wellhead that was supposed to stop oil flow in an emergency and is the only short-term solution for capping the well.\nDoug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production at BP, defended the company\u2019s efforts, and said the cleanup was costing $6 million a day.

The Japanese automaker has around 200 engineers developing solid-state batteries at its Higashi Fuji Technical Center, compared to the less than 30 engineers at Hyundai Motor.\nHyundai Motor reportedly has a pilot scale production line for the batteries and it may also have its own production facilities in the future, like Toyota, if necessary, the source said.\nIndustry sources said Hyundai may be able to mass produce the solid-state batteries around or after 2025. In such a scenario and considering the five-year cycle of car production, the battery should be completed around 2020.\nConventional battery makers including Samsung SDI and LG Chem are taking a more cautious approach. Although they are developing solid-state batteries, they may unveil solid-like batteries first, which have some liquid electrolytes, instead of directly mass producing solid-state batteries. Solid-like batteries are safer than lithium-ion batteries and easier to produce than solid-state batteries.\nBoth Samsung SDI and LG Chem confirmed they are developing the technologies, but declined to comment as to the current development level of the technologies."}

While a rebound is likely, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep tightening policy, limiting the potential for a big rise in the euro.\nIndeed, the Fed raised rates on Wednesday, dropped a pledge to keep them low enough to stimulate the economy \u201cfor some time\u201d and signalled it may hike borrowing costs somewhat faster than earlier projected.\nNew staff forecasts are expected to show stronger inflation, slower growth and broadly unchanged core inflation, sources told Reuters earlier.\nNew guidance on interest rates, which the ECB has promised and could deliver on Thursday, would also be closely scrutinized. The current formulation ties the first hike to the end of asset purchases, stipulating that it would only come \u201cwell past\u201d the end of QE.\nThe new guidance is expected to say that rates will stay at their present level for some quarters but as long as the expected path of inflation is consistent with rates.\nSuch a formulation would not commit the ECB to a move more than a year into the"}

Therefore, investors are advised to stay on the sidelines and keep ready a war chest of money to be invested in good quality small and midcap shares after a correction.

In some diseases, including Friedreich\u2019s, the repeats become roadblocks to cellular machines that decode the gene and start making the protein that the cell needs. In other diseases, such as the neurological condition Huntington\u2019s, the repeats can result in excess protein, which itself can become toxic.\nIn research reported this week in the \u201cfirst release\u201d section of the journal Science, Aseem Ansari, a professor of biochemistry and genomics at UW\u2013Madison, and colleagues showed that their \u201cmolecular prosthesis\u201d can help cellular machinery overcome the blockade posed by the repeats in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia.\nOne component of the prosthesis locates the repeats, then the second helps the cellular machinery soldier past the repeats to properly decode the gene.\nIn the Ansari group, Graham Erwin, Matthew Grieshop and Asfa Ali formed a team that designed and created the prototype molecule, and also orchestrated collaboration with colleagues at UW\u2013Madison, the pharmaceutical firm Novartis, and a leading medical center in India.\nIn studies of cell lines from more than 20 Friedreich\u2019s patients, the molecular prosthesis restored expression of the frataxin protein.\nIn mice containing transplanted human cells carrying about 310 GAA repeats, the prosthesis restored expression of a signaling protein to nearly normal.\nThe molecule being tested is designed to assist the enzyme that reads, or \u201ctranscribes,\u201d DNA at the confusing repeats. Once it reaches the other side, the enzyme, called RNA polymerase, reads the gene and makes RNA that in turn codes for frataxin, the protein that is lacking in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia.\nThe new results published this week in Science suggest that \u201cwe have figured out how to turn on the part of the gene that is being ignored without doing anything anywhere else,\u201d Ansari says.\nEven as patients and families yearn for a cure, it\u2019s likely to take several years before drug testing begins, Ansari warns.\nAnsari, who has been trying to unravel repeats for about 15 years at UW\u2013Madison, achieved initial success in 2004 when his group designed \u201ctwo-headed\u201d molecules with a \u201cDNA reading head\u201d that would deliver the molecule to a specific location in an individual\u2019s genome, and a \u201cdocking head\u201d that would dock a cellular machine to force the gene to be read correctly at that site.\nThen, Ansari says, researchers found that the molecule got \u201cdistracted\u201d while floating in a sea of DNA and failed to distinguish hundreds of \u201clook-alike\u201d sites from its actual target.\nBy 2013, funding had dried up, and only a grant from the W.M.

They gave the Devils\u2019 forwards no room to breath, not allowing a New Jersey shot over a 14:09-stretch during the final period.\nSidney Crosby and Robert Bortuzzo added two huge daggers less than three minutes apart in the middle of the third to give Pittsburgh an insurmountable four-goal lead.\nBortuzzo\u2019s goal with just over 10 minutes remaining marked his first career-NHL tally and he received a thunderous applause after his slap shot from the blue line powered past Martin Brodeur.\nBortuzzo said his adjustment to Pittsburgh has been a relatively easy one, since the Pens play a similar system as its American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge factor. I\u2019ve played a lot of games in Wilkes-Barre and the system is almost the exact same and that is a real luxury that I\u2019ve had in my career,\u201d Bortuzzo said.\nAnother first occurred Saturday as Brandon Sutter had his official welcome to Pittsburgh moment a little over two minutes into the second period.\nSutter shoved his way into the crease along with the puck, pushing it into Brodeur where it pinballed its way into New Jersey\u2019s net. The goal was originally awarded to Crosby, but was given to Sutter a few minutes later, and he received a rousing ovation.\n\u201cIt felt great. I\u2019ve said before I\u2019ve had a few chances the last few games and I\u2019ve been getting robbed a little bit so it\u2019s nice to get the monkey off the back and get the first one,\u201d Sutter said.\nDespite feeling under the weather, Chris Kunitz also had a spectacular performance, racking up a goal and two assists.\nHis goal came midway through the second period when Anton Volchenkov\u2019s pass intended for Bryce Salvador waffled off his stick and right onto Kunitz\u2019s tape. Kunitz had a clear path to the New Jersey net and slammed a shot past Brodeur for his second goal of the season.\nKunitz said he was more than happy to capitalize on Volchenkov\u2019s mistake.\n\u201cWhen you get one turned over right there and put it on net, it felt good for it to go in, but that doesn\u2019t happen too often,\u201d Kunitz said.\nThe Penguins did an excellent job defensively, allowing just 16 shots. Through the first two periods, they allowed a season-low 10 shots to get through to Fleury. The Pens\u2019 previous low in shots allowed through two periods this season was 17. The four shots allowed in the second period were also a season low.\nPittsburgh\u2019s defensemen frustrated the Devils\u2019 forwards, getting in front of 14 New Jersey shots, led by Brooks Orpik\u2019s three first-period blocks.\nFleury said he thought the Penguins might have had their best overall team effort and that led to the Pens first home victory in three tries.\n\u201cI think the Rangers game was pretty solid, and again today at home.

In fact, the resolution targets 10 types of plastics that are in use in straws, cutlery, plates, and cotton buds. Also, by 2025 plastic bottles should be made of 25 percent recycled content, and by 2029 90 percent of them should be recycled. The ban will come into effect in all EU member states by 2021. The EU currently produces about 25 million tons of plastic waste per year and less than 30 percent of voters recycled over 80 percent of waste in the oceans is plastic. Also, this waste has created an enormous island of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is said to be twice the size of Texas.\nJoining me now to discuss the plastics ban are Jerri-Lynn Scofield and Jonathan Latham. Jerri-Lynn Scofield used to be a securities lawyer and derivatives trader who now writes for Naked Capitalism, Truthout, and other outlets. She joins us from Kolkata, India. And Dr. Latham is the co-founder and executive director of the Bioscience Resource Project. He joins us from Ithaca, New York. Thanks, Jerri-Lynn and Jonathan for being here today.\nGREG WILPERT: So Jonathan, let\u2019s start with you. Why is the banning of single use plastic important? Can you give us some examples of what makes them so harmful to our health and our environment?\nJONATHAN LATHAM: Well, there\u2019s two fundamental issues. One is that these plastics don\u2019t biodegrade very well, if at all. So what they end up doing is blocking the airways and stomach passages and so forth of animals, so large animals and small animals all die from having too much plastic inside them. But the second issue is that these plastics also poison animals. So in many cases, they have heavy metals inside them. Some of them are made from endocrine disruptors, some of them are made from toxins of other kinds, and there are a whole mishmash of chemicals that basically have bad effects on the natural world. So they can poison many, many animals. And so, there\u2019s two kinds of problems that follow from these plastics.\nSo Jerri-Lynn, in January 2018, you wrote an article for Naked Capitalism titled EU Makes Limited Move on Plastics: Too Little, Too Late. Do you think that the EU legislation as it passed now is strong enough to deal with the problems that Jonathan outlined?\nJERRI-LYNN SCOFIELD: I certainly don\u2019t. I believe the EU step is one in the right direction. I point out that within the last couple of years, the state of Michigan actually put a ban on municipalities in Michigan imposing bans on plastics. So cities, municipalities that tried to ban plastics were told by the state that they shouldn\u2019t be able to do that. So at least it\u2019s a first step. However, I think it\u2019s a very, very modest step compared to what is necessary. And I point out that places like India, which use far less plastics per capita\u201324 pounds per person in India, compared to 240 pounds in the U.S.\u2013"}

This month, she is ready to set new sales records with her second novel.\nI have a dream: Savi Sharma.\nThere was once a girl who didn\u2019t read books, till one day, she began reading. She read a few, and then she read some more; and then she decided to write her own. It could be an extension of her notebook, she thought, where she jotted down her thoughts and observations about her life. The protagonist, Meera, could also be a fictional version of herself, a girl in search of a story to share with the world. It would be a love story, of course, but the budding writer wanted to do more \u2014 she wanted to inspire her readers and make them believe that inside each one of them is a story; all they had to do was find it. Less than a year after it was published, Everyone Has a Story (EHAS) has sold 1.6 lakh copies; and spurred a quasi-sequel this month \u2014 This is Not Your Story (TINYS) \u2014 that is poised to set new records in the Indian publishing industry.

The launch and the book tour are the perks of signing up with Westland, the Delhi-based publishing house that was purchased by Amazon last year, and is known for delivering commercial hits with authors such as Amish and Ashwin Sanghi.\nLast year, Westland beat Penguin Random House to sign Sharma, after the self-published first print run of EHAS (5,000 copies) quickly sold out online. With the firm\u2019s distribution network, the book swiftly crossed the 1 lakh mark. Some industry insiders have expressed doubts about the veracity of those figures, but this has not stopped Sharma from snagging a multi-book deal with Westland. \u201cNow, my first book has been translated into Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali and Telugu,\u201d says Sharma, who teamed up with a friend and mentor, Ashish Bagrecha, last June to start a motivational blog, Life and People.

Jan Brewer fought her own Republican party in the state Legislature for months to push through a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\nThat was three years ago. Now, as an early Donald Trump supporter who has his ear, Brewer hopes one of the pillars of President Barack Obama's health care law can be saved as Trump pushes to dump much of the overhaul.\n\"I don't know how much of that, and I mean it sincerely, is going to be affected,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview. She said she's encouraging Trump's administration to look at Arizona's model because it is so cost-effective.\nBrewer said the low-income population that the Medicaid expansion was designed to cover was one of the main drivers of the law, and she's not prepared to see that group go without care. Nearly 400,000 Arizonans have gained Medicaid insurance since Brewer's proposal took effect in 2014.\nArizona is one of 31 states that expanded Medicaid, many of them run by Democrats. Republicans have blocked expansion in the remaining 19 states.\nAmong the GOP-led states that expanded Medicaid, many officials are like Brewer, strong proponents of the program that has brought insurance to about 9 million low-income Americans who can't possibly afford to buy it themselves. Before the expansion, those people had little access to regular health care, and when they got sick, hospitals were forced to treat them without compensation.\nStates that strongly oppose Medicaid expansion, however, continue to do so.\nMississippi's three top Republican leaders have said consistently for years that they believe the state cannot afford expansion, as have Idaho's GOP leaders.\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott called for a complete repeal of Obama's overhaul a week after the Nov. 8 election. Scott has been vague, however, about what should be done about the 20 million Americans who got health insurance through the overhaul, nearly half of them though Medicaid expansion his state rejected.\nIf he doesn't completely dump the program, Trump will be under pressure to allow changes to it to give states more control.\nCurrent Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey last year proposed a work requirement for healthy Medicaid recipients, premiums and co-pays and a five-year limit on coverage. The Obama administration approved limited co-pays but nixed the work requirement and the five-year limit. Michigan, Indiana and Iowa also have been allowed to charge premiums or fees, but broader changes requested by some states have been rejected.\nVice president-elect Mike Pence told Republican governors meeting in Florida on Nov. 14 that Trump would replace traditional Medicaid funding to states with block grants that \"encourage innovation that better delivers health care to eligible residents,\" according to a statement from the Trump transition team.\nPence, Indiana's governor, expanded Medicaid in his state but got waivers from the Obama administration to implement plans that kick healthy people off the program for six months if they fail to pay premiums.\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he hopes Trump's election means the state will have more flexibility in how it spends Medicaid money. More than 300,000 people are enrolled in the state's hybrid Medicaid expansion, which uses federal expansion money to buy private insurance for low-income residents.\n\"This election means we're going to have an"}

Whether you\u2019re looking at a Tablet as a companion device or as your next computer they offer a distinctly mobile experience that can free you up to work or play in a variety of locations even if those locations just mean moving from the sofa downstairs to the sofa upstairs. Or maybe you\u2019d just like to take a step up from the Tablet you already own. Either way you\u2019ve got some decision making to do. There are plenty of Tablets to choose from. Your choice depends on your needs and your budget.\nLook at this as a guide for Tablet shopping that stays away from specs and hardware differences, but instead looks at the Tablet experience in a general sense. There is reason I\u2019m treating this post this way. This year, unlike past years, the distinction between Tablets from different makers may vary, but the experiences Tablets offer are becoming closer and closer. If there is a category where things might be changing that category might be the long term value proposition.\nEach of the Tablets discussed in this post have much in common. They all have the latest and greatest chipsets, beautiful display screens, and access to a range of content that offer options to those looking to play games, watch video, listen to music, read books, sling content to a TV, or even get some work done. They all offer windows into the world you\u2019d like to create for yourself while holding that world in your hand.\nWhile there are many different Tablet makers there are really four ecosystems to choose from. And one of those has two different variants. No, I\u2019m not talking about Android, although I will shortly. The Big Four are Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google/Android/Samsung/many others. Each of these big four have introduced new Tablets and have older Tablet models still available for sale. Each Tablet and its respective ecosystem has something to offer. I would venture to say, that things have improved so much that unless you have an absolute specific need or are tied into an ecosystem that you absolutely adore, that for most consumers this holiday system, the newer Tablets from any of the big four would satisfy. I\u2019m not saying that all Tablets are created equal. There are differences. But the distance between those differences is narrower this year than it has been in the past.\nThe Tablet ecosystem with two distinct variants belongs to Microsoft. Microsoft has two different Tablet operating systems right now: Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 RT. If you think that sounds confusing, Microsoft thinks so too.\nThe difference between Windows 8.1 RT and Windows 8.1 is that Windows 8.1 RT does not run what we think of as conventional Windows Apps. Windows 8.1 RT Tablets run on the ARM architecture and Windows 8.1 runs on Tablets running Intel chips. Apps for Windows 8.1 RT need to be written for that platform specifically. They used to be called Metro Apps and some still use that name. But that\u2019s a rule that Microsoft has broken itself by providing Microsoft Office 2013 for free on the Windows 8.1 RT platform. Some like to say that RT Tablets are not real Windows PCs. For lack of a better shortcut I think that\u2019s accurate. But they are powerful Tablets in an of their own right.\nWindows 8.1 RT operates on three Tablets at the moment: Surface RT, Surface 2, and the Nokia 2520. The Surface RT was the original Tablet using this operating system. The Surface 2 is the much improved second generation"}

The Sun Devils will go on to hold the no. 15 Michigan State University to only three points in the first half. They\u2019ll have excellent time clock management in the fourth quarter before kicking a field goal for the go-ahead win as the final seconds tick away.\nIf you are an Arizona State fan, this scenario sounds like an unlikely dream come true. If you\u2019re a Michigan State fan, a fan of any other team or even a realist, you would have probably laughed in this person\u2019s face, especially when they tell you about the elevated defensive level of play.\nArizona State vs. Michigan State was a nail-biting game that came down until the very last seconds of the game. The win meant more than being able to advance to 2-0 on the books; it was a crucial moment for the program, signifying a turning point and what the future will likely be under Herm.\nSun Devil Stadium was a packed house, creating an electrifying atmosphere for the fans and players alike. It brought a sense of excitement that hadn\u2019t been felt since the 2014 season. With an estimate of at least 17,000 MSU fans in attendance, this was no easy feat for Arizona State, as the Spartans brought the noise.\nAmong those in attendance were somewhere around 70 prospects, with more than 40 of them already with an offer to play at ASU. Top prospects from around the nation were there to experience the glorious victory and vibrant atmosphere that day, which left a solid impression on many of them, some who will certainly be the future of the program. In fact, it was such a strong impression that the Sun Devils have already gained another commitment from the 2019 class.\nIt also validates the somewhat questionable and outside of the box hiring of Herm Edwards. Back in November, nearly everyone was scratching their heads when Ray Anderson made the announcement. Now, however, most of them are on the train and ready to go. But either way, the hire has garnered up a bunch of national attention for the program, and when you\u2019re winning at the same time, it\u2019s likely going to lead to good things for the program.\nHerm Edwards is the No. 1 trend in America!\nThe game was also a good way to gauge where the program is at. Arizona State was able to make the victory over UTSA look easy, but that wasn\u2019t necessarily the best game to determine where the strengths and weaknesses are. Michigan State was a much better test, and even when the normally dominant offense struggled, the defense came through and shined.\nOh yeah, defeating a top-ranked team and having impressive stats on both side of the ball catapulted them into this week\u2019s top-25 ranking, placing them at number 23. Not to mention their defense is being talked about with some of the best in the nation. They\u2019ve allowed only three first half points so far this season, putting them in second place behind Alabama and Missouri, who both have allowed zero.\nThis week, the Sun Devils will hit the road for the first time on the season to face San Diego State. The players who were a member of last year\u2019s squad remember the gut-wrenching loss at home to the Aztecs, as former running back Rashaad Penny single-handedly annihilated ASU\u2019s defense.

It has been replaced by the word epilessija in Maltese.\nWith the correct medication, some 75 per cent of people with epilepsy can become seizure-free; the remaining 25 per cent will still have seizures, despite maximising the use of available medication.\nDespite ongoing research, it is still not fully understood why some people have epilepsy and not others. However, it is known that the condition can be due to head trauma or injury, or the after-effect of a tumour or stroke, but in others it is idiopathic (ie the cause remains unknown). To complicate matters further, various triggers, including stress, fatigue, alcohol, drugs or flashing lights, can lead to a seizure.\nIn view of the fact that not many people are aware of the condition, and the varying types of seizures and its implications, many people are afraid to try and help a person having a seizure \u2013 and some mistakenly think the individual is intoxicated. There is nothing that can be done to shorten the duration of a seizure, but you can still help in several ways.\nWhat is the Epilepsy Toolkit?\nThis year, with the support of the Commission for the Rights of People with Disability \u2013 CRPD, the Caritas Malta Epilepsy Association is launching a toolkit. This project has involved a wide range of professionals in order to develop a Maltese resource that acts as a point of information and explanation to those who have just been diagnosed and to carers, teachers and families looking for further information. It will be available in hospitals and to anyone who requests it and there has also been work regarding the training of workforces and educational establishments on how to support those with epilepsy.\nWhat should you do if someone has a seiz"}

It was initially announced in mid-January that the election would take place on the third Wednesday in October, in line with the constitution.\nLess than three weeks later, on February 5, President Aliyev brought the date forward without offering any explanation for doing so. Scheduling early presidential elections was one of the additional powers granted to the president under constitutional amendments adopted in a referendum in September 2016. At the same time, the presidential term was extended from five to seven years.\nThe scheduling of the early vote was met with outrage and consternation by prospective opposition candidates, who were thus left with just five weeks to collect the minimum 40,000 signatures in their support required for registration, the deadline for which was March 12.\nThe National Council of Democratic Forces (NSDS) formed in the run-up to the 2013 presidential ballot, and which unites prominent opposition figures, immediately declared its intention to boycott what its leader, Camil Hasanli, termed \"a farce\" and \"flouting the institution of elections.\"\nArif Hacili, chairman of the opposition Musavat Party, which is one of the country's oldest and most respected, similarly branded the ballot illegal.\nHacili's predecessor as party chairman, Isa Qambar, placed second to Aliyev in the 2003 presidential ballot, which he claimed was rigged to deny him victory.\nThe Umid (Hope) party, for its part, decided not to field a candidate: its chairman, Iqbal Agazade -- who garnered under 3 percent of the vote in the 2008 and 2013 presidential ballots -- explained to the news portal Caucasian Knot that the party's statutes require it to convene a congress to select a presidential candidate, which was impossible given the time constraints.\nReAl and the youth organization Nida both announced that they will not acknowledge the election outcome as legitimate, Caucasian Knot reported, while in late March, the religious movement Muslim Unity, most of whose leaders are currently in prison, called on its members and supporters to boycott the vote.\nA total of 15 hopefuls sought to register for the election, of whom only eight succeeded, including Aliyev.

His suggestion, which would almost certainly be unconstitutional, represents perhaps the most sweeping call for a religious test proposed by a mainstream political figure over the last few years, which have seen a strong backlash against Islam.\nGingrich continued by saying that anyone who visited a website associated with ISIS or Al-Qaeda should be prosecuted as a felon.\nGingrich has a tendency to speak off the cuff, often saying outrageous things, so it\u2019s hard to tell how considered the comment was. But it represents a grave misunderstanding of both the First Amendment and \u201csharia,\u201d an oft-blurred term.\nSuch an approach would also be difficult to enforce. What would prevent a believer from simply lying? As many an anti-Islam campaigner has pointed out, Shia Islam grants believers a dispensation to conceal their faith in the face of persecution. In some cases\u2014the Spanish Inquisition comes to mind\u2014elaborate tests have been devised to sniff our secret Muslims and Jews, but those tests were both unscientific and obviously brutal; and even so small colonies of Muslims persisted in Spain, perhaps as late as the 1980s.\nAre there any precedents for this in American history? The common parallel cited is the internment of Japanese Americans at the start of World War II, an incident that has been widely regarded as black mark on the nation\u2019s history, if one that Trump has cautiously defended. But even that ban was based on ethnicity tied to a nation with which the U.S. was at war, not a religious identity spanning the globe.\nGingrich\u2019s suggestion also represents a common if serious misunderstanding of sharia. \u201cSharia\u201d is often used as a shorthand for radical Islamism, but Gingrich shows the limitation of that approach. To suggest that Muslims are acceptable as long as they don\u2019t believe in sharia is a little like saying Christians are OK as long as they don\u2019t believe the Gospel. In other words, any practicing Muslim believes in sharia. It\u2019s simply a code of behavior and law in the religion, just as in any other religion. And just as there are Christians whose religious beliefs run the gamut from casual belief and church attendance on Christmas and Easter to those who commit violence and murder in the name of their religion, there is a range of Muslim beliefs that fit under the rubric of sharia. Might a reasonable Christian disavow someone like Eric Rudolph, insisting he represented a perversion or misunderstanding of what Jesus taught? Of course. But then most American Muslims would (and do) say the same of Islamist terrorists.\nGingrich\u2019s latest comments are related to things he\u2019s said before. In 2006, for example\u2014at a dinner celebrating the First Amendment, no less!\u2014the former House speaker argued that freedom of speech needed to be reconsidered in light of the threat of terrorism. Gingrich spoke out against the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, a proposed Islamic center in lower Manhattan, and he has advocated for banning the use of sharia in American courts. My colleague Conor Friedersdorf in 2012 rounded up some of Gingrich\u2019s comments about Islam and Muslims, arguing that if they had been made about any other religious group, Gingrich would have been drummed out of polite circles.\nBut the idea of deport"}

(AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions returned from their open date with a significant injury announcement.\nJamal Agnew, who earned All-Pro honors last season as a rookie punt returner, was put on injured reserve with a knee problem. The Lions announced the move Monday, although coach Matt Patricia doesn\u2019t seem to be ruling out the possibility of Agnew returning this season.\nWhat\u2019s clear for now is that the Lions will be without Agnew for a while, and their season could hinge on what happens in these next few games. Detroit (2-3) recovered from a terrible start to the season with victories over Tom Brady and New England and Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay.\nBut those two wins came at home. Now the Lions play three of their next four games on the road \u2014 and their next seven are against teams currently at .500 or better.\nDetroit plays at Miami this weekend.\nAgnew returned two punts for touchdowns last season.

Miami is 3-0 at home this season, including an overtime win over Chicago on Sunday in 89-degree weather.\n\u201cI think as you can see as the games go on down there, the teams in the end \u2014 conditioning will be a big part of the game,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cThey\u2019re fortunate that they have that nice shaded sideline down there for their home team, so we\u2019re going to be in the heat for the entire game.\nNOTES: Lions CB Nevin Lawson went to high school in the Miami area and expects to have plenty of supporters in the crowd this weekend \u2014 although he said he wasn\u2019t about to become everybody\u2019s ticket broker. \u201cI tell them just go on StubHub.com and you get all the tickets you want,\u201d Lawson said. \u2026 The Lions signed LB Trevor Bates to the active roster from the practice squad. \u2026 The Lions also announced that they have signed free agent linebacker Garret Dooley to the practice squad."}

With the blending of the carriers still underway, the world\u2019s largest airline faces challenges years after competitors finished their mergers.\n\u201cAmerican is playing catch-up to other airlines, the result of past business decisions to not invest in its passenger experience,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel consultant with Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco.\nMost of the changes unveiled Saturday by Fort Worth, Texas-based American involve larger jets used on international routes. Work has begun on American\u2019s Boeing 777-200s and 767-300s, including in-seat entertainment or in-flight connectivity and lie-flat business class seats. It\u2019s due to be completed in 2016.\nLie-flat business seats also will be added to single-aisle Boeing 757s flown on overseas trips, while power ports and Wi-Fi will be extended throughout the plane.\nOn the heels of American\u2019s product changes, Delta on Monday said it would rebrand its cabins to create five distinct offerings.\nThis rendering of an American Airlines Admirals Club lounge shows what its airport space might look like.\n\u201cDelta is leading the industry in what products we are offering our customers, and the market is seeing that,\u201d he said.\nMost of the changes Delta announced Monday were nominal and take effect March 1.\nAmerican has produced record profits since the US Airways deal closed on Dec. 9, 2013, paid its first dividend since 1980 and announced a $1 billion share buyback plan \u2014 soothing creditors who ended up with stakes in the new airline when it left bankruptcy via the merger. The shares have more than doubled in the past 12 months.\nBy year\u2019s end, American will have received about 100 new aircraft while retiring older planes, swaps the carrier said will give it the youngest fleet among its U.S. peers at 12.3 years. It will add 112 new planes next year, 84 in 2016 and about 300 more through 2022.\nMost of American\u2019s new aircraft will have seat-back video screens throughout. All of the planes in the carrier\u2019s primary jet fleet now have Wi-Fi, with plans to expand to it to regional aircraft, said Joshua Freed, a spokesman.\nAmerican\u2019s merger was the last among the deals shrinking the ranks of U.S. full-service carriers to just three.

The extra nutrients could help guard against infections, said Van Hook.\nUmbilical cords are clamped immediately after birth to prevent the baby from getting unnecessary blood from the mother, which could put the child at risk of becoming jaundiced.\n\"On one hand, we want the safest possible delivery.

The views expressed are the author\u2019s own.\nAlthough the girls were badly injured, all three thankfully survived. Unfortunately, Malala and her classmates were not the only Pakistani students attacked in the past year. In June, for example, 14 female university students were killed when militants blew up their bus in Quetta, Balochistan, a western province.\nPakistan\u2019s teachers and administrators have also been targeted. Five teachers were killed in January in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. In March, another was shot and killed in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. A principal and six school children died that month during an attack at their school in Karachi.\nSchools and university buildings haven\u2019t been spared. Militants set off explosives at a girls\u2019 school in Khyber Pakhtunkwa, also in March. And classrooms have been used for military purposes just as the Pakistani armed forces used Malala\u2019s school during a 2009 operation to uproot the Taliban from Swat Valley.\nViolence against students, educators, and educational institutions isn\u2019t unique to Pakistan. We have documented attacks on education in about 30 countries in the last five years. On September 29, the extremist group Boko Haram killed more than 40 students asleep in their dormitories at Nigeria\u2019s Yobe State College of Agriculture. That same day, an airstrike killed as many as 16 people, mostly students and teachers, at a secondary school in the Syrian city of Raqaa. Just this week, a dozen students were killed in an attack on a school in Iraq.\nSchools are attacked because they are seen to represent the government, or the curriculum is viewed as perpetuating certain values. The Taliban, for instance, demolish schools and threaten teachers and students where they believe the education provided is \u201cun-Islamic.\u201d Girls schooling suffers particularly, as Malala\u2019s story illustrates. She has been blogging and advocating for education \u2013 particularly for girls \u2013 since she was 11. The assault was a direct attack on her views, her \u201caudacity\u201d in publicizing them, and girls\u2019 education.\nEducation is also attacked as a means of challenging the political system, or perceived ethnic or social inequality. Baloch militants have directly fired at non-Baloch educators as a tactic in their separatist struggle.\nArmed groups and security forces have used classrooms as barracks, firing positions, weapons storage, and detention centers because of their thick boundary walls, which make them good tactical sites, and because they have toilets, washing facilities, and cooking spaces. These uses harm education. Armed forces and armed groups often shut schools down entirely, or they make the learning environment so difficult that students stop attending. An armed presence can also trigger attack from opposing forces, threatening the lives of those within.\nIn every country where education is under assault, access to and quality of schooling suffers. Parents are less likely to send their children, especially daughters, to classes, teachers flee, and schools close. Furthermore, violence and threats against education stunt long term social development and economic growth for the whole community.\nPreventing violence and threats directed at students, teachers, professors, schools, and universities requires a concerted response.

{"idx": "25585", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Is this the real Arab Spring?\nShortly after the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, Maryam Namazie, director of the Council of Ex-Muslims in Britain (CEMB), created the hashtag \u201c#ExMuslimBecause\u201d on Twitter. The result was a firestorm, through which tens of thousands of ex-Muslims across the world declared their apostasy, many gathering courage from the brave and often poignant words of others.\nHis words speak directly to the impetus behind Namazie\u2019s movement, and behind the founding of the CEMB, which, according to its website, was formed \u201cin order to break the taboo that comes with renouncing Islam.\u201d That taboo is as powerful as it is perverse: For Muslims, leaving the faith is punishable by death.\nThis is of greater importance in the Muslim world than in the West where, for people like Akhtar, it is possible to consider oneself a practicing Muslim while maintaining Western ideas. That ability, in fact, is allowing many Western Muslims to start trying to change the narrative \u2014 one that, until now, has largely been led by conservative Islamic organizations such as the Council for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and by Muslim fundamentalists. Earlier this month, M. Zuhdi Jasser, founder of the American-Islamic Forum for Democracy, established the Muslim Reform Movement in concert with 13 other practicing Muslims, including activist Asra Nomani and Farahnaz Ispahani, a former member of the Pakistani Parliament. The group published a nine-point \u201cdeclaration,\u201d confirming their shared belief in free speech, freedom of religion, equal rights, and condemning violent jihad.\nYet even for Muslims in the West, there are risks. Some are excommunicated from their families. Others are attacked by Muslims in their communities, either physically, verbally, or emotionally. When Namazie spoke at Goldsmiths, University of London on November 30 at the invitation of its Atheist, Secularist, and Humanist Society, for instance, the school\u2019s Islamic Society (ISOC) repeatedly disrupted. Making matters worse, Goldsmiths\u2019 LGBT and feminist societies defended the Islamic Society\u2019s actions.\nNever mind that the ISOC supports the wearing of burqas and other garments that many claim oppress women. Never mind that Namazie, a woman, was bullied by (mostly male) Muslims in the audience. Never mind that the Islamic Society itself has invited speakers who defend jihadists, including Zara Faris, who frequently refers to events like 9/11 as \u201cSo-called \u2018Muslim\u2019 terrorist attacks.'\u201d Never mind its support for the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement against Israel. Never mind that the Society accused Namazie of depriving its members their right to free speech in their efforts to protest against her, but failed to see an assault on free speech in their own efforts to silence her.\nGoldsmiths notwithstanding, the response to #ExMuslimBecause suggests that Warraq may be right. If so, this would be an important step in the fight against Islamic extremism, because only if we can talk about the subject openly and frankly, debating the issue from all angles with the freedom that Western, enlightened culture holds as its core value, can we ever defeat those who would take that freedom from us."}
{"idx": "25586", "prompt": "Continue the following text: \"In teaching as in few other fields,\" writes Rosetta Marantz Cohen in her introduction to A Lifetime of Teaching: Portraits of Five Veteran High School Teachers, \"the life makes itself manifest in every aspect of the work.\" To understand the careers of devoted and successful teachers, Ms. Cohen followed five exemplary yet quite different high-school teachers, profiling each in intimate, day-in-the-classroom detail. One of the teachers, Carl Brenner, is a 28-year veteran of Alamos Heights High School in San Antonio and the author of four popular mathematics texts. In his personal and low-key, yet academically demanding style, Mr. Brenner helps prove a central thesis of the book: that it is ultimately the teacher, not the method, that forms the cornerstone of a student's educational experience.\nThe world of [Carl] Brenner's classroom is an uncomplicated world, where only friendly competition exists and all errors can be remedied. \"Tests are called 'games' in my class,\" he says, \"and ungraded homework is called 'tests.' That way no one gets too nervous.\" If a student fails a test, he can copy the correct answers off the blackboard during the post-test review, and the old score will automatically be averaged in with an 80 percent. \"That way, it is rare for someone who works with honest effort and is interested in understanding his mistakes to fail,\" Carl says.\nOne senses how difficult it is for Brenner to disappoint or punish a student, no matter how much punishment may be deserved. When an apologetic 9th grader shows up after skipping out on one of Carl's retests, the following conversation takes place.\nCarl: \"You had an appointment, and you skipped out.\"\nBoy: \"Yeah. Yeah, I did.\"\nCarl: \"What's my policy for skipping?\"\nBoy: \"You get a zero?\"\nBoy (crestfallen): \"That's bad. A zero is bad.\"\nCarl: \"Well, if you take the test home and do it well, I'll take that into consideration .\"\nBoy: \"But can I get an A on it?\"\nCarl: \"I reserve the right to change your grade, for better or worse, but probably for better.\"\nWhen I ask Carl if he has a theory about discipline he says, \"I do have a theory. You just wouldn't know it because it doesn't work. My theory is that students should be quiet while I teach.\" It's doubtful, though, that he means this. The success of Carl's teaching style seems contingent on a certain amount of steady noise, on questions called from the back of the room, on bad jokes eliciting groans. Every class, from first-period algebra to last-period calculus, has its own noise games, contrived by Carl and woven into the fabric of the curriculum.\nOne class collects quarters from Carl for errors found in the textbook. Loose change lines the upper blackboard, and students are often exclaiming over mistaken errors. In another class, Carl collects a nickel from every student, having won a bet that at least one of them would repeat \"the same, dumb mistake\" on a particular test question. The money, in both cases, will go for an ice-cream party at the end of the year. In general, any extended period of seriousness is punctuated by a moment of raucousness or foolishness, which Carl himself seems to enjoy as much, if not more than, the students he is entertaining.\nThere have been classes, Brenner admits"}

Image source: Getty Images.\nInvestors can often find stock market winners by looking for companies that generate a lot of cash on a consistent basis. A strong free cash flow \u2013 which is the cash that a company generates from its operations that is left over after it makes necessary investments in its business \u2013 enables a company to pay dividends, buy back shares of its stock, and grow the business via acquisitions and in other ways.\nHaving plenty of cash coming in is important for all companies, but especially ones involved in technology, where the ability to invest in innovation and fast growth is especially critical.\nThere's no single factor that qualifies a company as a \"cash cow,\" but such companies will generally have a high free cash margin, which is the percentage of revenue converted into cash, and/or a high cash return on invested capital, which reflects how good a company is at turning capital into cash and is calculated by dividing free cash flow by invested capital.\nTwo companies that fit the bill are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).\nApple's cash flow soared upon the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Image source: Apple.\nApple's name is practically synonymous with \"cash cow,\" which is largely due to the immense popularity of the iPhone. Over the 12 months through its most recent fiscal fourth quarter, the tech superstar generated free cash flow of $52.28 billion on revenue of $215.65 billion, which equates to a cash margin of 24.2%.\nApple's cash return on invested capital is likewise standout, clocking in at 25.8%. While this is still a very impressive number, it has come down over the last year. This probably reflects to some degree that it often simply gets more difficult to generate higher and higher returns on invested capital as a company's cash stash builds up. However, more meaningfully, it also no doubt reflects Apple's declining free cash flow due to declining sales of the iPhone.\nAAPL Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts.\nOver the last few quarters, Apple's year-over-year revenue has declined because quarterly year-over-year sales of the iPhone have declined, as the iconic smartphone accounts for about two-thirds of the company's top line.

He doesn't say when we could see a release to the public, however.\nThe director is also hoping to improve things in the future to ensure that Android users are treated as well as iPhone and iPad users.\nThe end goal, it seems, is to ensure Sky is well prepared for the next major Android OS release, so customers don't suffer from the same delays as previous releases in terms of having Sky Go supported on the new OS.\nWith lots happening in the next couple of months in terms of device releases and the possibility of a new OS from Android and of course Apple, we'll have to wait to see if those promises are dreams or reality."}

For Ganga, Olatunde Timothy, Alamgir Sanpui, PC Lalnhming Thanga and Surojit Duloi put some effort to cruise into the FCI citadel.

{"idx": "25608", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Did Netscape jump the gun with new browser?\nLong heckled for being late to market with its new browser, Netscape Communications is now the target of critics who say the company jumped the gun in releasing the browser this month.\nNetscape fans breathed a sigh of relief two weeks ago with the official launch of Netscape's first major browser release in more than two years. The browser's 32-month gestation, marked by regularly revised due dates, gave what many saw as a critical advantage to rival Microsoft in establishing its dominance of the browser market.\nBut some supporters say problems with the release indicate that Netscape should have waited until its open-source group, Mozilla.org, released its own version 1.0 browser, which isn't due for another five months.\n\"Netscape 6 still plays like beta software,\" said Glenn Davis, a co-founder of the Web Standards Project (WaSP) and an independent Web publisher. \"The results I've had using it seem to indicate that it's just not quite finished. I'd have much rather seen them wait until the Mozilla project had their 1.0 version complete instead of rushing it out the door.\n\"Sure, we needed something new from Netscape--after all, their 4.0 browsers have become Web antiques--but there are still far too many bugs evident.\"\nIn an official statement released Thursday, WaSP lauded the browser's standards support but acknowledged its technical problems, calling Netscape 6 \"essentially a 1.0 software release.\"\nNetscape 6 also came under fire in postings to newsgroups, including \"netscape.public.general,\" and other public forums, where critics complained about issues ranging from the browser's speed and stability to its compatibility with various Web technologies and the size of its download.\nNetscape defended the timing and quality of the release.\n\"Netscape 6 represents a quantum leap forward in convenience, customizability, Web standards support and user privacy protection,\" Michael La Guardia, director of product marketing at Netscape, wrote in an email interview. \"We have answered a burning need for our users by putting it out in the marketplace.\"\nThe controversy over the release of Netscape 6 underscores the difficulty of Netscape's position. Because Netscape 6 was written from scratch, rather than molded from the proprietary 4.x code, the new product is, as critics point out, akin to a version 1.0 release.\nOn the other hand, Netscape faces the competitive pressures of a maturing browser market that Microsoft has by most accounts overtaken. That has led to sometimes shrill demands for speedy delivery, voiced by standards advocates and others who fear a one-browser Web.\nSome of the finished browser's critics also lambasted Netscape for its delays, leading the company's defenders to see it as damned it if does and damned if it doesn't.\n\"Why are you taking forever to deliver a usable browser?\" the WaSP asked in a July open letter to Netscape. \"If you genuinely realized it would take two years to replace Netscape 4, we wish you would have told us. No market, let alone the Internet, can stand still that long.\"\nThe company said it is paying close attention to consumers' reactions, which it said have been mostly positive.\n\"Netscape is closely monitoring feedback to Netscape 6,\" said a company representative. \"Thus far, the overwhelming response to the product from consumers and reviewers has been positive, and the downloads of the product have exceeded our expectations.\"\nThe release of Netscape 6 marked the culmination"}

Maybe you're interested in making cheese from goat's milk? Or perhaps letting come what may - being the assistant to an eccentric kibbutznik's experiment or mindless work on the production line. A majority of Israeli kibbutzim are now privatized, leaving no opportunities for foreign volunteers to come and work. Despite the fact that fewer jobs are on offer, managers at the Kibbutz Program Center, the national center that coordinates volunteer experiences in Israel, are seeing a surge of volunteers from all over the world this year. There is even a waiting list. And today it's not just for the globetrotting hippy: \"It's a great experience for young people, who come to Israel for over half a year,\" says Rina Keren, manager of volunteers at the center. \"Of course there are students in the field of agriculture who come; there are also the ones who are specifically looking for the real organic farms too,\" she says. Like at Kibbutz Lotan, the only true organic kibbutz in Israel. \"But most of the people are not coming for something special - just a unique way to visit and get to know Israel,\" says Keren. With an abundance of kibbutz volunteers from all over the world - the United States, Europe (England and Germany especially), South Africa and Korea, the kibbutz volunteer experience is also an enjoyable international one, Keren points out. Today, about 30 kibbutzim are accepting volunteers and this past year some 500 people submitted applications. In the tracks of Dylan and Seinfeld Bob Dylan did it. So did Jerry Seinfeld who was only 17 when he came to the kibbutz.

But anyone who has ever lived or volunteered on a kibbutz would know, there is really no need for money. Despite privatization, the kibbutz is still largely a communal space, where services such as laundry and entertainment come as part of the package. A home away from home \"It's a great idea that helped make the kibbutz and Israel itself a home away from home,\" says Rebecca Fiala who volunteered at Kibbutz Lotan in the Arava. In a local newspaper she said, \"I felt as if I could finally break through the tourist route and meet the people, as well as know that I always have a place to stay.\" Finding a great kibbutz is often a matter of luck. And while the volunteers have come and gone over the years (there are those who do stay and marry Israelis), to further enhance the experience, some kibbutzim organize special trips to further enrich their volunteers' time in Israel. Most volunteers, at the end of their trip, usually agree that their short time on a kibbutz leaves them wanting more. This article first appeared, in its original version, in Israel21c."}

I'm just letting you know that,\" Seavey said at a press conference after the race, his statement met by applause in the crowded building near the finish line.\nIn 4-degree temperatures Tuesday, Seavey pulled under the burled arch on Nome's snowy Front Street with a team of 11 dogs, led by 4-year-old Pilot and 5-year-old Crisp.\nCrowds lined the street, cheering on the team and taking photographs. One person held a sign that read, \"Old guys rule.\"\nSeavey, in a puffy, red parka with a thick ruff, got off his sled and walked to the front of his team, praising the sled dogs along the way.\n\"Good dogs,\" he told them, icicles stuck to his mustache. \"Good dogs.\"\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" Mitch Seavey said of his team's speed throughout the race, which started March 6, in Fairbanks, and featured a temperature swing of at least 70 degrees, with lows reaching 40 and 50 below in its early days.\nA month before the Iditarod began, race officials said they planned to move the official start north, from Willow to Fairbanks. The course out of Fairbanks includes more running on frozen rivers in comparison to the Willow route that sends mushers over the Alaska Range.\nBut, Seavey said he didn't know if the course necessarily contributed to the fast race.\n\"I'm not sure whether it's slower to go a couple hundred miles on the Yukon at 50 below or take a little hop over the Alaska Range,\" he said. Still, he gave the trail the grade of \"A-minus.\"\nThroughout much of the 1,000-mile course, Seavey's team held its speed, allowing him to pull away from the other frontrunners.\n\"They love speed,\" Seavey said of his sled dogs. \"I think it frustrated them to go too slow, so I just let 'em roll. It was scary because I've never gone that far that fast ever, but that's what they wanted to do and maybe it's a new chapter.\"\nSeavey's team recorded runs that averaged 10 and 11 mph between some checkpoints and the separation he built over other racers gave him the flexibility to bank generous rest for his dogs, and himself, as they moved up the Norton Sound coast in the race's final days.\n\"They only know one thing and that's 9.5 to 10 mph and they hit their feet, and they hit their speed and that's what they do.

The move threatens to damage already fragile relations between Germany and Poland.\nThere is widespread resistance to the idea that Germans too could have been victims of World War II. So it comes as no surprise that the decision by a group of Germans to file compensation for property they lost when they or their relatives were forcibly expelled from Poland after World War II is extremely controversial.\nRudi Pawelka, head of the supervisory board of the Prussian Trust. The organization wants compensation for Germans expelled from Poland after World War II.\nOn Friday the Prussian Trust (Preussische Treuhand), a group representing post-1945 German expellees from Eastern Europe, revealed that it had filed 23 individual claims against Poland with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The group has said it intends to increase this number to around 50.\nThe move by the D\u00fcsseldorf-based group has been sharply criticized in Germany, and it risks harming German-Polish relations, which have been strained in recent months.\nGesine Schwan, the German government's coordinator for relations with Poland, said there needed to be a clear sign that Germany opposed the Prussian Trust and that the authorities in Poland shouldn't pay too much attention to the organization. \"I expect other politically relevant forces will distance themselves from this action,\" she told the Berliner Zeitung Saturday.\nMarkus Meckel, a foreign policy spokesman for the junior coalition partners the Social Democrats (SPD), said the government should withhold all support for the action. \"The government's position is clear,\" he said. \"It opposes this claim, because it is poisonous for the German-Polish reconciliation process.\"\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and her predecessor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der had repeatedly attempted to reassure the Poles, saying the German government would not lodge any claim against Poland for compensation -- although it could not stop individuals or organizations from doing so. In 2004, a joint Polish-German commission ruled that there was no legal foundation for claims by Germans regarding property in Poland.\nNevertheless, the Poles were far from happy with the Prussian Trust's move. President Lech Kaczynski said on Friday that, \"Such legal proceedings would have a devastating influence on the relations between two European states.\" On Saturday his twin brother Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski went one step further, saying the move marked Germany's return to nationalist ideology. \"We observe in Germany a process deeper than a simple attitude of one government or another,\" he told the newspaper Rzeczpospolita. \"It's a re-nationalization of politics, an exceptionally radical calling into question of historical judgements.\"\nPolish Foreign Minister Anna Fotya said the complaint \"may adversely affect Polish-German dialogue, and in the long run, could disrupt Polish-German relations.\" Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, a former foreign minister of Poland, told the newspaper Rzeczpospolita, \"If the Germans want money for the property they lost, they should address their demands to the US, Britain and the heirs of the Soviet Union,\" referring to the Allied powers who met in Potsdam in 1945 to carve up post-war Europe.\nFor a number of years, the main group representing the refugees, the Federation of Expellees, has been attempting to construct a 'Center Against Expulsion' in Germany to commemorate the forced migration.

Now, three years into the Southeast Asian country&apos;s bumpy transition to democracy, smartphones and computer shops are common, but so are phone stands and typists. Even telegrams have not quite made their exit.\nAung Myint says his work is steady enough, but a far cry from the days of military rule, when he spent most of his time typing up authors&apos; novels for submission to the now-defunct censorship board. He rarely broke for lunch back then, often working by candlelight well after shops were shuttered and businessmen had long gone home.\nHow does the 67-year-old manage to keep going as his country belatedly joins the computer age?

It serves as a journey through the mind and influences of Presley and is a solid listen for fans of lo-fi psychedelic rock.\nWhite Fence is not a new album from Tim Presley's solo project but a reissue of the very first White Fence album, originally released in 2010. Presley has been a member of the bands Darker My Love as well as the Strange Boys and recorded a collaboration album with Ty Segall, 2012's essential Hair as Ty Segall & White Fence. Presley records prolifically as White Fence, having recorded four White Fence records in as many years. He makes warped lo-fi psych pop songs that can go anywhere and everywhere. The fidelity changes from song to song, sometimes even during a song. A lot it sounds vaguely like Syd Barrett channeling Northwest garage rock legends, The Sonics. Another sonic reference point would be early Ariel Pink records, if Pink had an obsession with '60s psychedelic rock instead of '70s AM pop. The songs also have a relaxed, meandering quality, almost like brief thought bubbles and ideas that fade in to being for a few moments with a pretty melody and offbeat instrumentation before stopping abruptly after a minute or two.\nThis is the work of a solitary man or rather a solitary alien transmitting rock songs from a parallel dimension. Mr. Adams kicks the album off with harmonized, reverbed, extremely laidback vocals that sound like they're floating through the air as opposed to actually being sung. The song melts in to a drum break that goes right in to the \"Who Feels Right\" where guitars provide a soft backdrop that roar in to a psychedelic solo. \"Slaughter on Sunset Strip\" is a Rubber Soul-era McCartney song filtered through a chillwave haze and played with first take chops before coming to a sudden end. \"I'll Follow You\" is a soft acoustic track propelled by a shaker with a Schoenhut toy piano that fades in and out of the background throughout the song. Most of these songs sound like brief daydreams that flow gently before either fading in to the next track or ending abruptly. They remind me of spacing out in class back when I was in grade school before my teacher called my name and tersely forced my mind back to reality. The extremely loud \"Baxter Corner\" follows the pretty \"Sara Snow\" with the sound of Syd Barrett channeling Damaged-era Black Flag.\nAlthough White Fence is 16 songs, most of them are short and the whole thing goes by quickly. Not every song here is worth the cut though and \"The Gallery\" and \"Sick Doctor Blues\" just kind of warble their way forward without any real melodies to grasp on to. The album ends with the best song on the record, \"Be Right Too\" and serves as an awesome sign of the songwriting chops that Presley has continued to develop with each successive White Fence album. Interestingly enough, it is also the best sounding, as if Presley had finally figured how to properly use his four-track. These songs take repeated listens to sink in but once they do, Presley's melodic gifts and penchant for interesting instrumentation begin to shine through. The album is spotty and not every song is a winner but the good definitely outshines the bad and nothing overstays its"}

The report was authored by Mark Hamrick, the senior economic analyst of personal finance at the advisory firm Bankrate.com.\nWhile both groups cited a market decline as a key risk to the economy, millennials viewed the concern as the second-biggest risk to the US economy over the next six months. Older Americans weren't as worried, ranking a stock-market sell-off as their fourth-biggest concern \u2014 behind politics, terrorism, and developments overseas.\nBoth groups cited the \"political environment in Washington\" politics as the No. 1 threat to the economy, with more than 40% of both cohorts naming it their top concern. Surprisingly, 49% of Republicans felt Washington was the biggest risk, despite the Trump presidency, with 45% of Democrats similarly concerned.\n\"One can imagine these concerns reflect their lack of confidence in officials' ability or willingness to resolve problems,\" Hamrick said, adding that concern about Washington politics had increased among all cohorts surveyed over the past few years.\nFifteen percent of millennials responded that stock markets presented the top risk to the economy, while only 11% of Americans overall feared that was the case. The disparity may be driven by the fact that older Americans likely have more discretionary savings to invest during a market decline, whereas millennials may fear such an environment could dampen their job prospects.\nMany millennials joined the workforce during the global financial crisis and could be particularly sensitive about market volatility spilling over into the real economy. In addition, the fragile economic recovery through most of the decade may leave younger workers less secure in their jobs. \"We've seen for some time that millennials have been more cautious,\" Hamrick told Business Insider.\nDespite the risks to the overall economy, Americans do not appear to be changing their spending habits, the study found. Just 25% of those who identified a threat to the economy are spending less, according to the study.\n\"With the economic expansion set to become a decade-old this summer, more Americans should be focused on paying down debt and saving more both for retirement and for emergencies,\" Hamrick said.\nWhile Hamrick cited a declining market as an opportunity for millennials to invest at lower valuations, he also said that student-loan burdens may also be playing a role. An additional Bankrate.com study published in February found that millennials continue to be stretched by student-loan debt, which now exceeds $1.5 trillion in the US and has surpassed both auto-loan and credit-card debt.\nAccording to the study, more than 30% of Americans say they have or have had student-loan debt stemming from their own education. Of these respondents, 23% report delaying homeownership, while nearly 10% have even cited student-loan burdens as a factor in their decision to marry or have children.\n\"There's a huge toll being taken on individuals and the U.S. economy from the growing burden of student loan debt,\" Hamrick said."}

Many of the comments I was posting this week came from a guy I met in the hotel bar, a consultant who teaches a seminar called \u201cCreating the Benefit Free Workplace; Labor in the era of Mandated Government Benefits for Employees.\u201d His seminar is so popular that he ran it seven times instead of his scheduled one event, as every franchisee was required to take the class.\ufffd This guy is about business, not politics, but he told me a few things I didn\u2019t know. First, I was not aware that many of the major chain stores and restaurants that you see around town are not \u201ccompany stores\u201d any more, but franchised stores. Some of our largest brand names are quickly becoming nothing but franchise management, as they outsource distribution, trucking and retail to other people. Second, the margin of profit for a franchisee has never been lower. Third, based on that narrow margin, complying with the Obamatax would simply put hundreds if not thousands of franchisees out of business, which would likely leave a substantial part of the United States without basic retail and food services. He was wondering out loud why it seems that no one in the White House seems to grasp the basic point that the Obamatax will fall most heavily not on the mom and pop small business, but rather on the small franchisee who plunked his or her entire life savings into a franchised big box store with a 2 percent profit margin. He was also pointing out a response to a comment someone made on the blog\u2013that public companies have investors who won\u2019t tolerate this kind of behavior\u2013the de-employing of America. He was noting that two major public companies, Dell and Barnes & Noble, have already been encountering a buy out of the retail operations, which would separate those operations from other business modalities, getting rid of the pesky investor concern about the fate of the employees. He rattled off the name of a dozen other publicly traded operations that are also either trying to get delisted or who are moving to a franchise model to avoid Obamatax. Obama is reshaping insurance, this consultant said, by creating insurance exchanges which will still be out of the reach of most Americans, and which will eventually and ultimately put half the country below the poverty line and on to medicare.\ufffd His last point is that the argument that Obamacare will work as well as Romneycare avoids a major problem in that reasoning. \u201cLook around,\u201d he said to me \u201cdoes this place look like Massachusetts?\u201d The answer is no. I am always struck by the growing disparity between Massachusetts and the rest of the United States, and how much it seems like\ufffd a different country, and how absolutely clueless people here are about what is going on in the rest of America.

The trustee of the trust would be legally bound to ensure that the designated amounts are used to cover these expenses.\nIf you anticipate that your beneficiaries will owe estate and income tax on the amounts that they inherit, you might be able to minimize these taxes by using tax-efficient strategies. For instance, you could leave taxable assets to charities if charities are included in your list of beneficiaries, and leave your tax-free assets, such as Roth retirement accounts, life insurance and after-tax savings, to your other beneficiaries.\nYour beneficiaries can lose a significant amount of the taxable assets that they inherit to estate and income taxes. This can be offset with the proceeds from life insurance.\nFor instance, if your estate planner estimates that your beneficiary will owe $500,000 in estate and income tax, you can purchase a life insurance plan for that amount and name the affected party as the beneficiary. Since life-insurance proceeds paid to your beneficiaries are tax-free, the entire $500,000 would be available to pay the taxes owed.\nAn estate planning attorney who can help with the designing and creation of trusts and wills, as well as ensuring that your estate plan meets federal and state requirements. It is often best to work with a local attorney as he/she is more likely to be familiar with the laws of the area in which you reside.\nA tax professional that can help to minimize the amount of income taxes that your beneficiaries would pay on the amounts they inherit.\nA financial advisor can help you to design a suitable investment portfolio for your assets. When choosing a financial advisor, ensure that he/she is knowledgeable about the estate planning needs and rules for retirement accounts.\nIf you are working with a team, make sure that they routinely communicate with each other, so that they are all aware of developments and changes. If you are unsure about whether your estate is large enough to need the services of a team, interview a few of these professionals on a complimentary consultation basis, so as to get an insight into when their services would be necessary."}

If the film is a hit, maybe they could immediately start developing an X-Force film that would finally give us the first live-action version of Cable.

There\u2019s a 17% gulf between small and mid-size companies with female board representation and those without.\nNet income growth for companies guided in part by women has averaged 14%, compared to 10% for those with no female board representation.

That\u2019s up from 73% of companies with at least one female director in 2005.

The Seahawks\u2019 second-year defensive end went to Lowe\u2019s this week to buy home supplies, and left with a neon yellow construction vest and a white hard hat instead. He bought the set because he knew it would match his lime green sneakers.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only reason.\nThe 6-foot-4, 295-pound Jackson did just that on Thursday, to the tune of three tackles and one tackle for loss in the Seahawks\u2019 30-19 defeat to the Oakland Raiders. Quinton Jefferson, who Jackson continues to battle at the strong side defensive end position, added two tackles in defeat.\n\u201cI took my game up a notch because I have to,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWith Quinton in here, me and Q are pushing each other \u2013 two guys from Pittsburgh who know each other, longtime friends. But when it comes to football we\u2019re playing the same position. We\u2019re battling for the same spot, and we\u2019ve got guys like Dion (Jordan) who will be back and he\u2019s going to be in the mix.\nThat\u2019s because Saturday is cut-down day for the Seahawks and the rest of the NFL, meaning that each organization must trim its roster from 90 to 53 players by 1 p.m. Jackson \u2013 who made 11 tackles in 12 games with the Seahawks last season \u2013 is likely safe, especially considering Jordan\u2019s ongoing injury situation.\nStill, the third-year pro \u2013 who went undrafted in 2016 and began his career with the aforementioned Oakland Raiders \u2013 understands what it feels like to teeter on the fringe of a roster spot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling you really can\u2019t explain, man,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep gut feeling \u2013 uncertainty. It\u2019s terrible. From a guy like me who has made a cut and has also been cut, this time around I\u2019m a lot more level-headed and a lot more confident in my play, especially because of what I\u2019ve done. So I\u2019m just going into this with a clear mind, knowing I gave them everything I could. I think it\u2019ll play out the way that I want it to.\nAustin Calitro is another expert. The second-year linebacker \u2013 who finished second on the Seahawks with five tackles and a sack on Thursday \u2013 bounced around four different NFL rosters last season. It appears he may stick in Seattle, however, as Calitro has solidified himself as a competent middle linebacker backup to all-pro veteran Bobby Wagner.\n\u201cBobby and K.J.

Moore pulled together just $3 million for his bid. The gap let Sanford stay on television with ads throughout the summer to tell voters about himself and defining the issues.

They had to move 72 yards in 2 minutes 10 seconds to win.\nWithin 50 seconds, they had reached the Giants' 10-yard line, where they had third down and 4 to go. They came out of the huddle in a shotgun formation, and the play would obviously be a pass.\nInstead, they called a trap draw, and Herschel Walker, in his National Football League debut, bolted up the middle for the touchdown that won the game for the Cowboys, 31-28. Gary Reasons, the Giants' inside linebacker, got a hand on him, but Walker kept exploding to the end zone.\n''We run the same play,'' said Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants.\nThe winning touchdown, as dramatic as it was, was only made possible by the first and third plays of that drive.\nThe first play was a 23-yard pass from Danny White to Walker on which Walker broke four arm tackles. Next, a screen pass from White to Walker lost 2 yards. Then White passed 35 yards to Tony Hill, who left his defender, Elvis Patterson, turning left while he turned right. It was Patterson's one bad coverage of the game.\nWalker, previously a record-breaking runner for the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League, joined the Cowboys four weeks ago as a $1 million-a-year bonanza. He is still learning the system, and he played only occasionally in the first half, mostly as a receiver.\nTony Dorsett is still the Cowboys' No. 1 tailback. But he sprained his left ankle in the first half, and when it became swollen he sat out the second half. So Walker found himself playing full time, and he succeeded with a story-book finish."}

Early in an election year in which both parties seem ready to make guns a political issue, Lynch called Obama's moves \"well-reasoned measures, well within existing legal authorities, built on work that's already underway.\"\nThe modest steps Obama announced two weeks ago were immediately attacked by a top Republican, who said the measures were the latest of the president's actions infringing on the constitutional right to own guns and exceeding his executive branch powers.\n\"The department is on notice,\" Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, told Lynch. \"This subcommittee will have no part in undermining the Constitution and the rights that it protects.\"\nSome GOP senators on the panel mixed distaste for Obama's unilateral moves with an openness to some of the details. That included his proposal to boost the number of FBI personnel who process background checks so the system can operate 24 hours daily instead of its current 17 hours.\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., in whose state the background check system is based, said some of Obama's proposals were \"political messaging\" but expressed support for buttressing the \"overstressed\" system.\nBacked by the National Rifle Association, the GOP-led Congress is all but certain to take no action curbing firearms this year. But the gulf between Lynch and Shelby underscored that the issue will be part of the presidential and congressional campaigns.\nAlready, Democratic presidential candidates have backed Obama's moves while GOP contenders have lambasted them as wilting gun rights and abusing his presidential powers. House Republicans have said they will create a task force to study \"executive overreach\" by Obama and other presidents.\nShelby, who faces a conservative challenger in his March 1 Senate GOP primary, criticized Obama's response to recent mass shootings, including last month's killing of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple that authorities say had been radicalized. Shelby said that instead of tightening screening for potentially violent immigrants or addressing \"our law enforcement's failures,\" Obama has instead resorted to \"grandstanding and engaging in anti-gun theatrics.\"\nLynch said the actions were appropriate.\n\"As the list of tragedies involving firearms has grown, so has the American people's belief that we must do more to stem the tide of gun violence, and this administration is committed to doing our part,\" she said.\nObama's actions include guidance on who the government will consider \"in the business\" of selling firearms \u2014 a phrase used to describe which dealers must obtain federal licenses and conduct background checks on buyers. Even those selling a few guns online or at gun shows can be required to get licenses and perform background checks, the administration said.\nOther steps include hiring 230 more FBI background check examiners; adding 200 agents to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; boosting federal research on gun safety technology and asking Congress for $500 million to improve mental health programs.\nGun violence has flared anew as a political issue following the"}

The boy was skiing near the La Plagne ski resort in the French Alps with seven other skiers, his father among them, on Wednesday, December 26, when an avalanche occurred. He is said to have been dragged at least 100 meters (110 yards). Rescue workers were immediately sent to the location of the avalanche in a helicopter in an effort to save the boy. The helicopter had to fly at 2,400 meters (7,875 feet) altitude. Eventually, he was discovered alive by a sniffer dog that was aiding in the search.\nThe rescuers are considering the boy\u2019s survival a \u201cmiracle,\u201d as most people aren\u2019t able to survive being buried in snow for longer than 15 minutes. Adding to the miracle was that the boy was not even wearing an avalanche detector, which has been known to save lives in the past. According to REI, many skiers now wear avalanche transceivers that can track where a person is if they are lost beneath the snow. The faster a person is found in an avalanche, the higher chance they have to survive. Most avalanche victims die due to asphyxiation. The boy only survived due to his airways not being blocked by snow.\nA total of 118 people have been swept away by fallen snow this skiing season, resulting in 36 deaths. However, the boy in this instance only suffered a broken leg. According to Metro, the boy was slightly ahead of the others when skiing and was therefore the only one caught up in the avalanche. Authorities were notified about the missing boy, who is reportedly from London, at around 1:50 p.m. local time. The boy\u2019s group was said to be skiing off-piste, even though they did not have the proper equipment for it."}

The 100 new courses, 30 new specializations, and two public health-focused master\u2019s degrees will provide learners with the skills they need to enter high demand jobs, particularly related to Health Informatics, Healthcare Management, and Public Health.\nThe healthcare industry\u2014and the world\u2014is undergoing a fundamental shift. Changes in demographic factors, an aging world population, an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, and a resurgence of untreatable infectious diseases, mean that traditional healthcare systems are under significant pressure to provide costly care to a growing number of people. At the same time, new opportunities for personalized care driven by genetics, genomics, immunotherapy, and integrative therapies are beginning to change the skills required to power the modern health system.\nWith this rapidly growing need for health services, the demand for workers in the healthcare sector is already outpacing other industries and expected to skyrocket in the coming decade. McKinsey estimates that healthcare-related jobs could grow by 80 million to 130 million by 2030 globally. These changes will create demand across a broad range of occupations, including Informatics Nurse Specialists, Clinical Analysts, Bioinformatics Scientists, Hospital Administrators, NGO Workers, Researchers, Community Health Coordinators, Policymakers, Home Health Aides, Personal Care Aides, and Nursing Assistants in many countries.\nCoursera and top-ranked partners in health\u2014including Columbia University, Emory University, Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University, University of Colorado, University of Michigan and University of Minnesota\u2014are committed to making high-quality content and healthcare education more widely accessible. The new portfolio of content which includes Specializations focused on Biostatistics, Population Health Management, Nursing Informatics, and Social Welfare Policy is designed to develop or supplement knowledge for those already working in the healthcare space or to provide a path to a career in healthcare.\nCoursera has a long history of democratizing access to education. It has equipped millions around the world with the knowledge and skills required to enter sought-after careers in business, technology, and data science. By making cutting-edge health education accessible, Coursera and top-ranked health institutions are once again acting on a shared commitment of equipping people around the world with skills they need to advance their careers and impact their communities.\nThe new Specializations will roll-out through 2019 and will be available for a subscription range of $39 to $79 per month.

At SMA, fun means more flexible work hours, a fitness centre, and summer and Christmas parties.

But a major new scandal involving top government figures has shocked even the most jaded Kenyans.\nLast month, a leading Kenyan newspaper published a detailed account by the country's former anticorruption czar of his investigation into millions of dollars in government security contracts to a company called Anglo Leasing and Finance\u2014which, he found, never existed.\nThe report describes how the company was a shell for some key members of President Mwai Kibaki's government. Their dealings with crooked businessmen, along with tales of blackmail, taped conversations and death threats, have captivated Kenya in recent weeks and further undermined Kibaki's struggling administration.\nThe Cabinet ministers behind the scandal have been dropped, and on Friday hundreds marched in a demonstration in central Nairobi calling for the ouster of the vice president, Moody Awori, who also was involved. This comes two months after Kibaki reorganized the Cabinet when his bid to expand presidential powers through a new constitution was soundly rejected in a nationwide referendum.\n\"Kibaki has not lived up to his pledge\u2014he has let us down.\"\nThe man at the center of the storm is John Githongo, whom Kibaki appointed to the post of anticorruption czar shortly after he was elected. A former journalist and head of Transparency International's Kenya office, Githongo began investigating the suspicious Anglo Leasing contracts in 2004.\nGithongo found that Cabinet officials had arranged for the company to be awarded a $40 million contract to produce tamperproof passports. A separate parliamentary probe found it also had a deal to build a $600 million forensics laboratory.\nGithongo's investigation was ongoing last January when he resigned his post and fled to exile in Britain. Colleagues at the time said he had made powerful enemies and felt his life was threatened.\nIn November, Githongo sent a report to Kibaki on Anglo Leasing, which was published by newspapers last month. In it he said officials told him the stolen money was to be used for political campaigns and warned him to back off his investigation.\nGithongo secretly taped many of these conversations. In a tape played for the BBC this month, Kiraitu Murungi, then the justice minister, is heard telling him that if he were to back off, a large loan that his father owed to a prominent businessman might be forgiven.\nMurungi resigned on Feb. 13. Two other Kibaki allies accused of blocking Githongo's investigation\u2014finance minister David Mwiraria and former national security minister Chris Murungaru\u2014also have been dropped.\nIn the middle of it all is Kibaki, 74. Githongo wrote in his report that he briefed Kibaki several times during his investigation, but the president took little action.\nFor now, however, Kibaki hasn't been directly implicated, and observers believe he is unlikely to step down before his term expires next year."}

{"idx": "25691", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: London\u2019s housing crisis is just the most conspicuous aspect of Britain\u2019s collective failure to meet the demands of urban development. We have moved past the predictable production lines of Henry Ford\u2019s day, but our inability to grasp the chaotic genius of the modern market means we are failing to seize the potential prosperity this change brings. Our communication-intensive new economy is built on professional networking and thrives best in large, dense urban clusters. Most of us feel it in our bones that we must join the central networks and that our careers are incompatible with being cut off in provincial or suburban locations.\nAccordingly we spend an increasing proportion of our income on being located centrally. However, prices have increased to a point where many people who otherwise could and should join this productive hub are discouraged, leading to frustration and loss of potential productivity. But it is political interference, especially with regard to housing, that stops urban development functioning properly. When Britain stopped building and started selling social housing the market wasn\u2019t free to pick up the slack.\nLondon\u2019s urban fabric remains incredibly low density compared with cities such as Paris, and our development process imposes severe restrictions. Supply is restricted and prices increased by the planning process, the imposition of space standards and, ironically, via the \u201caffordable housing\u201d system ostensibly crafted to alleviate the crisis.\nThe latter scheme does not deliver homes to the poorest members of society. Rather it is a huge redistribution machine now meant to encompass a full 50% of all new housing supply. Politicians tend to know how to channel resources to the median voters who can make a difference to them. Many of those who pay for these subsidies are less well off than many of those who receive the benefits. Politicians fire rhetoric against the price rises but we can be sure that as long as they remain so empowered they will never allow prices to come down.\nHousing is one of our most essential and cherished commodities. It is rightly one of our biggest markets, but unfortunately one of the most politicised, suffocating under quasi-socialist political interventionism. The loss of prosperity in our whole society is enormous. Not only because of poor housing provision, but because of its stifling impact on all economic activities. That\u2019s why the need for a capitalist revolution is so urgent.\nOpening up the magic of the market would make us all better off, and bring more justice. Current zoning restrictions redistribute wealth and income to homeowners and landowners, and the lack of development imposes a politically engineered wealth inequality.\nEqually important is experimentation with new models of living beyond the stifling space standards. Smaller units, co-living and other new forms should be offered. It should be left to us if we want to trade centrality for size, or whether we mind the number of units sharing a core, or whether we are really bothered by being overlooked, or whether balconies are a necessary ingredient. All these paternalistic handcuffs must be replaced by our choices. What will really protect us is not politicians taking choices away \u2013 that can only make us poorer \u2013 but a lively competition among different suppliers with different products to choose from.\nWhat should be an economic take-off fuelled by technology and urban renaissance has become a struggle on many fronts. The UK\u2019s average annual productivity growth over the past 10 years was just 0.1%. This is a scandal, considering all the progress in science and technology. Of course, the political barriers to urban development are only one part of a larger picture.

Those who rate today a \"7\" or higher and the future an \"8\" or higher are considered to be \"thriving.\" Those who rate today and the future a \"4\" or lower on the scale are considered to be \"suffering.\" \"Net thriving\" is the difference between people who are \"thriving\" and \"suffering\" in a given group. Country data are weighted by their populations to reflect worldwide figures.\nThe global data reveal that workers who believe their companies are hiring new workers are 27 percentage points more likely to be thriving than suffering, nearly double the gap for workers at companies laying workers off (14 point). Those who say their company is not changing the size of its workforce fall about halfway in between, with a 20-point thriving gap.\nPerceptions of whether one's employer is increasing or decreasing the size of its workforce are also related to workers' reported mood. Even among those who believe their employers are laying people off, those reporting only happiness and enjoyment outnumber those reporting only stress and worry (the gap is 25 points). However, this gap grows to 39 points for those who report that their company is hiring new people. Those who report no change in the size of their company's workforce fall in between (with a mood gap of 34), but slightly closer to those who say their employer is hiring.\nAlthough the connection between perceived layoffs and wellbeing shows up in every region of the world, the connection is stronger in Europe and in the Americas than in the rest of the world. Specifically, the net thriving gap between those who think their companies are currently hiring and those who think their companies are currently letting people go is 24 points in Europe and the Americas, which is about twice as large as the comparable gap in Africa and Asia.\nPerhaps those working in Europe or the Americas base their wellbeing more heavily on feelings of job security. Another possibility, though, is that high levels of wellbeing may somehow influence perceived hiring patterns in a more dramatic way in Europe and the Americas than in the rest of the world. A similar, albeit not identical, regional pattern emerges based on mood rather than life evaluation. In the case of mood, the association with perceived job loss is even stronger in the Americas than in Europe, but Africa and Asia now have gaps comparable to that in Europe. The region that stands out most is the former Soviet Union countries, where the gap is five points.\nBecause these data are based on representative samples within countries and are weighted by each country's population, they provide a picture of the large majority of the world's citizens. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the results are not driven exclusively by the trends in a few highly populated countries such as China or India. First, the same trends appear to differing degrees in all five world regions. Second the connection between perceived job loss and wellbeing still shows up in every world region if one weights all countries equally, or if one examines median country scores in each region, rather than weighting by national populations.\nT"}

All project files are common, so customers can work collaboratively, even when different artists are running different platforms on the same job.\nIn addition to the Fusion on Linux announcement, Blackmagic Design is also announcing that Fusion 8.2 is available as a free software download so customers can immediately download the software and use it for real work today. The Fusion 8.2 software is public beta and available on the Blackmagic Design web site free of charge.\nThis free version of Fusion can be used on any commercial production without restriction, however the paid edition of Fusion software, called Fusion 8.2 Studio, provides even more powerful features and is available at the low cost of $995. Fusion Studio customers get unlimited free render nodes and other multi user features. The most exciting aspect of Fusion Studio&apos;s paid license is that there are no ongoing subscription, cloud licensing, maintenance fees or additional render node costs.\nWith full native support of Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, studios can run Fusion projects and workflows in mixed OS environments and easily integrate Fusion in existing studio pipelines using Python and Lua scripting. In addition, Fusion projects can be moved between the Mac, Windows and Linux versions so customers can work on the platform of their choice, or even in studios with mixed platforms.\nFusion has been one of Hollywood&apos;s leading visual effects and motion graphics tools for over 25 years, and has been used on thousands of feature film and television projects, including blockbusters like Thor, Live Die and Repeat, the Hunger Games trilogy, The Martian and more.\nFeaturing a powerful node based interface, Fusion makes it extremely easy to build sophisticated visual effects compositions very quickly. Its massive toolset consists of hundreds of built in tools so customers can pull keys, track objects, rotoscope, retouch images, animate titles, create amazing particle effects and much more, all in a true 3D workspace.\nFusion can also import 3D models, point cloud data, cameras or even entire 3D scenes from Maya, 3ds Max or Lightwave and render them seamlessly with other elements. Deep pixel tools can be used to add volumetric fog, lighting and reflection mapping of rendered objects using world position passes so customers can create amazing atmospheric effects that render in seconds, instead of hours.\nSince acquiring Fusion two years ago, Blackmagic Design engineers have massively updated the Fusion codebase making it easier for new users to learn, while maintaining the consistency and familiar workflow that long time users expect. Customers currently working with older visual effects solutions will find it easy to make the transition to Fusion on Linux.\nFusion 8.2 Studio on Linux also features a free render node license that can be installed on an unlimited number of render nodes. This allows large studios to create massive render farms at no additional cost, dramatically changing the economics of rendering for effects heavy blockbuster films and television shows.\nUnlike other high end visual effects software, there is no per node render \"tax\" with Fusion. When customers using Fusion 8.2 Studio need to meet a deadline and render scenes more quickly, they"}

The most commonly accepted explanation is the nebular hypothesis: Dust grains circling around a parent star collide, the hypothesis goes, and develop into larger objects through a process of accretion. But one reason the hypothesis remains a hypothesis is that it's incredibly hard to observe the phenomena it's trying to explain: We haven't actually been able to witness the birth of another planet from our perch here on this one. We take the evidence we have -- the stuff we can observe -- and reverse-engineer.\nNow, though, researchers claim to have spotted a planet in the first pangs of its birth, and they've shared their findings in a paper [pdf] published in the journal Astrophysical Letters. Relying on pictures captured by a high-resolution infrared camera -- which was linked to the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile -- the team observed what seems to be a planet in the midst of a disk of gas and dust that surrounds its central star, HD 100546 -- a star located in the Milky Way, 335 light years away from Earth. The protoplanet is about as massive as Jupiter, and, like Jupiter, a gas giant.\nThe team believes the new planet is so new that it could be the youngest we've ever observed. While there have been other probable protoplanets that have been contenders for \"youngest planet\" honors -- objects discovered in 2011 and 2012, respectively -- those bodies seem to be further ahead in their development than the one forming near HD 100546. \"They have already cleared a big gap in the disk of their host stars,\" Quanz explains.\nSo if the team's observations hold up, the finding would be one of the first direct observations of the earliest stages of a planet's birth. But: if they hold up. The team, Quanz says, still needs to confirm that the data it gathered actually suggest a forming planet. (Another possible explanation for their observations, he notes, is that the object in question is actually being ejected from its solar system, rather than being born into it -- since data suggest that HD 100546 has another planet orbiting closer to it, which could result in ejection for one of the two.) But if there is a protoplanet out there, we'll have a long time to study it: It would, the researchers note, take tens of thousands of years to mature from its current, infantile state. As Quanz sums it up: \"If we are correct, this is the first time we are seeing a planet forming inside its natal environment.\""}

The investment comes on the heels of news that Wealthfront, another provider of electronically enhanced wealth management services, had raised $64 million in its own later stage round of financing.\nFor Personal Capital, money for its Series D came from the late stage private equity investor Corsair Capital, alongside BBVA Ventures and USAA.\nThe company\u2019s existing investors, IVP, Venrock, and Crosslink Capital, also participated in the big new round.\nThese rounds for Wealthfront and Personal Capital show just how competitive the wealth management market has become and how big the potential market is. While Wealthfront has carved out its stake servicing the newly minted dot-com millionaires of Silicon Valley (and Silicon Alley), Personal Capital has taken a different tack, and tried to reach the mass affluent market of investors with between $100,000 and $2 million in holdings, according to chief executive Bill Harris.\nThe company put its foot in the door with customers not by offering investment management services, but with a financial management tool that Harris says shows the full picture of a customer\u2019s financial health. Beyond any stock portfolio or basket of mutual funds, the Personal Capital tool assesses a person\u2019s cash holdings, debts, and investments to give investors a view of their total financial holdings.\nHarris said capital from the round will be used to roll out additional products and services centered on products like mortgages and other financial tools that customers could expect from a big financial services provider.\nPersonal Capital also differs from the traditional electronic management tools in its use of advisors and technology to service its customers. Over 600,000 families use Personal Capital\u2019s financial management software and services tools to track $100 billion in holdings, although the number of customers using Personal Capital to actually manage their holdings is much smaller.\nThe company\u2019s money management tools are free to use, but customers pay for the advisory and investment services. The company recently launched a private client service to invest money for families with over $1 million in invested assets, and that service now accounts for over a quarter of the company\u2019s business, according to a statement from Jay Shah, Personal Capital\u2019s chief operations officer.\nThe San Francisco-based company has managed to carve out a niche for itself with affluent customers, just as Wealthfront and Betterment tackle the dot-com millennial set and high-end white-collar professionals; while FutureAdvisor and SigFig try to offer up services for the middle class.\n\u201cPersonal Capital is at the intersection of consumer technology and financial services, a sector we believe is poised for continued growth\u201d says Jeremy Schein, a principal with Corsair Capital who will take a seat on the Personal Capital board."}

{"idx": "25724", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: WIDELY reported cases involving ``surrogate mothers,'' and other recent events in our society, have prompted many people to consider more deeply what constitutes motherhood. Such issues, and their implications in human lives, can be deeply disturbing. As a Christian Scientist I take refuge in this unassailable fact: God is our true Mother. Intimations of the motherhood of God are found in the Bible. In the book of Psalms, for example, the image of finding safety under the shadow of God's wings appears frequently.1 And in Isaiah, God is represented as saying, ``As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.''2 Many passages in the Bible convey a sense of the comforting, nurturing, mothering love of God.\nThe understanding that God is our Mother as well as our Father has brought healing to my own experience. When I was a girl of twelve or thirteen my mother developed a puzzling resentment toward me. This went on for many years and tormented me. I felt that if my own mother didn't like me, I could not be worth anything at all. Self-respect and peace of mind eluded me. Eventually I was married, and my husband and I became Christian Scientists.\nThe healing of my unhappiness did not come all at once. I remember sitting in a Christian Science Reading Room, perhaps two or three years after I had become a serious student of this Science. I was praying deeply to see myself more as God knows me. Suddenly I understood that from a spiritual standpoint, God is my true Mother, now and always, and that in God's sight I am now and have always been His beloved and perfect offspring.\nFrom that time on I began to find a self-respect and peace I had never known. I found that I could actually like and love myself. My marriage became more stable, and I was soon doing work that was commensurate with my education and ability. Not only that, my relationship with my mother became harmonious for the first time in almost thirty years. There are still occasional problems, but the momentum of healing predominates. My mother seems happier and healthier than she has been for many years.\nAcknowledging the motherhood of God doesn't belittle the human sense of motherhood but purifies and elevates it. The realization of God's motherhood can free women from any sense of inferiority. There are no second-class citizens in the kingdom of heaven. God is both Father and Mother, and each individual in his or her true selfhood reflects all the qualities of Deity.\nThe comprehension of this spiritual fact can heal injustice in individual instances like my own and on the larger stage of society as well. Social action undergirded by such metaphysical understanding is less likely to lead to discouragement if new forms of exploitation crop up to replace the old. We find in a spiritual understanding of God and man a truly radical and efficacious approach to the troubles that plague humankind.\nWe do not have to settle for injustice or exploitation for ourselves or others. And the perception that God is indeed our Mother shows us why.\n1See, for example, Psalms 17:8; 36:7; 57:1; 61:4; 63:7; 91:4. 2Isaiah 66:13. 3Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, p. 340."}

{"idx": "25730", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Cary Fukunaga, the director behind the first season of HBO's True Detective and Netflix's Beasts of No Nation, was originally supposed to be at the helm for New Line and Warner Bros.' adaptation of Stephen King's IT. In 2015, he departed the project over creative differences and that was that. Andy Muschietti eventually was brought in and he shepherded the movie to great success. Now, Cary Fukunaga has opened up about leaving the project.\nCreative differences quite often cause rifts between studios and directors, but the precise details regarding those differences are often a bit blurry. Cary Fukunaga now says that he left IT behind because there was tension between himself and the producers as they felt he couldn't be controlled. Here's what he had to say about it in a recent interview.\n\"I think it was fear on their part, that they couldn't control me. No, they thought they couldn't control me. I would have been a total collaborator. That was the kind of ridiculous part. It was just more a perception. I have never seen a note and been like, f*** you guys. No way. It's always been a conversation.\"\nUnder the direction of Cary Fukunaga, it would have been We're the Millers star Will Poulter as Pennywise, as opposed to Bill Skarsgard, who ultimately went on to play the part. The general consensus seems to be that worked out quite well. Fukunaga also wrote his own version of the script and, while he maintained a writing credit, much was changed during further development that took place in the wake of his departure. Gary Dauberman came in and did a major rewrite. Apparently, the studio liked what he did, as he was brought back to pen IT 2.\nThere was a sense that Cary Fukunaga was an auteur in the true sense of the word. That he was uncompromising in his vision and that such a director might make things tricky come time for cameras to begin rolling. Fukunaga also talked a bit about this, saying that the concept of him being uncompromising simply isn't true.\n\"I don't think I've ever been able to make something uncompromising. Like, someone commented on Beasts, 'Oh, how did it feel to make a movie that's uncompromising?' Like, uncompromising? I had to rewrite my entire third act 'cause we didn't have the money to finish the film. We compromise all over the place.\"\nUltimately, IT turned out to be a tremendous success. The movie grossed more than $700 million worldwide and was met with a whole lot of praise from critics and fans alike. The studio quickly got working on the follow-up, IT: Chapter 2, which will arrive in theaters next September. Andy Muschietti was brought back to direct the sequel as well. As for Fukunaga? He's got his Netflix series Maniac coming down the pipeline, which reunites Superbad stars Emma Stone and Jonah Hill. It seems as though things worked out well enough for everyone.

{"idx": "25731", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has collected extensive information on the tactics, training and organization of antiwar demonstrators and has advised local law enforcement officials to report any suspicious activity at protests to its counterterrorism squads, according to interviews and a confidential bureau memorandum.\nThe memorandum, which the bureau sent to local law enforcement agencies last month in advance of antiwar demonstrations in Washington and San Francisco, detailed how protesters have sometimes used ''training camps'' to rehearse for demonstrations, the Internet to raise money and gas masks to defend against tear gas. The memorandum analyzed lawful activities like recruiting demonstrators, as well as illegal activities like using fake documentation to get into a secured site.\nF.B.I. officials said in interviews that the intelligence-gathering effort was aimed at identifying anarchists and ''extremist elements'' plotting violence, not at monitoring the political speech of law-abiding protesters.\nThe initiative has won the support of some local police, who view it as a critical way to maintain order at large-scale demonstrations. Indeed, some law enforcement officials said they believed the F.B.I.'s approach had helped to ensure that nationwide antiwar demonstrations in recent months, drawing hundreds of thousands of protesters, remained largely free of violence and disruption.\nBut some civil rights advocates and legal scholars said the monitoring program could signal a return to the abuses of the 1960's and 1970's, when J. Edgar Hoover was the F.B.I. director and agents routinely spied on political protesters like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\nHerman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University who has written about F.B.I. history, said collecting intelligence at demonstrations is probably legal.\nThe abuses of the Hoover era, which included efforts by the F.B.I. to harass and discredit Hoover's political enemies under a program known as Cointelpro, led to tight restrictions on F.B.I. investigations of political activities.\nMr. Ashcroft said the Sept. 11 attacks made it essential that the F.B.I. be allowed to investigate terrorism more aggressively. The bureau's recent strategy in policing demonstrations is an outgrowth of that policy, officials said.\nCivil rights advocates, relying largely on anecdotal evidence, have complained for months that federal officials have surreptitiously sought to suppress the First Amendment rights of antiwar demonstrators.\nCritics of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, for instance, have sued the government to learn how their names ended up on a ''no fly'' list used to stop suspected terrorists from boarding planes. Civil rights advocates have accused federal and local authorities in Denver and Fresno, Calif., of spying on antiwar demonstrators or infiltrating planning meetings. And the New York Police Department this year questioned many of those arrested at demonstrations about their political affiliations, before halting the practice and expunging the data in the face of public criticism.\nThe F.B.I. memorandum, however, appears to offer the first corroboration of a coordinated, nationwide effort to collect intelligence regarding demonstrations.\nBut it pointed to violence at protests against the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as evidence of potential disruption. Law enforcement officials said in interviews that they had become particularly concerned about the ability of antigovernment groups to exploit demonstrations and promote a violent agenda.\nThe memorandum urged local law enforcement officials ''to be alert to these possible indicators of protest activity and report"}

After all, why would a site known for homespun items \u2014 like this \u201cChubby Hedgehog Catnip Toy\u201d \u2014 want to take part in a political slugfest between gigantic cable and media companies?\nThe answer, according to Etsy\u2019s Public Policy Director Althea Erickson, is that the FCC\u2019s proposal to allow internet companies to charge for \u201cfast lanes\u201d would affect not just video sites like [company]Netflix[/company] and Twitch, but ordinary retail sites too.\n\u201cResearch shows a delay of milliseconds leads to loss of sales, and customers not coming back. A slow loading page puts sellers at a disadvantage. We\u2019re really worried about the world of paid prioritization,\u201d Erickson said in a phone interview on Thursday.\nThe FCC\u2019s plan, in other words, may bring a future in which the [company]Amazons[/company] of the world pay ISPs like [company]Comcast[/company] to ensure their pages load faster than smaller sites, and where [company]Google[/company] offers only its ad partners an express ride on its Fiber network.\nI asked Erickson for details on the \u201cmilliseconds\u201d claim, and she pointed me to earlier research by Akamai and O\u2019Reilly that shows direct correlations between web page speed and success in the ecommerce market. The research did not refer to milliseconds, but it does give credence to Etsy\u2019s concerns \u2014 which have also been voiced by crowd-fund site [company]Kickstarter[/company] \u2014 that small retailers could be collateral damage in the fight over fast lanes.\nErickson added that [company]Etsy[/company] may introduce videos to help its sellers, who are predominantly female micro-entrepreneurs, tell the stories of their products, but that the plan will be less viable if Etsy has to pay for a fast lane.\nEtsy, Netflix and a handful of other companies have urged the FCC to shelve its plans for fast lanes and to reintroduce a strict net neutrality policy. But Washington insiders have suggested the agency is unlikely to take such action due to the opposition of powerful broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast, and the decision of tech heavyweights like Google to sit out the debate.\nErickson, however, says she is not discouraged.\n\u201cWe see it differently. The Comcasts of the world have spent a lot on lobbying money, but 1.5 million people outside the beltway have weighed in too,\u201d she said.\nErickson also pointed to recent comments by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and President Obama that suggested the agency is thinking of invoking its Title II power in order to reclassify the ISPs as so-called common carriers. According to a major court ruling earlier this year, the Title II option is the only way that the FCC can force the ISP\u2019s not to favor certain websites over others.\n\u201cThe debate has shifted,\u201d said Erickson, adding that Etsy\u2019s position has gained more momentum through the support of influential Senators like Chuck Schumer (D.-NY). The fast lane proposal is also raising questions over whether government websites would suffer.\nThe next big phase for the net neutrality debate comes on September 15, when the reply period for comments on the FCC\u2019s fast lane plan will close,"}

We were an export economy then, but not nearly at the level that we are now. Also, foreign direct investment was just taking off in the 90s, which is around the time Intel (the nation s largest exporter in terms of sales) arrived. The arrival of Intel sparked the movement of foreign direct investment into Costa Rica, which has given the country a much greater presence in the international economy.\nNevertheless, the mild-mannered, 30-year veteran of the Costa Rican and Latin American economic scene appears ready for the second go-round. Bola\u00f1os, 59, holds a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago, and served as Costa Rica s Finance Minister from 1989-1990 and as manager of the National Stock Market from 1986-1995.\nPrior to returning to his role at the Central Bank, he presided over the Colombia-based Latin American Reserves Fund.\nWhile Bola\u00f1os buttoned-up demeanor is a departure from the affable, outgoing Guti\u00e9rrez, his strength is his precise understanding of the country s monetary system.\nBola\u00f1os recites Costa Rican financial history as if he wrote it himself, and draws from his understanding of past crises to guide financial policy towards what he hopes will be a more stable future.\nThe following is an excerpt from his interview with The Tico Times, held in Bola\u00f1os fourth floor office at the Central Bank s downtown San Jos\u00e9 office.\nTT: What are the biggest differences in the position as Central Bank president now compared to when you first held the job?\nRB: Basically, there is an important difference regarding the management of the exchange rate system. I like the changes I see in the financial system; it s a much more complete system than it was in the past.\nIn the 1990s, the financial system was managed using (automatic) mini-devaluations.\nAt that time, managing the exchange rate was a much more serious problem for the Central Bank and required much more attention than it does today. Today, the Central Bank is in a much better financial situation (with $4 billion in cash reserves) with a much better balance in the monetary system. That is one of the principal reasons why today we are able to maintain a much lower level of inflation than we ve had in the past.\nAnother important difference in this role is the management of the exchange rate with the new bands system that was established by the Central Bank (where the exchange rate is allowed to float within upper and lower limits set by the bank). The bands system allows the Central Bank to control the exchange rate by managing the amount of colones and dollars circulating in the national financial market. This allows for better control of the aggregate financial system, and, as we begin to work our way out of the worldwide economic crisis, we can monitor the fluctuations in monetary demands.\nWhat goals top your list of priorities for this term as Central Bank president?\nThe"}

In many respects, these individuals lay the groundwork for our state\u2019s economic prosperity.\nIn South Dakota, we have more than 1,800 miles of operational railroad lines, over which roughly half of our agriculture commodities travel. When hiccups occur, farmers often feel the impact immediately in the form of an increased basis. If backups or delays are bad enough, the state\u2019s entire farm economy can be impacted, especially if prices are low and producers have little wiggle room financially. It\u2019s critical, then, that we make the investments necessary to upgrade and maintain our nation\u2019s network of railroads.\nLike many features of America\u2019s infrastructure system, the country\u2019s railways are aging. Private American companies, however, have made significant investments to repair and modernize lines. From a policy perspective, these are investments I want to incentivize.\nOne way to do that is through the Short Line Tax Credit, which generally offers a $1 benefit for every $2 of private investment. First enacted in 2005, the credit has helped spark $4 billion worth of private investment by regional railroads, including millions of dollars in South Dakota.\nBut the credit expired in 2017. In response, I\u2019ve cosponsored legislation to make the tax credit permanent and will fight to include that proposal in an upcoming tax package.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve been thrilled to see President Trump\u2019s elimination of more than 1,600 unnecessary regulations, accelerating the pace at which developers can work. These same deregulation principles guided much of my advocacy in 2015, when we passed the first fully funded transportation bill in a decade and got it signed into law. The legislation cut red tape, streamlined rail project approvals, and increased support for highway-railway grade crossings.\nBut more can be done. President Trump has laid out an impressive infrastructure agenda to modernize our roads, bridges, and rails. More specifically, the president\u2019s plan prioritizes investments in rural America, further reduces the regulatory burden, and puts a renewed focus on the skills training needed to fill construction jobs.\nMuch of South Dakota\u2019s economy couldn\u2019t operate without a robust railroad infrastructure.

Electricity struck Benjamin Franklin.\nBased on those well-worn historical examples, you might think all inventors, creators and idea dudes are hit with wonderfully brief \"eureka moments\" that instantly propel our culture to new heights of innovation and discovery.\nBut what if that's all baloney?\nA number of writers this month have been challenging these and other long-held beliefs about innovation -- from the fact and fiction of that \"a-ha\" moment to the kinds of people who tend to innovate, and which ideas are best.\nDrawing much of the attention is Steven Johnson's new book, \"Where Good Ideas Come From.\" But a recent academic paper from MIT and the release of \"The Social Network,\" that movie about Facebook's innovative founder, have been stirring up the bloggers, too.\nHere's a quick look at some of these innovation myths. Chip in your own thoughts in the comments section below. If you're on Twitter, you can use the #goodideas hash tag to discuss Johnson's book, and join us for the #cnntechlunch conversation Friday at noon ET. We'll chat about these issues then.\nThe invention of the World Wide Web shows that great ideas don't arrive as epiphanies, Johnson writes in \"Where Good Ideas Come From.\"\n\"The Web came into being as an archetypal slow hunch: from a child's exploration of a hundred-year-old encyclopedia, to a freelancer's idle side project designed to help him keep track of his colleagues, to a deliberate attempt to build a new information platform,\" Johnson writes.\nHe told Salon.com in an interview that \"concepts take time to develop and incubate and sit around in the back of [innovator's] minds sometimes for decades.\"\nSo don't expect to wake up with out-of-the-blue brilliance.\nBased on the spectacles that tech companies make out of announcing new products (when Apple unveiled a new iPod in September, Chris Martin from Coldplay and Lady Gaga were on hand), it would be easy to think that the big companies of Silicon Valley are doing most of the innovating these days.\nNot so, according to a recent study.\nEric Von Hippel of MIT and colleagues found that regular Joes spend more money in aggregate on developing new consumer products as all of the innovation firms in the UK. And more than 6 percent of the 1,173 people studied had participated in \"household\" innovation.\n\"Hippel's work suggests that people like you and me (and Mark Frauenfelder) are a hidden engine of economic development as we reshape the things that we buy,\" Alexis Madrigal writes in The Atlantic's tech section. \"If we assume that American households are as innovative as their British counterparts, 14.5 million of us develop products, and we spend something like $18 billion a year doing it.\"\nPerhaps it would be wise to stop sitting in that chair, staring out the window and hoping for your next great idea to waft into your brain from that cappuccino you've been nursing.\nGood ideas most often come from group brainstorms, writes Johnson, or at the very least from contact with a well-informed network of people.\n\"What I'm saying is individuals have better ideas if they're connected to rich, diverse networks of other individuals.

Copyright is back in the news. And not in the positive way it was when we defeated the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA) at the European Court last summer.\nAfter a private collaboration, the CIPR and NLA sprung yet another new copying licence on an unsuspecting PR world. They described it as \"a step forward\". We described it as a massive error of judgement.\nWhy? What can be wrong with another licence? Especially one that might save small agencies a hundred quid or so?\nWell... It further complicates an already complicated market. Far from making agencies\u2019 lives simpler, it will make them more confused. They won\u2019t know which licence will be the least expensive option. So they\u2019ll have to ask the NLA for advice.\nAnd then BAM! You\u2019re in its sights. And it will never let you go. You\u2019ll be paying it for years. We know from experience that the NLA\u2019s model is to lure you in with a small bill, and then increase the bill considerably. It\u2019ll be exactly the same here.\nSecond, there are more fundamental issues at stake. How on earth was this deal reached? I can identify two CIPR members who were consulted. They certainly didn\u2019t pick up the phone to me. If they had done so, I would have said this to them: over the past eight years, we\u2019ve fought the NLA in five \u00adseparate courts. It will squeeze every last penny out of your members.\nYou simply can\u2019t negotiate with it in good faith. Walk away now. If the CIPR had rung up its former \u00adpresident Lionel Zetter, he would have said the same. He and I tried to \u00adarrange an agreement with the NLA in 2007. We soon realised the fundamental truth of negotiating with the NLA is that you will never win.\nOver the past eight years, we\u2019ve made significant progress challenging the NLA. We cut back its bill pretensions in the Copyright Tribunal.\nWe changed the law in 29 countries at the European Court. We were getting somewhere. And now the NLA has been thrown a legitimacy lifeline.\nWhere do we go from here? I believe it simply is not possible to cut deals with the NLA. The only things it respects are money and strength. So when we talk about issues that affect its bottom line, we need to show strength as an industry.\nFundamentally, the NLA, the \u00adCopyright Licensing Agency and other collecting societies are wrestling with a business model that isn\u2019t relevant for modern life. Social media are destroying the foundations on which the NLA et al are based. We need to hasten the crumbling of those foundations.\nSo here\u2019s what the PRCA will do. We are going to construct a coalition of all the membership bodies in our \u00adindustry. We are going to build a \u00adcommon front in defending PR\u2019s \u00adinterests. And we are going to talk, not with the NLA, but with law-makers. And every person who cares as we do about our industry and its \u00adfuture is welcome to join us.

Between 1820 and 1829, Cincinnati's black population grew from 2 percent to nearly 10 percent of the ciy's population. The city's Overseers of the Poor responded to this growth by enforcing the state's \"black laws\" which required blacks to register with the county clerk to ensure that they were not fugitives and to obtain a certificate to work. Blacks in the city were given 30 days to comply or leave the state. White mobs forced more than a thousand blacks to leave the city, prompting the organization of the National Black Convention movement, which met for the first time in Richard Allen's Bethel AME Church in Philadelphia in 1830.\nBy the 1850s, when the Illustrated News published this image of the African Church, increasing numbers of blacks from Pennsylvania had begun migrating to Cincinnati."}

Elizabeth Warren renewed her attack on Wells Fargo & Co., urging the Federal Reserve to remove the 12 directors who were on the board when bank employees set up legions of fake customer accounts.\nCongress empowered the Fed to remove board members if they violate the law or engage in unsafe business practices that cause banks with federal deposit insurance to suffer losses, Warren, D-Mass., wrote in a letter Monday to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen.\n\"I urge you to exercise your legal authority to remove the holdover Wells Fargo board members,\" Warren wrote. \"The board did nothing to stop rampant misconduct\" that led to \"more than 5,000 bank employees creating more than 2 million fake accounts over four years\" between 2011 and 2015, Warren added.\nWells Fargo has faced a barrage of criticism from Warren and others since it was fined $185 million in September for opening retail bank accounts without customer approval. The scandal triggered public complaints and congressional hearings, prompting the San Francisco-based bank to name new leaders, claw back pay and find new ways to encourage sales. In April, shareholders voted narrowly to re-elect all 15 board members after some proxy advisers and large investors had urged that the \u00admajority be voted off.\nWells Fargo has \"taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices, including changes in senior \u00adleadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected,\" spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said in a statement. \"That work continues and remains a core part of our efforts.\"\nWarren's real goal probably isn't to oust the firm's board, but to use the Wells Fargo scandal as a means of rebutting Republican calls for broad bank deregulation, said analyst Isaac Boltansky, at Compass Point Research & Trading.\n\"It's about defending the regulatory regime,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Senator Warren's big fear is that the call for medium-size and smaller bank deregulation will be used as a Trojan horse\" for easing rules against the biggest lenders.\nBoth parties have tried to leverage the scandal to further political goals. GOP Rep.Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has used it to criticize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, contending its regulators should have spotted the fraud before the bank flagged it.

They came to celebrate four young women from this farming community who have emerged as the most unexpected (and most gloriously bespectacled) stars of the Winter Olympics.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, townspeople gathered inside the gymnasium here at Uiseong Girls High School to root for the South Korean women\u2019s curling team, whose match against the United States was shown on a big screen as an emcee leaned into a microphone and banged on a drum.\nIt was the biggest, loudest party in the province, and for good reason: The team\u2019s top four players grew up in this small city of about 54,000 people and graduated from this high school. Now, thanks to an improbable run at the Olympics being held in Pyeongchang, about 80 miles to the north, the team \u2014 dubbed the Garlic Girls by the Korean press, owing to the region\u2019s production of garlic \u2014 seems on the cusp of international celebrity.\nNever mind that the Garlic Girls, with their dominant record in pool play, have vaulted themselves into medal position in a sport that is still foreign to most South Koreans.\nCurling\u2019s roots date to 16th-century Scotland. But it was not until 2006 that one of South Korea\u2019s first curling facilities was built \u2014 here in Uiseong. A former government official had seen the sport while travelling in Canada and thought it would appeal to a wide range of people. So the county cobbled together the funds to build the Gyeongbuk Uiseong Curling Centre.\nKim Joo-soo, the county mayor, said in an interview at his office that four friends (including two sisters) from Uiseong Girls High School soon became regulars. They thought it was a fun after-school activity. Nobody knew they would become Olympians.\nAnother factor: the sterling play of Kim Eun-jung, 27, who goes by the nickname Annie and operates as the team\u2019s skip. They\u2019ve already beaten powerhouses Canada, Switzerland and Britain, sealing a berth in Friday\u2019s semifinals.\nTheir path to Olympic stardom was not without obstacles. In recent years, the Korean curling federation was roiled by a sexual abuse case that involved a former coach and by the misappropriation of training funds. But the players on the current team persevered, and banners featuring their faces and the Olympic rings are now scattered across Uiseong.\nKim Sung-hee, the woman who lost her voice from cheering too hard, said she was from the same neighborhood as the two sisters on the team. She had been watching their matches at a community center, she said. But as the wins kept piling up, it was starting to get pretty crowded.\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s match, an announcement was posted on the county\u2019s official website that a viewing party would be held at the high school. Word spread around the county. Lee Jung-yong, an actor and entertainer from Seoul, was brought in to rev up the crowd \u2014 but that hardly seemed necessary."}

They're the most antisocial of particles: The ghostly things will pass right through entire planets without interacting with a single molecule. So if physicists want to learn anything about them, they have to construct super-elaborate\u2014and super-expensive\u2014detectors to catch even a few of the particles as they fly by. You may have heard about one of them, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, last week after it captured traces of neutrinos from way out in space.\nBut ... don't scientists know that neutrinos exist already? Why do physicists need to be spending all this money if they already know the particles are out there? Unlike other subatomic particles under observation, the existence of neutrinos isn\u2019t debated\u2014the first one was definitively detected all the way back in 1956, when scientists caught neutrinos that had been created by a nuclear reactor in South Carolina. Today, though, neutrino detectors aren\u2019t built necessarily to detect neutrinos\u2014they\u2019re there to study particle behavior in the hopes of revealing deep secrets about the universe.\nHere are the basics behind those detectors: Occasionally, a neutrino\u2014which comes in three types, muon, electron, and tau\u2014will collide with a single atom and leave behind a trace of particles and light. So detectors are designed to capture those signals. To make sure they only detect neutrino signals, though, they have to block out other kinds of particles with some sort of barrier. Engineers can gear a detector toward a particular source of neutrinos\u2014a nuclear reactor, the sun, the cosmos, Earth itself\u2014and depending on the distance they travel and the energy they carry, the detector will use different kinds of shielding.\nTo get a sense for how much goes into understanding these teeny, tiny particles, we pulled together a list of the neutrino detectors you've seen in the news lately\u2014along with their financial and engineering specs. These are the lengths physicists will go to for new information about the universe's most abundant (and aloof) particle.\nLast week, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in the South Pole reported the detection of cosmic neutrinos\u2014that is, neutrinos that have traveled all the way from the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Their measurement could help physicists understand the highly energetic processes that created them out in space, including supernovae, black holes, and pulsars.\nSpecs: 5,160 digital optical modules suspended along 86 strings embedded in a cubic kilometer of ice, almost a mile underground. Instead of concrete shielding, this detector uses the Earth itself to block out other particles; when a neutrino collides with an atom in the Antarctic ice, it produces light that the DOMs pick up.\nLocated in Ash River, Minnesota, this long-range detector captures neutrinos sent from a particle accelerator at FermiLab all the way in Illinois. Earlier this month, the experiment published its first evidence of oscillating neutrinos\u2014that is, neutrinos transforming between their three forms. NOvA caught muon neutrinos turning into electron neutrinos.\nSpecs: A 50 by 50 by 200 foot detector weighing 14,000 tons is made of thousands of reflective PVC cells filled with 2.5 million gallons of liquid scintillator. A neutrino hitting an atom in the scintillator emits charged particles that are measured by a network of fibers and photodetectors.\nT"}

Gottlieb said in a previous statement, because of California DOJ\u2019s Firearms Application Reporting System (CFARS) breaking down during the deadline week for people to register their firearms in accordance with new state laws.\n\u201cFor a whole week the system was largely inaccessible, so people who wanted to comply with the law simply couldn\u2019t and now they face becoming criminals because they couldn\u2019t do what the law requires,\u201d said Gottlieb.\nFollowing the California DOJ announcement, Combs described the case to The Daily Caller as a \u201cdue process\u201d issue more than anything else. According to Coombs, registration of firearms in California was a fairly simple process that was made clear by state officials in the past via media campaigns and required lawful firearm owners to fill out a postcard and send it to the appropriate authorities.\n\u201cThis time they cut out all of the outreach. They purposefully essentially hid the football and didn\u2019t tell all the people in California, \u2018Hey here\u2019s your legal duties.\u2019 And they created this new system rather than a very simple online system\u2026They built this very complicated system in our view,\u201d said Combs.\nAlthough California relented on imposing its gun registration this time, FPC is still involved with other lawsuits related to the state of California and its restrictions on firearms. One such case to watch for, Combs says, is the 9-year old case Pe\u00f1a V. Lindley.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still in the Ninth Circuit. That was argued last February in 2017 and submitted. So it\u2019s just been sitting waiting for a decision for nearly a year and a half.

The country\u2019s biggest earners brought in 95% of all income gains between 2009 and 2012; in terms of income, the other 99% have barely recovered from the recession at all.

Two months ago, President Obama declared that reversing income inequality must be Washington\u2019s \u201chighest priority,\u201d but the issue has subsequently dropped off the map again.\nEconomic policy remains in a holding pattern, trending towards continued austerity. A proposal to raise the minimum wage languishes in committee, student loan rates are expected to rise over the next few years, House Republicans are set to introduce a massive food stamp cut, and Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has proposed a \u201cnon-controversial\u201d budget plan which would avert government shutdown but extend across-the-board sequestration cuts. Meanwhile, the economy continues to gradually add more low-wage jobs, and more Americans give up on finding work entirely.\nSyria might be partially to blame for sucking the oxygen out of other pressing issues; the debate over a potential military strike against the Assad regime was the subject of two recent Congressional hearings and President Obama\u2019s prime time address to the nation Tuesday. Other congressional business, including immigration reform, has also been pushed aside for now.\nThe inequality crisis may also seem less urgent because it is nothing new. In fact, the rich have been steadily accumulating a greater share of the country\u2019s income since the end of the 1970s. Yet rarely in American history has the gap between rich and poor been so stark; recent studies suggest that the United States may now have even higher income inequality than Tsarist Russia and the Roman Empire (not including slaves).\nAll In agenda: Remembering 9/11 as the U.S."}

In contrast, among those who did not alter their way of life, telomeres decreased in length by three per cent on average.\nAlthough it is well known that a healthy diet and plenty of exercise can result in a host of medical befits, the findings published in The Lancet Oncology journal, are the first evidence of such an effect on telomeres.\nProf Dean Ornish, who led the study, said: \"The implications of this relatively small pilot study may go beyond men with prostate cancer.\nDr Lynne Cox, a Biochemistry lecturer at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said the findings \"support the calls for adoption of and adherence to healthier lifestyles\".\nIt is \"perhaps too soon to judge whether this increase in telomere length will correlate with increased longevity or healthspan\", she added.\nParticipants adopted a diet high in whole foods such as fruit, vegetables, pulses and grains. They cut down on refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, and lowered their fat intake to less than 10 per cent of all the calories in their diet.\nThe men were asked to undertake \"moderate\" levels of aerobic exercise for the duration of the study, for example walking for half an hour a day, six times per week.\nExercises participants carried out to lower their stress levels were gentle yoga-based stretching routines, breathing exercises, meditation and \"progressive relaxation\", a technique which involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in turn.\nThe men were asked to attend one hour-long group \"social support\" session each week, led by a clinical psychologist."}

You can assemble them in a factory with an explicable design meaning consistent standards and predicable costs and delivery timescale,\u201d said Anurag Gupta, director and global lead for power infrastructure at consultancy KPMG.\nIn a nuclear power plant, heat is created when uranium atoms split. Different reactor designs use this heat in different ways to raise the temperature of water and create steam, which then powers turbines to produce electricity.\nManufacturing advancements mean SMR developers are only a few years from being able to replicate this technology on a smaller scale, and plants could be ready for deployment by the mid-2020s.\n\u201cFrom a technical perspective there is no reason why you wouldn\u2019t be able to make a smaller version of an already commercially viable nuclear technology such as PWR (pressurised water reactor),\u201d Mike Tynan, director of Britain\u2019s Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC), said.\nThere are already more than 100 nuclear plants using PWR technology in operation across the globe.\nNuScale, majority owned by U.S. Fluor Corp, is developing 50 megawatt (MW) SMRs using PWRs which could be deployed at a site hosting up to 12 units generating a total of 600 MW. The 50 MW units would be 65 feet (20 metres) tall, roughly the length of two busses, and nine feet in diameter.\nRolls-Royce, which already makes components for PWR nuclear submarines, is part of a consortium developing a 220 MW SMR unit which could be doubled for a larger-scale project.\nRolls-Royce Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stein said the first 440 MW power plant would cost around 1.75 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) but costs would likely fall once production is ramped up.\n\u201cOne of the advantages of the SMRs is that they cost a lot less (than large nuclear plants), and it is an easier case to present to private investors,\u201d Stein said.\nCritics, however, say there is no guarantee that SMR developers will be able to cut costs enough to make the plants viable.\n\u201cSMR vendors say factory production will save a lot of money, but it will take a long time and a lot of units to achieve what they are calling economies of mass production,\u201d said Edwin Lyman, nuclear expert at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).\n\u201cFactory manufacture is not a panacea.

We compare it to a bomb blast,\" Mead said.\n\"It's vital to make sure that people are not in the surge area when an eruption happens. And we know from earlier research that most Auckland Volcanic Field eruptions have had a surge.\"\nVolcanoes typically gave signals when about to erupt, such as a series of earthquakes that occurred as magma rose through the earth's crust.\nIn Auckland, current planning meant evacuating up to a 5km radius which could restrict up to 435,000 people, although this also allowed for a smaller or larger area to be evacuated if better information was available.\n\"When we look at research into the history of Auckland volcanoes, we see that some surges have been smaller than the 5km radius.\"\nFurther, as the surge flowed, it was affected by terrain such as hills, potentially changing the affected area.\n\"What we're doing is taking the research that's already been done on surges, and using computer modelling to get more accurate information about where a surge would travel and create damage,\" Mead said.\n\"We are expecting to be able to better define surge damage zones, which could assist in both long-term and evacuation plans.\n\"Given the potential impact on people, industry, road and air travel and tourism, this information could be very useful.\"\nOnce his team has crunched the data, they will create a model for emergency managers.\n\"We've got experts on our research team from computer science, statistics and volcanology,\" he said.\n\"What we are aiming to show in the model is the likely effects of a surge, and our confidence level in the prediction, so that emergency managers can weigh up the situation and make the best decision.\"\nEQC science and education manager Dr Richard Smith said the project was a good example of using scientific research for local action.\n\"Dr Mead and his team will make a very practical contribution to volcano risk management in New Zealand,\" he said.\n\"Getting a better understanding of where and how far a volcanic surge is likely to travel will help Auckland's emergency managers be more effective in managing evacuation.\""}

{"idx": "25788", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Necessity is often the mother of invention, so when it comes to managing Big Data these days, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to discover that a lot of organizations are relying more on their own initiative.\nA perfect example of that initiative is a new open source project that makes available a new file system for Hadoop. Quantcast, a provider of an analytics service for measuring Web traffic, created the Quantcast File System (QFS) to address storage scalability issues in Hadoop environments. According to Jim Kelly, vice president of research and development at Quantcast, the QFS is a more efficient approach to managing storage than the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) that comes native with the Apache distribution of Hadoop. QFS is a derivative of the open source Kosmos File System (KFS), which is also known as CloudStore.\nKelly says the key difference between QFS and HDFS is that Quantcast rebuilt the sorter in Hadoop and added a more accessible application-programming interface. QFS runs more tasks in parallel and implements an error recovery mechanism based on a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm that reduces storage costs by better reclaiming empty space of disk drives attached to a Hadoop cluster. According to Kelly, that has enabled Quantcast to reclaim as much as half the disk space in its Hadoop cluster, which not only reduces storage costs, but also reduces physical space requirements in the data center and the amount of energy consumed.\nQuantcast developed QFS to deal with the more than 40TB of data the company is pumping into its Hadoop cluster every day. While most organizations are still piloting their Hadoop projects, Kelly says it\u2019s only a matter of time before they encounter the same scalability limitations of HDFS that Quantcast did.\nGiven the fact that storage vendors don\u2019t have a real financial motivation to come up with technologies that serve to reduce storage consumption, Kelly says Quantcast felt the time had come to build a larger community to support the continuing development of QFS.\nThe issue that this move by Quantcast gets at is whether organizations can really trust storage vendors to address one of the most vexing and costly challenges in all of IT. In theory, competition between storage vendors should result in more efficient systems that help rein in storage costs.

{"idx": "25795", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: I grow several different types of basil, and try new ones each year. Usually, I end up preferring the basic sweet basil to other kinds, but not this year. A new favorite this year is lime basil.\nBasil (Ocimum basilicum) has many different cultivars. They are generally divided into four groups: sweet green, dwarf green, purple-leaf, and scented leaf.\nLime Basil is a scented leaf basil. True to its name and type, it has a mild citrus aroma and flavor. Lime basil is slightly smaller than sweet basil, growing to about a foot tall. Mom uses it in her lemon cookies. I use it in my tomato-cucumber salad and plan to try it in mojitos and on grilled fish.\nWhile I\u2019m enjoying using lime basil in various food and drink, sweet green basil will always be a staple in my garden. Sweet basil grows about two foot tall with bright green leaves. It has a clove-like taste that I particularly like as a hot tea additive or made into pesto-pasto. In fact, I use sweet basil so much that I grow it and cilantro year round. In the summer I plant transplants in the outdoor herb garden, and in the winter I grow them from seed in my aerogarden. This year I am also growing both of these plants in containers on the patio.\n\u2018Dark Opal Purple\u2019 Basil is also an ole, standby in my garden. It is similar to sweet basil in taste and plant size, but with dark bronze-purple leaves. Other purple-leaf basils include \u2018Purple Ruffles\u2019 and \u2018Rubin.\u2019 I infuse purple basil leaves in vinegar to use in salads, egg dishes, and more.\nThai basil is my least favorite basil, probably because it strong taste is too much like black licorice. Another scented leaf basil, it is used in Thai and Indian cooking. Taller than sweet basil, Thai basil grows to three foot in height.\nIf you are limited on space or want to grow container herbs on the patio, try a dwarf green type. \u2018Spicy globe\u2019 is only grows six to twelve inches tall, thus making it an excellent container or edging plant. Though miniature, it tastes like a sweet basil.\nAll basil types are easy to grow, either from seed or transplants. They prefer sunny locations, warm temperatures, and moist, but well-drained soil. As soon as the plant has some size, begin cutting off the leaves for cooking. The newest leaves have the best flavor. This will also keep the plant from flowering, which shortens the life of the plant. Regular harvesting will encourage branching and the production of new leaves.\nFor more information on growing basil and other herbs, go to University of Illinois Extension\u2019s Herb Gardening website at http://extension.illinois.edu/herbs. I also have a short YouTube video on harvesting herbs at go.illinois.edu/ILRiverHort Videos."}

He beat Virginia Tech twice, North Carolina twice and N.C. State twice.\nIdeally, East Carolina needs an offensive-minded recruiting specialist who understands North Carolina, especially east of I-95.\nSo where does East Carolina go next?\nIdeally, East Carolina needs an offensive-minded recruiting specialist who understands North Carolina, especially east of I-95. That doesn\u2019t leave a long list of candidates. McNeill, when he was hired, checked two of those boxes. By bringing offensive whiz kid Lincoln Riley with him from Texas Tech, he checked the third.\nAbove all that, the Lumberton native embodied and embraced everything that\u2019s good about East Carolina football \u2013 the passion, the belief, the expectations. McNeill cared deeply about the players, seeing himself in them, believing in their futures. At the core of his recruiting pitch, he sold himself as a father figure. And he meant it.\nWhen the Pirates won his debut, beating Tulsa on a Hail Mary in the east end zone of Dowdy-Ficklen, McNeill wiped away tears as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d Last season should have been his best, with East Carolina poised to claim the Group of 5 spot in a New Year\u2019s bowl game, but losses to Temple, Cincinnati and Central Florida scuttled those dreams.\nThere\u2019s a legitimate discussion to be had about the direction the program was going under McNeill, and consistent areas of concern that never seemed to show improvement \u2013 penalties, for one \u2013 but it seemed only fair to give McNeill at least another season.\nRiley, who left this season for Oklahoma and is a finalist for the Broyles Award that goes to the nation\u2019s top assistant coach, is the natural successor, but he may (and probably should) have higher ambitions. Riley is under consideration for the South Carolina opening and won\u2019t have to wait long to do better than East Carolina, even if he was willing to take the job that his longtime colleague just lost \u2013 especially if McNeill was unwilling to make staff changes and that contributed to his firing.\nLooking back, the writing was on the wall when East Carolina announced earlier this week it would not accept a bowl bid even if offered one. (That was exceedingly unlikely anyway given East Carolina\u2019s APR, the academic metric the NCAA is using to fill bowls with 5-7 teams.) While noble, the decision to forgo the extra practices that would come with a bowl game makes a lot more sense if you know a coaching change is coming.\nOnly Compher did. That doesn\u2019t mean firing McNeill was the wrong decision, only that Compher is now under extraordinary pressure to get the next part right."}

Recently though getting hold of the illustrious Nexus 4 via Google Play hasn\u2019t been without its problems, as stock levels have virtually been non-existent since the handset was released selling out almost instantly every time stock is replenished. There are now new rumours about a LG Nexus 5 and Nexus 7.7 release being tipped with Android 5.0 Key Lime Pie.\nThere were recently rumours suggesting that LG had ceased production of the Nexus 4 for the imminent release of a new model, which were quickly dismissed and earlier today we brought you the news that T-Mobile in the US were widening the availability of the smartphone.\nNow more rumours have come to light that suggest LG is working on new Nexus hardware that includes another smartphone, and a tablet PC. First up the Nexus 5 is being tipped to feature a 5-inch Full HD display and powered by the new Nvidia Tegra 4 processor that was unveiled recently. This will be paired with 2GB of RAM with a 13-megapixel rear camera, and around the front it is being claimed there will be a 3-megapixel shooter.\nStorage wise the handset is supposedly going to come in either 8GB or 16GB of storage, with the 8GB version costing the same price as the current Nexus 4. It is also alleged that LG is working on a Nexus 7.7 tablet PC that will feature a display of 7.7-inches with a resolution of 1920 x 1200, and 294ppi pixel density.\nThis again will have the Tegra 4 processor under the hood with HD cameras on the both sides of the device. It is being claimed that both of the devices will be unveiled at the Google I/O 2013 event that starts on May 15th. While these rumours have to be taken with the usual pinch of salt, there could be some truth in them considering the event is still a few months away yet.\nBoth of these devices are claimed to release running the yet to be announced Android 5.0 Key Lime Pie operating system, and It also seems that this year will certainly see the explosion of numerous smartphones being made available with 5-inch displays, and would be a bump up from the 4.7-inch that the Nexus 4 uses.

No different than in the 17th century, listening to a heartbeat has been a manual process that relies entirely on a doctor\u2019s ear to detect irregularities.\nThat is, until today. And it\u2019s all thanks to Eko Devices, a Berkeley-based startup that just became the youngest team to secure FDA clearance for a Class II medical device. Co-founders Connor Landgraf, Jason Bellet, and Tyler Crouch, all rather recent graduates of UC Berkeley, have added a digital dimension to the centuries-old tool.\nDubbed the Eko Core, their solution is an adapter that attaches to the typical stethoscope and streams the heartbeat data to the cloud, providing doctors with an entirely new layer of information to analyze.\nWith the Eko Core, the physician can see the heartbeat in wave form on a mobile device as well as hear the sound at an amplified level. Both the visible and audible data can be recorded and easily shared between physicians and hospitals.\nFor doctors, this takes a lot of the guesswork out of detecting murmurs, valve problems, and blockages in the arteries.\nAnd for the 70 percent of pediatric patients with suspected heart murmurs who are unnecessarily referred to a cardiologist, Eko will be able to save thousands of dollars in avoidable echocardiograms.\n\u201cPhysicians don\u2019t have confidence in their ability to use the stethoscope in a lot of situations so they frequently refer people to cardiologists when it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Landgraf says.\nEko is running a pilot with Stanford Hospital, where all residents will be using the Eko Core device as a training tool. Today, the company is releasing the device to the public for $199 on its own, or $299 with a stethoscope included.\nOver the next few months, the team will be continuing to develop an algorithm that analyzes the data collected by all Eko devices in order to match heartbeats to conditions in real-time. Kind of like the \u201cShazam for heartbeats,\u201d as Landgraf says doctors like to call it.\nThe condition-detecting feature is slated to launch in Q1 of next year, and Landgraf hints that Eko will eventually roll out additional products to give physicians a better understanding of the heart in a noninvasive manner.\nSince Eko was founded in 2013, the company has raised $2.8 million from Stanford\u2019s StartX Fund, FOUNDER.org founder Michael Baum, and the co-founders of Shazam, among others."}

The game went on sale in the US on March 21 and is now on sale in the UK.\nThe sci-fi action RPG - developer BioWare's first new entry in the series in five years - sees players controlling one of the two Ryder twins as they search for humanity's new home, this time with a touch of Westerosi flavour as Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer joins the cast.\nThe game features Dormer as Dr Lexi T'Perro, an Asari physician and psychiatrist on board the Tempest, the game's main spaceship, who will serve as a key ally for players as they venture around the Andromeda galaxy.\nWIRED spoke with Dormer to discuss her shift into games, Lexi as a character, and how acting in the medium affects a performer.\nWIRED: How did your involvement in Mass Effect come about?\nNatalie Dormer: They approached me, and I, in my ignorance of gaming, was not quite aware of what a big deal that was. I said yes because from the little I did know about gaming I was intrigued and wanted to do it. It was only when I was doing it that my friends who are big gamers explained to me what a big deal Mass Effect is.\nDid reprising the role of Margaery Tyrell in Telltale's Game of Thrones prepare you for acting in games?\n[The role] gave me some help on a technical level; an understanding of what they need from you when you're in the booth. It was sort of a miniature training, but that was easy because I'd played that character for so many years and I knew exactly what she was. The fun part was working out who Lexi was.\nWhat was it about Lexi that appealed to you?\nShe has an analytical, objective brain.\nShe's there to maintain the mental and physical health of Ryder and his crew on the Tempest [and] I liked the idea of playing this sort of objective species. Lexi is academic in the way she thinks - she has a great interest in alien anatomy and she's sort of omnipresent on Ryder's journey through the game, to advise in this calm way. That appealed, to play that kind of character because I haven't really done anything like that. I haven't played a straight, analytical character before.\nWhat was the recording process like \u2013 entirely vocal, or did you contribute motion capture?\nIt was an entirely vocal performance. That's quite cool as an actor because it gives you an opportunity to play roles that look or move in a way you never would. Apart from the fact that I'm not blue and never will be - unless I get on Avatar number 256 or something - it's interesting because they move in a different way. [BioWare] uses a different actor for motion capture, so it's kind of cool to realise you're a small cog and you have to be quite specific in giving the team what they need to add the final piece to the character. She was pretty much there, in front of me when I came into the room - it was almost like I had to match her, not the other way around.\nHow was that experience for you as an actor, not being able to put your own physicality into the performance?\nI quite liked it actually.

Wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations.\nAnd men who are more attractive are better collaborators compared to less attractive men, they said.\nPrevious research based on the 'facial width-to-height ratio' found individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with wider faces.\nIt claimed that while men with wider faces are more likely to lie and cheat, they tend to lead more financially successful firms.\nAlthough this study finds a correlation, the researchers stress that it doesn't mean all men with wide faces have psychopathic tendencies.\nThe facial width to height ratio (fWHR) is worked out by measuring the horizontal distance between the outer edges of the cheekbones and the vertical distance from the highest point of the top lip to the highest point of the eyelids.\nThe width is then divided by the height.\nFor the study, the researchers asked 96 adult male university students and 41 male prisoners at a young offenders institution to complete a standard questionnaire that psychologists use to measure psychopathic traits.\nKnown as the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R) test, it creates a total psychopathy score (PPI-R total) and studies fearless dominance, self-centered impulsivity, and coldheartedness.\nFollowing the questionnaire, the men were asked to sit with their faces on a chin-rest, while their photographs were taken.\nThe researchers measured the men's fWHRs from these photos and correlated the results with their questionnaire answers.\nFace width in men is affected by testosterone exposure during puberty, with wider faces reflecting higher levels of testosterone, the researchers from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt said.\n'Without doubt, testosterone has long-lasting effects on the brain, particularly during sensitive developmental periods such as puberty,' they wrote in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.\n'The affected brain regions include the amygdala and the hippocampus, limbic structures that are crucially involved in socio-emotional behaviour.\nPrevious studies have found that women are more likely to want a man with a wide face for a fling, but less likely to see him as husband material, while wide-faced footballers score more goals but commit more fouls.\nLast year, a separate study found both men and women with wide faces tend to be more aggressive, dominant and angry.\nThose with broad features - such as Wayne Rooney, Sylvester Stallone or Sarah Palin - are more likely to have bad tempers and display bouts of verbal or physical aggression.\nPsychologists think the trait is linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones.\nThose who had more robust facial bones could be more aggressive, because they could better withstand a punch, the scientists suggest."}

Not this time.\n\"I'm more pumped up about this trip than any I've been on in the past 20 years,'' he said.\nThe trip, which will begin Oct. 16, will take Jarrett and a team of doctors and nurses -- mostly from Danbury Hospital -- to Choray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.\nAt Choray Hospital, the team will work with the hospital's cardiologists to teach them the best practices of cardiology and open-heart surgery.\nWhile Jarrett has been laying the groundwork for the trip for years -- years of trust-building -- this is the first time he'll bring a full team of 11 people with him. It's also the first big trip sponsored by Hearts Around the World Inc., the non-profit organization Jarrett set up to fund this work.\nAnd it's the first of many trips he'll be making to lead the project.\nBefore the Russian project -- which was sponsored by Healing the Children NE, based in New Milford -- Jarrett had gone on other international missions. He realized that simply stopping in a country for a few hours to deliver supplies, or a few days to perform surgery wasn't enough.\nInstead, the mission to Ho Chi Minh City -- formerly Saigon -- will have the American doctors and nurses working side by side with their Vietnamese counterparts. By working with them and by teaching them, they'll improve the medical techniques at the hospital over time.\nThe team this time will have a Danbury Hospital cohort of Dr. Cary Passik, a cardiac surgeon at Danbury Hospital; Dr. Ilya Zhuravlev, an anesthesiologist; Catherine Cassidy, the hospital's head operating room nurse; Angela Watts, the cardiac nurse in the intensive care unit, and Rick Rigling, a sonographer.\nTwo others -- Dr. Carl Reimers, an interventional cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, and Timothy Hansen, a cardiac physician's assistant from Yale-New Haven Hospital -- will complete the team.\nFor Passik, the decision to spend 16 hours in an airplane flying from New York to Hong Kong, have a three-hour layover, fly three more hours to Ho Chi Minh City, work hard in a foreign hospital, then take the same 22-hour trip home was an easy one.\nJarrett said the problems the doctors will face in Ho Chi Minh City will involve things doctors don't see in the United States.

In a tentative first step toward ending months of political deadlock, British lawmakers voted Wednesday to block the country from leaving the European Union without a divorce agreement, triggering an attempt to delay that departure, currently due to take place on March 29.\nIn a stalemate over Brexit, British politicians have chosen to delay it.\nAfter weeks of political gridlock, Parliament voted Thursday to seek to postpone the country's departure from the European Union, a move that will likely avert a chaotic withdrawal on the scheduled exit date of March 29.\nWith Brexit due in 15 days and no divorce deal yet approved, the House of Commons voted 412-202 to ask the bloc to put off Britain's exit until at least June 30.\nThe vote gives Prime Minister Theresa May some breathing space, but is still humbling for a leader who has spent two years telling Britons they were leaving the bloc on March 29.\nPower to approve or reject the extension lies with the EU, which has signaled that it will only allow a delay if Britain either approves a divorce deal or makes a fundamental shift in its approach to Brexit. In a historic irony, almost three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, its future is now in the bloc's hands.\nMay is likely to ask EU leaders for an extension at a March 21-22 summit of the bloc in Brussels.\nThe European Commission said the bloc would consider any request, \"taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.\"\nMay was forced to consider a Brexit delay after lawmakers twice rejected her EU divorce deal and also ruled out, in principle, leaving the bloc without an agreement. Withdrawing without a deal could mean major disruptions for businesses and people in the U.K. and the 27 remaining countries.\nBy law, Britain will leave the EU on March 29, with or without a deal, unless it cancels Brexit or secures a delay.\nThursday could have been worse for May. Lawmakers rejected an attempt to strip her of control over the Brexit agenda. They defeated by the narrowest of margins \u2014 314-312 \u2014 an opposition attempt let Parliament choose an alternative to May's rejected divorce deal and force the government to negotiate it with the EU.\nLawmakers also voted against holding a second Brexit referendum \u2014 at least for now.\nBy a decisive 334-85 vote, they defeated a motion that called for another vote by the public on whether to stay in the EU or leave. Campaigners for a new referendum are divided over whether the time is right to push for a second Brexit vote. The vote doesn't prevent lawmakers from trying again later to get Parliament's support for another referendum.\nDespite the rebuffs and the political chaos that have weakened her authority, May has signaled she will try a third time to get backing for her agreement next week. She is seeking to win over Brexit-backing opponents in her own party and its Northern Irish political ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, who fear the deal keeps Britain too closely tied to the EU.\nAlan Wager, a researcher at the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank, said May faced a struggle to overturn a 149-vote margin of defeat in Parliament this week.\n\"It's still really difficult to see how the numbers stack up for Ther"}

He went 6-10 with 18 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.\nBut he wants and expects more this season, regardless of what the team does in the draft.\nGeneral Manager John Elway recently called Keenum \u201cprobably a short-term fix\u201d at quarterback for the Broncos. That comes as no surprise to anyone, including Keenum.\nThe Broncos could use a high draft choice on a quarterback, but Keenum isn\u2019t worried about what they do at his position this offseason. They have the 10th overall choice.\nDon\u2019t worry Case, you\u2019ll know when the draft happens because you\u2019ll instantly end up your familiar position of backup QB as soon as the draftee walks in the building.\nI hope they give Keenum another season. I think he is good but Vance Joseph was just a bad HC.\nCase is 30, and has made over $25,000,000 so far \u2026 with more to come. He really doesn\u2019t have a lot to worry about.\nElway just burned a late round pick in the 2016 draft on a quarterback who is no longer even rostered in the NFL. It wouldn\u2019t be very wise of Elway to burn a top 10 pick on another quarterback with plenty of questions surrounding him ala Lynch.\nIt may not have been the season you expected, but it was pretty much on par with the expectations of anyone with half a brain.\nKeenum had a magical season with the Vikings in 2017, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s a viable starter.\nCase, they can\u2019t replace Elway in the draft.\nIt seems like every QB that Elway has picked has been a disaster. When are the Broncos going to hold HIM accountable? Being a good NFL QB doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a good GM.\nDefinitely take a QB. And definitely do not start him in year 1.\nThat depends what you have around you put around him\u2026 Diggs and Theilen can help that. Much like when the Bears had Marshall Jefferey and Forte.\nI honestly think the Vikings would\u2019ve had a better season this year with Keenum. I\u2019d have said that even if the \u201cmn miracle\u201d did not happen.\nI heard Flacco can really air it out up in Mile High.\nHuh? Typically you keep hitting until you actually find a franchise QB. That\u2019s like saying the Browns shouldn\u2019t draft Mayfield because of what happened with Manziel.\nAlso, historically, Free Agent QB\u2019s never pan out unless your Drew Brees or Peyton Manning.\nThere is gonna be more questions surrounding the QB they draft at #10 than there was with Mayfield last year. If Elway misses at #10 like he did with Lynch then Elway won\u2019t have to worry about drafting for Denver again.\nThere\u2019s not a first round QB in this class. Doesn\u2019t mean some won\u2019t get drafted there.\nThe Broncos need to go after Foles like they did Manning. Keennum will always be a Hoyer-type borderline starter guy. Make keenum the backup.

Since the event is closed to the public, here is everything you missed, from his clothes to his quotes!\nLet it be known that the fans swarmed the hotel in anticipation of his arrival (a rarity despite the A-list actors who've come through TCA this year, like Matthew McConaughey and Julia Roberts). When asked about the impact Sherlock has had on his life, particularly these fans, Cumberbatch replied, \"It's extraordinary.\"\n\"I think a lot of it comes with who [Sherlock] is,\" he continued. \"He's a very iconic figure. I feel not an onerous sense of responsibility, but it has to be acknowledged and I feel gratitude that they're supportive and loyal and committed to something I love doing. And a character I love playing. So, it means a lot to me.\"\nCumberbatch revealed the fan that caught him most by surprise was Harrison Ford.

Based on a graphic novel by \u201cDerf\u201d Backderf, who grew up with the future serial killer in small-town Ohio, My Friend Dahmer offers happy summer cinemagoers a portrait of the lunatic as a confused young man.\nThere are pointers to the grim perversions \u2013 necrophilia and the preservation of inner organs \u2013 that characterised Dahmer\u2019s reign of horror in the 1980s, but, before the final madness arrives, little confirmation of his psychopathy is offered.\nThose unaware of Dahmer\u2019s fate could see the film as an angular take on 1970s loserdom played to melodies from the Lars Von Trier songbook (stark, liquid camerawork; awkward riffs on learning disability). Most of the audience will experience something else: a variation on Carrie that ends with the actual death of 17 men.\nLike that Stephen King story, My Friend Dahmer reminds us what a terrifying, disabling place the American high school can be. Early on, we learn that young Jeffrey (Ross Lynch) \u2013 pudding-bowl hair and bad glasses like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Boogie Nights \u2013 is coping badly with squabbling parents.\nHis bi-polar mom (an excellent Anne Heche) insists the family eat her under-cooked chicken. His dad (Dallas Roberts), a chemist, foolishly lends Jeffrey acid to help experiments in the preservation of dead animals. Unsurprisingly, Dahmer is bullied at school, but, out of nowhere, he wins oddball friends by perfecting a noisy impersonation of people with learning difficulties. Soon he is \u201cspazzing\u201d for their entertainment in the local mall.\nLynch works hard at perfecting the slumped, dead-eyed lurch of the perpetual loner. The film\u2019s unwillingness to break through his carapace can be frustrating, but one thing that sets such psychopaths aside is surely their impenetrability. The film is not so naive as to suggest that some intervention could have made Dahmer a different person.\nMy Friend Dahmer is nonetheless a sad film about squandered opportunity. Everybody is losing out in this grim, claustrophobic version of the late 1970s. Not for nothing does the director insert snippets from Pere Ubu\u2019s Final Solution in the closing minutes. \u201cDon\u2019t need a cure/ Don\u2019t need a cure/ Need a final solution.\u201d Eugh!"}

Organizations can typically use this container technology to avoid application version conflicts when producing software builds, for instance.\nMicrosoft released its service-enabled System Center Configuration Manager 2016 component of the System Center 2016 management suite about a year ago to keep pace with managing Windows 10 clients.

Its officials hold coordination meetings most weekdays with one another and with staff members from the 20 embassies of individual member nations in Sarajevo and from international bodies.\nFew can envy Stefan Feller, head of the union\u2019s police mission, whose job is to improve law enforcement in a country of four million people with 15 police agencies.

For example, the survey found that 22 percent of companies had reduced subsidies for covered dependents and that 18 percent of companies had added a surcharge for adult dependents with access to other health coverage.\nMore employers are adopting pay-for-performance strategies in which companies steer employees to high-quality hospitals or doctors for specific procedures, use health care systems with an integrated delivery model, or set a pricing cap on benefits for medical services, the survey found.\nAon Hewitt said the data is derived from its Health Value Initiative database, which captures health care cost and benefit data for 561 large U.S. employers representing 13 million participants, more than 1,260 plans and $64.8 billion in 2014 health care spending."}

The country is therefore expected to ask Noble Energy for confirmation that drilling does not reach Lebanese territory, and also to warn the company that as long as it works for \"the Israeli enemy\" and the issue is not resolved, it must avoid producing gas in order to preserve any quantity of natural gas that might be found to belong to Lebanon."}

Even as a rumor, as Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research put it in an advisory note to investors, the idea was \u201cnuts\u201d because Broadcom and CA are US companies with the majority of their personnel in America.\nThe US Department of Defense emitted a statement that read: \u201cOur initial assessment is that this is likely to be a fraudulent document.\u201d Uncle Sam's financial watchdog the SEC, and Justice Department prosecutors, are likely to investigate whether the fake memo was an attempt to manipulate Broadcom and CA stock prices.\nWe have learned that a fraudulent memo purported to be signed by the US Department of Defense (\"DoD\") is circulating among Senators and members of Congress referencing the possible need for review of Broadcom's acquisition of CA Technologies (NASDAQ: CA) by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\"CFIUS\"). We have been informed by DoD officials that this memo is in fact a forged document.\nBefore Broadcom's statement hit wide circulation, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) appeared to echo the sentiments in the fake memo, urging Treasury officials to investigate the takeover on national security grounds.\nHis letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cited CFIUS's recommendation earlier this year against the proposed Broadcom/Qualcomm merger.\n\u201cSimply because Broadcom recently moved its domicile to the United States does not mean that it is no longer a Chinese-controlled company or that the national security concerns previously expressed by CFIUS no longer persist. Given the circumstances surrounding the proposed takeover of CA Technologies by Broadcom, a CFIUS review is entirely appropriate\u201d, he wrote.\nBroadcom predecessor Avago was American rather than Chinese: it was spun out of HP as Agilent, bought by KKR and Silver Lake Partners, renamed Avago, and incorporated in Singapore for tax reasons. It renamed itself to Broadcom after acquiring that company in 2015. Broadcom's heritage is similarly American: it was founded by a professor and student from UCLA, Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas, respectively, in 1991.\nApparently, the timing of Paul's letter is pure coincidence. His chief strategist Doug Stafford tweeted on Wednesday a denial that Paul's office was reacting to the memo.\n\u201cNo one here has seen a memo or basing the need for CFIUS review on anything other than the obvious national security implications of this merger. Broadcom had national security issues in a CFIUS review just earlier this year and this review should be undertaken immediately\u201d, Stafford wrote in the tweet."}

AVA currently licenses pet shops and pet farms, some of which have commercial pet boarding facilities, she added.\nBeyond the Code of Animal Welfare, AVA can take enforcement action against pet boarding businesses under the Animals and Birds Act for failing in this duty of care, or for animal cruelty.\nIn December last year, authorities had raided the premises of Platinium Dogs Club as part of an investigation into reports of alleged mistreatment of animals at the centre.\nIn response to Ms Sun's comments on the review of rules for the pet boarding industry, Mr Ng asked whether there is a list of of pet boarders that can be referred to in the meantime, so that spot checks can be done proactively in order to prevent abuse.\nMs Sun replied that AVA maintains a list of commercial boarders in pet farms. Mr Ng, however, said that the issue may lie in premises such as Platinum Dogs Club, which are not housed in pet farms.\n\"Pet boarders are currently not required to be licensed unless they are on farmland. I think we need to be mindful that there are many pet boarders out there who are do-gooders, well-meaning pet lovers who provide pet boarding facilities,\" Ms Sun replied.\nAt present, under the Animal and Birds Act, offenders who fail in their duty of care towards the animals in the course of conducting an animal-related business may face a fine of up to S$40,000 and/or a jail term of up to two years, if convicted."}

The goal matches the slogan: \"Pay your dues before you booze.\"\nBefore stumbling out of the Starboard after a night of drinking, or instead of staying in bed the next morning fighting off a hangover, Blair Jost is out to make sure you feel a little less guilty about your weekend debauchery at the beach.\nJost, 36, is into year two of running Dewey Beach Fit, a workout instruction class at the Delaware beaches' biggest party town, right at the entrance to the beach off Dagsworthy Street.\nA graduate of Lake Forest High School in Felton, Jost had been coming to the Delaware beaches all throughout her childhood. She moved to Dewey after graduating from the University of Delaware with a degree in theater production. Her stage became Starboard, where she tended bar.\nIn search of a change of scenery, she picked up and moved to New York when she was 26. After a few years of service industry work, with summers in Dewey, she was turned on to the world of fitness and dove in head first, becoming a certified instructor. She stopped coming down to the beach to grow her business. Still a resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Jost is a personal trainer, teaches classes at a gym and also runs a boot camp workout at Carl Schurz Park along the East River.\nBut after realizing a lot of her clients were fleeing the city for the summer, she turned her eyes back to Dewey, where last year \u2014 after planning out a logo and getting ads out \u2014 she launched Dewey Beach Fit.\nIt came with some struggles.\nShe learned the hard way. Empty classes. Sometimes just a few signups. Sundays, she figured out, weren\u2019t a good day. Last summer was full of trial and error.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like getting your teeth kicked in over and over again,\u201d Jost said.\nShe found social media to be a powerful tool. By the end of the summer, classes started filling out. Back in New York, regular Dewey participants would contact her when they were in the city to go work out.\nFully ingrained in the Dewey community, Jost has used her connections to her advantage. Starboard provides free water to Dewey Beach Fit participants. And when it rains, Northbeach, on the bayside, has a covered sand area that Jost uses for class.\nThis year, she\u2019s added yoga to the mix. Missy Radcliffe, an instructor at Ignite in Rehoboth, is heading up yoga classes under the Dewey Beach Fit umbrella.\nJost will leave NYC for the summer and begin classes on a more regular schedule come the last week in June.

He was only able to serve one of the three years of his first term in Congress.\n\u201cOur concern here is, why would the groups with the votes be made to suffer?\u201d Colmenares said.\nColmenares also pointed out that the Comelec should determine the \u201creal threshold\u201d for the party-list groups\u2019 votes.

Activities include identifying and understanding what objects are in space, ensuring uninterrupted satellite operations, and avoiding satellite collisions.\n* The CAF rely on space for a wide-range of functions such as command and control, weather information, navigation, communications, mapping, and search and rescue.\n* This collaboration aims to help address threats to the integral space assets of all nations, whether by debris, collisions with other satellites, or other means.\n* By working with our closest allies, we can leverage key Canadian contributions, such as the Sapphire satellite, in exchange for access to other capabilities. This will help avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts, allowing us to make the best use of taxpayer money.\nQ1. What is the nature of this agreement?\nA1. This Combined Space Operations partnership among the armed forces of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States enables the sharing of space-related information and resources to synchronize space operations among the partners and to provide enhanced awareness of the space environment. This partnership will allow for more effective and coordinated use of space capabilities through cooperation on activities such as identifying and understanding what objects are in space, ensuring uninterrupted satellite operations, and avoiding satellite collisions.\nQ2. Why is this important for Canada?\nA2. Cooperation is especially important given Canada\u2019s extensive military and civilian use of space-based capabilities. The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) rely on space for a wide-range of functions such as command and control, weather information, navigation, communications, mapping, and search and rescue. Space-based technology also has a range of civilian uses from internet banking transactions and telecommunications to airplane travel.\nQ3. What sort of information will be shared?\nA3. The information shared through this international space partnership will help Canada in several areas of mutual international interest. These include data on satellite orbits (which will help prevent collisions), accuracy of GPS signals, methods to prevent interference with satellite communications, and space weather. Sharing orbital data is particularly important for objects that may re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as it allows for a better projection of re-entry paths, providing better warning in the event of dangers to populated areas. The partnership demonstrates the continued dedication and strong commitment of the partners to encouraging the responsible and peaceful use of space for all.\nQ4. How does DND benefit from international cooperation in space?\n* Sapphire: Canada\u2019s first dedicated operational military satellite, Sapphire detects manmade objects in orbit, and transmits data to the U.S.-led Space Surveillance Catalogue dedicated to preventing satellite collisions.\n* Wideband Global SATCOM: Led by the U.S., this program provides guaranteed, secure access to high-capacity frequencies for government communications. As costs are shared among seven partner nations, this program allows the CAF to economically meet its need for strategic satellite communications.\n* Protected Military SATCOM project: This program will provide near-worldwide, secure, survivable, and jam-resistant communications for high-priority military ground, sea and air assets. Program goals will be achieved through participation in the U.S.-led Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite system.\n* Multi-National Experiments: This is a concept development and experimentation project jointly undertaken every"}

But some climate investigators say a naked northernmost ocean may also screw up weather to the south.\nFor the past several years, a pair of atmospheric scientists \u2014 Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University and Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison \u2014 have pushed the hypothesis that connects diminishing sea ice up north with increasingly erratic weather across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere.\nBut the idea that a lack of sea ice sends swirling air masses south and smacks us with horrid, frigid winters has stirred controversy in climate science. Some critics point to climate models and weather measurements that fail to match such predictions.\nNow, with Arctic sea ice so sparse, conditions are ripe to test \u2014 and litigate \u2014 their idea that a melting North Pole means decades of extreme winter weather for the northern half of the planet.\n\u201cJennifer Francis\u2019 hypothesis is still controversial,\u201d Darryn Waugh, a professor of atmospheric science at Johns Hopkins University, told BuzzFeed News. New studies from other researchers that build on the theory, including one just last month, simply \u201cstirred the pot,\u201d he said.\nWhile there is overwhelming scientific consensus that heat-trapping gases released by burning fossil fuels are warming the planet (in particular at the poles), the debate shows there is still a fracas over the finer ways in which Earth\u2019s climate will change. The idea, first outlined in a 2012 paper in Geophysical Research Letters, involves a narrow current of westerly winds that circumnavigates the top of the globe, called the polar jet stream.\nAccording to Francis and Vavrus, when the temperature difference between the Arctic and tropics is great, the jet stream circles the Earth rapidly, hugging the northern latitudes. The winds whips by so quickly that airlines flying from New York to London will often soar into the swift current to save on fuel.\nBut as the Arctic warms and that temperature difference between the pole and equator decreases, they argue, those winds slow down. And like slow-moving river meandering through a desert, the diminished jet stream wobbles over the northern portions of North America, Europe and Asia.\nThose waves in the jet stream funnel high-altitude surges of cold air spinning around the North Pole \u2014 best known as the polar vortex \u2014 south.\nSea ice shows the median extent for October 2016, the latest available. \"Normal\" ice edge is the median for October between 1981 and 2010. Jet stream shows a snapshot of winds 60 knots and greater at an altitude of about 32,000 feet on November 28.\nBut critics, such as Martin Hoerling, a meteorologist at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), doubt that the the frigid Arctic can hold such sway over the path the jet stream cuts. They argue weather systems are ultimately driven by energy \u2014 and more energy is put into the atmosphere in the tropics, where the sun shines year round, than at the chilly poles.\nSome powerful computer simulations of Earth\u2019s climate, including several analyzed by Hoerling and his team, also fail to show the pattern of warm"}

A wave of mergers and acquisitions sent respectably performing agencies tumbling down the rankings, as well as ensuring that only one independent?Edelman?remained in the top 10.\nLeading agency IPR, parent of Shandwick, Golin/Harris and Weber, surrendered its independent status by selling out to US communications giant Interpublic.\nIt subsequently changed its name to International (rather than Independent) PR. Its new owners will be pleased to see that it retained the top slot.\nBut the deal that caused all the furor was the takeover of Dewe Rogerson by Citigate's parent company, Incepta. The dollars 43.2 million agreement at the end of last year propelled the merged Citigate Dewe Rogerson into third place with an 8% income hike. The move shunted Hill & Knowlton down one slot, despite its impressive 24% income growth, and also robbed Countrywide Porter Novelli of fourth place.\n'Consolidation is the most visible trend at the moment and it's likely to continue for some time,' says Countrywide managing director Paul Miller.\n'The trend is also being caused by the increasing interest of international communications groups in PR, coupled with a desire among agencies for a global reach,' Miller adds.\nThere were other significant moves. In March, successful agency Charles Barker added the BSMG suffix to its name following its takeover by US group BSMG Worldwide in 1997. The agency's more international outlook was reflected by the appointment of Charles Barker chief executive officer Tim Sutton to the role of BSMG Europe CEO.\nOne place below Charles Barker, Ketchum was catapulted into the top 10 when it acquired Life PR from its Omnicom sister company GGT, helping to boost income by 69%. In its former incarnation, Life was Lynne Franks PR, founded by the one-time doyenne of the UK PR scene and the inspiration for the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous.\nFurther down the charts, GCI/APCO boosted its income by 45% and moved up two places to number 14 after buying its affiliate, Focus Communications.\nIn fact, the bigger agencies are beginning to recognize that the specialists represent a threat, particularly in the rapidly-growing healthcare and hi-tech sectors.\nHis thoughts are echoed by Jason Gallucci, business development director at Hill & Knowlton. 'One of the biggest problems facing larger agencies is that they are perceived as too generalist compared to the specialist boutiques.' H&K has seven specialist units effectively acting as separate agencies. 'The selling point to clients is that we can orchestrate these units to provide an integrated campaign,' Gallucci says.\nAmong other challenges facing the industry, evaluation is still high on the agenda, with agencies devising various ways of tackling the issue.\nConsolidation has also given agencies access to a wide range of disciplines.\nThe appointment of number 18 Fishburn Hedges, which beat out a number of major advertising agencies, as lead agency for a worldwide review of oil giant Shell International's communications strategy was a coup.\nAnother issue peculiar to the UK is the government's seeming lack of commitment to the single currency.

Its shares have lost approximately 16% of their market capitalization in the second-half, after a robust performance in the first-half. However, this drop in its share price in my opinion offers an opportunity for value investors to buy more of the shares as the company continues to benefit from its downstream business that is offsetting the decline in the upstream segment.\nLet us have a look.\nBP\u2019s replacement cost profit for the third-quarter came in at $1.8 billion, up 39% from the second-quarter of 2015. This strapping performance in its replacement costs profit can be attributed to strong refining margins and its efforts of significantly lowering its unit cash costs as well as improvement in the capital efficiency.\nFor instance, these initiatives have allowed the company to lower its capital expenditure this year. BP now expects its capital expenditure to be in the range of $19 to $20 billion as against the previously stated capital expenditure of $24-$26 billion for the year. In fact, the company expects its organic capital expenditure to remain in the range of $17 to $19 billion per annum through to 2017.\nIn addition, the company is significantly divesting its non-core assets. In fact, it plans to achieve approximately $10.00 billion in divestment programs by this year end. Also, expects around $3 to $5 billion of divestment in 2016 and approximately $2 to $3 billion in 2017.\nBP is making this divestment as these non-core assets are not competitive at the current price environment. This divestment of the non-core assets will help the company to strengthen its balance sheet and invest in more productive assets that remains competitive against peers.\nBP is taking various initiatives in order to remain competitive during this lower commodity price environment that should withstand its growth. It has right-sized its business and reducing its operating costs meaningfully. Also, it is investing in the downstream business that offers plenty of opportunity to benefit from during the low oil and gas prices.\nShould Investors Buy BP?. InvestorGuide.com.

If the Elite feel that Ring of Honor isn't the place for them anymore, then there will be spots that become open that will be filled by other wrestlers tapping in to their potential. That is just how it is. People leave professional wrestling companies and other wrestlers fill those spots and find success. Ring of Honor has had wrestlers leave in the past and has survived and thrived. So, I don't see anything different happening if the Elite decide to leave.\"\n\"I've never really had these kind of stakes in Ring of Honor before. The situation, right now, is [ROH COO] Joe Koff said earlier in the year that he wasn't going to renew my contract. I've been trying to find reasons for him to change his mind and he hasn't yet. Now, we've come to a point where Marty [Scurll] has decided to put his number one [contender spot] that he won at Survival of the Fittest.

And, of course, Marty Scurll is one of the top wrestlers in the world. It is a big challenge. I'm really looking forward to it. I think I have Marty's number. No matter what happens, I'm going to do what I do best which is wrestle and we'll see how it goes.\"\n\"I think it is great that PCO has reinvigorated himself and reinvented his career. I don't know what he was doing the years prior to bursting on the independent scene and making a splash like he did. It is a great acquisition for ROH to have. I think the eyes of the wrestling world were sort of on PCO.

{"idx": "25874", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Packaging demand, inflationary pressures, the status of \"Wallula No. 3,\" and inventory levels are all topics shareholders should be conversant with.\nPackaging Corp. reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.18 last week, exceeding management's guidance of $2.16. After adjusting both the current and prior-year quarters for costs to convert the No. 3 paper machine at the company's Wallula, Washington mill to linerboard, Packaging Corp. reported EPS of $2.23, which outpaced Q3 2017's $1.68 in earnings by an impressive 33%. Below, we'll walk through key highlights from the earnings report that shareholders should consider when evaluating Packaging Corp.'s current condition.\nPackaging segment revenue rose 14% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driving total revenue up 10.4%, to $1.8 billion, and compensating for a slight decline in the paper segment, which dipped 6.3%, to $254.3 million.\nAs I discussed earlier this year, Packaging Corp. has fine-tuned its manufacturing operations over the last several quarters to take advantage of surging demand for cardboard packaging versus paper. The most visible aspect of this shift is the conversion of Wallula No. 3 from paper to packaging.\nDuring the last three months, the company hit record third-quarter corrugated shipments and achieved an all-time record for containerboard shipments.\nManagement is utilizing high demand to adjust pricing, which helps mitigate inflationary effects (which we'll address below). In the third quarter, price and mix improvement in the packaging segment contributed $0.38 of positive impact on EPS.\nIn a pattern similar to the last sequential quarter (Q2 2018), inflationary cost increases pressured the business. Packaging Corp. absorbed a $0.28 headwind in the form of operating cost increases over the last three months. Rising wages formed a prominent drag on costs in the third quarter, and management has signaled continuing wage inflation into the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIn addition, fuel expense impeded results, producing a drag of $0.08 on EPS (exclusive of the $0.28 in general operating costs above). Fuel costs are expected to rise again in the fourth quarter against the prior year, as management believes already elevated fuel prices will climb incrementally due to seasonally cold weather.\nSo far, the conversion of the Wallula No. 3 machine can be labeled a clear success. During the company's third-quarter earnings conference call, CEO Mark Kowlzan reminded investors that \"when we started up [the machine] in the first week of June, within the first two hours, we were selling premium high performance virgin kraft linerboard.\"\nThe No. 3 machine is currently out of service in a planned outage for the final implementation of conversion after which it will be able to run \"all out.\" By the beginning of November, the machine will be operating at its full capacity of 1,150 tons per day versus the 700 to 800 tons of daily output it recorded in the initial conversion phase.\nIn both the company's press release and its earnings conference call, Packaging Corp.'s management relayed to investors that inventory levels expanded significantly in the third quarter versus the prior-year quarter.\nContainerboard inventory jumped by 50,000 tons against the second quarter of 2018 and by 84,"}

The latest evidence came on Monday night, when Barack Obama turned himself into the country\u2019s Instagrammer-in-Chief. While en route to Alaska to promote his climate agenda, the president took a photograph of a mountain range from a window on Air Force One and posted the shot on the popular picture-sharing network. \u201cHey everyone, it's Barack,\u201d the caption read. \u201cI'll be spending the next few days touring this beautiful state and meeting with Alaskans about what\u2019s going on in their lives. Looking forward to sharing it with you.\u201d The photo quickly racked up thousands of likes.\nAnd then there\u2019s Donald Trump. If Sanders is a king, Trump is a god.

What Trump understands is that the best way to dominate the online discussion is not to inform but to provoke.\nTrump\u2019s glow may fade\u2014online celebrity has a fast-burning wick\u2014but his ability to control the agenda this summer says a lot about the changing dynamics of political races. If traditional print and broadcast media required candidates to be nouns\u2014stable, coherent figures\u2014social media pushes them to be verbs, engines of activity. Authority and respect don\u2019t accumulate on social media; they have to be earned anew at each moment. You\u2019re only as relevant as your last tweet.\nThe more established among this year\u2019s candidates have been slow to learn this lesson. That\u2019s particularly true of Clinton and Bush, the erstwhile shoo-ins. Their Twitter tiff was an exception to their generally anodyne presence on social media. They\u2019ve played it safe, burnishing their images as reliable public servants while trying to avoid any misstep that might blow up into a TV controversy. Bush\u2019s various social-media feeds come off as afterthoughts. They promote his appearances, offer kudos to his endorsers and provide links to his merchandise store. What they don\u2019t do\u2014at least until he launched a Twitter attack on Trump yesterday\u2014is make news. Clinton\u2019s postings have been equally bland. Her Facebook feed is a mirror image of her Twitter feed, and both aim to give followers a warm-and-fuzzy feeling about the candidate.\nClinton\u2019s predicament is a particularly painful one. She\u2019s spent years filing the burrs off her personality, only to find that rough edges are in. Back in June, her campaign issued an Official Hillary 2016 Playlist on Spotify.

If you have a major water leak, you must take care to completely dry both the carpet and padding or mold may grow on the padding. If mold grows, the padding should be replaced. Pet accidents are another common reason to pull up old padding and replace it.\nTo get to the padding, you need to pull up the carpet along the wall nearest the damaged area of carpet pad. Wooden tack strips hold the edge of the carpet in place. Typically, the tack strips are less than an inch away from the wall. The tacks are sharp, so use caution. Pull back enough carpet to expose the area of carpet pad that you need to replace. Fold or roll the carpet so it won\u2019t be in your way as you work.\nUsing a razor knife, cut around the section of padding you are removing so you can pull it away from the rest of the padding. A floor scraper works well to scrape the old padding off the floor. The scraper removes old adhesive and it also helps loosen staples so you can pull them out. Do not remove the tack strips. If you\u2019re removing the pad because of pet stains, you must cover the odor so the pet doesn\u2019t soil the new padding as well. Use a primer designed to stop stains and odors to cover the subfloor and let it dry completely. Take a scrap of the old carpet pad to the carpet store to find one that\u2019s a similar thickness and density. A carpet pad with a moisture barrier is a good choice if you are covering a pet stain. If the animal soils the floor again, moisture won\u2019t soak all the way through the padding.\nCarpet padding has a smooth side and a waffled side. Place the new pad so the waffled side faces up. Overlap the edges of the new and old padding to cut straight, abutting edges by holding a straightedge tool over the overlapped edges and drawing a razor knife along the straightedge. Discard the excess pieces. The padding shouldn\u2019t cover the tack strips, so you need to trim it to lie alongside the strips. Use duct tape to hold the seams in place. Staple the padding about every 6 inches to hold it to the subfloor. If the subfloor is concrete, use flooring adhesive to hold the padding in place.\nWhen the padding is in place, unfold the carpet and lay it back in place. Lightly press the carpet\u2019s backing onto the tack strip. For best results, use a carpet knee-kicker tool to help you restretch the carpeting firmly onto the tack strip. When the carpet is in place, a carpet stair tool, which you can also rent, helps you tuck the carpet\u2019s edges under the shoe molding along the wall.\nBrown, Denise. \"How to Replace Carpet Padding.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/replace-carpet-padding-36742.html.

The U.S.-led war has reached a point where questions are being raised about what comes next.\nSo far, the answer seems likely to be: more war.\nThat\u2019s partly because the U.S. strategy for defeating the Islamic State relies on a variety of regional allies and local armed groups who are often bitterly at odds. Though all of them regard the Islamic State as an enemy, most of them regard one another as enemies, too. As they conquer territory from the militants, they are staking out claims to the captured lands in ways that risk bringing them into conflict with others who are also seizing territory. New wars are brewing, for control of the post-Islamic State order.\nHere is a list of 10 of them, in no particular order. There are doubtless more. Some have already started. Others may never happen. But any one of them could increase the Islamic State\u2019s chances of survival, perpetuating the conditions that enabled the group to thrive \u2014 and perhaps entangling the United States in the region for many years to come.\nThis is one of the wars that have already started, and it is also one of the more complicated ones. Turkey, which is fighting a war at home against separatist Turkish Kurds, has watched with alarm as Syrian Kurds have capitalized on U.S. support to expand Kurdish control over northeastern Syria. Syrian Arab rebels allied to Turkey are also opposed to the Kurdish expansion, which is encroaching on Arab areas. So when Turkey intervened in Syria two weeks ago to help Syrian rebels capture Islamic State territory, it was clear that the Kurds were as much of a target as the Islamic State. Fighting has since erupted, and though the United States has asked both sides to stop, it is unclear whether the it has enough leverage over its rival allies to prevent a deepening conflict.\nThis war would be similar to war No. 1, but bigger. For now, Turkey has confined its incursion into Syria to an area of Syria occupied by the Islamic State that is mostly Arab. But Turkey is just as worried about the de facto Kurdish state emerging along its border farther east. Kurds declared an autonomous region there earlier this year, and Turkey is now building a wall along the border to try to seal it off. If the tensions persist, a direct Turkish invasion of the Kurdish area \u2014 where a small number of U.S. troops also are based \u2014 can\u2019t be ruled out.\nThe Syrian government also feels threatened by the territorial ambitions of the Kurds. Until recently, they had maintained an uneasy alliance, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boasted on a number of occasions that his government provides the Kurds with arms. But the relationship has soured since the autonomy declaration by the Kurds, and the two sides have fought brief battles in areas where they both have forces.\nThere is now a cease-fire, but the Kurdish aspirations to self-rule are directly at odds with Assad\u2019s proclaimed goal of reasserting Syrian sovereignty over the whole country.\nThis is a war that could have erupted on any number of occasions in the five years since President Obama called for the ouster of Assad. That it hasn\u2019t is testimony to how much both sides want to avoid conflict. It still seems extremely unlikely. But there are a few front lines where the Islamic State war could at some point bring U.S.-backed groups into"}

Comparing any Republican presidential candidate to Hitler had been a standard Democratic political tactic for some time no matter how inappropriate it might be.\nBefore McGovern was comparing Nixon to Hitler, he was comparing Barry Goldwater to Hitler. Goldwater had a Jewish father and a distaste for Socialism, which would have made him unwelcome in the ranks of the racially and politically pure National Socialists, but that didn\u2019t stop the Hitler accusations from being hurled by the Democratic party and its political allies in the press.\nGovernor Pat Brown of California said, \u201cGoldwater's acceptance speech had the stench of fascism. All we needed to hear was Heil Hitler.\u201d Mayor Jack Shelley of San Francisco claimed that Goldwater strategists got all their ideas from Mein Kampf.\nEven though Goldwater had been an early NAACP member, NAACP leader Roy Wilkins warned, \"Those who say that the doctrine of ultra-conservatism offers no menace should remember that a man come out of the beer halls of Munich and rallied the forces of rightism in Germany. All the same elements are there in San Francisco now.\"\nUnion leaders launched a national campaign to denounce Goldwater as Hitler II. \"I have drawn a parallel between Goldwater and Hitler and I make no apology for drawing that parallel,\" George Meany of the AFL-CIO declared. While Goldwater wasn\u2019t Hitler, the CIO part of the AFL-CIO had strong Communist influences and after the Hitler-Stalin pact, some unions within it staged strikes to sabotage production and prevent aid from reaching the Allies who were fighting Hitler. Not only was Goldwater not Hitler, but some of the organizations represented by Meany had aided Hitler when Stalin told them to.\nAccusing Republicans of being Hitler for assorted petty reasons dates back to the time when Hitler was still around. FDR accused Republican candidate Wendell Willkie of using \u201cHitler tactics\u201d by repeating his slogans frequently. But it was the frequent associations of Republicans and Hitler by Democrats that was the true Big Lie. Its only purpose was a senseless association through the repetition of ridiculous and baseless accusations that every single Republican was just Hitler in a better suit.\nTypical of this tactic was Senator Tom Lantos ranting, \u201cIf you overlook your involvement in the KKK, or the Nazi party, or the Republican Party, you are lying.\u201d The issue at hand had nothing to do with Nazism. It was about Clinton\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture taking bribes. The goal was to associate Republicans with Nazism by classing the two together as frequently as possible regardless of relevance, decency or truth.\nIn the Iran-Contra trial, Oliver North was accused of \u201cfollowing Adolf Hitler\u2019s official strategy\u201d. What did one have to do with the other? Nothing. But this sort of lazy accusation had become typical and routine.

Those who want to can stay off the field, including in the locker room, until the anthem is finished. Players had been required to be on the field during the anthem.\nThe policy also allows franchises to develop their own policies, which could include fining players who protest by not standing.\nThe league could impose fines against a team if a player or representative on the sideline doesn\u2019t stand or \u201cshow respect\u201d during the anthem.\nThe move comes after other players joined the effort of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who in previous years chose to kneel during the national anthem as a form of protest against police brutality and racial inequality against people of color.\nThe issue has sparked national debate, including among civil rights groups.\n\u201cAs national organizations we are uniting to make clear that we stand with those players who chose to use their platform to call attention to ongoing police shootings of unarmed people in our country,\" Clarke said. \u201cThis is an issue that is not going away and will remain the subject of intense national interest.\"\nPresident Trump has repeatedly criticized players for kneeling during the anthem calling it unpatriotic and disrespectful to the flag.

One of the early turning points in the French Revolution, the people of Paris seized weapons from the armory at the Invalides, and marched in the direction of an ancient royal fortress, the Bastille. It signaled the first victory of the people of Paris against the symbol of the Ancien R\u00e9gime.\nThe United States was the guest of honor at this year\u2019s ceremony, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the entry of American troops onto French soil during World War I, and as a reaffirmation of the long-standing friendship between the U.S. and France.\n\u201cThe ties between the United States and France stretch back almost as far as our shared history as democratic republics. France is America\u2019s first and oldest ally. In 1778, our two countries signed a treaty of friendship and alliance.

He has been promising since the summer that he would declare an emergency, a technical step that can free up funds and loosen some regulations.\nThe new order will allow some limited new steps, such as enabling patients in rural parts of the country to access medication for addiction treatment through telemedicine, administration officials said.\nThe order also should allow federal agencies to redirect some existing grant money to focus on opioid-addicted patients.\nAnd it may make it easier for state Medicaid programs to pay for inpatient treatment for people with substance-abuse disorders, a practice that was restricted decades ago amid widely publicized abuses at many institutions.\nBut many public health officials have been urging White House to take more aggressive steps in response to an epidemic that is killing more people than AIDS did at the height of that crisis.\nAlthough Congress appropriated some additional money last year, most state leaders, public health officials and addiction specialists say much more is needed.\nThe administration still doesn\u2019t have a permanent Health and Human Services secretary or a director of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Trump\u2019s pick for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), recently withdrew his nomination.\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has worked for most of the year to roll back the Affordable Care Act, which has helped many states on the front line of the epidemic expand treatment for patients with a substance abuse disorder.\nRepublican plans to repeal the 2010 law, often called Obamacare, would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars of federal healthcare aid to these states and others.\nThe president stressed Thursday that the Trump administration has already taken steps to bolster the federal response to the opioid crisis.\nTrump also ticked off other efforts his administration is taking, including prosecuting drug traffickers, educating physicians about how to safely prescribe opioids and supporting research into nonaddictive pain medicines.\nThis week, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said his agency plans to encourage wider use of medications such as methadone and buprenorphine to treat patients with opioid addiction, a step widely seen as critical to addressing the crisis.\nThese so-called medication-assisted treatments continue to be stigmatized in many places.\nThose efforts \u2014 and some of the new steps announced by the president Thursday \u2014 could be helpful, said Dr. Corey Waller, an addiction specialist who has led efforts to confront the epidemic for the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

While some students in the audience questioned whether, as Winn claimed, a true feminist could be pro-life, four of those interviewed said Winn presented a side of the abortion debate that they had not previously heard.\nIn her talk before an audience of about 20 people, Winn reexamined nearly 200 years of feminism through a pro-life lens, beginning with the early 19th century.\nFurthermore, colleges must adjust to modern-day reality of pregnancy and high rates of abortion among students, Winn contested.\nAt a northeastern college health center that Feminists for Life works with, Winn said, 6,000 pregnancy tests were done in a single year and 300 of those tested positive.

For those who have had hip replacements, the National Institutes of Health recommends low-impact exercises such as walking, stationary bicycling, swimming and cross-country skiing.\nPhilippon advocates preventing hip replacements altogether through early detection of osteoarthritis, arthroscopy when necessary, and strengthening of the muscles around the hip through proper exercise.\n* Side-lying leg lift: lie on right side with right arm straight overhead.

This summer, he had lined up a job working with the Wareham Gatemen and was helping UMass Dartmouth head coach Bob Prince.\nWith Old Colony, Rodrigues worked closely with catcher Drew Sullivan, another student of the game, while trying to integrate analytics into the team\u2019s preparation.\nRodrigues' love affair with the intersection of analytics and old-school coaching took off when he started working with the Bourne Braves and had access to TrackMan, a massive database similar to MLB\u2019s StatTrack that covers everything from arm velocity and spin rate to exit velocity and fielding angles.\nSoon, he found a like-minded online community of other baseball quants, at all coaching levels, who simply wanted to share what they\u2019d learned and best practices they had picked up.\nOne of Rodrigues\u2019 unique talents was taking this analytic-heavy model and make it approachable and digestible for players who aren\u2019t heavy into bar graphs or line charts.\nAs Rodrigues\u2019 online following grew, a couple of Major League teams reached out to him.

A year later, his scheme would be formally christened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Venezuela, which sits atop what are arguably the biggest petroleum reserves in the world, was the only non-Middle Eastern country to be included \u2014 a testament to its importance to the global oil business.\nVenezuela was considered rich in the early 1960s: It produced more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s crude and had a per capita GDP many times bigger than that of its neighbors Brazil and Colombia \u2014 and not far behind that of the United States. At the time, Venezuela was eager to diversify beyond just oil and avoid the so-called resource curse, a common phenomenon in which easy money from commodities such as oil and gold leads governments to neglect other productive parts of their economies. But by the 1970s, Venezuela was riding a spike in oil prices to what looked like a never-ending economic bonanza. Complemented by years of stable democracy, it seemed a model country in an otherwise often troubled region.\nSuch success makes the sorry state of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry today, not to mention that of the country at large, all the more surprising \u2014 and tragic. The same state that, six decades ago, dreamed up the idea of a cartel of oil exporters now must import petroleum to meet its needs. Crude production has tanked, hitting a 28-year low last fall when it dipped under 2 million barrels a day. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a collapse of that magnitude [anywhere] without a war, without sanctions,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America expert at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\nThe combination of plummeting oil revenues and years of government mismanagement has virtually killed off the country\u2019s economy, sparking a humanitarian crisis that threatens to engulf the region.\nVenezuela has not, of course, fought a war in recent years. But the combination of plummeting oil revenues and years of government mismanagement has virtually killed off the country\u2019s economy, sparking a humanitarian crisis that threatens to engulf the region. Caracas refuses to track inflation (or at least publish its findings), but the National Assembly calculates the annual rate to be more than 4,000 percent, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it could hit 13,000 percent this year. Given how much prices have already risen since January, the real number could be 10 times higher.\nVenezuela\u2019s murder rate, meanwhile, now surpasses that of Honduras and El Salvador, which formerly had the world\u2019s highest levels, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory. Blackouts are a near-daily occurrence, and many people live without running water.

There was, to be clear, no apology in the statement, only an attempt to soothe the wounds reopened by the startling sight of the UP president flashing the triumphalist Marcos \u201cV\u201d sign alongside the dictator\u2019s eldest daughter.\nWhat comes off Concepcion\u2019s words, in fact, is a profound unreflectiveness not only about his responsibilities as caretaker of an institution with a hallowed tradition of activism, but, more gravely, about the very national history and memory that many of his old pals in that soir\u00e9e are systematically working to undermine, if not erase altogether.\nWas his early dalliance with the dictatorship\u2019s youth cadre wrong in any respect? Perhaps it was an association he regretted now as a mature, conscientious Filipino\u2014especially after everything that has come to light about the KB and its bloody history?\nSurely, for instance, he is familiar by now with the story of Archimedes Trajano. On Aug. 31, 1977, during one of the KB fora at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, the 21-year-old Mapua student questioned Imee Marcos\u2019 appointment as KB national chair. Witnesses recalled how Trajano was subsequently seized and dragged by the presidential daughter\u2019s bodyguards and how, days later, his body was found on the street with marks of severe torture.\nTrajano\u2019s mother had to wait until after the Marcoses were ousted before she could file charges of \u201cfalse imprisonment, kidnapping, wrongful death, and a deprivation of rights\u201d in a Hawaii court. She later won the damage suit.\nDoes Concepcion regret having been, in any way, part of such an organization? He didn\u2019t say. He expressed regret only for hurting his UP constituency, but not for his membership in what amounted to be the youth brigade of the Marcos dictatorship. Until now, it appears, he sees nothing wrong with the KB.\nThe implication disturbs: Even as the cream of the country\u2019s activist youth was being decimated by the martial law regime, was Concepcion perhaps having the time of his life as part of Imee Marcos\u2019 national posse, such that, decades later, all he can apparently summon of that dark period is his halcyon memories of youthful friendships made in that privileged cocoon?\nIt must be asked of the UP president: Is that dangerous obliviousness still there?"}

It also showed that many students have witnessed incidents of violence, harassment or other behaviors that can be potentially harmful to others.\nTo bring about this change, Rockland-Miller and UMass Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and Campus Life Enku Gelaye collaborated with other faculty, staff and student committees to develop a program that would address these issues.\nThis program, known as UMatter at UMass, is being launched this year. UMatter at UMass is a campaign that seeks to help students who feel disconnected on campus, encourage students to be proactive and reach out to those around them, raise awareness of the resources the University provides and ensure that UMass is a safe, caring and compassionate environment.\nRockland-Miller and Gelaye explained that at such a large school, it is easy for students to feel lost and disconnected.\n\u201cIn a big community, it\u2019s sort of easy to get lost in the crowd,\u201d Rockland-Miller said.\n\u201cFor some it doesn\u2019t come that easily,\u201d she continued.\nStudents who feel isolated and alone may experience depression, engage in risky behaviors or even have thoughts of suicide. Often, their peers do not realize that they need help, or do not know how to get them the help they need.\nIn situations where students are experiencing violence, harassment, bullying, hazing or sexual assault, it can be hard for others to step in and help. Many people feel uncomfortable or unsafe intervening, or simply do not know how to help or who to get help from.\nStudents who feel isolated or unsafe often do not know where to turn either. Gelaye points out that these students are more likely to go to a friend than to a University staff member.\nThe UMatter campaign will work to inform students, staff and faculty on how they can step up and help in these situations, and where they can get professional help when it is needed. It will also give students the tools they need to feel empowered on campus, and encourage them to take a proactive role in making the most out of their college experience and making the campus a compassionate and caring environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an affirmation of what we already do well to begin with,\u201d Gelaye said. \u201cThere are hundreds of people every day being kind to each other, helping people with resources, really being there for somebody in good times and bad times.\nTo encourage proactivity, the UMatter campaign is encouraging people to take an active bystander role. Gelaye and Rockland-Miller explained that to be active bystanders, students should intervene in situations that might be harmful or hurtful, or where someone feels isolated and alone. By intervening and helping someone out, students not only can change the life of that one individual, but they can also help make our community a more kind and caring place.\nTo demonstrate the idea of active bystandership, a student working on the UMatter committee created a poster as a visual. The poster describes active bystandership using three D\u2019s: Direct, distract and delegate. The first \u201cD\u201d is about directly intervening to stop a potentially harmful situation. The second \u201cD\u201d involves distracting a person from acting inappropriately.

Vaccinations are injected into an arm muscle in a 3-step process. After the first injection, the arm shot is repeated 1 month and 6 months later. This vaccine regimen works in most people, providing them with long-term protection and, for some, even life-long protection. Other injection schedules are available to meet various individual situations. A blood test can determine if the vaccine has \"taken\" in people who have experienced specific exposure to hepatitis B. This would include someone who is a sexual partner of a hepatitis B carrier or household members who have been living with a carrier. People using the vaccine for general risk reduction do not normally need to have the blood test after the shots are completed. You should discuss this with your doctor or health care professional at a clinic.\nWhile everybody may benefit from hepatitis B vaccines, there are certain situations in which vaccination is especially important. People at high risk include household and sexual contacts of an infected person, gay or bisexual men, IV drug users, newborns of infected mothers, those who handle blood or blood products, hemodialysis patients, and travelers to countries where there's a high incidence of hepatitis B in the community.\nThis may be the most important group that requires vaccination. The Public Health Agency of Canada now strongly recommends that all newborns of infected mothers receive immune globulin and a dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth with additional doses of hepatitis vaccines within 6 months of birth (the number of doses may vary depending on whether the baby is pre mature).\nWho should not receive the vaccine?\nPeople who have already been infected with hepatitis B, or those who have become immune to hepatitis B from a previous vaccination, do not need to be vaccinated.\nStephen Sacks, MD, FRCPC, with updates by the MediResource clinical team."}

Taking place at a critical time for the company, just as it's supposed to begin ramping up Model S sales significantly higher and shortly after the Model X launch, investors will be watching closely.\nHere's what investors need to know going into the earnings release.\nOn average, analysts expect Tesla to report revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26 billion and a loss of $0.48. These results compare to year-ago revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $932 million and $0.02.\nThe expected jump in Tesla's revenue reflects the company's already reported 49% year-over-year growth in Q3 vehicle sales.\nTesla's expected non-GAAP loss reflects the company's outsized year-over-year growth in research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue as the company invests in the growth of its service and sales footprint and the R&D associated with the Gigafactory, Model X, and Model 3.\nNotably, however, the company's operating leverage is beginning to improve on a sequential basis, and the company said during its second-quarter letter to shareholders that Tesla expects this trend to continue.\nTesla noted in its second-quarter letter to shareholders that it expected operating expenses to grow 5 to 10% sequentially in Q3. To ensure management is executing as planned, it would be worth investors' time to check in on the metric to see if the company followed through accordingly.\nLikely the most closely watched figure when Tesla reports third-quarter results will be its guidance for Q4.\nBut after Tesla's second quarter, it reduced its expectations for the full year, providing a new guidance range of 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles for the full year, citing \"many dependencies that could influence our Q4 production and deliveries.\"\nWe are still testing the ability of many suppliers to deliver high quality production parts in quantities sufficient to meet our planned production ramp [for Model X]. Since production ramps rapidly late in Q4, a one-week push out of this ramp due to an issue at even a single supplier could reduce Model X production by approximately 800 units for the quarter. Furthermore, since Model S and Model X are produced on the same general assembly line, Model X production challenges could slow Model S production.\nGuidance for 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles for the full year, however, is still impressive. With Tesla delivering just over 11,500 vehicles in Q3 as planned, it will need to deliver about 17,000 vehicles during Q4 to achieve the bottom end of its guidance range for the full year. This would represent huge year-over-year and sequential growth for Tesla's vehicle deliveries.\nTesla's Model X SUV. Image source: Tesla Motors.\nWith little sign of Tesla ramping up Model X production to a meaningful level, it raises questions about whether Tesla can live up to its own target. Will growth in Model S sales offset lacking Model X vehicles if production of the new vehicle fails to live up to Tesla's expectations?\nTesla's third-quarter earnings will definitely be a quarter worth tuning into.

Such practices take observation, systematic documentation, and artful analysis of the city, as given, as a precondition to any designed intervention. For our purposes Empirical Urbanism is a framework for revealing the sometimes hidden philosophical assumptions, and design alibis among a diverse group of urban theories and practices that, while often thought to represent opposing ideologies, share an empirical approach.\nThis symposium will interrogate this trend, asking how urbanism as an art and a set of practices may gain from more explicitly deciphering the relationship between the ways we characterize the past and present city, and how we go about projecting alternate futures for it. Our title notwithstanding, we do not imagine an end to empirical urban research.

Kalem said, \u201cWar is never a lasting solution for any problem.\u201d However, is that statement completely true? War, through the ages, has brought great advances and solutions in medicine.\nPerhaps the first innovation in medicine that evolved during warring times came with drilling holes through the boney skulls of warriors whose heads were smashed in by clubs. Once a hole was made, one could insert a finger and pull out the caved-in skull bone with the added benefit of providing an escape hole for bleeding, releasing pressure off the brain. There are museums that have 7,000-year-old skulls with healed over burr holes, and this treatment called trephination, is still done today.\nDuring the 1700 and 1800s, the world-wide imperialism of the British came from their conquering navy. This was partially because the Brits knew lime and lemon juice with vitamin C prevented scurvy which is a life-threatening progressive condition of profound weakness, gum disease, skin ulcers and bleeding. Opposing navies riddled with scurvy had no chance against the Brits.\nDuring the Crimean War of the 1850s, Florence Nightingale and her team of newly trained nurses showed how nursing made a difference. They cleaned up injured soldiers, provided a warm dry bed, gave healing nutrition and, in general, cared for the soldier, which remarkably reduced the death rate by two-thirds. Nursing grew from that beginning.\nThe Civil War brought the advancement of anesthesia with easily used ether and the education of myriads of surgeons who spread their surgical skills throughout the country after the war. Also, the Civil War generated the development of the ambulance wagon, an effective method of transferring the injured from the battlefield to a place for treatment and comfort. For example, in the battle of Antietam, every wounded-living Union soldier was off the battlefield by the end of the day.\nDuring the Boer War and World War I, X-Ray machines became available at portable hospitals, facilitating the repair of boney injuries. The field of orthopedics evolved as surgeons had growing trauma experience along with the aid of anesthesia and antisepsis. Also, blood transfusions and intravenous fluids came to be used during WWI and brought into reality how very sick people no longer had to die from dehydration.\nCivil War General William T. Sherman said, \u201cWar is cruelty . . . and at best barbarism. Its glory is all moonshine . . . war is hell.\u201d That said, in response to the terrible injuries and illnesses of war, we have learned and improved medicine in ways to relieve suffering and enhance healing during times of both war and peace."}

But it buys more happiness when you\u2019re young.\nWe\u2019re frequently told, by news-you-can-use segments and bank ads hawking savings accounts, that Americans are not saving enough for their retirements. Yet just as often we\u2019re reminded that, given the fleeting nature of human existence, we should eat, drink, and be merry while we still can. Thriftiness is making a comeback in the wake of our latest speculative bubble, but some new evidence may help to tip the scales back in favor of the carpe diem approach to life. It turns out that money can buy you happiness\u2014but young people get a lot more happiness out of their dollars than old people do.\nRecent research by economists Amy Finkelstein, Erzo Luttmer, and Matthew Notowidigdo suggests that you\u2019ll get a bigger bang for your consumer buck by spending while you\u2019re healthy, before old age starts to take the fun out of life\u2019s indulgences. Their research is part of a larger academic enterprise attempting to understand what makes us happy. Economics is a field more associated with rational calculation than emotion, but there\u2019s an ever-growing subculture of \u201chappiness economists.\u201d Just as mainstream economists spend their time figuring out things like gross national product\u2014how much a country produces in dollar terms\u2014these happiness scholars churn out numbers like gross national happiness (how much happiness a country produces).\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to measure things like corporate profits and trade flows. Measuring a person\u2019s psychic well-being is trickier, though happiness economists take a relatively straightforward approach: For the most part, they just ask people if they\u2019re happy. They then try to figure out what makes people say yes or no. Perhaps not surprisingly, money-obsessed economists have been fixated on whether higher incomes make us happier. And after much debate, their conclusion is that money does indeed buy happiness. Or, as an economist would put it, there\u2019s a positive marginal utility of consumption. People in rich countries say they\u2019re happier than people in poor countries, and in just about every nation, the well-to-do report being happier than their impoverished counterparts.\nOf course, an extra dollar may not bring the same joy to all people. For some, happiness is only as far away as the next swipe of their Amex; for others, there\u2019s pleasure to be had in having nothing at all. It\u2019s also true that what makes us happy today might not do the trick tomorrow\u2014the money-happiness connection may change throughout a person\u2019s lifetime.\nHow does ill health affect this relationship? Healthy people are happier than sick ones. That\u2019s obvious. But once you\u2019re sick, does money buy you more happiness or less? On the one hand, you can\u2019t enjoy your new Mustang convertible if you\u2019re laid up in the hospital. On the other hand, money can buy a lot of comforts for those suffering from debilitating illness (a full-time housekeeper; a nice, soft La-Z-Boy).\nFinkelstein and her co-authors use the \u201cHealth and Retirement Survey,\u201d which follows a sample of retired persons, asking them questions about, among other things, income, health, and whether they agree with the statement \u201cMuch of the time I was happy during the past week.\u201d The study allowed the researchers to determine whether rich retirees say they\u2019re happier than poor retirees.

No matter what the circumstances that led to your filing -- large medical bills or a job loss, for example -- you probably feel embarrassed and afraid that no one's going to want to give you the time of day, much less a decent loan.\n\"The most important thing to know is that you do have options,\" says Phil Reed, senior consumer advice editor for the car buying platform Edmunds.com. He says lenders are interested in working with borrowers who are recovering from financial problems, and in fact some dealerships are eager to sell them a car. \"You shouldn't assume that no one will talk with you and that you have to take whatever someone will give you,\" he says.\nYeah, checking your credit probably feels a little like pulling a bandage off a big gaping wound. It's not going to be pretty. But the lender is going to check your credit, so you might as well know what they are going to see. Besides, it's always a good idea to review your reports after bankruptcy because mistakes are not uncommon.\nYou can get your free annual credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com and you can get a free credit report summary from Credit.com that explains how lenders are likely to view your information. Although the lender will pull a customized credit score that likely differs from the one you see, it will still give you an idea of where you stand in general.\nPay particular attention to what the report says about previous auto loans, since those are often more heavily weighted in the credit scoring models used by auto lenders. Positive on-time car loan payments reported during and after bankruptcy can be helpful.\nConnecticut bankruptcy attorney Eugene Melchionne suggests asking yourself the following questions: \"Was there a previous car loan involved in the bankruptcy? Was that car loan reaffirmed?\" (When you reaffirm the loan you agree to continue to pay the loan balance rather than wiping it out.) \"If the loan is reaffirmed, then the tradeline (account) should be showing up on the credit report.\"\nIf you did not reaffirm a loan on a car you held onto in bankruptcy, then the account probably won't be on your credit reports, even if you have continued to make payments. \"In that case, I have the borrower go the dealer/lender prepared with proof of post-bankruptcy payments to create the history,\" Melchionne says.\nHopefully wiping out debt in bankruptcy improved your cash flow enough that you can save some money for a down payment. \"I tell my clients to plan on living an entire year on a cash-only basis and build up savings before getting back into the credit game,\" says Melchionne. The larger your down payment, the less risk your lender is taking. After all, they also have your vehicle as collateral. Need a set of wheels right away but short on cash? A trade-in can help toward a down payment, and you may be able to get more cash for your current vehicle if you sell it yourself.\nGather all your financial information (pay stubs, copy of your credit report, etc.) and dedicate a day to getting preapproved for a car loan. It's a good idea to limit your shopping to a single day to minimize the potential impact multiple inquiries may have on your credit scores.\nIdeally, try to get preapproved before you visit the dealership. \"Like any car buying expedition, you have the best leverage if you get approved for a loan before you shop,\" Northern California bankruptcy attorney Cathy Moran says.\nIf"}

They will study computer science, with special emphasis on topics relevant to game design such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, digital video and audio fundamentals. They will also study topics relevant to development of a game concept to the final \u2018shooting script\u2019 (prior to programming).\nSpecifically, students will gain knowledge of: digital media technologies; skills in programming, system analysis and integration of software components; and human computer interface and theories of perception, which will enable the student to develop computer-gaming situations.\nGraduates may pursue higher degrees by research or through taught postgraduate programmes. Owing to the research expertise in the university, students will have opportunities to work with distinguished researchers during the third-year summer break or carry out final-year projects under their supervision.\nWith the global games industry now worth US$20bn, which is more than the film industry, games development has become one of the hottest of all software sectors. Ireland has already stated its intention to be a games development hotbed with the Digital Hub in Dublin\u2019s Liberties district becoming home to several games firms.\nThe country\u2019s growing development community now comprises 22 companies, North and South, across a range of activities that includes mobile, multiplayer, PC and console games and middleware.\nThe shortage of suitably qualified graduates, however, is seen as a potential growth barrier so a number of third-level institutes have established games development courses in recent times. These include a new four-year degree course at Carlow Institute of Technology, which gives students a grounding in developing games for all the major games platforms and diploma courses at Ballyfermot Senior College and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.\nWhile there is a worldwide scarcity of games programmers, especially in the domains of graphics programming and computer simulation, employment possibilities in the computer games arena in Ireland and the UK are mainly in the area of games programming and design and games project management.\nCareer options include games programmer, graphics programming, visualisation, research and development in media and entertainment-related technologies.

But, if there is a quantity shortfall - with the production target of 464 million tonnes this financial year, it is likely to be - we may have to go for imports,\" Rao told Business Standard, days after a directive mandated CIL to supply coal at 80 per cent commitment level to power companies.\nThe presidential agreement came after the CIL board - even as it agreed to sign fuel supply agreements with power companies - turned down a directive by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) asking the coal miner to live up to its 80 per cent commitment. The presidential directive, however, provided some relief to the coal mining company by giving it the freedom to relax the 10 per cent penalty clause.\nBacking the government on the issue, Rao said: \"In my personal view, if the government gives orders to supply coal, a state-run company would be bound to do that. I don't think it would be a demon-like situation. For CIL, the biggest challenge is to meet the demand-supply gap and we will have to do every possible thing to meet the customers' demand.\"\nImporting coal may, however, drag the bottom line of CIL, given that the commodity globally follows the gross calorific value (GCV) and is much higher than domestic pricing. The company recently rolled back prices after widespread protests from end-users on the GCV-benchmarked pricing.\nRao said, to solve issues regarding pricing after the introduction of GCV, he is ready to open talks with all power and non-power sector players. \"We need to sit with them and resolve this appropriately. All the other issues, including setting up for technologies like bomb calorimeters are just procedural.\"\nAccording to sources in CIL, with the presidential directive in place, it requires an additional 70-80 mt coal to fuel 20,000 Mw power required for plants in place till 2011. Keeping this in mind and to find a solution to the environmental issues faced by the company, he said: \"My priority would be an increase in production and despatch. Rest are all in-house issues that will fall in place once we achieve higher production. From the current 435 mt, even if we reach the projected 464 mt, there may still be a shortfall. We have to rectify that. We can also talk and try to convince the Ministry of Environment and Forests on environmental issues.\"\nRao, who is currently CMD of Singareni Collieries, got his offer letter yesterday and is expected to take charge within two weeks. However, Rao remained quiet on the move of The Children's Investment Fund's to take legal action against the Kolkata-based company. He said he was not fully aware of the issue as he is \"not yet part of the board\"."}

Chaudhry Nisar\u2019s announcement of a complete review then, comes late, but still remains necessary, and it is hoped the given timeframe of 48 hours to develop a means to do this is enough. A hasty review that leaves half the job undone is of no use to anyone.\nIn lieu of the failure to carry out a census in the past seventeen years, the Nadra database is virtually the only means of estimating the total population of the country, as well as work out the population demographics of each area. But the database\u2019s fallibility was no secret; there have been numerous cases of ID cards issued for people that do not belong here, while actual citizens cannot get themselves registered for one reason or another. Both corruption and indifference have a part to play in creating the situation we find ourselves in today, and after the verification process, an investigation into such large-scale mismanagement and corruption should be carried out.\n45000 foreigners have reportedly been registered with Nadra under false aliases. This tells us that terrorists can enter the country with ease using the porous borders, and can then roam around the country as a legal citizen on the surface. Afghanis, Indians and a whole host of other nations both friendly and unfriendly have nationals that also possess the Pakistani NIC. The lofty principles this nation state was created on are undermined each time a foreign national can buy themselves a (fake) citizenship.

But using the best onion for the job can really add a depth of flavor to your meals that using a subpar type just, well, won\u2019t.\nFor most of the year, you\u2019ll find red storage onions at the supermarket, which are pungent and spicy. In the summer months, you\u2019ll often find fresh red onions, which are much more mild, and lack a bit of the \u201conion-y\u201d flavor you\u2019ll find in their yellow and white cousins. They do much better raw than cooked. If you find the taste of raw red onions (and really any other type of onion) too sharp, you can soak red onions in water for 30 minutes-1 hour.\nBest For: Salads, sandwiches, burgers, pickling, salsas.\nThe gold standard onion and usually the cheapest one at the market. If you\u2019re using a recipe that doesn\u2019t specify what type of onion to use, a yellow onion is your best bet. Yellow onions are particularly hardy, and their flavor complex and spicy. They also have more sulfur than other onion varietals, so they\u2019re much more pungent, difficult to eat raw, and more likely to make you tear up.\nYellow onions keep for a very long time.\nBest For: Dishes that cook for a long time on low heat, like soups, including French onion soup, stocks, risotto, sauces and stews. Anything saut\u00e9ed, too.\nOf all of the main types of onion, white onions are the least common. Sharper than yellow onions, crisp and clean white onions are great raw and cooked. You can cook white onions like you would yellow onions.\nWhite onions have a slightly shorter storage life than yellow onions, but should not be kept in the fridge.\nBest For: Mexican food, white sauces, pasta salads, raw in salads, in chili, and potato salads.\nThey tend to be larger, and have thinner skin, than other types of onions. Some are so sweet that you can actually eat them like an apple. You may have seen sweet onions called Vidalia, Walla Walla, and, less commonly, Texas sweet onions and Maui onions. Sweet onions are much less pungent, and yes, sweeter, than yellow onions. They break down quickly and aren\u2019t very complex, so it\u2019s best not to use them in lieu of regular yellow onions as an aromatic flavor.\nUnlike other onions, sweet onions spoil quickly and should be stored in the fridge.\nBest For: Gratins, roasted vegetables, onion rings.

With two pints in my hand the double-denim guy with long flowing grey hair, sat at the table inside the door, accused me of stereo drinking \u2013 something he says he\u2019s a strong believer in.\nBack in the open air and re-seated on my Rattan-style chair on the industrial-looking decking I realised this was a great choice.\nThere\u2019s something of the totally tropical about this one, a bit like Lilt, sure, it\u2019s a bit cloudy but the lovely deep taste of lemon and grapefruit powers through and it\u2019s a great pint.\nGenerally, this seems to be an outside pub with seating on at least four separate levels. And, for once the gents is on the same level as the pub, it\u2019s the ladies who are forced downstairs to powder their noses \u2013 quite right too.\nAlthough, with the clear glazed window in the gents I noticed you could still wave to those outside whilst in full flow. Beautifully perfumed and decorated in dark green and white tiles, I chose to stop waving and leave my calling card.\nThough, on the subject of being overlooked, the lofty position of the pub means at one point the passengers on the top deck of the Brighton & Hove Buses Route 5 are able to share a smile with those drinking outside.\nWhilst there are lovely touches, like the fresh flowers carefully arranged in old gin and vodka bottles and the many strings of lights carefully arranged for when it gets dark, but this isn\u2019t a pretentious place and clearly caters for everyone.\nI appear to be attracting scaffold"}

Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will chime in later this year with \u201cThe Terminal,\u201d a topical drama about an East European who becomes a man without a country while stranded at an American airport.\nThe management of Visions Cinema seems alert to the possibilities. Their booking of the documentary feature, \u201cLost Boys of Sudan,\u201d is now followed by a fictional import about a Lost Boy of South African origins, the central character of an Israeli feature titled, \u201cJames\u2019 Journey to Jerusalem.\u201d A muck-raking account of culture shock and labor exploitation in a setting that may take art-house patrons by surprise, the movie observes the disillusioning odyssey of a pious pilgrim.\nIntending to visit the holy city on behalf of his village, the title character is detained for passport irregularities that are never adequately explained. While lingering in custody, he is \u201crescued\u201d by an opportunistic benefactor named Shimi, a black market labor hustler who is permitted to pay James\u2019 bail and shunt him into a condition of indentured servitude in Tel Aviv.\nJames (Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe) is obliged to fetch and carry for various customers, while dormed with several African men in a similar legal and economic limbo. Shimi (Salim Daw) appears to reward them with a pocket money stipend that he considers generous, reserving a larger chunk of their wages for himself and, presumably, the overhead entailed in sustaining a crooked employment service.\nQuite a few sociological points are never clarified during the cynical course of \u201cJames\u2019 Journey,\u201d which takes an obvious hard-boiled pride in keeping Jerusalem just out of the reach of its bewildered but industrious and aspiring hero. The budget doesn\u2019t seem to permit an introductory sequence that would actually establish James in his birthplace. Instead, title illustrations and the music track are counted on to evoke Africa. James begins attending an Assembly of God congregation of fellow immigrants in Tel Aviv, but there\u2019s no indication that anyone takes an interest in his specific plight, or might have heard of a Legal Aid society that specializes in the snares awaiting detainees.\nThe scenario does have more dramatic shape than movies often demonstrate these days, and the central performances are sharply etched. An ironic rags-to-misleading-affluence fable, the film observes James becoming a kind of favorite with Shimi, who finds him especially useful as a baby sitter and handyman for his hostile old father Salah (Arie Elias), vegetating on a lot that Shimi is avid to sell to a developer.\nSeizing an opportunity that comes with the treacherous territory, James begins operating a clandestine labor network of his own within the Shimi apparatus. A movie with a sunnier disposition might reward James with an escape route as a consequence of this well-earned deception. Since the fix is in, taking the initiative earns James only further disillusion and a possibly consoling deportation.\nAlthough most of the dialogue is in English, the importers go with a subtitled policy that covers every spoken word \u2014 English, Zulu and Hebrew.

Veem is a startup trying to simplify all of that for SMBs by providing a platform to ease the international transfer of funds between businesses. Today, it announced it was opening up that capability to developers in the form of an API.\nUp until now, users could go to the Veem website, or they could use the direct integration inside Quickbooks, Xero and Netsuite, three accounting platforms that are popular with SMBs (small to medium sized businesses).\nTo use Veem, the parties involved simply sign up online on the Veem website to create an account. Instead of requiring a ton of information to make the transfer, all you need is an email. You enter the amount and the email of the recipient and Veem handles the cross-border transfers and makes money on the exchange rate.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that general foreign exchange fees are typically around 4 percent with bank wire transfers. Depending on the transaction, Veem takes between a half and 2 percent on exchange, making it a much cheaper and easier option for small businesses to use.\nWhen small businesses make these kinds of international monetary transfers, there are also rules and regulations to deal with, which Veem can also handle including bills of sale or lading and other details the receiving bank may require.\nThis is really where opening this up to other platforms other than the three accounting packages could shine. It enables programmers to add international payments to any app by connecting to the Veem API.\nThis not only opens up this capability to developers, greatly simplifying something that\u2019s actually quite complicated, it provides a way for Veem to appear inside more applications without dealing with the integration themselves. It also provides a way to build Veem usage without having users go directly to the Veem site.\nVeem launched in 2014 and has raised over $44 million."}
