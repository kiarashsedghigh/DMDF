They sit together behind rows of computer terminals, clicking away on keyboards to ensure the firm's computers are operating correctly and are connected to all the right exchanges.\nIn essence, Citadel's proprietary computer programs have become the new eyes, ears, and brains of the U.S. stock market.\nAbout 20 programmers create the computer algorithms that decide how to execute each order, and what to send to public exchanges or so-called dark pools.\nDark pools may sound like the favorite haunts of Star Wars villains, but they are simply venues where buyers and sellers can submit bids without disclosing them to the public markets. Citadel operates a dark pool called Apogee out of its New York office.\nCitadel's programmers are constantly making adjustments as computers \"learn\" customer behavior to make the process more efficient.\n\"All the decisions are made by the computers,\" Jamil Nazarali, Citadel's head of electronic execution, told CNNMoney during an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour. \"The people here are not making any decisions with respect to whether an order should be filled or at what price it should be filled.

Regulators are worried about high-speed traders get an edge over other investors in certain trading venues. It's unclear if Citadel was part of that group, and FINRA declined to comment.\nTrading is definitely faster, but whether it's better and cheaper for the average retail investor remains to be seen"}

The settlement would also see the defendants\u2014listed as Nvidia, Gigabyte, Asus, and EVGA\u2014pay out $1.3 million in attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe court will hear the petition to approve the settlement on Wednesday, August 24, as first reported by Top Class Actions. A total of 15 lawsuits seeking class-action status would be settled if the proposal goes through.\nPCWorld tried to reach Nvidia for comment early Thursday afternoon. At this writing the company had not yet responded.\nAfter the GTX 970 rolled out in September 2014, gamers started to notice that the card's performance would suffer when it used more than 3.5GB of the card\u2019s 4GB of VRAM.\nNvidia later admitted that the design of the card was to blame, which split the card\u2019s memory into 3.5GB and 512MB segments. Nvidia\u2019s CEO later explained that the memory segmentation was an inventive way to make the GTX 970 a 4GB card when it normally would\u2019ve been 3GB.\nAt the same time of the memory fallout, Nvidia also divulged that the card had 56 render output units as opposed to the originally stated 64 ROPs.\nSome online retailers offered refunds to irked customers as a result of the memory and ROP discrepancies, and the first lawsuit over the issue was filed in February 2015. The lawsuits largely claimed that Nvidia misled its customers. Nvidia denied those allegations. The proposed settlement would not force the company admit to any liability. The Register has a copy of the proposed settlement if you want to take a look.\nAt the time of the controversy, we said the GTX 970 still delivered great performance for the price. Knowing those key details about the graphics card's capabilities makes it easier for buyers to understand its potential strengths and weaknesses. For example, the reduced frame buffer makes the GTX 970 less appealing for people looking to use two graphics cards in one PC to drive a 4K monitor. That said, the GTX 970 has since been overshadowed by newer graphics cards that offer higher performance at equal or better prices.\nThe impact on you at home: Speaking of prices, GTX 970 owners will want to pay attention to court proceedings next month. Soon you may be able to get a $30 rebate on your card. In fact, if you bought your card from Amazon, you might even be able to get a refund right now. Users on Reddit\u2019s PC forums are reporting that the online retailer is still offering a 20 percent refund on at least some GTX 970 purchases, similar to what it offered users in February 2015."}

At least for now, you'll need to get the Luxury Package and all of its extras before you can get the Technology Package, which has those top-tech items.\nThe 2014 Kia Cadenza is no sport sedan, but it's a screaming deal of a luxury car in nearly everything but the badge.\nSouth Korean automakers have made value a principal part of their appeal. But what happens when prices go up and those brands venture into luxury territory? The 2014 Kia Cadenza will be the first test of the automaker's growing reputation, and its ability to draw buyers at the $40,000 price level.\nYes, even before the Cadenza's introduction, the 2014 Kia Sorento could already stretch over the $40k mark, fully loaded; but it's the Cadenza that reaches beyond that, and really tests the brand's boundaries by expanding into a new part of the market: big sedans that some call 'near luxury'\u2014cars that might not have a luxury badge, but be for all intents and purposes luxury cars.\nKia couldn't have picked a better name, either, we think. In music, it's the colorful, skilled solo that usually helps bookend a concerto. Likewise, Kia sure has had a run the past several years, pushing beyond the bland-basic, car-of-last-resort flavor of cars like the Sephia and Spectra and onto models fashion-forward, truly desirable models like the latest Optima and Forte. And\u2014ahem--there was a predecessor to the Cadenza, just a few years ago: the arthritis-inducing Amanti.\nSimply a great-looking large sedan, the Cadenza looks like a performance-focused model from some angles even though it isn't. As with all those newer Kia products designed under Peter Schreyer, the Cadenza hints throughout that it's European-influenced, but whether you take the design a piece as a time or as a whole, it's definitely not derivative.\nThe Cadenza is closely related to the Hyundai Azera, but you'll never know it from the outside\u2014or from the inside. To the point, they're completely different designs, and the Azera's smooth, flowing design and deeply sculpted sheetmetal stand in contrast to the Cadenza's taut, more athletic look.\nOverall, the Cadenza feels quick and responsive; but it's all relative and you really can't compare the Cadenza to any true sport sedan. Power is provided by a 3.3-liter V-6, making 293 horsepower and 255 pound-feet. The V-6 doesn't make all that much torque at the low end of the rev band, which means that stepping away from a standing start, or up a steep hill, feel a bit more sluggish than you'd guess from its power output\u2014until the revs build, and then you rocket ahead. Steering lacks road feel and requires a lot of small movements to stay on course on the highway. When driven at anything but a sport-sedan pace, this is a car that feels confident on the back roads yet maneuverable in town.\nChoose a big sedan like the 2014 Kia Cadenza, that's not overtly a sport sedan, and you might expect the ride quality to be pillowy, almost queasy."}

What Next?\nScott Goodson is the founder of StrawberryFrog, the world\u2019s first cultural movement agency. His first book, Uprising exploring the phenomena of movements will be published by McGraw Hill soon.\nCan you imagine a city without billboards, business signs or posters? An urban landscape with absolutely no advertising displayed anywhere?\nSeems impossible doesn\u2019t it but that\u2019s exactly what happened in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil five years ago when mayor Gilberto Kassab passed a \u2018Clean City Law\u2019, banning all visual pollution, i.e. outdoor advertising.\nAlthough most residents welcomed the crackdown, which would help to restore the natural beauty of their city, businesses were uneasy about the move, saying it would surely ruin them.\nYou can see their point when tens of thousands of ads were immediately removed from the streets, destroying any al fresco advertising opportunities whatsoever. Well, certainly in terms of splashing logos, billboards and branding on anything and everything.\nBut did this \u2018ad ban\u2019 cause widespread panic and suffering to local firms? Interestingly, it didn\u2019t. Instead, it actually encouraged many companies to reassess their advertising campaigns and find new and improved ways to reach customers. It forced them to stop and think, inventing smart new ways to promote their products and services on the streets without covering up the beautiful architecture of the city.\nThat\u2019s when many stumbled across movement marketing. They realized that in order to reach customers they had to freshen up their act. They had to tap into a culture or common theme. Something that would spark people\u2019s interest and create an emotional connection.\nMany launched their own public stunts or viral campaigns on the streets. Others embraced social media and began to interact directly with their local customers.\nGuerilla marketing became the norm as brands fought for attention to get their marketing messages out there. And do you know what! It worked. The messages started to get through, like never before.\nWhich leads on to the next revelation\u2026 Firms realized that they\u2019d never even questioned whether billboards actually worked. They\u2019d never stopped to consider if outdoor advertising was bringing a good return on investment.\nOnce upon a time it did. Back in the old days when there weren\u2019t so many brands around, competing for our attention. But today is a different story. Today, most Americans see around 4,000 ads per day and with that much visual bombardment, it\u2019s a wonder if any message gets through.\nSo the ban taught businesses a valuable lesson. They realized that bombarding people with a visual traffic jam was never going to make an impact. They learnt that one-way advertising doesn\u2019t work anymore. They now understand that interaction is the key to winning customer loyalty and tapping into people\u2019s emotions, loves and interests.\nOf course, beautiful and creative outdoor posters can always make me smile. And, outdoor is such a wonderful medium for revolucions or movement marketing - taking the message to the street.\nBut in the case of Brazil, the removal of outdoor advertising may well have helped catalyze brands and the Brazilian ad industry to make a giant leap into digital. Their creative folks are today some of the most amazing digital talent in the world.\nCan you imagine your own city without endless posters, clogging up the horizon? It\u2019s entirely possible. S\u00e3o Paulo has done it and is living proof that there\u2019s more to life than billboards. What's next down there? In Spielberg's film Minority Report, outdoor billboards are super digital boards able to react to and engage with each person individually.

{"idx": "3011", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Like university students cramming for an exam, Thursday night the parliamentary public security committee (SECU) finished the last of nine hearings (over only six days) into the government's anti-terrorism bill (C-51). It's now up to the committee to perform a clause-by-clause review of the omnibus legislation and draft recommendations to the House, including possible amendments, before third reading, which is expected to happen quickly. The NDP and the Liberals have announced the amendments they will be seeking.\nIt's possible, though probably difficult for the government (given nearly every witness proposed at least one change to C-51, with a majority calling for greater oversight of Canada's national security agencies), that Conservatives on committee will force a vote on the bill as is. This would look pretty bad. Ed Broadbent's high-profile speech in Ottawa included, \"C-51 is flawed. C-51 is dangerous. C-51 must be defeated by Parliament.\" The no-compromise route could also rile Conservative voters, according to Tasha Kheiriddin of iPolitics.ca. On top of the recent criticism of C-51 from MP Michael Chong, the National Firearms Association and Connie Fournier of the FreeDominion web forum, Kheiriddin points out, \"Former Conservative senator Hugh Segal supported the bill but called for more independent oversight. Former Security Information Review Committee chair Ron Atkey predicted the bill could not survive a constitutional challenge. So did Brian Hay, chair of the Mackenzie Institute, who said '\u2026 permitting a judge to break a law, or to ignore the Charter to uphold the law or to protect a society which is to be based on law, seems, at best, contradictory.'\"\nThursday night's hearings added another friend of the government to the list of C-51's critics. David Matas, legal counsel with B'nai Brith Canada, explained that while his group supports new Criminal Code provisions for the promotion of terrorism, and the ability of security agencies to shut down websites that celebrate and encourage acts of violent terrorism against Jewish people and others, the bill as written is too vague on what constitutes terrorism, and contains no guidelines for when attorneys general are to give their consent for prosecution of a crime under the new definition.\nMatas was also puzzled why the attorney general's consent was required for some activities, such as taking down a website or seizing materials, but not for the prosecution of advocating terrorism, suggesting this makes private prosecution possible, and could clog up the courts with frivolous accusations. \"I've talked to somebody in the government about this and it may simply have been a drafting oversight,\" he said, adding that a law criminalizing advocacy of terrorism should not be too easy to use nor should it be \"a dead letter.\" As reported by the Canadian Jewish News, B'nai Brith's testimony \"concluded with recommendations to help the bill avoid 'vagueness and overbreadth' and 'meet Charter [of Rights and Freedoms] standards.'\"\nOn Wednesday I asked what C-51 was for if not stopping terrorism. There are no new resources for the RCMP or CSIS built into the omnibus bill, just new responsibilities and a wider net of possible security threats to cover, including legitimate protest activities. Statements to committee from police witnesses that the RCMP, CSIS and local police have better things to do than spy on low-level protests are contradicted by recent leaks and much of the historical record."}

So much so, in fact, that it may be unable to paint an accurate picture of the current conflict.\nThe two year old image at right is from a Reuters video of Palestinian terrorists escaping from an action in Israel with the aid of a UN van. Video here. The decision by America's MSM not to publish it at the time may represent press bias, or that its concern for American's right to know is somewhat selective. However, it also serves to make another important point.\nService organizations like the UN and the Red Cross often rely on local individuals to flesh out their staffs. Obviously, there are areas of the world where it's difficult to tell the good guys from the bad and sometimes the bad guys may represent the majority of the local population. Such may be the case in Southern Lebanon and it invites the kind of co-optation witnessed above.\nWith the MSM having decided to rely heavily on local stringers in covering the Israeli Hezbollah conflict in Southern Lebanon, their coverage appears to have fallen prey to manipulation by a terrorist group, or at least its propaganda machine. The following examples represent instances where that isn't simply speculation; it appears to be true.\nIn this post by Michelle Malkin you'll find the July cover of US News and World Report depicting a fire in a dump outside Beirut. The story implied the destruction was caused by an Israeli air or artillery strike. Time reported the fire to be the result of a downed Israeli jet. Neither of those versions seems true.\nFrom this video of the incident, we learn that the fire was the result of a Hezbollah rocket targeted at civilians in Israel before it was intercepted by Israeli defensive measures, falling back to earth.

Prince Charles' 200 year old Cedar of Lebanon tree was 60 feet high and was a stunning focal point for his house and garden at his organic farm at Highgrove.\nSadly, the tree developed a fungus and had to be felled. The answer to what to do was given to an environmental architect who specialises in ecological buildings. There was a young oak tree already growing by the stump so the architect, Mark Hoare, wanted to create a design that would surround the remnant of the trunk and allow the new oak to grow. The wood from the dead tree was full of knots and couldn't be recycled but he dismantled the tree carefully and furniture can be made of the old wood.\nThe new building is made from oak from the farm's woodland. The bottom part is covered with oak roof tiles and has a hole for the new tree to grow through and another one where the one remaining bough of the tree remains--temporarily. Apparently the Prince has a collection of oriental bird feeders and they will hang from it. The spire is 32 feet high and mirrors a neighbouring church spire. There are openings for birds to nest and alight. In time the bough will die and the oak tree will take its place. So the whole structure is organic in its own right.\nWhat do you do if you are a Prince and your favourite tree dies? You have a memorial pavilion built."}

Press in 2009. And this small selection of pictures gives some sense of what made it so moving. A photographer with architectural training, Mr. Payne spent six years, from 2002 to 2008, tracking down and documenting more than 70 mental hospitals across the country, several dating from the 19th century, all from before the mid-20th.\nStructurally imposing, set in parklike grounds (Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux contributed designs), and often situated away from cities, they were conceived to be self-contained and self-sustaining communities, with patients assigned to do much of the work, from housekeeping to farming. Marlboro State Hospital in New Jersey had its own dairy. Other hospitals were equipped with power plants and factories. Some had theaters, libraries, bowling alleys, beauty salons and patient cafes. Most had hospitals and facilities for hydrotherapy and electroshock therapy, treatments controversial today.\nAfter World War II, with the use of psychotropic drugs and a national swing toward community-based care, the state hospitals began to empty. Institutions built to hold small cities of residents were left with remnant populations. Facilities fell into disuse. Although most of the hospitals Mr. Payne visited were still marginally functional, others were crumbling away or abandoned, leaving evidence of vanished lives: cardboard boxes of clinical records, wardrobes of straitjackets, stored suitcases. And, in Oregon State Hospital in Salem, shelves filled with unclaimed copper cremation urns are reminders that hospital stays were often lifelong.\nA few of the hospitals have themselves vanished. The immense Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts is one.\nBuilt in the 1870s, it closed in 1992 and was demolished in 2006 to make way for condominiums. Mr. Payne recorded the demolition in an essay in the book (there\u2019s also an essay by the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks) and gives a clear sense of the mixed messages these hospitals now send: Many were founded on humane principles, enlightened by the standards of their day, only to end up overcrowded and understaffed, the snake pits of popular lore. It is their ghosts that make them compelling now."}

First off, eating a nutritious, high-protein, balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to kick-start your brain, improving concentration and performance. Plus breakfast is linked to better weight control, as it provides your body energy and may reduce hunger later in the day.\nChange up how you approach your morning meal and test some of these chef-inspired time-saving tricks and shortcuts in the kitchen.\nPut away the knife and grater: Grocery stores are waking up to the fact that customers love preparing delicious foods at home, but they don't love the time it takes to chop and peel. Let the grocery store take on the \"sous chef\" role, and explore your produce section for inspiration. Pick up a container of sliced fruit and peeled eggs, and you'll have a grab-and-go breakfast. When you have extra time, pre-chopped veggies and grated cheeses will complete your omelet station in no time.\nPull out your slow cooker: The slow cooker is a must-have tool for anyone wanting to save time in the morning.

Do all the sauteing and simmering in one Dutch oven or stockpot, setting aside the cooked ingredients as needed.\nKeep it real: A photo-worthy homemade breakfast is always a treat, but all you need are a handful of simple ingredients to create an inspired breakfast, with minimal prep and cooking time. For example, apples, quinoa and a few warm spices are all you need to make an unexpected but protein- and fiber-packed breakfast entree.

Instead of incorporating holograms into their intimate shows, they\u2019re letting real live people from around the globe step through their doors en masse using virtual reality.\nTo be at the forefront of live virtual reality experiences, Boiler Room is partnering with Inception, a U.K.-based virtual reality app that aims to create immersive music, art, and culture experiences. Together they kicked off their partnership capturing 12 rooms of programming during The Weekender, a music festival tucked deep in Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania at the Split Rock Resort. Each room will be released via the app in mid-December.\nBut Boiler Room isn't simply offering users a chance to re-live the show they\u2019ve already attended, or be part of a something they missed in another city. \u201cFor us it\u2019s sort of a grand experiment: The technology is there and we\u2019re going to explore what\u2019s possible with it. We don\u2019t fully know where it\u2019s going, but we at least know it\u2019s happening, right? The technology will continue will get better.

The bad news is, they\u2019re directing those concerns at the FBI, not the president.\nOn Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested to Fox News that the investigation was improper, and he doesn\u2019t trust some of the FBI\u2019s former top officials. As TPM noted, he wasn\u2019t the only congressional Republican directing his ire at the bureau.\nThe president himself this morning promoted a series of related messages via social media, including one that raises the prospect of the FBI having attempted a \u201ccoup\u201d through its investigation.\nIf we remove the relevant details and look at the story from a distance, I can appreciate why the FBI\u2019s examination of a sitting president \u2013 not this president specifically, but a president \u2013 must be approached with great care. That kind of scrutiny opens the door to possible abuses, so it\u2019s not crazy to insist that federal law enforcement act responsibly and proceed with investigations like these cautiously.\nBut for the Republicans lashing out at the FBI this week, the questions are obvious: what would they have the bureau do? Confronted with evidence that members of the president\u2019s team had been compromised by a foreign adversary, and facing legitimate questions about whether the president himself was siding with the adversary that attacked our elections and put him in power, was the FBI supposed to simply look the other way?\nFor those of us outside federal law enforcement, who read the New York Times\u2019 reporting with astonishment, there\u2019s a degree of frustration with the limited amount of available information. If the article is correct and the FBI began exploring whether, and to what to degree, Trump was advancing Russian interests, we don\u2019t know the kind of information officials relied on to justify the examination of the president\u2019s actions.\nMaybe the details FBI officials saw was compelling and alarming, maybe it was thin and underwhelming.

Among their concerns, Davis said, are \ufffdAm I going to make friends? Am I going to be bullied?\nTo encourage that throughout the school year, she selects 40 eighth-grade students a year to be WEB (Where Everybody Belongs) leaders. They talk with younger students about study skills, help with tutoring and take a lead role in efforts such as anti-bullying programs.\nBeing a student leader helps young people learn to speak publicly, work effectively one-on-one or in small groups, and teaches other skills that will be useful in high school and beyond.\n\ufffdSometimes I think the eighth-graders get more out of it than the sixth-graders,\ufffd she said. She doesn\ufffdt limit the program to top academic achievers, believing others deserve a chance and that the effort will be more effective if the group is diverse.\nPreparing students for college is another big part of Davis\ufffd job.

The mood at the New York meeting on Saturday afternoon was one of supportive optimism, with a touch of wariness, and the Los Angeles gathering was set to take place late in the evening. The boards are expected to meet as early as Sunday, and the strike could be over by Monday morning.\nAn end to the strike would also bring relief to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which was nervously making plans for an Oscar night on Feb. 24 without writers or stars. And late-night talk shows that have operated without writers would benefit immediately. Shows like NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d and the \u201cTonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d are already inviting writers back to work on Monday, assuming the strike ends. Dramas and comedies like Fox\u2019s \u201c24\u201d and \u201cBack to You\u201d are likely to take weeks to get back in production. Weaker shows might not return at all, and shake-ups in network planning might delay the return of others.\nThe agreement would let writers claim to have bettered a similar deal achieved last month between the production companies and the Directors Guild of America. In the third year of the Writers Guild deal, writers will be paid a percentage of the distributor\u2019s revenue rather than the flat fee for Web-streamed television shows granted to the directors. The writers had insisted on this issue to ensure they not lose out on any new-media windfall the studios and networks may get from Web video. The producers yielded on this point \u2014 and the directors did not push it \u2014arguing that Internet distribution is unlikely to become a significant business during the length of these contracts.\nWord of the deal came on Saturday in an early morning e-mail message to members of the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East. The deal was to be reviewed by members at previously scheduled meetings here and in New York on Saturday.\nWhile approval appears likely, members have warily debated the expected agreement all week, and they are certain to scrutinize the details closely. Members at the New York meeting on Saturday afternoon appeared largely upbeat, according to a writer who attended but spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with union leaders. But several questioners said they did not fully understand the contract, and some asked why the unions were being asked to lift the strike so quickly.\nSpokesmen for the writers and for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents over 300 production companies, declined to comment.\nThe strike was, in large part, fought over the contentious issue of compensation for work shown on the Internet and through cell phone and other new-media devices. Writers had demanded a much bigger share of returns from downloads and Web streaming than they had received in the past from the distribution of shows on older media like cassettes and DVDs, as well as expanded jurisdiction over reality television and animated features.\nCompany representatives initially responded by insisting on a complete revamping of Hollywood\u2019s time-honored residuals system, under which writers, directors, actors and others are paid for re-use of their work on television and home video.\nAs the more expansive demands for wider jurisdiction and a narrowing of"}

He said Milford is the largest community in the state with a three-person board of selectmen. Of the 294 towns in Massachusetts, 148 have a three-member board, while 145 have five members, he said.\nSoares believes going to five selectmen will bring more diversity, discussion and opinions to the board. It would help avoid potential situations that could arise if one member cannot attend a meeting and another recuses him or herself from voting due to a conflict of interest.\nIt would also make campaigns less divisive if there were a five-member board.\n\u201cI think five is better,\u201d he said.\nSelectman William Buckley encouraged Soares to provide examples of inefficiencies or incivility in the board to Town Meeting members.\nIf approved at Town Meeting, the measure would be placed on the annual town ballot in 2020. If voters approve the proposal, the two additional board members would be elected during the 2021 annual town election. One new member would be voted to a three-year term and the other to a two-year term, according to Soares\u2019 proposal.\nThe second petition article would move the annual town election from April to November to help increase turnout.\nTown Meeting member Bryan Cole filed the petition and is discouraged by low voter turnout at annual town elections. He believes more voters would show up to the polls if the municipal election is held in November.\nLast year\u2019s town election, which featured contested races for selectmen, School Committee and Board of Library Trustees, garnered only an 18 percent turnout. The 2017 municipal election, which also had contested races, had a turnout of 17 percent.\nThe turnout for the November 2018 state election was 57 percent. More than 76 percent of voters cast their ballot during the November 2016 presidential election.\nShifting the election to the fall could encourage more candidates to run because it will be easier to campaign in the late summer and early fall than in the late winter and early spring.\nMilford would also save money every other year by having one election in November, rather than one in April and another in November. State elections occur every other year in November.\nIf Town Meeting signs off, the proposal would go to the Legislature for approval.\nTown Meeting will also discuss and vote on the fiscal year 2020 budget and a budget for the Police Chief Search Committee.\nTo view the full warrant visit https://www.milfordma.gov/sites/milfordma/files/uploads/annual_town_meeting_warrant_05-20-2019.pdf.\nTown Meeting will be held Monday, May 20."}

And if so, will she be booed, even if she's only present for a brief three minute speech?\nIt will be an early bit of drama ahead of a convention lineup that's packed with star power -- with two presidents, a vice president and the first lady serving as warm-up acts for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.\nClinton's primary rival, Vermont Sen.

If the optimism holds, private American investment in the USSR is sure to increase. \"Very clearly, the forces in favor of change have won out,\" says Peter Pettibone, head of the New York City Bar Association Committee on Soviet Affairs. \"Now's the time,\" says Patrick McGovern, chairman of International Data Group, a Boston-based publisher of information technology magazines and newsletters. \"We should accelerate our plans to invest and help.\" Many pitfalls lie ahead for US businesses in the Soviet Union, says Michel Bergerac, chairman of his own private investment firm in New York that deals with the USSR and other countries. Serious reforms lie ahead. Big differences remain between the republics and Moscow. Yet, something important has changed since a coterie of hard-line officials tried to wrest control of the USSR last week. The coup has galvanized the populace, say US businessmen familiar with the Soviet Union. \"They're energized,\" says John Cavanaugh, chairman of Summit Ltd., a food-processing representative and consulting firm based in Omaha, Neb. \"This is the necessary catalyst to encourage people that they can't go on drifting,\" says Jenik Radon, whose international legal firm specializes in helping Western and Japanese businesses in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. \"They have to move.\" So, US businessmen - even longtime skeptics of the reform process - are taking a new look at business prospects in the USSR. \"We're going to put our foot on the accelerator, and we'll see how the car responds,\" says Robert Krattli, president of Scott-European Corporation. The Montpelier, Vt., manufacturers' representative and trading company focuses on the Soviet market. The renewed optimism among US businessmen is a far cry from the euphoria that prevailed in the late 1980s. Then, entrepreneurs rushed into perestroika (restructuring) with little understanding of the Soviet market and its difficulties. \"Many of them [were] frankly amateurs - and they're paralleled on the Soviet side,\" says Michael Rae, a trade representative who has dealt with the Soviets since the early 1970s and now heads Argus Trading Ltd., headquartered in Rockville, Md. Soviet companies compounded the problem by entering joint venture deals with little appreciation of their obligations. Shipments weren't fulfilled. Payments due two years ago are still unpaid. Foreign businesses still operate in a legal gray area, because Moscow and the republics have passed a bevy of contradictory laws. Soviet business experts believe the proposed treaty between the Kremlin and the republics should clear up most of the legal contradictions and, just as important, move more power and authority to the republics. As problems mounted with the USSR, euphoria gave way to skepticism, which reached a new low when Soviet tanks rolled into the Baltic republics in January. Even this summer, after tensions died down and hopes increased about a new treaty of union, many American businessmen remained skeptical about Soviet reform. After six months of planning, International Data Group got the final papers in July for a $2 million project to install an electronic and editing preprocess system in Moscow. Company officials refrained from signing the papers, Mr. McGovern says, because they were nervous about the growing public dissatisfaction with Soviet leader Mik"}

According to a neuroscience study published today in Current Biology, they're blessed with a type of brain activity that may essentially block out noise.\nSleep researchers from Harvard Medical School performed a slightly torturous experiment on 12 healthy volunteers. On their first night at the sleep lab, the subjects' brain waves were monitored via electroencephalography (EEG), but they were otherwise left in peace. That night, the researchers measured one particular sleep phenomenon: the brief bursts of high-frequency waves known as \"sleep spindles.\" On the following two nights, the researchers did their best to replicate a really irritating night's sleep.\n\"The volunteers would come in and we'd show them this luxury environment with a queen bed and comfy sheets, but there are these four very large speakers pointed straight at their heads,\" said study coauthor Jeffrey Ellenbogen.\nThe sleepers were then exposed to a steady stream of auditory assaults. Each sound \u2013 whether it was a phone ringing, an animated conversation, or a jet engine \u2013 would be played quietly at first, and then gradually cranked up until the patients' brain waves showed a disruption to the sleep pattern. After a few seconds of quiet, the researchers cued up the next sound and the process began again.\nThe results showed that patients with more frequent sleep spindles were better able to tolerate noise; it took higher-decibel sounds to disrupt their sleep patterns. Ellenbogen says this gives researchers a new predictive power.\n\"If you know how many spindles a person is producing and compare them to others, you can predict who among them will run into trouble when it comes to blocking sound during sleep,\" he said.\nEllenbogen and his colleagues believe the sleep spindles' protective effect relates to where they're produced: the thalamus, the brain region that acts as a waystation for sounds and other sensory information on their way to the perceptual areas of the brain. The sleep spindles may be \"colliding\" with the sounds and blocking their progress.\n\"The mechanism that produces spindles may actually interfere with the transmission of sensory information through the thalamus to the cortex,\" said study coauthor Thien Thanh Dang-Vu.\nIn people who produce more frequent spindles, there's a better chance that a noise will encounter this sensory blockade.\nIt isn't yet known why some people naturally produce more sleep spindles than others, nor is it clear if spindles can be artificially boosted to help people such as hospital patients sleep in noisy environments. The researchers say sleeping pills do increase spindles, but they may interfere with other beneficial sleep stages.\nThe new work also has implications for learning and memory research. Stuart Fogel, who studies sleep at the University of Montreal and who was not involved in the current study, says the research complements previous studies that have found a link between a high frequency of sleep spindles and high performance on certain IQ and memory tests.\n\"It raises one of the unanswered questions from our research,\" Fogel says. \"Do we see these correlations between IQ and memory consolidation because sleep spindles serve a protective function, and those with better quality sleep can learn more easily? Or do spindles also play a more active role in memory consolidation?\"\n"}

An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of endurance and terrible trauma. In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty. These people whose suffering was so much greater than anything I had experienced were being dehumanised, talked about as though they were rats. It made me feel sick. I thought: I don\u2019t want to be like this. I want to show that there are people in Britain who care.\nMy husband came upstairs to find me crying. I felt helpless and angry. The best way to answer the heartlessness I\u2019d seen online would be to make a donation \u2013 to provide some material support to the refugees and make their lives a bit easier. I thought it would be easy to find a big charity that I could send money to. But I looked and looked, and didn\u2019t find anything. Eventually I came across Stand up to Racism. They were sending supplies to Calais, where thousands of refugees were staying. I suddenly realised that I wanted to offer more than cash. Before I knew it, I was making plans to drive to Dover and use my car to help transport clothing across the channel.\nThat was in the summer. I\u2019m still in Calais now. I left behind my business and my husband and family. It\u2019s been hard for them, but they know it\u2019s something I just have to do. I can\u2019t stand by in all conscience and ignore what\u2019s happening. I can\u2019t imagine living my normal life, going to restaurants, parties, without thinking about how people here need help.\nI thought: I don\u2019t want to be like this. I want to show that there are people in Britain who care.\nSince I first arrived my job has evolved. I\u2019m now running distribution for Care4Calais. Every day, I wake up in my bedsit on the outskirts of the town, have a quick shower, a 30-second breakfast, then I\u2019m down to our warehouse where we collect together donated clothes, food, bedding and camping equipment. We brief our volunteers and then split into teams. I spend most of the day at the camp, face-to-face with refugees.\nSome of the most emotional moments are when people who have received supplies thank me, despite not knowing the language. The other day a guy came up to me. He pointed to his shoes and said \u201cEngland\u201d, then to his coat and said \u201cEngland\u201d, then he just cheered. Sometimes people walk past, point at what they\u2019re wearing and just kiss me. It\u2019s an amazing feeling: like I\u2019ve made a difference to their lives, made things just a tiny bit easier for them.\nThese are not people who have come here by choice to take advantage of our generosity. That\u2019s a caricature. Who would go through what they\u2019ve gone through \u2013 terror, bereavement, loss of all their possessions \u2013 unless there lives depended on it? They\u2019re here because existence is impossible back home. Whether it\u2019s war, political or religious persecution, whether it\u2019s Syria or Afghanistan, they have no choice.\nI believe we have a responsibility to help these people.

Experts advise that parents do in fact act like a bank and set an interest rate (even if it is far less than a traditional bank rate) and create a payment plan.\nBut it can be a hard decision on whether to make the loan: You want to support your children, but you also want them to learn the lessons saving for what they want, and financial hardship, teaches.\nFor example, with a few complicated exceptions, gifts or loans to children more than $13,000 are subject to gift tax unless interest in the amount of at least the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) is charged, which is about 2.72% for a 10-year note. If you don&apos;t want your child to pay interest or make substantial payments, there are a few legal ways around it with the help of a professional.\nValidate the child&apos;s reason for needing the money. Talk about how the money will be used to make sure you\u2019re comfortable making the loan and that it will be used wisely. Ask whether the child has taken action to increase income and reduce expenses (are they thinking of taking a second job, cutting costs?), and make sure they have a detailed re-payment plan.\nStan Molotsky of SHM Financial Group in New Jersey recommends only lending money in vital situations like making rent, buying food or paying bills.\nMake it clear you won&apos;t always loan money. Setting clear expectations and loan terms avoid repeat trips to the bank of mom and dad.\nDraw up a contract. A loan arrangement between you and the adult child should be treated like a normal creditor-debtor relationship. A contract may cause discomfort and raise questions about trust, but is necessary, says Molotsky.\nCharge reasonable interest. Danny Kofke, author of A Simple Book of Financial Wisdom: Teach Yourself (and Your Kids) How to Live Wealthy with Little Money, suggests charging 5% interest on loans to children. \u201cIt may be difficult to charge your own child interest but you are actually doing them a favor in the long run and teaching them a valuable lesson,\u201d he says."}

We are a people on the edge of beyond; on the end of a massive continent. Peoples were migrating northwest; and they couldn't get any further. We have collected them.\"\nHe and his colleagues have found West African, Arabian, south-east Asian and Siberian ancestry in Scotland. \"The West African ancestry mostly originates in the 18th century, so it is almost certainly to do with the slave trade,\" he said.\nDavid Lammy, MP for Tottenham, whose immediate ancestors are from the Caribbean, also revealed at the festival this week that DNA analysis had shown he has Orcadian ancestry \u2013 also likely to relate to British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.\nOne per cent of all Scottish men, said Moffat, have Berber ancestry \u2013 why, he says, remains a mystery, though he believes that the penetration of people from the medieval caliphate of Cordoba \"must have been immensely important\". Moffat said his colleagues had also discovered DNA originating from Roman-period Illyria, the area occupied by modern Croatia, which may relate to Roman occupation of lowland Scotland.\nMany of Moffat and Wilson's findings are laid out in their book The Scots: A Genetic Journey. But research continues apace, and most recent finding suggests that porridge has been a crucial factor in the nation's early history, Moffat said.\nUntil recently, he said, it had been believed that farming arrived incrementally in Scotland, around 3,000 years ago, by a process of slow and gradual adoption, by women, of new techniques. But their recent DNA research suggests something quite different, he said: that it arrived quickly via young male immigrants from what is now Germany.\nThese young men, he said, brought brand-new techniques with them, planting grass-derived crops that could be turned into porridge and fed to young children. This new improved food production reduced the period, argued Moffat, that the hunter-gatherer mothers had to devote to breast-feeding, and thus increased their fertility. This led to a population explosion, he said, laying the seeds of a recognisable society in northern Britain. \"It is a revelation. Porridge, and I'm not joking about this, is absolutely crucial to our history.\"\nNot every analysis of DNA has delivered welcome results.

Ned Lamont promised Tuesday to reduce borrowing by the state of Connecticut by more than $500 million annually, committing to a \u201cdebt diet\u201d before a gathering of business leaders in Southbury.\nThe move, if successful, would be a dramatic change after years of borrowing for state-funded projects in all corners of the state, from Hartford to rural school districts to highways.\nIn the future, the state will limit its borrowing to \u201ccritical needs\" that are \u201cwithin the state\u2019s ability to pay,\" Lamont said.\nLamont said he would scale back the annual bond authorization to less than $1 billion \u2014 a reduction of 39 percent. During eight years under Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the state averaged approximately $1.59 billion worth of general bond authorizations per year.\nWhile fiscal conservatives have been calling for reduced bonding for years, other legislators often look for state bond money to fund projects in their districts, particularly in election years. Lamont said he would hold the line on bonding even in the second year of the two-year budget, an election year for the entire legislature.\nConstruction and renovations of public schools \u2014 traditionally a large part of the annual bond package \u2014 will continue, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to be selective,\u2019\u2019 Lamont said.\nIf wealthy communities want to construct a small school in their town, they can still do that \u2014 but they should not be relying on state funds, Lamont said. Preferences would be given to larger, regional schools, which would provide more incentive for cost-saving consolidations, he said. Rather than forcing schools to consolidate, which has been recommended by some legislators, Lamont is more interested in offering incentives regarding state funding.\nIn recent years, two Republican legislators on the 10-member State Bond Commission argued repeatedly during meetings that the state was spending too much money on construction projects, saying the fiscal largess was unsustainable. But they were routinely outvoted, 8-2, by Malloy and seven other Democrats on the commission. The governor controls the commission\u2019s agenda and has the ultimate authority to decide which projects will receive a vote. Now, Lamont can control bonding by simply refusing to place items on the agenda or by holding fewer meetings. He has already canceled the bond meetings for January and February.\nKevin Maloney, the chief spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said cities and towns rely on bonding for school construction, clean water funds and repairs to local infrastructure.\n\u201cAny reduction in bond funding for towns cannot be an isolated, piecemeal shift of revenue needs onto the property tax,'' Maloney said. \"Any bonding diet must be accompanied by more holistic state-local tax reform'' to help towns.\nState Rep. Arthur O\u2019Neill, the longest-serving Republican in the House, hailed the move, saying bonding has spun out of control in recent years.\nO\u2019Neill particularly criticized the use of bond funds to provide incentives to corporations to move to Connecticut and retain jobs. He cited the approval in 2016 of $22 million in grants and loans for Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund.\nSenate Republican leader Len Fasano, who tangled with Malloy but has had a more cordial relationship with Lamont, said the debt diet is \"long overdue'' and a marked change from the Malloy years.\nState bond funding has played a key role in helping to finance redevelopment projects in downtown Hartford administered by the Capital Region Development Authority.

Daniel and Susan Voyer just released their study Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis in the Psychological Bulletin. They raise doubts that about the generally accepted belief that girls are not interested in science and math. They turn it into an urban legend.\nThe meta-analysis asked and answered questions about the generally reported STEM gap between genders from elementary school through the university. \"The largest effects were observed for language courses, and the smallest gender differences were obtained in math courses. In contrast, the magnitude of gender differences was significantly smaller in mathematics, science, and social sciences courses when compared to global measures.\" The results of this academic, scientific meta-analysis showed that gender differences \"favored females in all fields of study\" (p.21). They encourage further study to examine gender differences in school performance.\nWhat does this tell us about our assumptions and how they may play out as teachers and leaders? With little doubt, the message is clear. We need to be invested in all students' ability to access higher-level courses that are rigorous and prepare them well for college and career. Whether they are female or male we have the same obligation to encourage and support their learning capacities. While the studies continue and the information grows, will it make a difference in our practice?\nA recent ThinkProgress.org article reported that a study released by the Center for Talent Innovation that found \"women call it quits 45 percent more often in their rookie years at ... STEM jobs than men.\" They also reported that 41% of those graduating from engineering or science programs are women. So it isn't that women are not going into college with the intention of going into STEM fields. Why are they leaving? The article points to the fact that women are primary care givers if their family includes children. STEM careers tend to be rigid in their demand for time. They also cite bias that senior leaders fail to believe women can reach top jobs in STEM fields. And finally, they cite a tremendous wage gap between male and female wage earners in STEM fields. Once discovered, that wouldn't be encouraging for women wanting to advance their careers.\nOn one hand, we have to ask ourselves why we would encourage female students in this direction. And on the other hand, we need women in these fields to push at the boundaries and make the changes necessary. Raising a family is important for both mothers and fathers. Flexibility in the workplace has been figured out in many other fields. There are successful female doctors of every specialty. There are female college presidents, governors, senators, and members of congress, there are female school leaders, and CEO's. It has been figured out. The belief that women cannot rise to the top of a STEM field is ridiculous and that must be addressed. And finally, the wage gap is simply absurd.\nSo not only do we have an obligation to prepare all students for STEM fields, it seems that particularly for young women, we need to prepare them to be scientists, technologists, engineers, mathematicians AND we need to prepare them to be advocates who can champion their cause and fight for equal opportunities in these fields. If what this article has reported doesn't change, then the rhetoric about falling behind other nations in these fields will remain. With women as almost half the graduates in these fields, the problem does not appear to be lack of interest or ability. Perhaps we have stumbled onto something else. Perhaps it is the field, at least in part, that is failing to welcome women into its workforce and there"}

A publicist for Smollett\u2019s attorney was the first to notify the news media Tuesday morning, issuing an alert that did not elaborate on the nature of the emergency.\nFoxx did try to have the FBI take over the case early on. Does this outcome mean that, in retrospect, she was on to something? Sources close to Smollett tell TMZ that the case against him had \u201cdisintegrated.\u201d Specifically, the check which was supposedly written to pay the brothers for the attack was actually written for training in the gym.

He says he has been \u201ctruthful and consistent\u201d from the beginning.\nUpdate: We\u2019ll have to wait to see what the Osundairo brothers have to say about all this but this much is clear. Smollett is not backing away from the claim he was attacked and the brothers have admitted they did it. Plus there\u2019s lots of evidence they did it. So there are at least two options here for what happened.\nOption 1: The Osundairo brothers attacked their rich, famous friend in the middle of the night for reasons of their own. They then lied about it after being arrested and claimed it was Smollett\u2019s idea from the start. Police realized the case was falling apart and dropped the charges.\nOption 2: Smollett planned this just as the brothers claimed. However, the police got some facts wrong and the Police Superintendent was on tape saying things that weren\u2019t quite accurate, i.e. Smollett paid for the attack by check. The States Attorney realized a competent lawyer would be able to tear the case apart based on those misstatements (again, there\u2019s video of the errors) and decided to let it go rather than embarrass the Chicago PD with a trial that would be covered by every network 24/7.\nI\u2019m not saying these are the only two options, just the two that occur to me given what we know at this point.

Most people have experienced some sort of a muscle cramp throughout their life and it is something we all wish would never happen again. The Mayo Clinic defines a muscle cramp as a sudden, involuntary contraction of one or more muscles. Fortunately, there are some things that you can do to prevent muscle cramping.\nOne of the biggest elements to preventing muscle cramping is drinking plenty of water. Dehydration can happen to anyone with prolonged, strenuous activities or just being in the heat for a duration of time. When you are trying to get the yard looking good for your summer parties, take a break, get in the shade and guzzle the H2O. We all live busy lives; however it would be wise to add a couple minutes of stretching before and after activities. A stretch can be held in place for 30 to 45 seconds at a time or you may try some dynamic movements to loosen up the muscles such as ankle pumps, high knee marches or ride a stationary bicycle to name a few. It is also a great idea to add potassium in to your diet. A banana a day may help keep those nasty cramps away. Consult with your physician should you decide to take a potassium supplement. These helpful tips will help reduce leg cramping.\nThere are some factors that we are not in control of when it comes to muscle cramps. As we get older, we lose muscle mass and the muscles remaining will easily get over worked. Those who are pregnant, take certain medications or are diabetic will be prone to increased risk for muscle cramps. The preventative measures listed above may help to alleviate either the intensity or frequency of the cramps."}

If there is unattended dog waste left at the park, a DNA sample will be tested by a company called Poo Prints to trace the \"poo\" back to the owner.\n\"We're hoping that this brings an opportunity for people to move into homes that have a residential feeling,\" said Mayor Ellen Brain, who serves on the planning board. \"What's different about these apartments is that they each have their own entrance and so they have that feeling of being in a home as opposed to an apartment.\"\nShe said the design of the apartments are considered to be luxury because of the amenities, design and clubhouse and pool, adding that they will be a \"lovely\" addition to the borough.\nSome residents at the planning board meeting raised concern about the traffic level.

Batteries Not Included.\nThe EMC3 is an eye-catching three-wheeled enclosed motorcycle with all the creature comforts of a low-cost car. This May, it just might be coming to a dealer near you.\nThe creator of the EMC3, ECO Motor Car Company, is a Seattle startup with a \"less is more\" philosophy. In this case, one less wheel is responsible for more fuel economy. No batteries, no pesky 25 mph speed restrictions. While the EMC3 looks like a miniature convertible, as far as the DOT is concerned it's a full-fledged two-seater motorcycle with all the necessary government approvals. Depending on options, it's expected to sell for between $13,995 and $14,995. The only thing it's missing is a rear wheel.\nJim Evans is the sales manager at Townline Auto Group of Danielson, CT, a launch dealer for the eye-catching trike. He's already driving a prototype, and so far he's pretty impressed. Driving is a \"great, fun experience,\" Evans told Wired.com. \"Handling is like your auto, not like a converted motorcycle or something like the T-Rex, Scorpion or any of the other reverse trikes.\"\nOh yeah, and did we mention it gets 60 mpg?\nThe formula for EMC3 is simple: Car - excess weight = higher fuel economy. With a curb weight between 1,300 and 1,500 lbs depending on transmission, it's not hard to see how ECO squeezes Prius-beating numbers out of their trike. Power comes from a 1.0 liter, 52 horsepower SOHC three-cylinder six-valve engine with an aluminum head and iron block, mated to either an automatic or manual transmission. As if owners won't be armed with enough conversation starters, consider that the EMC3 is built in China by Geely. That means it's the first ever Chinese car Chinese-built enclosed vehicle capable of highway speeds to be sold in the US.\nEvans is quick to note that the driving experience will be familiar and comfortable even for drivers who have never been on a bike. \"No more noise than a typical convertible, much less noise than a motorcycle,\" he told Wired.com. \"Our first deposit came from a gentleman, 6'6\" and 275 lbs \u2013 no problem with leg room or accessing the vehicle.\" The interior is serviceable and comfortable, and the dash looks like it's straight out of a late model Hyundai. According to Evans, preliminary crash tests show that the side-impact door beams and airbags are doing their job.\nOn the looks scale, the EMC3 is Urkel-worthy, somewhere between a Reliant Robin and a Davis. The Aptera it is not. That doesn't mean it doesn't attract attention. Evans said that even though the gas tank is only ten gallons, it still takes him 20 minutes to fill up once he's finished answering questions about the car.

Californians still need electricity. And PG&E can\u2019t be trusted.\nThe Blue Cut Fire burns after sunset in the mountains near Wrightwood, California, on Aug. 17, 2016.\nPacific Gas and Electric\u2014the investor-owned utility that provides electricity and gas for approximately 16 million people across Northern California\u2014announced Monday that it plans to file for bankruptcy. The move is perhaps not surprising for a company that was already an estimated $30 billion in the hole thanks to costs it\u2019s faced in damage to its infrastructure and equipment in the past two years from wildfires across the state. The company has also been found responsible for at least 18 of the 21 large fires that blazed through California in 2017, and that doesn\u2019t even count its possible liability for the Camp Fire, the deadliest conflagration in California history. November\u2019s Camp Fire took the lives of at least 86 people in Butte County, turned the entire town of Paradise to ash, and consumed more than 14,000 homes in the area. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the blaze, but PG&E did report damage to a 115,000-volt transmission line just minutes before the fire first sparked in the same location. If it is found to be at fault in the Camp Fire, the utility may face charges of homicide, according to a state attorney general.\nSo the plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, but it could pose an enormous problem. Here in California, we\u2019re still trying to figure out how to rebuild and help victims of fires that burned months and years ago. No one is sure which path forward will safely provide electricity to the millions of Californians who need it. The fires aren\u2019t likely to stop. And a broke utility company filing for bankruptcy certainly doesn\u2019t help, particularly because the federal bankruptcy judge who will rule on the potential filing will be obligated to prioritize the interest of PG&E\u2019s creditors rather than ratepayers or fire victims.\nPG&E has vowed that the lights will stay on even if the utility succeeds in its bankruptcy claim. \u201cServices will still be provided,\u201d said Mark Toney, director of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThis is a reorganization; they aren\u2019t going to close the store.\u201d Any charges that are floated to ratepayers will need to be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, the state regulatory agency that oversees PG&E, an essential protection in a market that will prioritize creditors over customers.\nWe\u2019re still trying to figure out how to rebuild and help victims of fires that burned months and years ago. No one is sure which path forward will safely provide electricity to the millions of Californians who need it.\nInterestingly, some experts, including Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University, think a taxpayer-funded bailout for the utility company could be a good thing. Consumers in Northern California still need power. Providing that power will still be risky, thanks to a threat that is increasingly exacerbated by the effects of climate change, like drought and dying trees. A bailout could be used to extract sizable, necessary concessions from PG&E, including negotiations that protect ratepayers and promises that the company make good on"}

{"idx": "3103", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Departments of Education and Justice have teamed up to make the lives of students in tough neighborhoods even tougher. Framed as a measure to combat discrimination against black and Hispanic children, the guidelines issued by the Obama administration about school discipline will actually encourage racial discrimination, undermine the learning environments of classrooms and contribute to an unjust race-consciousness in meting out discipline.\nClaiming that African-American and Hispanic students are more harshly disciplined than whites for the same infractions, the Obama administration now advises that any disciplinary rule that results in a \"disparate impact\" on these groups will be challenged by the government.\n\"Disparate impact\" analysis, as we've seen in employment law, does not require any intentional discrimination. It means, for example, that if an employer asks job seekers to take a test, and a larger percentage of one ethnic group fails the test than another, that the test is de facto discriminatory because it has a \"disparate impact.\"\nIn the school context, the federal government is now arguing that if a disciplinary rule results in more black, Hispanic or special education kids being suspended or otherwise sanctioned, the rule must be suspect. The \"Dear Colleague\" letter explains that a disciplinary policy can be unlawful discrimination, even if the rule is \"neutral on its face ... and is administered in an evenhanded manner,\" if it has a \"disparate impact\" on certain ethnic and other groups.\nThe inclusion of special education students is particularly perverse, as special ed students frequently get that designation because their emotional disturbances cause them to misbehave in various ways. So if a rule against, say, knocking over desks, is found to be violated more frequently by special ed than regular ed students, then the rule must be questioned? That's circular.\nAs the CATO Institute's Walter Olson notes, the federal guidelines pass over one example of disparate impact with no comment -- namely the dramatically more males than females who face disciplinary action nationwide. If we are to judge a rule's lawfulness by the disparate impact on males, no rule would survive the inquiry. Is it possible that more boys misbehave in the classroom than girls? To ask this question is to venture into an area the federal government would have us avoid. Actual infractions by individuals are not the issue. We must have group justice, not individual justice.\nWe've actually been down this road many times before. Various state and federal agencies have raised concerns about the large numbers of black and Hispanic students facing disciplinary action. Such concerns helped to generate the rigid \"zero tolerance\" policies the administration now condemns. Zero tolerance is a brainless approach to a subject that requires considerable finesse and deliberation, but the disparate impact rule is even more pernicious.\nUnder the new dispensation, teachers, principals and other officials will have to pause before they discipline, say, the fourth black student in a month. \"How will this look to the feds?\" they'll ask themselves. Will the student's family be able to sue us? A variety of solutions to the federally created problem will present themselves. School officials can search out offenses by white and Asian students to make the numbers come out right. Asian students are disciplined at rates far below any other ethnic group. Is this due to pro-Asian bias in our schools, or is it because Asians commit many fewer infractions? Oops, there we go into territory forbidden by the federal guidelines.\nAnother solution will be to ignore misbehavior by blacks and Hispanics. For classes with large numbers of minority students, this guarantees that the learning environment"}

{"idx": "3117", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, responsible for overseeing marijuana legalization matters in the government, started accepting applications for priority certification from marijuana dispensaries seeking to acquire licenses in order to sell the drug for recreational purposes. After significant deliberation, the commission launched the website to review them on Monday.\nEver since recreational marijuana possession was legalized in Massachusetts in 2016, many stakeholders in the industry have been interested in selling weed in stores for customers to buy, just as they would purchase cigarettes or alcoholic beverages. The commission received nearly 200 applications, according to The Boston Globe, a high number that indicates the success of the program.\nIt\u2019s important to note that talks about establishing recreational marijuana businesses have been ongoing since 2016. And while it\u2019s been two years since starting that conversation, it is commendable how well the system for receiving applications is working. The commission took its time to create an effective system and functioning website to review applicants, which is far more worthwhile than putting something out there sooner that\u2019s not smoother or more efficient. It is evident commission officials were diligent and thoughtful in crafting the system \u2014 and these efforts have clearly paid off.\nApplications from medical marijuana companies and businesses looking to operate in places where there have been frequent drug-related arrests were prioritized; businesses who wish to serve these communities are especially important. But with marijuana now legal and the upcoming opportunity to sell it, the introduction of these business will hopefully bolster these neighborhoods\u2019 economies and improve employment for locals living there. This move could also help bridge racial inequities that resulted from those arrested and strengthen families affected by the enforcement of the previous marijuana laws.\nThese stores are also exciting from a general economic perspective. For a long time, recreational marijuana has been viewed as a thing only enjoyed by people who consume it, but vendors can now reap the economic benefits of selling them on a legal market. Ultimately, the sale of marijuana can be practical for the state economy and prove to be beneficial for both sides. These stores give us the chance to diversify the economy and turn it into something lucrative.\nThe commission is planning to relocate its headquarters to Worcester, which is centrally located in Massachusetts. This can provide more people the chance to apply for a license and make the opportunity available to those who want it.\nThe CCC also hopes to establish a satellite office in Boston near a MBTA stop, which ensures accessibility and bureaucratic efficiency.

The 2014 budget projects a total revenue of $9,832,091 compared to $9,788,198 in the 2013 budget. The projected expenses amount to $9,481,395 compared to 2013's $9,609,846. Though the budget was officially presented to the city council, adjustments will be made and the final budget will be presented by January 31. In his monthly treasurer's report, Patrick Roberson told the council that the city's income was $712,000 over the past month and expenses totaled to $776,000. Among the reoccurring expenses to the city includes maintenance on an aging fleet of city vehicles. Of the $47,000 spent last month in repairs, $12,000 repaired sanitation vehicles. Roberson also noted that the city owed as much as $19,000 in October in auto parts, including $9,173 in parts to maintain and repair police cars and $10,617 to maintain and repair sanitation vehicles. Council member Wanda Crockett asked Police Chief Uless Wallace about the large repair bill on his fleet of police cars. \"Just this month we had to buy two transmissions [and] I have a car that has exceeded 200,000 miles,\u201d said Wallace.

It fills your child\u2019s head with repetitive thoughts that can knock her for a loop. It\u2019s the Worry Monster.\nBut like all monsters, this one can be slayed. You just need to choose your weapons wisely.\nMake Your Worrier A Warrior, available in November at Great Potential Press, is a detailed guide packed with techniques to help your child conquer his or her fears and anxiety.* The author, Daniel Peters, PhD, a psychologist, himself suffered from anxiety as a child, so is uniquely sensitive to a child\u2019s thoughts and feelings. As a child he was a serious worrier and a perfectionist, and is able to describe in clear language what that feels like for a child.\nAlso, as a parent and psychologist who specializes in the treatment of children, adolescents, and families, (with a special emphasis on gifted children) Dr. Peters also understands the concern and feelings of helplessness a parent has when their child has anxiety. A parent watches her child miss out on important social and educational experiences because of fears . He or she might even struggle with depression and feelings of panic and low-self worth.\nNearly ten percent of adolescents 13-18 have been diagnosed with anxiety related disorders, and many more younger children and adolescents are un-diagnosed and untreated. Make Your Worrier A Warrior offers helpful clinical information in an accessible format so you can understand what your child is experiencing from a psychological view as well as a personal one.\nDr. Peters clearly explains anxiety-related disorders such as General Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Social Phobia, Separation Anxiety Disorder, Perfectionism, and others. He shows how anxiety can manifest, and gives detailed descriptions of anxiety-related thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how they can negatively impact a child\u2019s life.\nVery important is the comprehensive list of helpful strategies (interventions) which make this book so useful to parents. The strategies are listed by type: Cognitive (thinking), Mindfulness-based; and Behavioral.Dr. Peters goes into great detail on how a parent can implement them. He even addresses diet, breathing, and physical activity, which we are always happy to see. We believe a whole-person approach is essential to good mental health treatment.\nOne constant element Dr. Peter\u2019s uses is \u201cthe worry monster\u201d, a way of naming and understanding anxiety. Dr. Peters and parents have used it to great success. He gives a detailed plan to \u201ctame\u201d the worry monster and his real-life examples show that children really \u201cget\u201d it.\nDr. Peters mentions that this book could also be titled A Parent\u2019s Toolbox For Raising Resilient Kids. Indeed throughout the book, and in a section called Promoting Resilience, he does just that. We found that virtually most parents and children could benefit from many of the strategies in this book, because underlying all is the belief that given the proper tools, we can control our thoughts and cultivate healthy emotions. A powerful message in a timely book.\n*Although this book is for parents who want to help their children\u2019s anxiety, we were pleasantly surprised to find that many, if not most, of the strategies could be used by adults. In fact, positive self-talk, breathing techniques, letting thoughts pass, fake it to make it, and so on can be used by anyone to help with fears, anxiety, and worries.\nYou can pre-order Make Your Worrier A Warrior at Amazon.com"}

The process is the same as a vacuum cleaner, but the brushes turn manually as you push a walk-behind sweeper. You may use a lawn sweeper to clean the yard after mowing it, or to clean fallen leaves and debris. An accumulation of dead grass and leaves on your lawn blocks sunlight and air from the grass and can kill the lawn. The process of using a lawn sweeper takes little time and your lawn will thank you for it.\nPut on leather work gloves to protect your hands from thorns or sharp objects.

Lawn sweepers work better on freshly mowed grass that is all the same height.\nAdjust the brush height on a lawn sweeper to the same height as the grass. Some models have a dial to turn or a handle to move forward or backward for brush adjustments. Look under the sweeper and move the adjustment apparatus until the brushes touch the grass.\nStart pushing the lawn sweeper in one corner of your lawn. Travel in paths back and forth across the lawn in opposite directions of either north to south or east to west. At the end of a path turn the lawn sweeper around and place the tires in the track of the finished path to overlap each path slightly for good coverage. Walk at a medium pace about at the speed as if you are push mowing your lawn.\nSpread a large tarp on the ground on an area that you have swept when the hopper is full of debris. Push the lawn sweeper to the tarp. Dump the contents of the sweeper bin onto the tarp. There may be a string or a handle to pull that opens the hopper to deposit the contents of the hopper.\nFold the tarp in half with the contents inside. Open a lawn and leaf bag with the opening facing upward. Pour the grass clippings and leaves inside the bag. Alternately, you may deposit the debris in a compost pile or green bin.\nContinue sweeping the lawn in paths and emptying the hopper until you have covered the entire lawn in paths.\nWalk-behind lawn sweepers are inexpensive and available at home improvement and garden centers.\nStore your lawn sweeper in a dry area such as a garage or storage shed.\nTow-behind lawn sweepers attach to a riding mower and operate in the same way.

Not only is the specific practice of random search rendered illegal by the court but its judgment focuses attention on the increasing abuse of measures brought in by the Terrorism Act 2000, and the resentment of the public.\nIt is interesting that the government has said it is disappointed with the ruling and will seek to appeal, because it has already ignored an equally categ\u00adorical decision in 2008 concerning the retention of innocent people's DNA. However, the case brought by Pennie Quinton and Kevin Gillan, protesters stopped in 2003 outside an arms fair in London, is going to be extremely difficult to ignore, for the simple fact that so many people find themselves being stopped.\nLast year about 250,000 people were stopped \u2013 about 700 a day. This jumped by one third in 2008. There has been a steady increase since the first year of the Act, when just 10,200 were stopped. Even Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, who normally supports a tough government line, suggested that implications of the ruling were quite serious and added that Section 44 was being used far too much.\nIn 2006, the House of Lords unanimously dismissed the pair's case with this: \"\nIn particular, the Law Lords were doubtful whether an ordinary superficial search of the person could be said to show a lack of respect for private life, so as to bring article 8 of the European convention on human rights into operation. Even if article 8 did apply, the procedure was in accordance with the law and it would be impossible to regard a proper exercise of the power as other than \u00adproportionate when seeking to counter the great danger of terrorism.\nThe European court disagreed and said it was \"struck by the statistical and other evidence showing the extent to which police officers resorted to the powers of stop and search under section 44 of the act and found that there was a clear risk of arbitrariness in granting such broad discretion to the police officer\". The judgment finds that a public search clearly interferes with the right to a private life, that it creates humiliation and embarrassment, and that there were not sufficient safeguards against arbitrary use by the police. The court highlighted that the failure to oblige police officers to show reasonable suspicion makes it impossible to prove that the powers were improperly used.\n\"While the present cases did not concern black applicants or those of Asian origin, the risks of the discriminatory use of the powers against such persons was a very real consideration and the statistics showed that black and Asian persons were disproportionately affected by the powers.\"\nLast year it was revealed that since May 2007 the number of searches under section 44 powers had risen by 322% for black people, 277% for Asian people, but only 185% for white people. The result was that police reportedly increased the searches in order to balance racial quotas, in one instance mounting an operation at the entrance of the British Library in London.\nThis is a very welcome judgment and I cannot believe a government that introduced the Human Rights Act with so much fanfare is seeking to appeal it."}

It was unafraid to address dark themes and even the darker motives of characters inhabiting America's underbelly.\nSydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Humphrey Bogart are all interested in finding \"the black bird\" in the 1941 film adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's \"The Maltese Falcon.\"\n\"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941) is often cited as the film that set the trend in motion.

Having headed Matt Etherington's right-wing corner wide, Jones produced a brilliant piece of skill to chest down Thomas Sorensen's clearance and hit a swerving 25-yard left-footed volley on the turn which the Villa goalkeeper had to parry away.\nVilla midfielder Marc Albrighton's received a talking-to for appearing to swipe Dean Whitehead around the head and from that point until the break the visitors took control. Gabriel Agbonlahor's 35th-minute curling left-footed cross to the far post caught Huth in two minds and he chose the wrong option as he stepped towards the ball only to see it sail over him. Downing timed his run and dive to perfection, planting a low curling header past Sorensen and in off the right post.\nStoke felt they had justifiable claims for a penalty moments later when James Collins seemed to handle under pressure from Jones but referee Lee Probert waved away appeals. Ashley Young should then have put Villa further ahead only to head wide from close range from Agbonlahor's cross when it looked easier to score.\nPulis made an emotional appearance for the second half to take up his position in the technical area, immediately giving the crowd and his team a lift. Five minutes after the restart Friedel kept out Jones' header from Etherington's free-kick, with the goalkeeper then pawing away Rory Delap's long throw under pressure from the Trinidad and Tobago international as Etherington's follow-up was blocked.\nStoke were back in the ascendancy but their hard work was almost undone by a misunderstanding between Ryan Shawcross and Sorensen which resulted in the goalkeeper blasting the ball at Nigel Reo-Coker and back over his own crossbar.\nHowever their endeavour finally paid off in the 80th minute when Ricardo Fuller combined with Etherington on the left of the penalty area and the winger sent over the ideal cross for Jones to head home. The former Sunderland striker pulled out his trademark somersault celebration but despite the equaliser Stoke still had to be alert and Shawcross deflected Reo-Coker's shot behind in the last five minutes.\nDeep into three minutes of injury-time Jermaine Pennant's free-kick dropped to Etherington and his shot was deflected in by Huth to secure the home side's first win of the season."}

As with all of these apps, LegalZoom Business Agreements\u2019 main appeal is the convenience of being able to print the forms by choosing from a list on your Lexmark Web-connected printer's front panel. How useful it will be, however, will depend on whether you need the particular forms it offers and how much you have to modify them to use them.\nAll of the Lexmark LegalZoom apps\u2014including LegalZoom Bill of Sale Forms ($39.95 direct, 3 stars), LegalZoom Employment Forms ($29.95 direct, 3 stars), LegalZoom Landlord and Tenant Forms ($39.95 direct, 3.5 stars), and LegalZoom NDA Forms ($37.95 direct, 3 stars)\u2014share some key features. In particular, after the one-time payment for the app, you can print out a given agreement as many times as you like. You can also download the app to all of your Web-connected Lexmark printers.\nFor the LegalZoom Business Agreements app, this means that if you regularly use independent contractors, for example, you can print a fresh Independent Contractor Agreement every time you need one. There are some issues that make this less useful than it might seem at first blush, but we'll come back to those in a moment.\nI tested LegalZoom Business Agreements on a Lexmark Pinnacle Pro901, but according to Lexmark it's compatible with all current Lexmark Web-connected inkjet printers. Lexmark also says that the app will probably work with future SmartSolutions-enabled printers as well, but it stops short of guaranteeing that.\nAs with all of the Lexmark LegalZoom apps, installing LegalZoom Business Agreements from Lexmark's SmartSolutions Web site is identical to installing one of Lexmark's free apps, except that you have to pay it. Once the app is installed, using it is standard. To print a business agreement, you simply choose the appropriate icon from the SmartSolutions option on the front panel, then choose the particular agreement you want to print, choose whether to include instructions, and, finally, give the command to print.\nNot so incidentally, the instructions are very much worth printing, since they offer lots of useful information about the agreements. A Dos and Don'ts list, for example, talks about steps you should take to minimize various legal risks, like having the IRS decide that your independent contractor is really an employee and that you owe taxes with penalties. If you print the instructions for each form once and save them, you won't have to waste ink and paper printing them again.\nBottom Line: Lexmark's Business Agreements app makes it easy to print a few selected agreements from legalzoom."}

{"idx": "3159", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it.\nThought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination.\nI'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.\nA long-standing motif in old Irish literature is of the poet drifting into inspiration, often beside a graveyard, with his head nuzzling a tree. The poet goes into a dream-state and experiences a vision referred to as an \"aisling,\" where Ireland appears to them in the form of a woman. The woman can be young and beautiful or old and haggard (often linked to the writer's thoughts on the state of the country at the time). In the 17th and 18th centuries, the \"aisling\" poetic genre became very popular as poets used the vision of Ireland to lament the suffering of Ireland under English rule.\nI would miss something if I called the aisling just a dream. That's why there are so many Irish words for dreams, including \"briongl\u00f3id\" (bringlowjuh) or \"taibhreamh\" (tavriv).\nTo be in a dream-like state is to be on a n\u00e9al eile (nail elluh), another cloud, which implies something about the cloud you\u2019re already coming from. That\u2019s why we say you\u2019re given dh\u00e1 s\u00faile (gaw sooleh) or your s\u00fail eile (sool elluh) when you experience clarity of conception: your other eye.\nBut maybe the experience is closer to speabhra\u00edd\u00ed (spawrawjee), the closest translation I can find being hallucinations. If it\u2019s a nightmare, that\u2019s a tromlu\u00ed (trumlee) which could be translated as \"a heavy lie-down.\" It feels like a heavy weight, the opposite of a light cloud.\nYou dig? That\u2019s an Irish word: dig \u2013 it means \"understand.\" An dtuigeann t\u00fa? (on digan too?). Most of the Irish people that flooded into New York spoke Irish, and our slang is peppered with Gaelic remnants. \u201cDig it\u201d is from the era when step dance morphed into tap.\n\"Jazz\" is another one \u2013 an Irish word that means heat or \"teas\" (jass, chass). Spike Slattery made the word common in San Francisco newspapers. You can read about this and other words like pizazz, razzmatazz, sucker and poker from Gaelic slang here.\nBack to some Irish ideas about thinking: how about the head itself?\nAs the temple of the soul, the head or ceann (kyahn) can be translated as both \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cend,\u201d as well as both \u201cone\u201d and \u201csake.\u201d If this seems confusing, you can say it\u2019s \"tr\u00ed mo cheann\" (tree muh kyahn), \u201cthrough my head,\u201d because the idea doesn\u2019t seem to have taken root yet.\nThoughts are like that. It's why someone might try to catch them with a thinking cap.

The area, which includes the Pine Ridge Native American reservation, has a 2014 life expectancy of 66.8 years \u2014 lower than the average of 67.2 in Sudan.\nWe asked the chief researcher behind the project, Ali Mokdad, what most surprised him.\nAs to why Oglala Lakota County in South Dakota is at the very bottom of the life expectancy, Mokdad has a predictable answer.\nSo what, in the end, are the key factors influencing life expectancy?\nThe opioid pandemic is certainly one of them, Mokdad says, but 74 percent of the difference between counties hinges on four lifestyle choices that are, in his words, \u201cpreventable\u201d: blood pressure, obesity, smoking and physical inactivity.\nWhere does your county rank?

While the midnight tribute has a touch of the theatrical, it\u2019s also an honest expression, Jerome said. Wherever Jerome travels in the world, he said when people find out what he does, they want to know whether the \u201cPoe Toaster\u201d is real.\nPoe lived for a time in Baltimore, but died in 1849 at age 40 after collapsing in a tavern during a visit to the city years later. He was buried in Westminster Burial Ground, then moved to a more prominent spot in the front of the cemetery in 1875. The rose and cognac tributes of an anonymous man dressed in black with a white scarf and wide-brimmed hat are thought to date back to at least the 1940s.\nThe vigil inside the former church is closed to the public, but over the years, a crowd has gathered outside the gates to watch. After the \u201cPoe Toaster\u201d failed to show in 2010, last year\u2019s vigil attracted impostors, including a man who arrived in a limo as well as a few women.\nThe visitor has left notes on occasion. A few indicated that the tradition passed to a new generation after the death of the original \u201cPoe Toaster\u201d in the late 1990s, and some even mentioned politics and sports. Those notes make it even more frustrating for Jerome that there has been no message explaining the absence."}

Despite Bruce Wayne believing he was taking control of the city over the last few years, Snyder's story has revealed that the Court of Owl has been secretly ruling Gotham City for generations.\nNow it's time for the Owls to battle the Bat, and most of Bruce Wayne's allies will get involved in the \"Night of the Owls.\" But although DC has promoted the event as a crossover, Snyder said none of the comics will actually \"cross\" into the other, merely tying into the overall concept.\nAccording to Snyder, the books that tie into \"The Night of the Owls\" will include Batman, Batgirl, Nightwing, Batman and Robin, Birds of Prey, Catwoman, Batwing and Red Hood and the Outlaws. The history of the Court of Owls will also show up in All-Star Western.\nThe event will be the largest DC has published since the company relaunched the entire DCU in September 2011. It's being entrusted to Snyder, who launched Batman in September after a successful year-long run on Detective Comics and an ongoing hit Vertigo comic, American Vampire.\nNewsarama talked with Snyder to find out more about what's coming up in Batman, including \"The Night of the Owls\" and how the other creators in the Batman universe got involved.\nNewsarama: Scott, you're heading toward a crossover event with both your Swamp Thing title and the Batman title. Plus you're co-writing the back-ups after having co-written a few other stories in the last couple years. Are you just naturally a collaborator when it comes to comics?\nScott Snyder: It's one of the things I love most about working in comics. I know it sounds cheesy, but coming from a literary background, the thing I hated the most about it, and the reason I've realized I'm tremendously happier in comics, is that I always worked alone. I mean, I loved getting to tell the stories I wanted and having creative breathing room in literary fiction, because no one's telling you what to write. So few people buy those things anyway, with short stories, that nobody is bothering you about it.\nBut then in comics, the big surprise is how creatively free it is here too, and the same kinds of stories I was doing in literary fiction, that really matter to me, I could do on characters that I had been inspired by as a kid and that inspired me when I write, like Batman and Swamp Thing. And to create my own series, like American Vampire.\nThat was the most surprising thing. But the thing that's been most rewarding, and is honestly the biggest thrill, is the collaboration. The feeling of getting to work with someone like Jeff Lemire and trade stories, and you feel like you evolve and you grow as a writer every time you share stuff with these guys, because they're so good.\nI mean, I listen to Pete Tomasi talk about what he's doing in Batman and Robin and read his scripts, and it makes me want to be better, you know?

This new environment requires significant changes in how medics and soldiers are trained and equipped, West said, and the changes are taking place now.\nCommand posts in the near future will have medical capabilities integrated within them, so patients can be monitored and calls made to a surgeon to recommend life-saving procedures.\nRobotic surgeries are another technology in development. It\u2019s a question now of \u201chow quickly we can scale it throughout our enterprise,\u201d West said.\nSuch surgery has been tested at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for example, with doctors there and a satellite hookup with soldiers in a remote area.\nTechnology used around the world today allows surgeons to operate virtually, West said.\nThe Army has invested in its first virtual medical center at Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas, which she said will expand capacity and capabilities and save more lives."}

{"idx": "3189", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation.\nIdeally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security \u2013external or internal \u2013with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy. National Intelligence cannot be competitively patriotic in relation to the Political Executive unless it is driven to a point where it had to confront the elected leadership on the latter's credentials as the guardian of national security.\nHow does one take a judgement call from outside on the ongoing 'conflict' between FBI \u2013which in US performs the counter-intelligence function against threats to national security- and Donald Trump, that kept on escalating even after the latter had been designated as the President-elect? The discordance between the two sprang up when the agency let it be known to the entire world that Putin's Russia had 'interfered' with the electoral system of US with the motive of helping the Republican campaign. FBI allowed the political furore to develop around the issue to a level where it was suggested that those in charge of Trump campaign might be in a clandestine collusion with Russian ambassador and other representatives of Russia in US. The underlying presumption was that the Republican leadership would be vulnerable to undesirable Russian influence in future. It then took only a little stretching by sections of media to elevate the Russian 'interference' in the US election to an 'espionage' operation that, at least indirectly, could be said to have cast aspersions on the Republican candidate himself. In US the chiefs of Intelligence agencies are political appointees and they would be on test, in a crucial moment for the regime such as the Presidential election- for their objectivity.\nTwo aspects of professional import do arise from this entire episode of Russian 'interference' in the US election. The first relates to the fact that the electoral process in a democratic country is an 'open' public event that can be watched by the entire world. If this happens in a country, which is also the only Super Power of the day, it is not surprising that other major powers- friendly or not so friendly- would have a stake in the outcome of an election that could possibly lead to a regime change. In the recent US Presidential election, Russian interest in monitoring the campaign was no doubt aggressive and reportedly involved prying into the party information available at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters through the deniable route of 'hacking'. The act would be an 'unfriendly' one in terms of international relations and would invite repercussions but would it be the same as 'espionage' which by definition is an attempt to get unauthorised access to State secrets protected through security classification? The onus of protecting information lies with the owner and Donald Trump, happy with the thought that what Russians did only cut to his advantage, was, during his campaign, quick to blame it all on the incompetence of the Hillary camp in securing their communications. The suggestion of 'espionage' could stick only if American Intelligence was able to establish that Russians had laid the groundwork for creating 'agents' in the new Presidency, for the future.\nIn any case this would all be in the area of confidentiality for FBI till such time as the agency reached a definite outcome. And this brings in the second point of"}

It's not all about technology though: it also covers wine and spirits, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, organic foods and secret recipes for prepackaged foods and food additives.\nChapter 18, on intellectual property, has two whole annexes devoted to Internet service providers -- which in the treaty's terminology means providers of either Internet access or of services on the Internet, and how they must help police online copyright infringement.\nSignatories to the treaty will be required to implement laws compelling ISPs to forward infringement notices to their subscribers and to make ISPs that do not comply pay damages.\nUnder laws mandated by the treaty, ISPs will have to remove cached copies of infringing material and search results pointing to such material upon receipt of a complaint, and they will be required to enforce court orders by removing or disabling access to infringing material stored by others.\nISPs will also be required to take down infringing materials promptly if they become aware of an infringement -- whether as a result of a court order, infringement notice or some other way. They will not be held liable if they take down allegedly infringing content in good faith.\nThey will also be required to identify users of their service accused of copyright infringement, when a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement has been made and where local principles of due process and privacy allow.\nThese rules won't make much difference in the U.S. and perhaps Australia, but represent a significant tightening of the law elsewhere. The treaty gives Brunei and Mexico three extra years to implement the provisions on ISPs because of the amount of legislative work that needs doing, where other countries must implement them when the rest of the treaty enters effect.\nBut the signing of the treaty does mean that, once countries introduce such laws, they won't be able to roll them back even if they want to -- or at least, not without withdrawing from the treaty, which would entail losing trade benefits in other areas, tying online copyright enforcement to trade in textiles, medicines and foods.\nThe text of the 30-chapter treaty, without its annexes, makes for a 3.15MB zipped archive on the website of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nThe U.S. pushed hard to fast-track the deal, despite resistance from digital rights groups and technology firms."}

But CEO Alfred Chuang said the release is the culmination of more than two years and several million dollars' worth of software engineering.\nWebLogic Platform is a suite of Java-based server applications, based on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) standard, which businesses use to build custom applications. The new release includes corporate portal software, specialized integration software, data access tools, and a set of development tools that BEA hopes will make Java programming much easier.\nSan Jose, Calif.-based BEA once dominated the market for Java server software but lost its lead to IBM, according to Gartner Dataquest research announced in May. The company is facing renewed attacks on its customer base from IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and open-source alternatives such as JBoss Group.\nNow, the company is basing a comeback on better software for connecting business systems from multiple vendors and on an easy-to-use Java development tool.\nIt still faces competition from deep-pocketed rivals, though, and the task of expanding its base of customers beyond technologically sophisticated, high-level users to more mainstream corporate developers.\n\"BEA's success hinges in penetrating more deeply into enterprise, and that's all about selling the benefits of Workshop,\" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research, referring to BEA's WebLogic Workshop Java-based development tool. \"The challenge is that developers don't buy software infrastructure, so it's a different buyer than BEA is used to calling on today.\"\nBEA became a powerhouse in the Java marketplace in the late 1990s on soaring sales of its WebLogic application server, which is used to host high-volume Web sites and demanding business applications.

Since the season had arrived, he had been a-field only on Saturdays. Last Saturday was the only time he had a bird almost in range of his 870. Then it decided to move in another direction and quit responding to his calls. This bird was on his mind as he drove in the early morning hours. He was going to set up close to the same resting spot that he had been in when he saw the gobbler.\nHe turned off the township road onto a small dirt lane that led him to within 200 yards of his destination. He parked between two trees, shut the ignition off and gathered his stuff. Then he continued his journey on foot. Ten steps into his walk, he stopped. He turned off his flashlight and took what we mountainmen call a quiet moment. There in the stillness and quietness of the morning is a feeling that cannot be described. (You just need to experience it for yourself.) Five minutes later the flashlight came back on and Ed continued his journey once again.\nHis resting spot the Saturday before had been in the timber surrounding a very large hay field. Today his sights were set on an island that jutted out into the field. It had been farmed around for many years. It consisted of a couple of very large oaks and a whole bunch of rocks. Apparently, the rocks had something to do with why the plow detoured around this spot. His resting spot was 10 feet off the field at the point of the island. There was a small amount of brush for cover, but he could see in three directions. He placed the blind spot to his back and a small orange band on a sapling to his left and settled in.\nAs he sat in the darkness, he talked to himself. (This is a sign of a true mountainman.) He was discussing the coolness of the morning. It felt like fall, but the smell was of spring. (A mountainman analyzes all situations automatically.) Then a soft wind started. This was his cue to load the 870. Once the last round went into the magazine, he laid it on his lap and the conversation ended. For the next 15 minutes, he watched the morning arrive.\nWhen it did, he started his calling. During the second set of calls, he got a response from the timber on the right side of the field. He continued to call for the next 30 minutes. After about every other set of calls, he would get a response. Then all went quiet. Ed called again, but still no response. Then he started another conversation to analyze the situation. Halfway through the conversation, he saw movement at the field\u2019s edge. He pulled his binoculars from his chest. When they hit his eyes, he saw the quiet gobbler. It was moving north in the timber about 10 feet off the field. Ed called again. The gobbler responded and continued to follow the timberline at the edge of the field. This gobbler was a classic edger. That is what we call a bird that likes to strut the edge of the field without entering the field. Well, Ed called again. The gobbler responded and then it went out of sight. Then just as fast as it exited, it came back and continued to be an edger. Ed continued to call occasionally. With each call, a response and then it disappeared again. Following his next call, the response was at the edge of the island he was sitting in. He turned a little to his right and called again. A second later the gobbler came into his field of view. The gobbler was still being an edger"}

Creative Technology, whose \"Zen Patent\" claim covers the iPod interface, trumpeted through press release today that the U.S. International Trade Commission is now involved in its dispute with Apple Computer.\nThe complaint alleges violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain portable digital media players that infringe Creative's ZEN Patent. Creative has requested that the ITC issue a permanent exclusion order and permanent cease and desist order.\nWhile a permanent exclusion order could theoretically result in the cessation of iPod sales, the reality is this is a required procedural move in the ongoing litigation.\n\u201cEssentially the institution of the ITC investigation is just a procedural matter that happens as a matter of course if you dot your i\u2019s and cross your t\u2019s on the complaint,\u201d said Stefani Shanberg, a partner in the San Francisco office of the law firm Perkins Coie. She specializes in intellectual property cases.\n\u201cA lot of times, companies will use the institution of an investigation as a press event because it sounds impressive,\u201d she added. She believes it is likely that the ITC will take up Apple\u2019s complaints against Creative as well.\nAnd Creative could certainly use something impressive sounding, as their stock price is currently trading at historic lows. One wonders if Creative will survive in the market place long enough to complete a litigation process that will likely take years.\nMeanwhile, in Vermont of all places, David Contois has taken Apple Computer to court over alleged infringement of his patent on jukebox software, though the case sounds more like a comic skit on a broken patent system.\nDisagreements ranged from specific -- what does \"selecting\" really mean? -- to general, including whether Contois' software alone, or the program coupled with devices it controls, was the heart of the debate.\nLawyer John Rabena, a member of Contois' legal team, said the software was key because it marked a vast improvement over earlier products from other companies.\n\"Those interfaces were not as intuitive and elegantly simple,\" he said.\nAn attorney for Apple, Greg Arovas of New York, disagreed: \"The plaintiff was very late to the digital-music game.\"\nOf course, Creative would undoubtedly say the same for Apple Computer and the iPod.\nForget units sold and market share as metrics of success, the new standard is litigation, and by this measurement Apple's iPod and its music related initiatives are winners."}

{"idx": "3212", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: One of the hardest parts of dating has always been getting up the nerve to hit on someone you see often, but don't know\u2014like the guy on the other side of the bar. Tinder says it might soon have a fix for that specific issue: The dating app is testing a new feature aimed at connecting people who like to hang out in the same bars, restaurants, and other public places. The new product, aptly named \"Places,\" will begin testing in cities in Australia and Chile today.\nThe announcement comes a month after Facebook announced it too was testing a new dating product, which will allow users to connect with people who attend the same events. The move feels like a marked change for Tinder, which has been best-known for facilitating hookups since it launched in 2012. Before, the app was a game of hot-or-not. Now, it's attempting to offer new ways to connect based on shared interests.\nPlaces will be entirely opt-in, and uses location data partially gleamed from a collaboration between Tinder and Foursquare. Users will have to decide to turn it on, and it won't display locations like doctor's offices, banks, and other non-social businesses you'd rather not broadcast to potential dates. Users will also be able to manually remove individual places, if you'd rather not reveal to matches that you go to the same taco place three times a week. Places also won't broadcast when you're currently eating tacos; the product is designed to surface a location 30 minutes after you've left. If you have the feature enabled, you'll be able to swipe on people who like to hang out at the same spots.\nThe feature isn't an entirely new idea. Apps like Happn have for years connected people who visit the same locations. Tinder too has long been a location-based app: You can already customize how far away you want potential matches to be, tightening your circle up to a one mile radius. But Places feels different\u2014now users will have the opportunity to connect based on more than just being two warm bodies in the same area.\nPlaces has the potential to bring together users who share common interests, or at least like to go to the same bars. At the same time, Places could end up merely reiterating the same shallowness that has always plagued online dating. You might, for example find yourself having to explain to a match that you just went to that restaurant once, but now it's popping up on Places. It could also be just as shallow as what people already put in their bios; a shared affinity for tacos isn't necessarily enough to build a meaningful relationship.\nRegardless of how Places plays out, the decision to introduce the feature feels like a step in a different direction for Tinder. The app's signature swiping feature has long been synonymous with finding someone to hook up with. Swiping with your friends, or even letting your friends swipe for you has evolved into a bonafide social activity. By now, online dating has become more of a game than a place to meet a life partner.\nFor a while, Tinder seemed to play into that idea. In 2016, the dating app launched an Apple TV app, which let you swipe with friends on the big screen. Tinder felt fun, until it wasn't.\nThe novelty of online dating has begun to wear off. Over the last couple of years, Tinder and other apps like it have begun to feel like less of a game, and more like work. It requires genuine commitment to swipe in earnest through the hundreds of potential matches that Tinder puts in front"}

My previous supervisor left a week earlier for a new job, and things had been chaotic ever since.\nAt the time, I worked as an academic counselor in a program that served underrepresented students. Before my supervisor Jim left, there were two full-time employees and one part-time. Now I was the only full-time employee. When I told coworkers about Jim\u2019s departure, they assumed that I was the new interim director.\nHowever, I didn\u2019t like that assumption because I didn\u2019t know if I wanted the job.\nI had a strong feeling that the reason Susan asked me into her office was to discuss the idea of a promotion, and as I sat across from her, I had a pit in my gut.\nShe leaned back in her chair for a moment, folded her arms, and then asked me to shut the door. \u201cHow do you feel about all of this?\u201d she asked.\nEver since I turned 30, I\u2019ve wanted to be a father first, and an employee second.\nAs I left Susan\u2019s office, I didn\u2019t think about failure.

It wasn\u2019t perfect, but I was content. Ever since I turned 30, I\u2019ve wanted to be a father first, and an employee second.\nI realized I was the logical choice for the promotion. I was the only full-time employee, and I knew the most about our current projects. But I also knew about the long hours the previous director spent away from his family, sitting in his office in the evening, writing reports and sending emails. We\u2019d become close friends, and he often mentioned the stress he was under to satisfy both the university and the Department of Education.\nI think about my father a lot because I don\u2019t want to become him.\nBut most importantly, I thought a lot about a man I hardly new. My father. He was a heating and air-conditioning contractor and business owner who spent most of my early childhood at work. To ease the stress of managing his own business, he turned to prescription painkillers and alcohol. He ended up plowing through four marriages and died at 49 years old. I think about my father a lot because I don\u2019t want to become him. I don\u2019t want to allow my job, my ambitions, to keep me from being a good father and husband.\nAfter the kids were in bed, I sat on the sofa next to my wife, Mel. The baby was in her lap.\nI was a wreck and I hadn\u2019t even been offered the job yet. I felt confident that I would be offered it, though, and I\u2019d have to make a decision. I told Mel about the conversation I had with Susan. I told her about my fears. She asked if the position would come with more money, and I told her that I assumed it would.

SAIC <600104.SS> has EVCard and Ford (NYSE: F) has a shuttle-sharing service, Chariot.\nBain said that for Chinese customers the time spent in traffic has reduced the attractiveness of owning a car.\n\"Customers tend to care most about the cost, waiting time and driver ratings, and much less about the brand of the car in which they travel.

France\u2019s economy, however, saw a 0.6% growth in GDP in the first quarter, according to new a report by France\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). The strong growth was partly attributed to improved trade thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, which has made French exports more attractive to consumers at home and abroad.\nIn total, France\u2019s GDP rose to 555.4 billion euros in the first quarter of 2016, with exports rising 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Imports rose at an even faster rate, climbing to 171.6 billion euros, or 1.3% higher than the same period a year ago.\nFrench consumers are also seeing more disposable income in a trend that largely began last year. In 2015, disposable income grew by 1.4% in the country, according to INSEE, the fastest growth rate since 2011. That is driving French consumers to spend more, helping final consumption expenditure rise 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.\nWhile the data was much better than economists expected, weakness was still seen in the foreign trade balance, which hurt GDP growth in addition to negative changes to inventories.\nFrance is targeting 1.5% GDP growth in 2016, which President Francois Hollande has promised in several speeches urging the French to allow further trade liberalization. One such move to allow freer trade is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which is broadly disliked in France and Germany by a majority of voters. The French government has nonetheless begun negotiations, requesting changes to dispute settlement language in the treaty.\nFrance\u2019s strong growth helps it join Germany in a group of recent European outperformers. After years of relative weakness, both of the largest continental EU nation states have seen growth accelerate handsomely. Earlier in May, Germany announced that its economy grew 0.7% in the first quarter of 2016, more than twice the 0.3% growth the nation saw at the end of 2015.\nDomestic investment is largely driving Germany\u2019s economy, while domestic consumers are largely helping France\u2019s economy.\nEconomists have expected broad improvement in economic growth throughout the European Union, helped in part by weak growth in 2015, a stronger U.S. dollar making exports more attractive, and cheap oil encouraging more consumption and investment. Additionally, improvements in the labor market in Germany and France are expected to cause wage levels to rise and unemployment to fall.\nMany European nations are still struggling with extremely high unemployment, with youth unemployment reaching or exceeding 50% in Portugal, Spain, and Greece."}

{"idx": "3230", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The Three Faces Of Steve In this exclusive, personal conversation, Apple's CEO reflects on the turnaround, and on how a wunderkind became an old pro.\n(FORTUNE Magazine) \u2013 Well into the conversation with FORTUNE that you're about to read, Steve Jobs, the once and interim CEO of Apple Computer, professes to feel, at the wizened age of 43, no different from when he was a frisky 17-year-old. True to form, he contradicts himself a little later, confessing to be \"an old man now.\" Those comments reveal as much about why Jobs has been able to pull off his prestidigital revival of Apple--his first and still greatest creation--as do his observations on his business strategies and actions of the past year.\nHere's why. Jobs is most effective as a businessman and leader when he invokes the pathos and gestalt of his generation. He is, after all, a child of the 1960s--you're still likely to find him barefoot in the office, and for breakfast he eats granola doused in apple juice. Yet Jobs is also a mature baby-boomer, with an impressive if offbeat store of business experience, plus the typical worries that go with having a daughter in college and three tykes at home.\nSo it's no wonder that Apple, which still carries Steve's genes and has always been as much a cultural phenomenon as a purveyor of computers, is responding dramatically to his patently iconoclastic yet subtly more seasoned leadership. The Jobs style also seems to click at the other company he heads: Pixar Animation Studios, a place that blends Silicon Valley stock options and technical rigor with the fanciful creativity of the movie biz (see box).\nListening to Jobs talk about his companies and his personal life, one can tell he believes he has finally, after more than two decades, found the formula that lets him be what he's always been best at: a consumer technology impresario, an adroit chief executive, and, at heart, a cultural revolutionary. Call them the three faces of Steve.\nFriends, competitors, and even former foes agree that Jobs has wrung out much of whatever was dysfunctional in his mercurial style. Listen to Regis McKenna, the marketing guru who 20 years ago showed Steve the ropes in high-tech promotion: \"Steve has matured. You know how I can tell? He asked lots of people for advice when he returned to Apple and actually listened to them. He's learned from his mistakes. What better accolade can you give him?\"\nOr how about this appraisal by John Sculley, the ex-Apple CEO who squeezed Jobs out of the company in 1985: \"The turnaround isn't a fluke. It's back to the future. Steve has done an absolutely sensational job of turning Apple into what he always wanted it to be.\"\nIf there's a new balance to Jobs, it may arise in large part from the fact that his two companies are so different and require orthogonal skills. Larry Ellison, founder and CEO of Oracle, an Apple director and close friend of Jobs', observes: \"Pixar is good for Steve, because although he is basically the owner of the company, he is not the owner or creator of the movies it makes, and he knows it. At Apple it's the other way around. He owns only one share of Apple stock, yet he clearly owns the product and the idea behind the company. The Mac is the"}

Pat Gelsinger, vice president of Intel Corp.'s Desktop Products Group, is expected to detail the final spec in a keynote.\nPlans for USB 2.0 were announced last year by the USB 2.0 Promoter Group, consisting of Compaq Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Microsoft Corp., NEC Technologies Inc., and Philips Electronics NV. USB 2.0 ports and peripherals could be widely available next year.\nUSB 2.0 extends the speed of connections between peripherals and PCs to up to 480 megabits per second, compared to the 12-mbps capacity of USB 1.1. This makes it especially useful for such high-bandwidth devices and applications as scanners, storage, and digital still and video cameras.\nThe new spec will be backward compatible so that existing USB devices can run on the new ports--although at their existing, slower speeds. However, USB 2.0 will let you simultaneously run multiple USB 1.x peripherals off the same port.\nAnd you won't suffer the speed loss you'd experience with a USB 1.x port once the combined bandwidth of the devices exceeds the 12-mbps maximum of that port.\nAlthough USB 2.0 will be even faster than the current IEEE 1394 standard (also called FireWire by Apple Computer Inc. and ILink by Sony Corp.), which tops out at about 400 mbps, Intel officials say they view the two specs as complimentary rather than competing.

There was estrangement between me and my father, estrangement between me, my immediate family, and extended family members. There were no visits on holidays, no phone calls, and certainly no \"Happy Father's Day\" wishes on that special Sunday. I was so certain that I was right and justified in my anger, and this probably would have continued indefinitely except something happened.\nMy relationship with my daughter deteriorated. She was in her teens, 17 to be exact, and rebellious. She had kept her waywardness well-hidden from her mother and me. By the time I discovered it, my attempts to correct her course seemed to have just the opposite affect intended. I tried to cut her off from a group of friends that I believed were a bad influence, but she would ultimately leave our home and run away with them.\nIt was devastating. One day, I was so sorrowful and distraught I dropped to the floor on my knees and prayerfully begged God in tears to bring my daughter home.\nIt was then God spoke to me powerfully. What I heard in my head and heart was as near to an audible voice as one might expect to hear in faith. In my distress, God said, \"Mark, why should I bring your daughter home, when you haven't spoken to your father in two years? Go and be reconciled with your father.\"\nSo terribly under conviction from the experience, I rose up immediately and made my way to where my mother and father still resided at the home of my childhood.\nWhen I pulled the car into the driveway, I could see my father and sister doing some work in the backyard. They both paused for a moment, trying to make out from a distance if it was really me. Within seconds they both came running, while I hurried toward them. When we reached one another, we fell into each other's arms and the only thing we could do for the longest time was just stand there together and weep.\nStrangely, every wrong I felt I'd suffered that had precipitated the crisis between me and my Dad didn't seem to matter anymore. The family was ultimately re-united in every sense, and months later my daughter would also come home. Love, grace, and mercy had conquered all.\nThose days were some of the most painful in my life, but the many deep spiritual lessons I garnered from that incident were priceless.\nFirst, the circumstances impressed upon me as never before God's command to honor our parents. The Fifth Commandment reads, \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\"\nSomeone might quickly say, \"Well, you don't know my parents. They aren't honorable.\"\nYes, I know the feeling. I felt that way about my father during the time we were separated, but that's really irrelevant to the command. If you and I were to stand before the bar in a courtroom, we would address the judge as \"Your Honor.\" That expression actually says nothing about the kind of person the judge is, but we do it because we are required to recognize the authority of the judge's position. God commands us to always honor our parents, if for no other reason than God has made them our parents.\nSecond, I should have known it before, but it didn't really register with me. I was too busy looking at my Dad through my"}

{"idx": "3238", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: This presidential race leaves an odd sensation among those of us not having a television. Like the much-cited Kennedy-Nixon race, in which the camera was generally thought to have given Kennedy the visual edge, the Gore-Bush debates played very differently with the visuals suppressed. Listening to them, Gore sounded stilted, yes, and Bush sounded unbelievably evasive, no surprises there.\nWhat\u2019s more interesting, however, is that the day after the first debate, I found myself unable to understand any of the follow-up commentary in the rest of the media. Matching suits? Jerking? Smirking? Orange lighting? Had Al Gore really been made up to look like Ronald Reagan? Even the now-famous sigh was mostly a visual event\u2013a camera angle, a gesture of exasperation; it hadn\u2019t come across at all on radio.\nI felt as though I\u2019d missed out on some weird national Halloween party. Who had the best costume? Who won the monster mash dance contest? And who in the world was all this playing to?\nI suppose that\u2019s why the candidates ended their campaign playing to undecided Missourians. You can\u2019t get more middle than that. No one in Harlem, where Gore started his campaign, is undecided. No one at Bob Jones University, where Bush began his, is undecided. And so the race ended with the contestants sashaying down the runway in a mock Mr. America contest, attired like the Blues Brothers in identical suits and ties, each spouting platitudes about education and the moral fortress that is marriage, each playing down differences so as to appeal to the kind of centrist whose taste runs no further to the right or left than boiled as opposed to mashed potatoes.\nBut as someone who listened rather than watched, I am really shaken by how little attention has been paid to what substantive disagreements there are between Gore and Bush. There was, for example, that revealing moment when Bush was pushed about affirmative action\u2013not the right-wing version that equates affirmative action with quotas, but the actual, conservative version permitted by the Supreme Court. Bush responded with some nonsense about what he called \u201caffirmative access,\u201d which as Gore pointed out, has no legal or political meaning. When Bush was asked directly whether he would support affirmative action without quotas, he retorted, \u201cIf affirmative action means what I just described, what I\u2019m for, then I\u2019m for it.\u201d This was the kind of repeated evasion at which Bush is very practiced, but the kind of evasion that in fact speaks volumes. There are, I repeat, big differences between Bush and Gore when it comes to the issues about which most people are rarely undecided: race, gender, labor and environmental issues.\nI suppose that most everyone except undecided Missourians understood that such games were being played in the debates. What worries me is the degree to which the recognition of this as masquerade has made some forget that it is also a game with high stakes. Impatience with the game-playing leads some to want to opt for someone who speaks passionately. But let\u2019s face it: Neither Nader nor Buchanan nor any other third party candidate has a prayer of winning this election. That\u2019s a mathematical certainty, folks. It\u2019s not the world I like\u2013I wanted Bradley. But for now there are two choices given, and one will rule our lives.\nWe are choosing the world\u2019s most powerful leader. It is not an opinion poll, it is not a popularity contest and it is unlikely ever to be the vehicle for launching a progressive revolution."}

Barely noticed, the UN put the death toll in Yemen at nearly 2,800 after nine months of fighting.\nAnd that\u2019s all just since last Saturday. In Lebanon in 2015, there were suicide car bombs claimed by Isis, popular \u2018You Stink\u2019 protests against the government that were crushed by security police, fighting between Islamist and other factions in Palestinian refugee camps, and the sentencing of a former minister for importing explosives to kill politicians and religious figures.\nOrdinary Lebanese are bewildered, their population of around 4.5 million swelled by over 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Mountains of rubbish and electricity cuts are tangible consequences of government corruption and incompetence. There has been a political crisis with the presidency vacant since Michel Sleiman\u2019s term expired in 2014, and paralysis in government for far longer.\nJust across the border in Syria, Russia and Iran are backing president Bashar al-Assad, from the minority Alawi sect, against a collection of rebels who are mainly Sunni and have various degrees of support from the authorities and non-governmental groups in Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries.\nThere are Lebanese from Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) fighting alongside Assad, while on the other side Lebanese Sunnis have joined the rebels.

This past spring, students at South High School had the unique opportunity to hear firsthand from several of the few remaining men who fought for US freedom in WWII. For many, the experience opened a new window into the freedoms they enjoy and the sacrifices that made them possible. Students\u2019 gratitude came pouring\u2014quite literally\u2014in the form of 60 thank you notes recently delivered to the community.\nThese \u201cliving history lessons\u201d are a unique program offered through partnership between Clermont Park and Denver South High School. Over the past seven years, they have offered numerous students the opportunity to hear from those who have served, including Nicholas Westendorf, Colorado\u2019s oldest living WWII veteran, who just turned 105 this past month.\nNick Westendorf helped train hundreds of new recruits at Naval Air Station Glenview in Chicago and later served as airplane mechanic in the Pacific Theater. His stories offer an eye-opening glimpse into life for the many soldiers who served in roles supporting the invasion forces. While Westendorf was able to spend his first years in recruitment closer to home, he was so busy that he actually forgot about his wife\u2019s first pregnancy. He came home one night to find her packing a suitcase, and when he asked why, she informed him that she was in labor and headed to the hospital.\nWhen the Navy no longer needed new pilots (and recruitment trainers) for the war effort, Westendorf was shipped overseas to the Philippines. \u201cI signed up for the war,\u201d he explained upon being asked why he continued to serve after his time in recruitment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d During this second half of WWII service he recalls the unique experiences of living in a Quonset Hut, docking in a harbor of half-sunken Japanese and American ships and going through the hazing-like \u201cinitiation\u201d administered to soldiers crossing the equator for the first time.\nHis time in the Philippines included more \u201cbehind-the-scenes work,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t essential. Together with three other airplane mechanics, Westendorf repaired hundreds of P24 aircraft that scouted for Japanese ships. The team of four worked at all hours to make sure that every plane was ready for its next day\u2019s mission.\nWestendorf\u2019s home is now Clermont Park Life Plan Community where he can be near his grown daughter Sandra.

But in these tough economic times, Vietnam and China could face new strains to add to their long and often acrimonious history.\nSince normalisation in 1991, China and Vietnam have made impressive progress in forging better ties, said Brantly Womack, a China-Vietnam expert at the University of Virginia.\nTwo-way trade last year grew to $21 billion, for instance.\n\u201cChina and Vietnam had no more reason to be friendly than Russia and Poland, and Russia and Poland ... are still each others\u2019 worst enemy,\u201d he said.\nThe fact the engravings in Lang Son do not spell out that the soldiers died \u201cfighting China\u201d illustrates Hanoi\u2019s cautious approach toward Beijing.\nFor its part, the stability-obsessed Chinese leadership has made a concerted effort in recent years to build constructive ties. But the coming months will be challenging.\nBoth export-fed economies, dependent on high-speed growth, are facing their sternest test since economic reforms were launched decades ago and the global financial uncertainty raises the potential for heightened tension.\nEven in good times, the efforts of Vietnamese and Chinese policymakers to be nice has limits. Both governments claim ownership of the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea, which are thought to sit on valuable oil and gas deposits.\nIn addition, both ruling Communist parties are constrained by the spectre of nationalist unrest if they appear soft on the issue. In 2007, hundreds of Vietnamese youth protested at the Chinese embassy in Hanoi after China reportedly set up a county government responsible for the disputed archipelagos.\nBeyond protests and rhetoric, the territorial dispute is a tangible political risk.\nLast July, China pressured Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to pull out of an oil exploration deal with Vietnam that it saw as a breach of Chinese sovereignty.

{"idx": "3257", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The benefits promised by blockchain technology are starting to make their way to Hollywood.\nChristopher Woodrow, American financier and CEO and Founder of MovieCoin, a financial technology company that leverages digital assets within the film and entertainment industry, has announced interest to bring blockchain technology to Hollywood.\nSince the launch of MovieCoin, we\u2019ve had tremendous interest from people all over the world. In particular, we\u2019ve discovered that blockchain technology can have a big impact on entertainment financing. To invest in Hollywood, one previously had to show up with a check for $50 million dollars for anyone to take them seriously. Utilizing blockchain can open up an entirely new asset class to accredited investors, Woodrow told me.\nWoodrow, who is no stranger to Hollywood, has financed and produced a number of notable feature films including box office hits, Black Mass and Hacksaw Ridge, as well as the critically acclaimed hit Birdman. Woodrow\u2019s films have grossed in excess of $700 million worldwide and have been nominated for 16 Academy Awards, winning six Oscars, including Best Picture.\nI had the opportunity to speak with Woodrow about how tokenizing industry assets will benefit Hollywood.\nRachel Wolfson: How will tokenizing assets impact Hollywood?\nChristopher Woodrow: The tokenization of assets will have a big impact on Hollywood in terms of investing in films, a sector that has been incredibly illiquid. For instance, those investing in a movie are traditionally locked up for several years. Those investing in several movies could even be locked up for a decade.\nThe MovieCoin MSF security token, for example, will be freely traded on security token exchanges after a one-year and will allow accredited investors to buy and sell tokens that represent ownership of the underlying portfolio of movies. This is a real significant change in Hollywood, as a tremendous amount of liquidity is being brought to a previously illiquid asset class.\nMoreover, aside from blockchain technology providing greater transparency and trust to investors, the MFS token is being offered to accredited investors all over the world. High net worth individuals everywhere can now participate in the financing of major Hollywood movies. Hollywood is still very much a closed club. Unless you know someone, you can\u2019t just go and finance a movie. But now for a relatively small amount of money, investors all over the world can participate in the financing of real movies.\nWolfson: Do you believe that security tokens are the future of the cryptocurrency market?\nWoodrow: Without question, security tokens are the future. I think it could be 20 times the size of the current cryptocurrency market, and security tokens will be groundbreaking in many ways. However, with respect to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency in general, I don\u2019t think this is something that is dying. ICOs were hyped last years and are now cooling off a bit, but this is becoming more regulated, which is good for everybody involved.\nWolfson: How exactly is blockchain technology benefiting Hollywood?\nWoodrow: In terms of blockchain, one of the key things to consider is access. To previously invest in Hollywood films, someone had to show up with a check for $50 million dollars to be taken seriously. Utilizing blockchain technology can open up an entirely new class to accredited investors who previously couldn\u2019t do this.\nAlso, liquidity is a significant breakthrough. We are talking about a market with above average returns, but historically has had very little liquidity. Now, suddenly you have liquidity. In my mind, we will see more money coming to this asset class.\nFinally, transparency"}
{"idx": "3258", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Japanese super-brand Uniqlo has officially completed the digital leg of its major expansion, with its long-awaited e-commerce platform launching today. Naturally, since online shopping is our middle name, we immediately took to Uniqlo.com to see whether we\u2019ll be bookmarking it \u2014 or whether we\u2019ll stick to shopping in the store\u2019s several brick-and-mortar locations. Read on for our (very general) assessment.\nEase of use: Overall, the site\u2019s not too difficult to navigate but it\u2019s definitely busy. Busier than we expected of the minimalist Japanese brand. You\u2019re first asked to select if you\u2019re a man or a woman, and from there it\u2019s a lot to take in. First, there\u2019s a page featuring select fall picks, which are showcased on models (good ones, including Lindsey Wixon) and when you hover over each, the looks roll over to reveal stills of each item. It\u2019s a fresh, visually appealing choice.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something more specific, click on over to the general women\u2019s section (a bit hard to find, on the top navigation) and choose a category (skirts, jeans, coats, bras, etc). There\u2019s a lot to sift through, so the brand organized its offerings with stylistic titles. For example, if you\u2019re shopping for dresses, you\u2019ll find the inventory grouped under captions like \u201ceasy living\u201d (flannel, slouchy) and \u201cunderstated elegance\u201d (solid jumpers, wool wrap dresses).\nSizing: So far, most sizes seem to be stocked (unlike at the NYC stores, which are almost always devoid of smaller sizes).\nLogging in: After items are placed in your cart and you\u2019re ready to check out, you\u2019ll be asked to register. What\u2019s interesting here is that users are able to login via Facebook, which adds a social media component to the experience.\nShipping and Returns: Standard orders over $100 receive free shipping, and it\u2019s $7 for orders under $100. Probably not the best move, considering the items are so inexpensive from the outset (standard knitwear starts at under $30, with hosiery as little as $12), so getting to $100 if you\u2019re not buyng a coat or some cashmere might be difficult. It also could be considered unwise because peripheral competitors like Zara \u2014whose entire e-commerce experience is technically and visually a pleasure\u2014offer free standard shipping and returns. Here, there\u2019s an additional $7 return fee, as well.\nThe bottom line: While the site is a fantastic resource for those without a Uniqlo store nearby, we\u2019ll likely only be inclined to use it if we\u2019re shopping for something over $100, or if we\u2019re unable to locate an item we want in the store. That said, there\u2019s no denying the chic simplicity of Uniqlo as a brand. Click through the gallery above to see some key online offerings."}
{"idx": "3259", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Witness is an argument. It uses game design, audio, and video to present its case about our relation to the search for truth.\nDeveloper Thekla and designer Jonathan Blow\u2019s puzzle game is a challenging adventure where you draw lines, listen to orations, and watch YouTube clips. It sounds simple, but as you go through that journey, The Witness uses these elements to make claims about the human experience while also providing evidence for those claims.\nPut simply, The Witness is about exploration and the human need to reach out and understand the unknown.\nYou have the capability to seek the truth.\nIt\u2019s noble to seek the truth.\nInterpreting the truth through common experience is important to understanding it.\nYou\u2019ll never reach the truth.\nThe Witness claims that the search for truth is the story of humanity. Individually, we witness existence moment to moment, and then we collectively combine those experiences over eons to empower the next generation of explorers to witness something new as a representative of our species.\nThat\u2019s a big case to make, and it all starts with you playing a game.\nPlaying The Witness in the context of its wider argument is about the importance of games throughout history to both people and animals.\nIn The Witness, you encounter confusing puzzles with esoteric rules. When you first try to solve these, they can appear daunting to the point of impossibility. Or you might assume that you\u2019re not smart enough to figure these things out. But over time, you slowly begin building up a mental vocabulary that enables you to decode and conquer these mazes until you reach a level of fluency with the game\u2019s world.\nIn this way, The Witness is no different from the games of other species. A lion cub plays with its siblings to help it get comfortable with moving and leaping. This is preparation for a life of hunting and fighting off competitors. Studies have also shown that rats (and some primates) play games to fine-tune their fight-or-flight responses.\nThe Witness is a way to help you fine-tune your fight-or-flight response in the face of challenging cerebral problems. If you battle through Blow\u2019s puzzles, you may end up feeling more capable of taking the more complex ideas of the real world.\nAnd having confidence in your capability to understand and solve problems is something The Witness reiterates in one of the first videos you play in the theater room hidden beneath the windmill.\nThe video is from the 1978 BBC science program Connections. It is from the final episode of the original series. Presenter James Burke sums up the core argument of his show, which is that understanding how the world works is how you have a say in its future.\nBurke claims that the scientists and technologists who understand the fundamentals of nature are the \u201ctrue driving force of humanity.\u201d And he maintains that you can have that power, too. You don\u2019t have to wait for someone to come around and give it to you. Instead, you have the capability to start asking questions and making discoveries for yourself.\nAnd the fact that you\u2019ve beaten The Witness is proof of your capabilities.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you asked for help while playing the game. It isn\u2019t a failing that you needed to ask someone to explain something to you slowly and clearly. All that matters is that you understood it in the end, and you were able to act on that understanding. You\u2019re intelligent and capable and all of human knowledge belongs to you.\nBurke goes a bit further and says that you don\u2019t need to settle for second- or third-hand interpretations of"}

The choir will perform next weekend.\nThe annual spring concert by the Salt Lake Children's Choir has traditionally been a musical trip that visits many countries and traverses a spacious range of styles and periods. That's partly because founder and director Ralph Woodward enjoys presenting programs of the widest possible scope.\nBut there's also a more practical reason. \"We're able to cover so much ground musically because the pieces we sing are so short,\" Woodward told the Deseret Morning News. \"But even though a lot of them aren't long, they are still interesting and sophisticated.\"\nAudiences will get a chance to hear the children sing on Friday and Saturday in First Presbyterian Church beginning at 7:30 p.m. And this year the group will also present the same program at BYU-Idaho on May 18 and in Brigham City on May 19.\nFor years, the Salt Lake Children's Choir has held its spring programs in Libby Gardner Concert Hall, but since last year, it's been calling First Presbyterian home. \"I like it there,\" Woodward said. \"It has an immediacy with the audience that is nice. You can see the kids better, and the acoustics have improved since their renovation.\"\nBefore forming the choir in 1979, Woodward traveled extensively through Europe and South America. From those trips he brought back a wealth of folk songs that he's arranged for children's voices, and which dot the spring programs. This year, there will be songs from Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Finland, Scotland, Bolivia, Brazil, Panama and other countries.\nWoodward noted that he chooses folk music not as a novelty but because of musical relevance. \"My selections are driven from musical interests. All of these pieces have real musical worth.\"\nIn addition to the folk music, the choir will sing \"Lift Thine Eyes\" from Mendelssohn's oratorio \"Elijah,\" along with a series of art songs by Mendelssohn (\"On Wings of Song\"), Brahms (\"A Thought Like Music\"), Massenet (\"Bonne Nuit\") and Butterworth (\"Loveliest of Trees\" from \"A Shropshire Lad\").\n\"The kids enjoy many of these masterpieces because of their sheer beauty,\" Woodward said. And that, in effect, is the impetus behind many of the works he puts on the program. Oftentimes Woodward includes a piece because the children keep asking to sing it. \"The kids' interests are broad, and so we're able to engage with them in a varied musical program,\" he said. \"And our tastes are not that different.\"\nCloser to home, the choir will sing two African-American spirituals, \"Deep River\" and \"Let Me Fly.\" Talking about \"Deep River,\" Woodward said it's been a favorite of the choir for years. Each year the children keep asking to do it. \"They really get into it. I feel something very moving about the way they approach it.\"\nWoodward said there is no specific angle to the concert. But with music from the Renaissance to folk, together with spirituals and cowboy songs (\"My Home's in Montana\"), the concert promises to have something to please everyone in the"}

To begin playing better as a team however, star players Hailey Leidel and Maggie Mulligan must get their play back to their expectations.\nLeidel, who has shot just 4-13 and 4-18 over the last two games, has been in a bit of an offensive slump. The reigning Atlantic-10 Rookie of the Year still sits fourth in the conference in three-point percentage, but her recent slide has hurt the Minutewomen\u2019s offensive production as of late. Coach Verdi admits that Hailey\u2019s play hasn\u2019t been up to par in recent games.\nSenior forward Maggie Mulligan has also been in a bit of a slump, shooting below 50 percent and getting into foul trouble early the past two games. The premier inside threat for the Minutewomen, Mulligan\u2019s inability to stay on the floor as of late, has allowed teams to take advantage of them on the interior.\nThe presence of Mulligan, who sits fifth in the A-10 in rebounds, averaging 9.6 per game, impacts the game immensely for the Minutewomen.\nTypically, when Mulligan gets into foul trouble, Verdi alters his 2-3 zone to include Hailey Leidel at the center position.\nMulligan\u2019s absence on the court creates a compounding effect on the rest of the team, as Leidel\u2019s defense is missed on the wing as well. If the Minutewomen want to bounce back on Wednesday, it\u2019s imperative Mulligan stays on the court for as long as she can.\nThough Leidel and Mulligan\u2019s play greatly affects the outcome of Wednesday\u2019s game, UMass shot a very poor 29 percent and 36.8 percent in the last two games, respectively.\nTory Verdi has taken some words out of Bill Belichick\u2019s book on how Leidel, Mulligan and the rest of the team can improve for next game, and from this point out.\nTip off from Washington D.C will commence at 7 p.m. on Wednesday."}

This became particularly clear last week, when Google released its latest financial statements. In 2014, Google said, it spent nearly $11 billion on big stuff like land and buildings and hardware. In other words, it spent more on the big stuff than Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker and a company whose capital spending was traditionally a high-water mark for tech businesses.\nWhile Intel spent about $10 billion on the property, massive manufacturing plants, and equipment needed to build all those chips, Google spent $11 billion expanding a very different kind of business. Yes, it may have spent money on equipment needed to manufacture things like phones and smart thermostats, but the main point here is that the company likely shells out far more on the data centers, computer servers, and networking equipment needed to operate its vast online empire.\nThe world, you see, has changed. Google's $11 billion is a wonderfully succinct symbol for an enormous shift in modern technology, a shift that will only get bigger in the years to come. What the Oracle of Omaha failed to realize is that in the future, the Googles and Microsofts will be among the biggest spenders, not the smallest. And together with Apple and Amazon, they will use such enormous spending to replace the very foundations of modern technology, pushing aside not only Intel, but also old-school computer makers such as Dell, HP, EMC, and others.\n\"What has happened in the last 10 years is that the players thought to have no capital expense are actually spending more than those, like Intel, that were held up as the most capital intense,\" says Horace Dediu, a tech financial analyst with a think tank called the Clayton Christensen Institute. \"As things move to the cloud, the effect is on Intel and HP and Dell and on the IT departments of the world\u2014an entire power-base for how IT decisions are made.\"\nIn expanding their already vast internet empires, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple are spending unprecedented amounts on the data centers and hardware devices that underpin their online services. And as these internet giants push into cloud computing\u2014offering services that let outside companies, developers, and individuals run software and store data without setting up their own machines\u2014they're eating away at the market for PCs, computer servers, storage hardware, and other stuff sold by the likes of Dell and HP. In the long run, they may undermine even Intel's chip business.\nThe world isn't just moving its software onto cloud computing services. Increasingly, we're tapping into this online software from smartphones and other mobile devices\u2014many built by Apple and Google\u2014and typically, these mobile devices eschew chips from Intel in favor of designs from rival ARM.

A beautiful cross and a header into the top corner of the net \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of moment that\u2019s perfect for World Cup fans to share on social media. Until, that is, the video disappears.\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, ESPN(S dis) and Univision have been sending in copyright strikers to take down videos of World Cup goals. In response, sports site SB Nation has had two social media accounts suspended, while Slate had to remove a popular clip that showed 138 goals in short succession. The Twitter account @replaylastgoal has also been suspended.\nFortunately, it is not every World Cup clip that ESPN, which is working with FIFA to enforce copyright, finds objectionable. According to the Journal, it is goal highlights \u2014 rather than things like fan celebrations \u2014 that are attracting the takedown notices.\nAll this, though, begs the question: does ESPN have the right to remove short goal videos at all? Under the doctrine of fair use, people can display a copyrighted work without permission in certain circumstances. For instance, an appeals court in California last year said that the musical \u201cJersey Boys\u201d was allowed under fair use to play a 6-second clip of the Ed Sullivan show. And, indeed, the history of fair use and hip-hop explains why Vine videos are six seconds in the first place. There\u2019s even a website devoted to Vine videos of TV\u2019s best moments.\nIn the case of the World Cup, however, the law is not so cut and dried. That\u2019s because fair use is not determined by a bright line rule, but by a four-part test that looks at things like the purpose of the use, and its effect on the market value of the original work. ESPN executives, who paid $100 million for the rights to the 2010 and 2014 broadcasts, would no doubt be quick to claim that goal highlights are the most valuable, important moment of a game \u2014 and that fair use should not apply. They are also no doubt keen to protect their current partnerships with Google(s goog) and others to distribute the highlights on their own terms.\nBut while the legal status of goal highlights is unclear, many other World Cup related clips clearly are fair use. The problem right now is that it is ESPN who gets to decide what is fair use and what is not. Under the rules of copyright law, ESPN lawyers can shoot first and ask questions later; it\u2019s true that people can challenge the takedowns as invalid, but that process takes at least 10 days, by which time the excitement of the moment is long past.\nUnder these circumstances, the best outcome may be for Twitter and other companies that host such clips to challenge the takedown notices, but so far they appear unwilling to rock the boat.\nSo for now, the best fans can hope for is that ESPN and FIFA will have the sense not to go overboard, and use copyright to kill the social media excitement that has become part of this year\u2019s tournament. And, if you\u2019ve had a World Cup highlight takedown, please leave us a comment if you think that was fair, and what you think the rules should be.\nTalk about short-sighted. Those clips are free advertising for ESPN\u2019s programming.\n@Steve, exactly. They don\u2019t understand network effect. Nor do most silo-ed app, content or service providers when distribution or interworking costs drop but they retain artificial barriers to new consumption models."}

Among all the districts that have retained all their librarians since 2005, 75% are white, Education Week reports. On the other end of the scale, student populations in the 20 districts that lost the most librarians in the same time comprised 78% students of color.\nIn other words, while U.S. employment rates are back up in the wake of the Great Recession, the public school librarian sector has not rebounded, and the nation's collective failure to rebuild its public information infrastructure is hitting minorities the hardest.\nSome states suffered a more dramatic loss than the average. The number of librarians employed across Florida\u2019s 67 school districts has dropped by 27% since just 2005, according to a 2017 Herald Tribune article, leaving several districts without any librarians at all. In replacement, the Herald Tribune argues, paraprofessionals run libraries as media aides \u2014 a position that requires just a high school diploma and a certification, and which starts at $14.60 an hour. Librarians with masters' degrees, however, are often the first to go when budgets need to be cut.\nEducation Week's articles also argues that librarian's roles are being replaced by other, less qualified job titles: As public school librarians dwindled by 20%, schools saw an 11% rise in counselors, 19% boost in instructional aides, and a full 28% more school administrators. Hopefully, some of those unemployed librarians were able to secure a second career in an administration position. Disputing this viewpoint, however, is Keith Curry Lance's School Library Journal analysis, which notes that public school library support staff have been cut or otherwise stopped working at a rate even faster than that of librarians: Support staff have dropped from more than 46,000 to fewer than 26,000, a loss of nearly 45 percent during the same time period librarians dropped nearly 20 percent. Hopefully, some of those unemployed librarians were able to secure a second career in an administration position.\nWhile the direct impact of the drop in school librarians can be tough to pinpoint with data, several recent studies have indicated that students suffer academically as a result: One nationwide study published in 2011 found signs that states' 4th grade reading scores dropped in correlation with their loss of librarians. A 2012 Colorado-specific study from the same researchers then followed up, finding a similar correlation in the opposite direction: \"Schools that either maintained or gained an endorsed librarian between 2005 and 2011 tended to have more students scoring advanced in reading in 2011 and to have increased their performance more than schools that either lost their librarians or never had one,\" that study holds.\n\"You"}

The Veteran's use of medication is reduced or eliminated under their Dr's care; in many instances, they return to work or school; and they are able to re-engage at last with friends, family and community.\nGuardian Angels is honored to have been chosen to partner with the Greater Metropolitan Association of REALTORS(R), and inspired by their commitment to the Michigan Veteran Community. GMAR is truly saving lives, one paw at a time.\nThe Greater Metropolitan Association of REALTORS(R) (GMAR) is the premier Association of REALTORS(R) in Southeast Michigan, providing services and support to the real estate profession and the communities they serve. With over 8,700 members, GMAR is the largest local REALTOR(R) association in the state. GMAR provides many benefits to its members, such as access to the MLS, over 220 quality continuing education and designation courses per year, the largest REALTOR(R) specific store in the area, the ToolShop(tm), Metropolitan Minute weekly newsletter and Metropolitan REALTOR(R) monthly electronic magazine. GMAR's mission is to educate, advocate, and care for our members and the communities they love."}

What do they make?\u201d I was asked this question on more than one occasion before attending Honeywell\u2019s media day in Phoenix, Arizona a couple weeks ago. In so many words, the answer is \u201ceverything, really.\u201d Although Honeywell plays an integral part in the aviation industry, it is almost all behind the scenes.\nHoneywell Engine HTF7000, used in mid-sized business jets, in production. Image courtesy Honeywell.\nFrom nose to tail, Honeywell probably crams more components into a typical aircraft than any other firm. To the average passenger, Honeywell is probably known as the manufacturer of their home thermostat from 1972. In the aircraft, however, Honeywell manufactures auxiliary power units, engines, avionics, complex air conditioning systems, radar systems, critical safety systems, and even in-flight WiFi hardware.\nAt their facility located just outside of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Honeywell kicked off a two day media event to give journalists, bloggers, and industry players a close look at exactly what it does. At this facility, Honeywell manufactures its jet engines and auxiliary power units (APU), which are essentially smaller jet engines located in the tail of the aircraft to supply electrical power and compressed air to the aircraft when needed. Both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family of aircraft use Honeywell APUs. The brand new Airbus A350 does as well, using Honeywell\u2019s largest APU ever.\nAfter a tour of production floor, it was time to see some of Honeywell\u2019s latest and greatest safety systems up close. That is when things really got interesting. The only way to make sure their new technology works in the real world is to test it in the real world, and this requires an aircraft. Enter the Honeywell Convair 580. Born a Convair 340 and delivered to United Airlines in 1952, this aircraft has been upgraded more times than can be counted to include upgraded engines and cutting edge avionics. Why a 1952 Convair, you ask? Honeywell says the strong aircraft packs an oversized nose, which is perfect for mounting 30 inch radar dishes you might find on a much larger aircraft.\nThe TCAS display on the flight deck. Image courtesy Honeywell.\nJust after lunch (bad idea), a group of about ten boarded the aircraft so Honeywell could demonstrate the enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) and traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). The climbout from Skyharbor was bumpy, but the Convair is a strong bird and handles it well.\nSo, how exactly does Honeywell test its EGPWS? They point the plane at the side of a mountain, of course! A haunting voice shouting \u201cTERRAIN! TERRAIN!\u201d echoed through our headsets as a monitor at the front of the cabin filled with the red outline of a mountain. The pilots yank the control column and we soar over the top of the of the rocks. Yup, it works!\nCloser to the city, TCAS lit up with targets in all directions \u2013 this is busy airspace. Under real test conditions, Honeywell will send up a second aircraft and set the two on a collision course. Once the two aircraft get close enough, the system issues a resolution advisory to both aircraft to successfully avoid disaster. One aircraft climbs, the other descends. TCAS is one of the most critical safety systems on a modern airliner, silently watching the skies at"}

One tunes into expecting \u2014 nay, hoping \u2014 to see laughably incoherent plots, full of holes and aping, in a cheap, made-for-TV way, some cheap, made-for-the-big-screen SF flick; ridiculously bad FX, replete with awful bluescreening and obvious CGI that some 19-year-old geek would have been creating for fun for his friend\u2019s Atom Film if he weren\u2019t being ludicrously overpaid to do the same for this production; and plenty of cheesy acting, perhaps (hopefully) by beautiful, half-naked people, though these (the half-naked people) will be mostly of the female variety, because few on the entertainment assembly line seem to have realized that straight women (and gay men, presumably, though they are a smaller demographic) actually like seeing beautiful half-naked men as much as straight men (and, presumably, gay women, though they are an even smaller demographic) like seeing beautiful, half-naked women.

A 'Super Sunday' it certainly wasn't.\nBurnley managed just one shot on goal in 45 minutes but Matej Vydra's attempt was more suited to the national sport of Wales. Even then, however, the forward's attempt would have been wide of the upright.\nCallum Paterson's attempt for the Bluebirds wasn't much better, either. The 23-year-old dragged the ball wide of the target after Joe Ralls had collected Ben Mee's clearance.\nAs the Clarets struggled to get a foothold in the game, Neil Warnock's side continued to press and Joe Hart had his woodwork to thank after Josh Murphy broke in to the box from the left hand side.\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche was forced in to a change midway through the first half as James Tarkowski, struggling with a shoulder injury, was replaced by Kevin Long.\nHart has been in fine form since joining the Clarets in the summer and the England international had to be at his best to deny Victor Camarasa at his near post after the Spaniard latched on to Paterson's pass.\nThe home side had the ball in the back of the net with 10 minutes of the half remaining but referee Martin Atkinson pulled play back after spotting an infringement.\nCity skipper Sean Morrison was the guilty party, climbing on the back of Long from Camarasa's corner as Zohore flicked the ball past Hart.\nThe Bluebirds almost had their noses in front just before the break when Vokes inadvertently glanced Morrison's header in to the six yard box and Paterson's looping header was cleared off the line by Vydra.\nCity appealed desperately for a penalty in time added on as Paterson acrobatically fired in to the arms of Matt Lowton but the cries fell on deaf ears.\nViewers would have been forgiven for switching off to catch the celebrations in Paris but they would have missed Johann Berg Gudmundsson's opener.\nQuick thinking from Aaron Lennon caught the hosts by surprise and Ashley Westwood's cross was converted at the far post by the Icelandic winger, who had to check twice to make sure that his header had beat Neil Etheridge.\nCamarasa fired over on the volley as Cardiff responded and they levelled on the hour as Burnley left their dangerman unmarked.\nBruno Ecuele Manga was allowed to get in behind on the right and his cross was fired back in the direction it came from by Murphy who picked out the corner.\nThe equaliser lifted the home side and it was Murphy who continued to threaten.

{"idx": "3316", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Newport-Mesa school officials have begun trying to explain how the Common Core State Standards will be implemented beginning in the next school year.\nIt's no easy job, given that they probably aren't entirely sure themselves what the new standards will look like in practice.\nEven so, district administrators are practically giddy with enthusiasm over the changes, which they believe will usher in more rigor and relevance to the classroom. In a meeting I attended recently, staff members were visibly excited as they attempted to introduce Common Core concepts to a group of parents.\nCommon Core is an effort to create national standards for K-12 education. Sponsored by the National Governors Assn. and the Council of Chief State School Officers, Common Core has been adopted by 45 states since 2010. California plans to use the assessment system being developed by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, but has left it up to each district to figure out how to implement the standards.\nAt its heart, Common Core is meant to achieve a few important goals: to tie what students learn to what they'll need to succeed in college and the workplace; to improve analysis and critical thinking skills; and to create a national framework that allows for states to evaluate progress and share information.\nBut all the excitement whipped up by the coming of Common Core must be tempered by some realistic expectations. Sorry to be a bit of a party-pooper, it's just that a little perspective and caution is in order. We've seen so-called revolutions in education before that have resulted in mixed or controversial results \u2014 remember the whole-language movement anyone? \u2014 prompting a backlash toward more traditional teaching styles.\nIndeed, a chorus of Common Core critics has emerged to take issue with many of the initiative's features, including its focus on standardized testing. Most controversial is the greater emphasis on nonfiction reading, which many believe can be achieved only at the expense of exposing kids to important works of literature.\nCommon Core enthusiasts consider these concerns overblown, and they may be right. But for all the promise of Common Core, the devil will be in the details, and in the implementation. The district is in the process of designing units of study to be piloted next year, and future staff training will focus on teaching the teachers how to employ the new methods.\nIt was evident at the meeting I attended that going from the broad strokes of Common Core goals and strategies to actual classroom practices will take time, discipline and a teaching community that is fully on board with the changes.\nIn one telling exchange between parents and district staff, questions about whether all teachers will cooperate and be held accountable under the new system were met with vague and somewhat confusing answers having to do with development, creativity and the impression that most teachers share their excitement about Common Core.\nMany questions were also raised about how Common Core will affect existing programs, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes, accelerated math tracks, and tests such as the California exit exam. Most of the answers were of the \"we need to figure it out\" variety.\nAs puzzled as many parents seemed, the response to the basic ideas behind Common Core appeared positive. As they roll out the changes, it might help if district officials avoid educational jargon and acronym-heavy sentences. Speak to us in plain English.\nAt one point during the presentation, a Power Point image was shown of a box split into four squares and references were made to \"quadrants A-D.\" I still have no idea what that was about.\nObviously, Common Core's success will require a lot more than just effectively communicating the concepts to parents.

Recruiters, career counselors and students say the fall recruiting season has been the most active since the dot.com boom.\nCollege hiring is expected to increase 13 percent over last year, according to a new survey from National Association of Colleges and Employers (search). Seven out of 10 employers said they expected to increase salary offers to new college grads, according to the survey released late last week, with an average increase of 3.7 percent.\nAccountants are again finding increased demand for their services \u2014 thanks to the wave of post-Enron regulations \u2014 but theirs is just one of several hot fields. Technology companies, investment banks and consulting firms appear to be picking up the pace, as do some defense contractors and even smaller businesses that haven&apos;t traditionally recruited on campus.\n\"I haven&apos;t been to school in the last three weeks because of my interview schedule,\" said Eric Golden, a senior at Bentley College (search), a business-oriented school in the Boston suburb of Waltham.

A population boom among college students has tightened competition, and employers remain gun-shy about big bonuses.\nSome engineers are still having a tough time, in part because so much manufacturing has moved off shore. And many businesses, notably financial services, learned to get by with leaner staffs during the downturn.\nBut there is clear momentum. At California State University, Fullerton (search), the number of companies at a fall career fair was up about 40 percent from last year; at the University of Florida (search), the number of recruiting companies is up as much as 15 percent.\nAnd at the University of Notre Dame (search) in South Bend, Ind., interviews are up roughly 30 percent and the school had to step in, requiring recruiters to allow students to mull job offers until at least Nov. 24.

People who eat at unusual times have more digestive illnesses than those who eat primarily during daytime hours, when the motility of the gastrointestinal system is at its peak \u2014 in other words, when your gut is working the most efficiently.\nEven if someone is used to being up all night, the body isn't prepared to digest full meals at a time when biological cues indicate it should be at rest.

His current research, financed by a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, is looking at the relationship between gastrointestinal clocks and aging.\nCassone said researchers know that the body craves higher-fat food later in the day.

In novelist Heather O\u2019Neill\u2019s case, her father shared hard-earned wisdom culled from early years as a petty criminal through to his work as a kind of philosopher-janitor. Unfortunately, his enthusiasm for dispensing life advice was in direct opposition to its practical application. But it certainly makes for good reading.\nBased on a lecture O\u2019Neill gave at the University of Alberta, this collection, like all of her work, is filled with humour, moments of joy, sudden bursts of deep emotion and heartbreaking sincerity.\nThe advice itself ranges from not-great to completely misguided. Learn to play the tuba, her father insists; there\u2019s a shortage of tuba players in the world so work is guaranteed. A well-meaning example of supply and demand, no doubt, but one which fails to take into account that the dearth of tuba players in the world is itself due to lack of demand. Make friends with Jewish kids; a pro-Semitic sentiment, although it comes off as the opposite until you learn that O\u2019Neill\u2019s father grew up in 1930s Montreal and admired how well his Jewish neighbours did in life \u2013 it stands to reason that you should stick with and learn from more successful people.\nBuddy O\u2019Neill\u2019s advice is incredibly specific to his experiences, and is often so narrowly applicable as to be effectively useless. There\u2019s no better example of this than the gem, \u201cNever watch a Paul Newman movie.\u201d Based on some sort of that-could-have-been-my-life, one-sided grudge, the rule extended all the way to the actor\u2019s line of salad dressings.\nAs a young girl, O\u2019Neill gamely tried to follow her dad\u2019s advice, but often found it wanting. Instead, she eventually finds the sentiment behind the nonsensical lessons. In the same way her dad wrote cheques for absurd amounts of money but never signed them \u2013 saying he would once things turned around \u2013 she comes to see that his advice was built on good intentions.\nIf there\u2019s one recurring theme, it\u2019s that her father thought the differences between people were superficial. As O\u2019Neill says, \u201cIf you were to change coats with a rich person, you would immediately become one.\u201d This no-one-is-better-than-me outlook serves her father poorly, but is hugely influential on O\u2019Neill\u2019s development as a writer, as she comes to appreciate the value in the world of her youth, the lower-class Montreal of the \u201980s and \u201990s.\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s debut, Lullabies for Little Criminals, is set in Montreal in these years, and St. Louis Square, then a rough park filled with addicts and a regular haunt for O\u2019Neill and her dad, features heavily.

It is probably no coincidence that an attacker also chose last week to plant phony ATM machines around Las Vegas in an attempt to capture account and PIN information and extract money from compromised accounts.\nPerhaps the attacker saw it as a personal challenge to \u201chack the hackers\u201d and test whether or not these security hobbyists and experts could detect an attempt to pull the wool over their eyes. The ironic part is that there was a presentation scheduled to be delivered at Blackhat by Juniper\u2019s Barnaby Jack related to exploiting a flaw in certain ATM machines, but the presentation was canceled at the request of an ATM vendor.\nThe presentation focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in devices running the Windows CE operating system. Many ATM machines rely on the Windows CE operating system so divulging the hack publicly could have had dire consequences. Juniper\u2019s director of corporate social media relations, Brendan Lewis, wrote a post on Juniper\u2019s official blog stating \u201cTo publicly disclose the research findings before the affected vendor could properly mitigate the exposure would have potentially placed their customers at risk. That is something we don't want to see happen.\"\nThat seems very altruistic on the part of Juniper and Barnaby Jack considering that Juniper notified the vendor of the vulnerability more than eight months ago. It wasn\u2019t as if it was a zero-day exploit or sudden shock to the vendor. Canceling the presentation prevents the flaw from becoming public knowledge, but the fact that they were able to find it and that affected systems have been vulnerable for more than eight months suggests that it is also possible that others with more questionable moral fiber may have stumbled upon the flaw as well and be actively exploiting it."}

Later he used his intelligence and knowledge of capital markets and leverage to build a financial empire in banking and insurance.\nThe Ministry of Public Security in Beijing has not commented on Xiao's whereabouts but China is in the middle of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday and most government offices are closed."}

Or wait, on reflection, maybe it\u2019s smarter scripts.\nOr hang on, perhaps it\u2019s more coherent action scenes. Or actually, you know what; it\u2019s the removal of Zack Snyder from every conceivable creative and technical level.\nOh yeah, so it was just the one thing, right, well in that case it would be a drastically lighter tone.\nTaking all the wrong lessons from Christopher Nolan\u2019s mostly sublime, game-changing Dark Knight trilogy, the DC extended universe (DCEU) has been defined by dirge, a glum, self-important string of downers without the requisite heft to justify the unbearably oppressive tone.\nAudiences grew weary fast and mammoth opening weekends turned into rapidly, embarrassingly diminishing returns. It led to a minor internal rehaul with Wonder Woman adding a modicum of levity before last year\u2019s Aquaman embraced the character\u2019s kitschier elements, becoming their biggest global hit to date.\nBut both, for me, were still pale comparisons to even Marvel\u2019s lesser offerings and the company remains in need of a more radical left turn, a brighter light to shine through all of the aggressive darkness.\nShazam, previously known as Captain Marvel before legal intervention, is a hero whose story has plagued DC\u2019s cinematic arm for years, multiple aborted iterations littered along the way, with the late, Oscar-winning screenwriter William Goldman once involved in a draft in the early 2000s.\nIn need of another surefire hit, both with audiences and critics, he\u2019s been dragged out of development hell and handed to Swedish director David F Sandberg, whose prior work has been more horror-focused, but whose vision for the film errs closer to something Amblin would have made in the 80s. Maybe it\u2019s the Stranger Things effect, one of the many pop culture references made in Earth to Echo writer Henry Gayden\u2019s zippy script, but there\u2019s something engagingly old school about both the film\u2019s tone and visuals.\nFast forward to the present and we meet wayward teen Billy Batson (Asher Angel) who bounces between foster homes, trying to track down the mother he was separated from as a child.\nAfter being placed with an eager makeshift family, he remains resistant to any form of attachment but finds himself in need of a confidante after a wizard blesses him with superheroic powers.\nThe word \u201cshazam\u201d causes him to magically turn into a cape-wearing adult (Zachary Levi), leading to a whole host of new problems.\nBecause while Shazam! might avoid many of the pitfalls that usually define DCEU offerings, there remains an insistence that more is more and since this is essentially a kids movie, dragging the plot out to a flabby 132 minutes is a staggering misjudgment.\nThe finale, while admirably self-contained and small-scale, grinds on for far too long, a boring escalation of anti-climaxes that cumulatively dull the intended emotional impact. It\u2019s a film in need of a tighter edit with a script in need of a sharper polish, an imperfect franchise-launcher that nonetheless represents"}

Many steps were taken, recognizing the importance of water resources on the Island. Among them, he pointed to the preservation of almost 40 percent of land on the Island, keeping it from being developed that could have compromised water resources.\nMr. Brown said he\u2019s tired of hearing that the town\u2019s infrastructure has been ignored by previous administrations and pointed to efforts made by former supervisors Hoot Sherman, Gerry Siller and Jeffrey Simes."}

Both parties are guilty of ignoring it for decades, but we need to carefully consider the policies that are being proposed by this administration.\nWhether Miller said it or not, that statement sums up this administration's immigration plans. Their policies are designed not only to stop people from entering illegally, but to drastically reduce legal immigrants as well as asylum seekers.\nThis administration's \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy caused the loudest outcry when people realized our government was separating children from their parents with no plan on how to reunite them. The policy was designed to be as harsh as possible in order to deter others from trying to enter our country.\nIt was reported that almost 500 parents were deported without their children back to the horrific violence they tried to escape in Central America. We'll never know if the U.S. is responsible for making any of these children orphans.\nIf that isn't horrific enough, a recent report from government inspectors shows that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents than was previously believed.\nOur country already has a stain on our collective conscience from our treatment of people seeking refuge. In 1939, over 900 mostly Jewish people boarded the SS St. Louis, a German ocean liner, to escape the Third Reich. Due to anti-Semitic protests only 29 people were allowed to stay in Havana. The rest were denied refuge by the U.S. They were told to wait their turn. The ship returned to Europe and at the end of the Holocaust, 254 of them were dead.\nPast generations have used that exact rhetoric to describe immigrants including Italian immigrants like Kelly's maternal grandfather who never spoke a word of English and made his living peddling fruit in East Boston.\nTrump prefers immigrants from Norway, and none from \"sh\u2014hole countries\" like Haiti and El Salvador. However, I doubt he would have been so welcoming to the dirt poor Norwegians (my ancestors) who came here over a century ago.\nEuropean immigrants at that time fueled the same fears we see directed at people trying to cross our southern border today. Now those Europeans are idealized as coming over with nothing but the shirt on their backs and living the American Dream.\nThis is a pivotal moment in our nation's history.

It's now possible to download your live video streams to your phone's storage, letting you keep them after you've finished broadcasting.\nInstagram introduced live video last year and has seen widespread success with the feature. You can start streaming what's around you using the app's built-in camera. Your followers can then tune into your video at any point while you're live. Comments are visible to everyone watching and users can send likes and emoji as you stream.\nCurrently, the details of the stream are lost when you stop broadcasting. Instagram doesn't retain any information on livestreams so once you tap \"End\" all evidence of the stream is removed from the app. Friends won't be able to view it and it doesn\u2019t show up in the home feed, preventing anyone seeing it \u2013 including yourself.\nAs the rest of Instagram's content is sourced from permanent material on your phone, this behaviour is a little incongruous. Instagram today announced it will now let you save livestreams once you're done filming them, letting you keep and watch them long after they've stopped being live. As with any other Instagram content, you'll be able to keep a permanent record on your phone to view again or share with friends who missed the original broadcast.\nLivestreams can be saved by tapping the new \"Save\" button in the upper right corner of the app after you've pressed \"End.\" The video will be added to your camera roll and will show up in your usual file browser or videos app. Tapping \"Done\" will then close the broadcast screen and delete the stream from the app. If you forget to press \"Save\" before \"Done,\" there's no way of returning to the page.\n\"Starting today, you\u2019ll have the option to save your live video to your phone at the end of a broadcast,\" said Instagram. \"While live videos will continue to disappear from the app when you\u2019re done, this update gives you the flexibility to hold onto your video and re-watch it later, especially if something exciting happens during your broadcast that you want to remember or share.\"\nInstagram reminded users that the feature only saves the raw video content and won't preserve any of the social features overlaid on it in the stream view. Likes, comments and interactions cannot be viewed once a stream ends and there's currently no way to save this data for later reference. It's possible Instagram will make this information available in the future.\nThe feature addition comes as Instagram places pressure on rival Snapchat. Snapchat has been facing difficulties since filing its IPO early this month. In the past year, its once-rapid growth has stalled dramatically, a change attributed to the launch of new Instagram features.\nIt's only a minor addition but the ability to save livestreams acts as a \"quality of life\" improvement for Instagram to keep fending off the threat of Snapchat. It could help to retain regular live video users, likely to be some of the most active people on Instagram.\nThe ability to save livestreams is available now in the latest version of Instagram for iOS and Android devices. The feature should show up in the Windows 10 version of the app in a few weeks' time. If you're not seeing the button appear in the app, you should manually check for updates and make sure version 10.12 is installed."}

It works with many Google services as well as some third-party products. I use Gears primarily with Site Specific Browsers (SSBs) like Mailplane and Fluid, which give me offline access to Gmail, Google Reader and Remember The Milk.\nThese are some of my most used programs, and as such it became eminently obvious to me after the Snow Leopard upgrade that Google Gears was no longer working. To be clear, not all Snow Leopard installs will cause Google Gears to stop functioning. If you do a standard upgrade, Gears functionality should be carried over. Rather, it\u2019s those like me who see a new operating system update as an opportunity to do a clean installation that will run into problems.\nSpecifically the new 64-bit version of Safari includes updated security features that are incompatible with Google Gears. If you tried to install Google Gears for OS X you would get a warning telling you that Google Gears won\u2019t install on a version of OS X higher than 10.5. Now this makes some sense since Gears simply won\u2019t work with the 64-bit version of Safari, but it also means that other programs like Mailplane and Fluid, which will work fine with the current version of Google Gears, are unable to get access to it\u2019s features.\nGoogle gears won't install on a clean Snow Leopard installation.\nThankfully, the helpful folks who developed Mailplane have created a hacked installer for Google Gears that skips the version check and allows you to install the program in Snow Leopard. You can pick up the modified installer here. As with any hack, proceed at your own risk, but my own experience has been flawless. Once I installed this version of Gears, Mailplane and Fluid were once again able to take advantage of the offline features of sites like Gmail.\nEven with this version of Gears installed you won\u2019t be able to use Gears with 64-bit Safari. If you do want to use Gears with Safari you will need to run it in 32-bit mode. This can be done easily by right-clicking on the Safari package, choosing Get Info and putting a check in the box next to \u201cOpen in 32-bit mode\u201d. Those of you who use Gears with Firefox may be wondering what all the fuss is about as Gears works fine with that browser. That\u2019s because Gears for Firefox is actually a Firefox extension, rather than an operating system service as Gears for OS X is.\nI hope this helps out all those other Snow Leopard users who depend on Google Gears and lost the functionality during a clean install. Hopefully Google updates Gears to work natively with Snow Leopard soon so workarounds like these are unnecessary.\ngood artice and very n1 app for me.\nAfter upgrading to Snow Leopard, I was no longer able to access gmail at all. I opened up the Google Gears settings, and changed all the settings to Deny, and then I was able to access my e-mail again. I hope this hacked install works! Thanks!\nBy default most of the native applications on Snow Leopard run in 64-bit mode, so if you\u2019re running Snow Leopard you are in fact running 64-bit applications, including Safari.

Supernatural is one of the longest-running dramas on television, and it's the only show on The CW that carried over from when the network was originally just The WB. And considering that the series doesn't show any signs of slowing down, who knows how long it will go on for.\nAlthough Supernatural has been around for a long time, its viewership has remained somewhat steady over the years, which is why The CW recently gave the series a season 14 renewal. But what came as a shock to longtime fans was that the new season would have a reduced episode count. Instead of being 22 or 23 episodes long, it would only have 20 episodes. It's not too much shorter, but it still breaks apart from the norm - and now fans know the reason for that decision.\nConsidering the network that Supernatural airs on, it has always had a long, 23-episode season, whereas new shows are able to get by with only 13 episodes. While reducing the episode count may greatly effect their personal lives, it shouldn't matter much to the show's overarching story. In fact, it might make the seasons even better since there wouldn't be as much of a need to add in filler episodes between major events.\nGiven that The CW has found success in airing shorter seasons for shows like The 100, perhaps the upcoming season of Supernatural is a test to see if the show would still be as successful with fewer episodes. If it is, then that could potentially lead to even fewer episodes, eventually getting to the point where it has maybe only 16 episodes a season instead of 23. Supernatural could also be relegated to a midseason premiere instead of a fall premiere, which would give the cast a different filming schedule that may work out better for their families, but that's something fans will just have to wait and see.\nSupernatural season 14 premieres Thursday, October 11 on The CW."}

The Warwick Manufacturing Group took special leadership, bringing the best of manufacturing know how to Indian industry.This was institutionalised with the CII through a Centre of Excellence in Manufacturing, sponsored by Godrej & Boyce and located in Vikhroli, Mumbai. He projected this as an Indo-British Partnership Initiative.\nIn CII, he found a partner desperate to give priority to manufacturing, which had become uncompetitive in the decades post-Independence because of a lack of competition and pressure.\nAn important dimension was the several hundred Indian engineers trained at the Warwick Manufacturing Group. These engineers are scattered all over India working in a variety of industries. Lord Bhattacharyya therefore helped create a human resource army ready to face the world in manufacturing. This programme faced many challenges but he persisted in the mission to help Indian industry transform itself.\nWhen he began the journey with India and CII, he was \u201cThe Prof\u201d. Later, he was made \u201cLord\u201d but he was always the Prof to India. And a small example of his commitment to the Indo-British Partnership happened pre-general elections in the UK in 1997. Tony Blair, campaigning to win for the Labour Party, visited Warwick Manufacturing Group. Professor invited and introduced Supriya Banerji, head, CII UK, to Tony Blair. And, soon after, when Tony Blair won and became prime minister, an early meeting was with CII\u2019s CEO Mission, again thanks to the intervention of \u201cThe Prof\u201d.\nAnother key role he played was connecting the leadership of the two countries, especially after the nuclear tests and adverse global reaction. He met former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, deputy prime minister L K Advani and foreign minister Jaswant Singh informally, and repeatedly, acting as a quiet bridge between the policy and decision makers. It was fitting that the government of India recognised his services to the nation with a prestigious Padma award.\nHe also worked quietly with the Indian High Commissioner in London, Ambassador Ronen Sen, to facilitate a regular dialogue with British media, especially the Financial Times, to project India.\nLord Bhattacharyya, of course, contributed enormously to the British manufacturing industry and received multiple awards in recognition. In particular in 2016, he was appointed Professor Regius of manufacturing which was an appointment by the Queen.\nBeyond India and the UK he built close links with China, the US and Japan counselling and mentoring the development of manufacturing industry. So his partnership stretched across the globe.\nBeyond countries and beyond institutions, like the CII, this unique man became mentor and guide to some of India\u2019s premier business groups. Two examples are the Tata group and the TVS Motors group. And, he brought Ratan Tata and Venu Srinivasan together under his umbrella, helped build friendship and mutual trust which led to Venu joining the Tata Sons board and, later, became vice-chairman of Tata Trusts. Another unique aspect of this man was that he never accepted any payment from anyone. It was all about friendship and caring.

The source selectors in the DoD are precluded by law from discussing any of their motivations beyond the stated specifications and how the selected aircraft met them.

The programming of E. coli to count gastrointestinal microbe growth rates is another advance for the field of synthetic biology, which largely aims to harness and re-wire cellular machinery for carrying out specific functions via genetic and metabolic engineering. The Wyss and HMS team is calling the method \"distributed cell division counting\", or DCDC for short.\n\"The dream in this field is to make cell-based computers, using cells that can remember, count, sense, actuate and complete tasks in a programmable way,\" said Pamela Silver, Ph.D., who is senior author on the new study, a Wyss Institute Core Faculty member on the Institute's Synthetic Biology platform, the Eliot T. and Onie H. Adams Professorship of Biochemistry and Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and a founder of the HMS Department of Systems Biology. \"This advance brings us another step closer to making that original dream a reality.\"\nGut microbes - which collectively contain a vast amount of genetic information known as the \"microbiome\" - play hugely important roles in the lives of their hosts. These microbes undergo dynamic shifts in their rates of growth depending upon factors like host diet or the presence of antibiotics. Gaining a window into these fluctuating dynamics helps scientists understand how microbes grow and divide inside our guts during infection, antibiotic therapy, and other microbial imbalances caused by health issues such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and cancer, which could help identify future therapies for treating these conditions.\nBut in gastrointestinal microbiome research, an area rife with new discoveries and opportunities thanks to recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how influential these microbes are to our health, it has until now been very difficult to monitor microbial cells during their travels through mammalian gastrointestinal tracts. Microbial growth rates fluctuate in response to diet, wellness, exercise and the environment, and are affected by inter-organism competition inside the gut. Yet after entering the gut and before exiting, microbes pass through the \"dark zone\", where they cannot be accessed or analyzed using standard methods and without disrupting observation of natural conditions.\nThat challenge inspired Cameron Myhrvold, a Hertz graduate fellow at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Medical School and the lead author on the new study, to work with Silver to develop the novel synthetic \"mark and recapture\" technique known as DCDC.\nUsing a genetically engineered red-colored fluorescent protein controlled by a gene expression promoter as a visual flag, Myhrvold set out to quite literally mark and recapture E. coli, which are extremely common bacteria found in all mammalian guts. The DCDC strategy - in which mice were fed the genetically engineered microbes and then their waste collected for analysis - enabled the team to precisely count the bacterial cell divisions that occurred inside the mice'"}

Why did his officials meet on Friday in Toronto with Kinder Morgan executives \u2014 who issued a threat to abandon the project while the prime minister was travelling to a vigil in Saskatchewan for those killed in that tragic bus accident, and who can still walk away from it on May 31 if they aren't satisfied?\n\"We are one country with a federal government that is there to ensure the national interest is upheld,\" Trudeau told reporters after Sunday's meeting.\nAt least part of the reason is that the government believes opponents of the project, while vocal, are outnumbered by those who support it. Another is that investors of all kinds are worried by the uncertain business climate this dispute is creating.\n\"It is the right thing for Canada. For the economy. For hard-working Canadians who work in the industry,\" said Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \"Their voices are being heard and that hasn't happened in a long time.\"\nTrudeau also knows the government of NDP Premier Rachel Notley is prepared to act even more quickly. The province will table a bill on Monday that Notley said \"would let Alberta deploy resources in a way that get the best return for Alberta.\"\nTranslation: the province would give itself the right to charge world prices on any oil it ships to British Columbia.\nStill, that doesn't offer much in the way of cover for the political risk Trudeau is taking"}

{"idx": "3378", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Food allergies are on the rise in the United States. It is estimated that as many as 8 percent of children suffer from at least one food allergy. A food allergy is when your body\u2019s immune system responds to a certain food as harmful and has a reaction. These reactions can range from itchy skin, vomiting or diarrhea to trouble breathing, wheezing or anaphylaxis, which is life-threatening.\nAlthough it is uncertain why food allergies have increased, one theory is the hygiene hypothesis: Our immune system\u2019s job is to fight germs and stave off infections. However, our homes have been sanitized with bleach and antibacterial soap. In our efforts to provide clean homes for our families, our immune systems have lost their job and are looking for something to do. As a result, it may mistake a certain food as harmful and take measures to protect the body.\nAnother theory is that it\u2019s rooted in the way foods are processed. For instance, in China, peanut allergies are far less common than in the United States. While peanuts most often are roasted in the U.S., they are boiled in China. Boiling does not alter the protein in peanuts \u2014 as does roasting \u2014 and it usually is the protein in foods that acts as the allergen.\nIn the past, physicians have advised parents not to introduce potential allergy foods to children until age 3. However, recent studies have shown that introducing these foods early may help prevent the allergy from developing. The Learning Early About Peanuts (LEAP) study, which was the first randomized trial to study early allergen introduction as a preventive strategy, found that the introduction of infant-safe peanut-containing foods at 4-11 months of age significantly reduced the risk of developing peanut allergy in high-risk infants. High-risk infants were defined as those who had severe eczema and/or egg allergy. The LEAP study was led by professor Gideon Lack and the results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine."}

We sink nails and smack thumbs to see.\nHammers are the quintessential tool--likely one of the first tools man invented, and probably one of the first tools you ever picked up. Everyone remembers his dad's old hammer. After the years go by and the time comes for your father's hammer to be passed down, there's no doubt you'll wear it on your hip with honor and announce to anyone who'll listen, \"This was my dad's hammer!\"\nBut now, here comes Craftsman with something called the NEXTEC Hammerhead Auto-Hammer, a battery-powered tool that drives nails by pounding a little piston up to 3600 times per minute. Is this new device poised to replace the traditional hammer, like the assault that the Kindle (and the other e-books we tested) may deliver to bound books made of paper?\nAre we looking at a future in which young men proudly announce that they've just inherited their father's Auto-Hammer?\nTo put this idea to the test, I pitted the Auto-Hammer head-to-head against my steel Estwing 16-ounce Rip Hammer in a series of challenges.\nThe parameters of my first test were simple: timing how long it took to drive four 4d 1-1/2-in. galvanized joist hanger nails. For the test, I sent the nails through 1-in.-thick poplar, a softwood, and into standard 2x stock, also pretty soft. I made sure that there were no knots in the testing area that would unfairly slow down the nails.\nUsing the trusty old Estwing, I managed to get all four nails embedded in the wood in an uneventful 18 seconds. The Auto-Hammer, on the other hand, had some trouble with the bulky nails. In 43 seconds, I managed to get them all in the wood, but I couldn't seal the deal with any of the nails; no matter what I tried, the Auto-Hammer got them to a point but left them sticking them out of the wood like little galvanized mushrooms.\nI then repeated the same test with 2-in. stainless-steel ring-shank nails. Showing that at the very least, I'm consistent, I again pounded all four nails in 18 seconds. The Auto-Hammer fared much better with the smaller nails, and I managed to drive them all flush with the wood in 41 seconds. It took over twice as long as with the regular hammer, but the end results were the same.\nThere is a certain, specific agony associated with hitting your thumb with a hammer. I'm never sure which is worse--the sheer pain, or the self-loathing, \"I can't believe I just did that,\" humiliation. Or, as the Auto-Hammer ad puts it: \"When a man misses a nail, the only thing bruised more than his thumb is his ego.\" It's a rite of passage, and it certainly happens to us all. But I think I'm one of the few to have done it on purpose.\nFor this test, I positioned the head of the Estwing about 10 in. above my thumb. Then, I let gravity do the rest. There's no need to detail the words that came out of my mouth upon impact. Even with that little bit of swing, the hit was truly painful. I switched hands, then pressed the nose of the Auto"}

This would seem to put the needs of the agency in front of the needs of the client. Is this what is happening in the wider agency-client world? If so, aren't media teams hampered by corporate mandates such as this?\nAmy says: As DSPs and trading desks entered the landscape, I was skeptical that buying would ever move that way. Digital media planners and buyers on the front lines of the business are not easily convinced that a new way of doing things is a better way. And holding companies and advertising agencies haven't necessarily found great success when they try to implement technology solutions. Agencies in general have been slow to adapt in the digital world, so it did seem that maybe DSPs and agency trading desks would be just a fad.\nHowever, the trading desk concept does seem to be taking hold across the industry. Ad networks are changing into data companies -- and I'm sure there isn't a new business pitch happening today without some sort of demonstration that a holding company's DSP lowers CPMs for clients and therefore improve campaign efficiencies. The benefit for the advertiser is clear: a more targeted audience at a lower cost. So in that way, the use of DSPs is actually the right thing to do and does put the client's needs at the forefront.\nI think the more important issue is how the sales side can prepare for the inevitable and further commoditization of media impressions and media ad sales in general. The digital media space -- that is, the Internet and websites/mobile platforms and apps/digital TV and content-on-demand -- is too big and fragmented to continue to be sold just by people. Billions of impressions per day are going unsold; there isn't any end in sight of how big the media landscape could become. DSPs and real-time bidding will make it possible for our business to scale. And eventually, CPMs will rise above the pennies currently traded.\nNow I realize I didn't give you any information that you probably found helpful, I just tried to give you the tough love.\nJason, do you have any TLC for our troubled seller?\nJason says: As the great philosophers, Air Supply, once said, \"I'm All Out of Love\" when it comes to this topic. I am afraid I don't have any soothing words to assuage your anguish. There is nothing that any of us can do to stop technology from making its rightful march to wherever it needs to go and in as many places as it warrants. You can't stop progress.\nNow, I am not one of those loons who want computers to do everything. I learned my lesson watching Who Made Who. I don't care if my refrigerator knows when it is time to order milk. I don't need my phone to tell me where the nearest Starbucks is. I don't even think we need alarm clocks. I will get there when I am good and ready.\nWhat is useful, though, is allowing mundane, thoughtless tasks to be automated (I'm talking to you, department store perfume testers). Let's take the digital RFP, for instance. Is it helpful? Rarely. Let's hope that goes away soon.\nAnd what about these buying platforms? Are they useful"}

But smaller players have just as much to lose under anti-immigration policies \u2014 and now some of them are stepping into the ring.\nFifteen startups have added their names to an amicus brief, signed by more than 100 technology companies and other businesses. The original brief backs the states\u2019 case, detailing how the executive order negatively impacts employees and business operations.\nStart-up companies contribute substantially to this country\u2019s economic prosperity and growth potential and for reasons similar to those already set forth by the Technology Companies in their Amici Brief, start-ups are especially affected by the immigration order at issue. Many start-up companies are founded by, and rely heavily on the hard work of immigrants. Orders of the type at issue here cause immediate harm to technology companies, their employees and their families, and the competitiveness of the United States in the global market for innovation. In many instances, the technological innovation driven by U.S. start-ups contributes not only to the national prosperity but also to the national security. Implementation of the immigration order at issue thus has the potential to harm the country\u2019s security as well as its prosperity.\nAs of last year, more than half of U.S. startups valued at $1 billion or more were founded by immigrant entrepreneurs, according to a study cited in an open letter The National Venture Capital Association sent to President Trump yesterday. The letter, signed by more than 100 investors and entrepreneurs, implores the president to reconsider his existing executive order, which temporarily blocks citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. and suspends refugee immigration indefinitely.\nThe NVCA letter also expresses concerns over a draft of another executive order, originally obtained by Bloomberg News.\nThe draft pledges to overhaul the H1-B visa program, which allows skilled, graduate-level immigrants to work for employers in the U.S. Big tech companies, like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, rely heavily on the H-1B visa to recruit talent.\nThe leaked order also reveals the Trump administration\u2019s plans to kill the \u201cInternational Entrepreneur Rule,\u201d that President Obama pushed through after Congress failed to create a \u201cstartup visa\u201d to encourage foreign entrepreneurs to grow companies in the U.S.\nIt\u2019s unclear when the draft executive order will be implemented. Meanwhile, the legal battle over Trump\u2019s travel ban is escalating quickly. Yesterday, a panel of judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals grilled representatives of Washington state and President Trump over a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by a federal Judge in Seattle Friday. The TRO immediately halted implementation of Trump\u2019s immigration ban until its legality could be tested in court.\nThe Department of Justice claims the president was well within his authority to suspend immigration of aliens deemed to be a national security threat. The Trump administration says the temporary halt is necessary to study immigration procedures and defend the country against threats of terrorism.\nPresident Trump used his favorite platform to express frustration with the legal challenges to his immigration order.\nThe Ninth Circut judges will likely decide whether the travel ban will be reinstated by the end of the week. The high-profile case is expected to rise to the Supreme Court.\nWashington and Minnesota have been steadily amassing support from other states and members of the business world but this latest brief is the first explicit declaration of support from the startup community.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think U.S., has an immigration problem,"}

The group was conceptualised by veteran writer, actor and producer Owen \u201cBlacka\u201d Ellis, who created a document outlining the structure of the group. However, it was Christopher \u201cJohnny\u201d Daley who decided that the time had come for action to be taken to formalise the work and worth of the nation's comedians.\n\u201cFor years we have been talking about forming an association, getting a group together to make representation as a bloc. There is JADA (Jamaica Association of Dramatic Actors) JFM (Jamaica Federation of Musicians), and so on... the time has come for us to get our act together,\u201d Daley told the Jamaica Observer in a telephone interview.\n\u201cBlacka had created this document some time ago and last weekend we decided to just flesh out... expand on Blacka's document with the aim of getting our association going,\u201d he continued.\nAccording to Daley the biggest takeaway coming out of recognising the confab, was the fact that all parties were on the same page in terms of the urgent need for organising and getting the group of entertainers on a more professional footing.\nJACE is aiming to provide an environment to foster the growth and development of its members and the entertainment industry here in Jamaica as it relates the stand-up comedy. The association is also looking to create a national yearly roster of shows produced by, and featuring its members, so as to prevent clashing and unnecessary competition among events. The group will also offer guidance and support for its members as it relates to issues of remuneration.\n\u201cGone are the days when stand-up comedy and comedians are simply seen as a side show. There are still some people who see us as something extra on an event and not worthy of being the main attraction. So we will also be putting a lot into developing our membership and preparing them for work across Jamaica, into the wider Caribbean and the diaspora,\u201d said Daley.\nJACE members can be individuals or a duo, who are performers for stage and have performed in front of a live audience for 10 minutes or more. Among the comedians present at last weekend's inaugural meeting were Bobby Smith, Dufton Shepherd, Boasy Boy Floyd, Lemon, Leighton Smith, Christopher \u201cThe Entertainer\u201d Larmond and Michael V.\nDaley, who first became known to local audiences from on his work on the television sitcom Lime Tree Lane in the 1980s, said the main trigger to get JACE started was his work with the Comedy Club, a weekly stand-up comedy spot in the Corporate Area. This, he said, offered comedians a place and space to develop their talent in front of an audience and garner the confidence to hold their own in the entertainment sphere.\nDaley is proud that the Comedy Club was able to be the home base from which the promoters of the stand-up comedy show Outburst, which was staged last year, could scout talent. Local comedians including Diego, Tubeless and Dufton Shepherd were the toast of the event which was headlined by American Mike Epps."}

His political imprisonment has placed his life in serious danger, this time not from state execution but instead from extra-legal medical neglect. The prison state has continuously failed in its efforts to murder Mumia through official means and has thus decided to refuse the former Black Panther adequate medical treatment for diabetes. Meanwhile, Boston residents of all classes await the verdict of whether the alleged \u201cBoston bomber\u201d Dzokhar Tsarnaev will receive the death penalty or life in prison. The event that faithful day remains shrouded in questions , but most of the city has accepted the dominant narrative put forth by the FBI and Boston Police Department. The War on Terror that produced the \u201cBoston Bombing\u201d and Mumia\u2019s struggle against the prison state are intimately connected. For Mumia to live with freedom and dignity, the US imperial order behind the War on Terror must die.\nMumia Abu-Jamal\u2019s existence as a political prisoner has been repressed by the establishment, while the War on Terror is a household name in the US. This is because the War on Terror serves the objectives of imperialism and Mumia does not. Mumia joined the Black Panther Party at fifteen and served as the Philadelphia Chapter\u2019s Ministry of Information. He used his talents in journalism in service of Black people both in the BPP and after. This landed him on J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s COINTEPRO list of Black liberation fighters to watch and suppress. In 1978, Mumia covered the Philadelphia police department\u2019s siege on the MOVE Organization. His critical investigation of the Philly PD\u2019s role in repressing MOVE led to his ouster from the journalism industry. In 1982, Mumia was framed for the murder of police officer Daniel Faulkner and sentenced to death.\nThe context of Mumia\u2019s imprisonment is at the essence of US imperialism\u2019s War on Terror, which could be better named its war of terror. In the film Manufacturing Guilt, Mumia\u2019s frame-up is blatantly exposed through court documents and investigations. Yet, Mumia has lived much of his life in prison, mostly in solitary confinement. What explains this injustice and how does it relate to the current War on Terror? In Still Black, Still Strong, Dhoruba Bin-Wahad explains how the FBI\u2019s counter insurgency war on the Black Panther Party chapters and leaders like Mumia established for local police departments a direct link to Washington\u2019s war and surveillance arsenal. Washington\u2019s war on Black liberation fighters precipitated the first SWAT team operation in 1969 and the FBI\u2019s declaration that the Black Panther Party was the \u201cgreatest threat to the internal security\u201d of the US. The war on Black freedom that jailed Mumia created the technical capacity for the War on Terror.\nMumia\u2019s story, one shared by numerous US political prisoners sentenced to die in the cages of the prison state, contains in it the seeds that sprouted the rise of the massive War on Terror. Russell Maroon Shoatz, Oscar Lopez Rivera, Leonard Peltier and scores more faced trumped up charges from the state as part of US imperialism\u2019s counter insurgency war on dissent generally and the Black liberation movement in particular.

The findings could eventually lead to a blood test that can make accurate predictions about tumor size and disease progression.\nDetecting DNA fragments from tumors could provide a useful tool in the treatment of cancer.\nOvarian cancer affects around 20,000 women in the United States each year. It is the ninth most common cancer in the U.S., but the fifth leading cause of cancer death.\nThe earlier ovarian cancer is caught, the more likely treatment is to be successful.\nHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most malignant form of ovarian cancer, accounting for 70 percent of cases.\nCurrently, as with most other cancers, assessing how well a treatment is performing is difficult. In a perfect world, if doctors had full visibility of how a tumor was responding to a certain medication, they would be able to manipulate the drug type and schedule with more confidence.\nTreatment and progression of HGSOC are gauged by measuring levels of a protein called CA-125. However, after one or two treatment cycles, the levels do not change quickly enough. This makes results difficult to interpret. Also, CA-125 can be expressed by normal tissue, making false readings a further concern.\nResearchers from Cancer Research UK's Cambridge Institute recently set out to investigate another molecule that might act as a more responsive marker. A team of scientists, led by Nitzan Rosenfeld and James Brenton, published their findings this week in PLOS Medicine.\nThe molecule in question is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). These short sections of genetic code are released from tumor cells as they die. They enter circulation and can be picked up in the bloodstream.\nCtDNA has been studied for more than 20 years, but making use of it as a diagnostic tool has not been easy - tiny portions of ctDNA must be identified within a sea of normal circulating DNA fragments.\nThanks to recent advances in the sensitivity of assaying technology, ctDNA has become a potentially useful tool for assessing cancer progression. However, while there have been a number of intriguing studies suggesting ctDNA's potential use in tracking cancer, research is still in its infancy.\nTo investigate these fragments further, Rosenfeld and Brenton concentrated specifically on levels of ctDNA that carried mutations in the gene TP53. These mutations can be found in 99 percent of patients with HGSOC.\nThe team took 318 blood samples from 40 HGSOC patients before, during, and after treatment. Alongside these analyses, computerized tomography (CT) scans of tumors and information on the progression of the cancer were also noted.\nThe team found that levels of mutated TP53 in ctDNA (TP53MAF) correlated with the volume of the tumor (when compared with the CT scan), and also the patient's time to progression.\nWhen compared with the diagnostic abilities of CA-125, TP53MAF fared much better. CA-125 took 84 days to reflect changes following chemotherapy. TP53MAF, on the other hand, took just 37 days.\nIn patients being treated for a relapse, a decrease of 60 percent or less in TP53MAF was associated with a weaker response to chemotherapy and a time to progression of under 6 months. A decrease in levels of more than "}

Bound up in consumer electronics, jewelry and the ores that it comes from, gold is difficult to extract, and most modern processes do it with a highly toxic combination of cyanide salts. The cyanide leaches the gold out, but the cyanide can seep into the ground, causing environmental problems and posing threats to human health.\nResearchers at Northwestern University recently stumbled upon a solution that uses cornstarch instead. It involves some complex chemistry, but it's cheap, biologically friendly and nasty-ingredient-free.\nLed by Sir Fraser Stoddart, a chemistry professor at Northwestern, the team discovered this method by accident when looking for something else. A postdoc named Zhichang Liu was trying to make three-dimensional cubes out of gold and starch, aiming to use them as storage containers for gases and small molecules. But a liquid mixture of dissolved gold-bromide salts and a starch-derived sugar didn't form cubes, it formed needles. This was strange, so the team decided to try to replicate it and tested different forms of sugars.\nAlpha-cyclodextrin, a cyclic starch fragment with six glucose molecules, is the best way to isolate gold, they found. \"Zhichang stumbled on a piece of magic for isolating gold from anything in a green way,\" Stoddart says in a statement. The spontaneous bundle of needles is made of thousands of nanowires, each 1.3 nanometers in diameter, which contain a charged gold atom inside four bromine atoms.\nThe interaction between the starch fragment and the gold allows the precious metal to be selectively recovered from other materials, including platinum, palladium and others. The researchers already developed a process to isolate gold from scraps, and they hope this will lead to an environmentally friendly, cheap way to recover gold from anything. The research is published in Nature Communications."}
{"idx": "3415", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: They have been. They've signed a handful of them.\nI'll try to explain where I think the Wild Card comments come from, even though I don't agree that the Cardinals are shooting for just a Wild Card and don't use that verbage. I think it comes from the fact that the Cardinals, instead of going for the jugglar, securing the best team possible, they add a few pieces, and then hope for the best. They hope Fowler bounces back. They hope Bader's offense progresses. They hope Ozuna's shoulder is healthy. They hope all of these young righties can handle the bullpen. In reality, there is a chance to add certainty with the market, whether it be Harper, or a proven reliever, or even a starter that shifts another starter to the pen, or a bench bat, and they are just content with Goldschmidt, Miller, and done. Again, just my opinion, and while I don't agree that the Cards are just shooting for the WC, I do think they could do a little more to assure certainty, or as much as possible, as nothing is ever fully certain.\nThis is a welcome explanation -- and I have no doubt that the roots of the \"wild card\" myth are somewhere in here. That is a fair stance: The Cardinals don't \"go for the jugular\" with moves. We're not seeing too many teams do that right now. I imagine if I suggested this to the Cardinals they would push back and suggest trading for Goldschmidt on a short-term deal is \"going for the jugular.\" We can argue that point, as can the fans. What I don't yet understand is how the Cardinals saw two key weaknesses on a team that fell short of the wild card. They addressed those two weaknesses with bona fide All-Stars and one MVP-level player -- and yet people suggest they're aiming for the wild card. This roster is seven wins better than last year's team. That's a realistic statement. And that's 95 wins.\nIt's wasted effort and doesn't save anything for a team that \"target\" the wild card and then be bummed when they miss their market and win the division, or fall short. I just don't see how that math works.\nComplementary, for sure. And they'll explore trades in spring training.\nI know this is a sensitive subject, but did you ask Dexter Fowler what he meant when he said he was depressed last season? Should we automatically assume it was some sort of clinical depression? I do not mean to sound insensitive, but I do not think everyone understands that \"being depressed\" can be a disease--often the term has been used to describe someone who is sad or down for a (relatively) short amount of time.\nOf course I did, and I felt that it was important for him to describe what that meant for him and to describe what treatment he thought -- to the point he was comfortable. I went deep into the details of this in a previous chat, and I urge to find them so that I don't have to re-type it all or slow down the chat anymore. Sorry for the homework assignment, but I think that's the best route. This was the first time Fowler talked about his feelings and what happened, and that he did so with candidness and a clarity that he had only previously offered the team and his family members. He was being public about a private concern, and as such I respected the ways he wanted to describe what he was feeling and in the story I was careful to use that language because, in the end"}

So many people love it, and you know they\u2019re going to want to come and see it again and bring friends and family to watch it who didn\u2019t see it last time. That is the growth of the show over the years I think - the fact that people want other people to come and see it.\nThere\u2019s also a whole new generation of young people who won\u2019t have seen it. We know, even from discussions with the cast we have at the moment, how inspiring this piece can be for young people who see the piece and then want to go on to a career in theatre, or particularly dance. Many of the men in the show, and in fact the women too, first came to dance through this piece having been taken to see it by their parents, or perhaps by their dance school, and now they\u2019re in it themselves.\nIt still seems to move and inspire people and therefore we get excited about doing it because that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re here to entertain.\nWhy did you decide to restage the show now? Is it a bigger challenge to revisit this work because audiences are so passionate about it and know it so well?\nIt\u2019s an interesting point about changing a piece that is so well-known and so well-loved. We\u2019ve made these changes for several reasons \u2013 one being that it\u2019s been around for 23 years now since we first made the piece and Lez Brotherston (set and costume design) and I felt it was a great opportunity to refresh it. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re changing it enormously but refreshing it for this next period of time. It may change again in the future, who knows?

We will know however, that we\u2019ve made hundreds of little changes. It won\u2019t be such big changes that people will think \u2018oh what did you do that for?\u2019. Maybe there will be one or two things that big fans of the show will miss, but I think generally speaking we\u2019re celebrating the piece that already exists.\nWe\u2019ve got a completely new cast as well. There are lots of new dancers who will bring their own interpretations to the piece, as they do with all our shows and that keeps the pieces fresh and alive.\nWere you surprised by the scale of the impact Swan Lake had on young dancers?\nObviously when we made Swan Lake we didn\u2019t know that it would have the impact it\u2019s had, but over the years I\u2019ve come to realise that it\u2019s been the trigger for a lot of boys and young men going into dance.\nI think it felt like something very cool and very masculine, yet it required a lot of artistry and sensitivity. I think, that really inspired a lot of young men to want to get into dance and to want to be a Swan, which is borne out by every member of our cast virtually who grew up with this piece.\nYou took Swan Lake in a completely different direction from the versions that had gone before it.

Peter Sheehan, a witty and hard-working 27-year-old researcher from the U.K.\u2019s University of East Anglia, was one of the first scientists aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer to lay eyes on it. He had just climbed up five flights of stairs from the lab to the ship\u2019s bridge, where he takes sea ice assessments every hour throughout the night. And there it was: a wall of ice on the starboard side of the ship, looming in the early morning light.\nBy 7 a.m., virtually the entire science and support team on the Palmer \u00ad\u2014 maybe 25 people \u2014\u00ad crowded up onto the bridge, which is like a skybox five levels above the main deck, with big windows and a bridgewalk that lets you stroll around outside. We all had our cameras and iPhones out, snapping pictures as we cruised along the 75-foot tall craggy face of Thwaites\u2019 ice shelf (the thick floating sheet of ice that extends out from the glacier like a fingernail). The weather was oddly warm and welcoming, \u00ad the wind calm, the sea tranquil. The Palmer was able to get within a few hundred feet of the calving front \u00ad\u2014 an extremely rare thing to be able to do at any glacier, much less a giant like Thwaites, due to the risk of falling ice. The fissures in the ice glowed luminous blue. Emperor penguins dove off a nearby ice floe and swam beside the ship, surprisingly fast and graceful, leaping in and out of the water, as if the big ship were a long-lost friend.\nThe peacefulness of such glacial awesomeness was sublime. It was also spooky, like this massive ice wall marked the boundary of another dimension of time and space.\nGetting to Thwaites was not easy. Our passage from the tip of South America to West Antarctica had taken a month, during which we weathered big waves, mechanical failures and a medical emergency. But through it all there was a sense of mission about our journey, a sense that we were tasked with answering one of the most urgent scientific questions of our time \u00ad which is, how fast will Thwaites collapse?\nGiven how important the stability of Thwaites is to the future of civilization, surprisingly little is known about its history. Most scientists believe that since the last interglacial period, which ended about 120,000 years ago, the waters we were sailing in had been covered with thousands of feet of ice. Other scientists suspect Thwaites may have melted significantly during that period, but there is no clear evidence of it. What is clear is that in the last few decades, as carbon pollution has accumulated in the atmosphere and the world has warmed, Thwaites\u2019 ice shelf has retreated quickly, opening up new water during the summer at the glacier\u2019s calving front that has never been explored or mapped.\nAs a result, much of what scientists know about Thwaites comes from satellites.

Whenever Liz\u2019s boyfriend unwraps a package of cigarettes and happens to leave the plastic wrappings around, kitty is in ecstasy. Pounces on the crinkly stuff; licks it and sometimes even ingests it, throwing up little pieces later.\nPoor addicted kitty can\u2019t seem to leave plastic alone. Talk about substance abuse! Talk about a bad habit! And needless to say, Liz is worried. She wants to know what in the world is going on with her feline who fancies this odd non-edible even more than tasty food and traditional treats. Has the animal gone crazy?\nWell, we pondered this problem. We talked with some experts in animal matters. We researched a bit online. Discovered that odd kitty cravings aren\u2019t at all unusual. And, Liz, there are other cats out there that share your pet\u2019s strange habit. We read about a feline that fancies plastic bags.Read about another that licks that emulsion stuff off photos.Thought about my own Missy who will try to eat the artificial fern in the living room if I don\u2019t watch out. Considered my Tony who goes for those little stringy things that appear on well-used and wearing-out carpeted cat trees. Remembered a friend who had a cat that would go wild for wool. So, Liz, you aren\u2019t the only feline owner with a crazy cat.\nWhy do cats decide to do this and drive us crazy?\nSeveral online sources I found, including www.askville.amazon.com, alluded to the fact that some plastics are made of rendered animal fat, gelatin or petroleum- type substances that have great appeal. Others mentioned the attractive crinkle/rattle that cats, hunters by nature and keenly attuned to such noises, have a hard time resisting\u2013and then things just escalate from there. In rare cases, attraction to the non-edible can come from having a disease called Pica, which can involve the ingesting of strange things like bamboo or wood.\nEagerness to eat unusual things also could occur because something essential is missing in the kitty\u2019s diet. Maybe an important nutrient, say, and so the cat resorts to dining on an oddity. Therefore, if a feline insists on eating things that are bad for him/her, the first line of defense is to check with a medical professional in animal matters and see if anything physically is wrong. If, however, it\u2019s a more simple matter of simply pouncing on the strange object and/or licking it rapturously, the best and easiest thing to do about it is to just not allow the object anywhere near the cat.\nOf course, I realize that this is easier said than done. But since you don\u2019t want to take chances with your precious kitty, Liz, and since plastic could result in swallowing/ suffocating issues, I guess the best solution is to advise the boyfriend that he must never, ever be careless about cigarette wrappers. And one more suggestion to help your kitty kick the habit: Buy some safe crinkle balls at the pet store. Made of cat-safe materials, they have a lovely sound when a feline bats them around. My cats are crazy about them. Perhaps your kitty will be, too. And in time your kitty may forget all about that potentially dangerous plastic."}

RK Nagar in Chennai will see 62 contestants\u2014the highest since its inception in 1967\u2014 when the constituency goes to vote on 12 April.\nHistorically speaking, the incumbent ruling party has always had an advantage in by-elections in Tamil Nadu. But now the ruling AIADMK party does not look confident to retain the seat while Panneerselvam look forward to win it for Jayalalithaa- even public seems to have sympathy for his Puratchithalaivi faction but DMK is all out to outsmart him. Deepa may not have chance to win this time.\nThe poll is particularly important for the DMK, ruling faction and OPS faction of AIADMK and end game fight is very tensed. Money is being distributed for votes and ruling AIADMK is being blamed for buying votes.\nNow that the ruling AIADMK is formally split into AIADMK (Amma) and AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi Amma) and with the EC freezing the party\u2019s two leaves symbol, the traditional AIADMK voters would be weighing between the new symbols\u2014hat and lamp post.\nDMK has fielded N.

Under these rules, if a report has adverse findings against an individual, then that person must be given a chance to read and respond to the report before it is sent to the ambassador responsible for overseeing the agency.\nSources in Geneva told The Reg the report was sent to Francis Gurry last month. He was given ten days to respond, as outlined in WIPO's Investigation Manual. He was then given an extension of another ten days.\nThe OIOS report, and any response from Gurry, has now been sent to Colombian ambassador Gabriel Duque, who is chair of WIPO's General Assembly \u2013 the group of UN ambassadors which oversees WIPO. Ambassador Duque did not respond to our emails.\nGurry stands accused of illegally collecting senior staff's DNA in a failed effort to uncover the author of anonymous letters of complaint sent to WIPO. He is further accused of over-ruling a WIPO technology procurement process in order to hand the contract to a friend. Gurry is further accused of illegally transferring computer equipment to North Korea and Iran in breach of US trade sanctions.\nHe is also accused of unfairly sacking the head of the staff council the day before a meeting of the General Assembly in order to prevent him criticising Gurry's leadership.\nAlthough two previous reports into Gurry's behaviour have been buried, there is increasing pressure to make sure the OIOS probe, or at least a redacted version of it, is made public.\nThe Register has seen a letter sent by Swiss law firm Gentium to Ambassador Duque calling for him to publish the report. Gentium represents WIPO's Staff Council.\nIt is widely known that the allegations against the Director General include the theft of personal effects from WIPO staff and the subsequent extraction of their DNA, without the staff members' knowledge or consent. It is further alleged that these events occurred without the staff members' legal immunities being lifted or waived in any proper way. As such the allegations, if proven, would appear to entail a serious breach of the Swiss criminal law.\nI am now writing very respectfully to ask that you promptly release publicly the conclusions of the OIOS investigation to my clients and inform all the staff of WIPO of those conclusions, so that the findings made about these allegations may now be known by all. The rumours and speculations about the allegations made against Mr Gurry, and the contents of the report, are circulating not only throughout WIPO but across the city of Geneva and indeed around the diplomatic community as a whole. None of this is desirable.

No importance is placed on critical nation building concepts such as infrastructure, international competitiveness and the building of future generations that will help build prosperity. We cannot get crucial projects built. We continue to become less competitive. We turn out \u201ceducated,\u201d but often job-challenged young adults. We receive bad government, at all levels and from all political parties. With each passing year, Canada becomes less recognizable.\nBrian hit the nail on the head.

The Weingarten family are considered the oldest family in the Old City of Jerusalem. Moshe\u2019s late grandfather Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Weingarten, the esteemed leader of the Jewish community in 1948, was forced to hand the keys of the Old City over to the Jordanians. The Weingarten family was the first family to return to the Old City in 1967 and his late mother Rivka was instrumental in providing an understanding of the area\u2019s history as well as in re-establishing the Jewish Quarter.\nMoshe\u2019s ancestors on the side of his grandmother, \"baale batim\" from the community of the Vilna Gaon, arrived in the area (first Ashkenazi Aliyah) in 1812. His grandfather\u2019s family arrived one generation later.\nRabbi Pach Rozental\u2019s son, Rabbi Isaac worked as secretary to Sir Moshe Montefiore in the late 19th-century and he was instrumental in helping establish the neighborhood of Mishkenot Sha'ananim and the windmill (which belonged to Pach Rozental as private property for several years).\nIn 1921, Moshe\u2019s grandmother Esther Tovah from the Rozental family married Rabbi Abraham Mordechai Weingarten, who became leader of the Jews in the Old City during some very challenging years under the British mandate. Despite Arab attacks and riots in 1936 and 1939, the pre-state leadership were not amenable to Rabbi Abraham Mordechai Weingarten\u2019s pleas to send soldiers and ammunition to protect the Jewish community, to organize transportation to and from the Old City and to establish a hospital. \u201cIt seemed that they were aiming for another heroic battle like Masada for the history books, where many Jewish lives would be sacrificed,\u201d says Moshe.\n\u201cMy grandfather and other leaders did not accept this, and tried to find ways to save the holy place,\u201d says Mr Weingarten. When the Old City was eventually captured in 1948 by the Jordanians, Rabbi Abraham Mordechai Weingarten requested from the Arab commander for Jews to remain and live in the area under Jordanian rule, and although the commander initially agreed, he subsequently refused.\nThe Weingartens, who had been extremely affluent, were forced to leave everything behind including all their important documents and a closet with 300 items of silver. \u201cMy family left only with the clothes on their backs,\u201d says Moshe.\nMoshe recalls his grandfather as an impressive, outstanding, intelligent and humane man. \u201cBut he was devastated due to the fall of the Old City and as a result of his disappointment with politicians and state leaders. He lived in sorrow and mourning until his death in 1964, just three years before the liberation,\u201d shares Moshe. \u201cMy grandmother was very righteous, loving, caring and supportive.\u201d A great cook, she was the benefactor and operator of a soup kitchen for the poor on a daily basis.\nTwo days later Moshe\u2019s late mother, Rivka, a dynamic woman, was asked to guide Prime Minister Levi Eshkol around the Old City and orient him as to where things had once stood.

{"idx": "3457", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the matter of Barack Obama's completely explainable and largely unremarkable poll numbers, we have yet another bogus theory: His policies are just about right, but his messaging just isn't moderate enough.\nThe key policies of Mr Obama\u2019s presidency so far have been the fiscal stimulus and healthcare reform. Both were needed and to begin with voters were on board. The policies that emerged were less than perfect but vastly better than nothing. Yet voters have soured. The reason is not the substance of the policies, but how they were pitched.\nIn Crook's telling, the president's poll numbers (and, by extension, his party's midterm prospects) have dimmed because he's too often flirted with \"leftist solutions\" before giving in to the watering down demands of conservative Democrats. Had he simply started out in the middle, the voter revolt would be far more subdued.\nThis doesn't make much sense, though.\nFirst, Crook seems oblivious to the basic nature of compromise. If you're a homeowner and you want to sell for $750,000, you start by asking for a million; if you're a president and you want a stimulus of $787 billion, you start by asking for a lot more. If Obama had opened the bidding on the stimulus and healthcare where both issues ended up, he would have settled for far less than what he got -- even though what he got, according to Crook, was just about right.\nPlus, it's not like Obama was ever pushing for \"leftist solutions\" on either of these issues. Crooks notes that he initially backed a public option on healthcare, but that doesn't exactly put Obama in Bernie Sanders-land. In fact, a strong case can be made (and has been made) from the left that Obama started out much too close to the center on healthcare, ruling out a push for single payer before any negotiations began. The story is roughly the same on the stimulus: When negotiations began, there was lots of room to Obama's left, both in terms of the overall size of the package and the role that tax cuts would play in it.\nBut the biggest problem with Crook's analysis is simple: We already know why Obama is struggling in the polls, and why his party is on the verge of a bloody midterm -- and it has everything to do with the economy. While Obama's numbers have declined markedly since he took office, they are also exactly where you'd expect them to be in the face of near-10 percent joblessness and stalled growth. If he adopted a more \"moderate\" salesmanship strategy, whatever that means, he'd be doing no better. As much as he's struggling, there's nothing extraordinary about Obama's current political position.\nIronically, this points to one step that Obama actually could have taken as president to avoid -- or lessen -- his current woes: Insist on a bigger stimulus from the get-go. A stimulus twice as large as the one that was enacted last year would have meant lower unemployment and more growth today -- which would have meant higher approval ratings for Obama, and fewer House and Senate losses in November. Of course, this would have required him to do something that Crook considers a sacrilege and to position himself much farther on the left at the start of stimulus negotiations. But if Obama had done that and succeeded in scoring a bigger stimulus, it would have done far, far more for his party's prospects than the \"lead from the center\" advice Crook is peddling.\nGranted, it's easy to"}

If you are 30 years old you should have 30% in bonds. So on a so forth.\nI think this is ridiculous. These rules of thumb are slowing down the growth potential of a young person right from the earlier years. And right when that person has the ability to take most risk.\nIt\u2019s my opinion that a 20-year-old person should not have any part of his portfolio in bonds. Stocks grow at about 8% per year. Bonds grow at about 2% per year. People buy bonds because they want less volatility. But at 20 years, the amount of money is not that much and the young person can withstand all kind of volatility.\nExample 1. Daniel is 55 years old and he only has $10,000. Does it make sense to put 55% in bonds? To protect it against what? Considering the cost of living in the US or in Canada, $10,000 would not take him too far. Daniel will have to find lots more capital if he wants to retire one day, or he will have to work way past his retirement years. The amount of bonds vs. stock is irrelevant, but if I was him, I will put 100% in stocks. I don\u2019t have much to lose. Why not take a chance.People should not be placed in a nice cookie cutter formula.\nExample 2. Maria has a portfolio of $10,000,000. Maria could be 100% in bonds no matter what age she is. Why would she take any risk at all? Even at today\u2019s low bond yields of 2%, Maria would receive $200,000 every year. Age is not a factor when we consider the asset allocation of Maria.\nExample 3. Louis is 65 years old. He has a portfolio of $500,000. He also has a fixed pension that gives him enough to live. As far as I know, Louis could have a portfolio of 100% stocks. No matter what risk he takes, he is covered. If he lives to 85 years, his money has 20 more years to grow.

The nation imports roughly $2 billion in U.S. food and agriculture.\nIn 2016, the value of pistachios sold to China was $530 million, and $518 million in almonds, according to figures from the California Department of Food Agriculture.\nThe U.S. stock market took a hit late last week as speculation over a potential trade war on up to $60 billion on Chinese products grew, but fears in financial markets eased somewhat after China's government said it is open to negotiating with Washington this week.\n\"Naturally, the prospect of a trade war between the world's two largest economies has weighed heavily on risk appetite over the last couple of weeks with U.S. equity markets posting significant losses on Thursday and Friday as things heated up,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. \"The message over the weekend, though, was far less confrontational and suggested the U.S. would be open to scrapping the tariffs in exchange for certain other concessions such as reduced tariffs on imported cars.\""}

Take a look through their big day in the photos below, captured by Megan Chase Photography.\nThough Luisanna and Ryan met in middle school in Springfield, Virginia, and been friends through high school and even as they parted ways to go to separate colleges, it took years for dating to become an option. While the two were in college, Lianna, Luisanna\u2019s older sister tweeted at Ryan that she approved of him dating her sister. He took advantage of the blessing the next time he saw Luisanna, and they went on a first date to Bone Fish Grill. Just one year later, Ryan was stationed in Oahu, Hawaii with the US Army, and when he asked Luisanna to join him, she gamely agreed.\nThey\u2019d been living in Hawaii for two years and added two dogs to their family when Ryan planned a date night at Luisanna\u2019s favorite hotel restaurant. Ryan asked the waitress to take a photo of the two of them on the balcony outside, and as the camera snapped, he got down on one knee to ask Luisanna to marry him. Afterwards, he surprised her with a weekend getaway at the hotel. Before the proposal night was over, Ryan gave Luisanna one more surprise: a video of him asking her parents\u2014including signing the question to Luisanna\u2019s mother, who is Deaf\u2014for their blessing.\nThe jewel-toned decor was accented with one very personal element. Luisanna\u2019s late Abuela had a habit of saying, \u201cI love you as big as the sky,\u201d and during the father-daughter dance, Luisanna\u2019s father instructed her to look up.

{"idx": "3484", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The storage industry and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are crafting energy consumption standards for enterprise storage as that part of the data center becomes a bigger target for questions about efficiency.\nOn Thursday, the EPA will hold a public meeting here at Storage Networking World in Orlando to solicit input on its developing Energy Star Data Center Storage specification. It released Draft 1.0 of the standard on April 9 and plans to conduct more meetings to refine that document, which may be finished by the end of the year. Storage vendors will then be able to label their products as compliant with the energy-saving standard.\nServers were the first focus of the green movement in data centers because they traditionally have consumed the most power of all components there. But through virtualization, Energy Star certification and utility-sponsored incentives to reduce the number of servers in data centers, the computing side in many cases has slashed its energy usage. In some cases, that has left storage systems eating a bigger piece of the energy pie in given facilities, said S.W. Worth, a senior standard program manager at Microsoft, who also works with the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA). As a result, they could come under greater scrutiny from business managers trying to reduce costs, he told a breakout session at SNW on Wednesday.\nSetting energy standards for storage systems will require a whole effort of its own because they work differently and serve a different purpose from servers, said Erik Riedel, a member of the SNIA Technical Council and a senior director of technology and architecture at EMC.\nWhereas servers are essentially just tools to carry out various computing tasks, each storage platform is the repository for specific data, Riedel said. This has implications for how they work. For example, storage systems almost always have dual power supplies, whereas servers often don't. If the sole power supply on a server were to fail, its work could be shifted to another server. But if the same happened on a storage device, applications would lose access to the data on that platform until it came back up, Riedel said during a session at SNW.\nIn addition, the idle state on a storage device is different from that of a server. For example, idle hard drives carry out housekeeping processes such as going through the data to correct errors and rearranging blocks of data for easier access in the future, Worth explained. This is one reason why storage power consumption at idle is usually less than 20 percent lower than in the active state, he said.\nIt has taken the EPA some time to learn about these differences, according to Riedel. Now the agency is mapping out a complex taxonomy of different types of storage systems based on size, performance and design, and developing different energy consumption requirements for Energy Star certification for each type, Riedel said. At Thursday's meeting, it will be looking for feedback from storage professionals on how it has crafted those classifications. Comments on Draft 1 of the standard are due to EPA by May 21.\nThe EPA has been holding public meetings about once every quarter, and though the length of the standards process is up to the agency, it's possible vendors will be able to label their products as Energy Star compliant late this year, Riedel said.\nThere are many areas where vendors can cut the energy consumption of their systems, Riedel said. Power supplies, disk arrays, hard drives, controllers and other components all could be made more efficient. But the biggest breakthroughs are likely to come from higher up in the system, he said. For example, if the storage system knew that the virtual machine associated with a particular application isn't being used, then the disks that hold the data for that application could be spun"}

Wages increased by 2.4% year over year in October to $52,746 per year.\nThat's a slight drop from the 2.5% increase in September, but it's still a strong number. Pay has been steadily rising for full-time workers since January 2016, driven at least in part by a shortage of available workers.\n\"It's far too soon to draw any conclusions about shifts in long-term trends as the dip is likely attributable to normal monthly fluctuation or short-term disruptions like Hurricane Michael,\" wrote Glassdoor's Daniel Zhao. \"Either way, the overall trend of sustained pay growth still indicates a tight labor market that's driving up wages for many American workers.\"\nSix of the jobs that make the list fall well below the median wage. It's very likely that the increases for fields like bank teller and bartender are due to a shortage of workers forcing companies to pay more. That's almost certainly the case when it comes to cashiers, as there is both a seasonal demand and not enough workers to fill all the available open jobs.\nProgrammer analysts and operations analysts saw wages rise at twice the national average. That's due to \"the proliferation of data collection and businesses' increasing reliance on data-driven insights\" creating \"significant demand for workers with programming and data skills.\" That's likely to continue as technology makes it easier for analysts to do work that once required a higher level of expertise.\n\"The manufacturing industry remains relatively strong with steady wage growth and job gains,\" Zhao wrote. \"Workers such as material handlers and production managers have seen wages grow well above inflation at 17.9% and 10.7%, respectively since May 2015.\"\nIn some cases, at the lower end of the pay scale, wage growth has been assisted by minimum wage increases. That could continue in 2019, as multiple states have minimum wage increase measures on the ballot in the upcoming midterm elections.\nCashiers have seen their wages rise steadily, although they remain well below the median.

Major retailers including Walmart have been automating some backend functions and are allowing more checkout via app. McDonald's has been another leader when it comes to automation, though the chain's efforts to offer ordering via app and kiosk have so far not led to job loss. These types of technology could eliminate some jobs, though they may also create some customer service positions.\nFor companies, it becomes a question of when the cost of employees, or the lack of available ones, makes the up-front cost of automating make sense.

A write-in candidate was fifth with some 216 votes, or less than 1 percent.\nDuring a brief, early Tuesday evening interview in his southeast Vacaville home, Mashburn expressed gratitude to voters for electing him to a third term on the Council, a political life that began in 2010, amid the ongoing socio-economic ravages of the Great Recession. His 2008 bid for a Council seat was unsuccessful, but then-Mayor Len Augustine later appointed him to the City Planning Commission.\nSullivan, reached by telephone, was home with family members and a close friend shortly before the posting of returns at 10:15 p.m. Tuesday.\nSullivan, 36, director of Yolo County Social Services in Woodland, is no public service novice.

But for many Democratic supporters who\u2019ve expected gains in other recent elections, this early optimism is beginning to sound all too familiar.\nYes, George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress are weaker than they have been since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But many analysts wonder whether the Democrats are ready to take advantage of the openings that Bush\u2019s imperial style and administrative ineptitude have created.\nIn essence, the message would be that Bush has made himself a kind of modern-day monarch who has exaggerated dangers to scare the American people into a disastrous war and into surrendering their liberties; that he is a self-aggrandizing leader who has abrogated the Constitution and the Bill of Rights through claims of \u201cplenary\u201d \u2013 or unlimited \u2013 powers as Commander in Chief; that he has transformed Americans from citizens to subjects.\nMeanwhile, with only a few exceptions, the Republican-controlled Congress has failed to conduct serious oversight of Bush\u2019s actions. Instead, Republican strategists, such as Karl Rove, have talked openly about their desire for indefinite GOP control of the federal government, from the White House to Congress to the courts.\nIn developing a response to this Republican arrogance, Democrats could rally the American people around some of the nation\u2019s most beloved principles, from the concept of \u201cunalienable rights,\u201d to \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d to \u201cthe checks and balances\u201d devised by the Founders as a way of stopping the encroachment of oppressive government.\nBy targeting the GOP\u2019s \u201cFour Bigs,\u201d the Democratic message would have the potential to reshape the electoral landscape \u2013 transcending business-as-usual politics and creating common ground among liberals, centrists and traditional conservatives.\nBut if the Democrats don\u2019t act aggressively in defining themselves and redefining the Republicans, the problem is sure to grow more critical with each passing electoral defeat. That\u2019s because, since the 1994 GOP victories, Republicans have become America\u2019s default party.\nIn a national election where there\u2019s no overwhelming Democratic advantage, Republicans have built the broad messaging themes and the political-media infrastructure to deliver winning margins in key races.\nEven after five electoral defeats, congressional Democrats still don\u2019t seem to grasp this changed paradigm. Democratic leaders have approached national campaigns almost like they are the incumbents, as if they can play it safe, run out the clock and then eke out marginal victories. But it\u2019s the Republicans who have learned to win the marginal races.\nDemocrats remain stuck in the mode of reacting to the message of the day, instead of planning ahead to create a larger, compelling national narrative \u2013 and developing the means to get that storyline consistently to the voters.\nLacking the national media apparatus of the Republicans and fearful of the attack politics mastered by GOP operatives over three decades, Democrats have sought again and again to find \u201celectable\u201d candidates who are supposed to be immune from negative assaults.\nWithout a clear and unified national message, Democrats also have suffered from having candidates focus entire campaigns on disparate local messages.

We looked forward to the exciting future of space exploration that the year 2001 promised,\" said Scott Hubbard, Mars Program Director at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.\n\"NASA's next mission to Mars, launching in the year 2001, represents the start of a new wave of exploration at the red planet,\" said Hubbard. \"It seemed fitting to name the mission 2001 Mars Odyssey not only in honor of the story and the movie, but also to herald the start of our new long-term journey to explore Mars.\"\nHubbard added that Arthur C. Clarke, author of \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" enthusiastically endorsed the new mission name.\nThe orbiting spacecraft is designed to find out what Mars is made of, detect water and shallow buried ice and study the radiation environment. The spacecraft begins thermal vacuum testing this week at Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colo., where it was designed and built.\n\"It's exciting to have a new name for the mission, and going into the thermal vacuum testing chamber is the next big step for the spacecraft,\" said George Pace, project manager for 2001 Mars Odyssey at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We will simulate the full range of temperatures that the spacecraft will be subjected to during its entire mission, from the coldest to the warmest.\"\n\"We have done several things in response to the NASA review board recommendations to ensure mission success, like adding additional staff and transitioning development personnel to operations. I'm confident we have a solid mission,\" Pace added.\nThe orbiter will study the kinds of minerals on the surface and measure the amount of hydrogen in the shallow subsurfaces of the planet, which will give scientists clues about the presence of water, either past or present. It will also provide information on the structure of the Martian surface and on the geological processes that may have caused it. Finally, the orbiter will take all-important measurements of the planet's radiation environment so potential health risks to future human explorers can be evaluated. To do this, the spacecraft carries three science instruments: The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), and the Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE).\n2001 Mars Odyssey is scheduled for launch on April 7, 2001, on a Delta 2 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL. The space explorer is scheduled to arrive at Mars in October 2001.\nIn August, NASA announced plans to launch twin rovers which will land on Mars in 2003, and later this fall, will announce details of the multi-year Mars exploration program plan.\nThe mission is managed by JPL for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, DC.

But one day he forgot. His son, knowing that his father was meticulous about such things, for some reason pulled the trigger.\nIn my household, I was taught that every gun is loaded until it is examined to see if it is unloaded. This is the #1 rule for gun safety.\nThe reverse rule applies to every warehouse. Every officially full warehouse is empty until it is shown to be full. This is #1 rule for storage safety.\nThis rule applies to Fort Knox, where the nation\u2019s gold is said to be stored. According to the United States Mint, which is officially in charge of the nation\u2019s gold, here are the facts.\nAmount of present gold holdings: 147.3 million ounces.The only gold removed has been very small quantities used to test the purity of gold during regularly scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the Depository for many years.The gold is held as an asset of the United States at book value of $42.22 per ounce.The Depository opened in 1937; the first gold was moved to the depository in January that year.\nWe are assured that there are \u201cregularly scheduled audits.\u201d By whom? Reported where? This is all that I have been able to find.\nIn 1974, after the US closed the gold window, congressional support grew for inquiring into the US gold stock. The Mint and the GAO were sanctioned to audit a portion of the Treasury\u2019s gold. Three out of thirteen compartments at Fort Knox were audited for inventory and samples were assayed and compared to records currently held by the Mint. Following this partial audit the Treasury created the Committee for Continuing Audits of the United States Government-owned Gold in 1975 to annually inspect the accuracy and adequacy of the Mint\u2019s records and internal procedures. These inspections involved auditing about 10% of the US Mint\u2019s gold annually in an attempt to cycle through the whole gold stock. By 1986, the Treasury\u2019s Inspector General managed to halt the audits under the notion that most of the Mint\u2019s gold had already been audited, about 92%, and sealed and no significant issues were yet found. The costs of the procedures were also a stated concern in the halting of continuing audits.\nSince then, starting in the 90\u2019s under 31 U.S.C. 3515, the audits were mostly indirect efforts as the Mint\u2019s financial statements and Custodial Schedule are annually audited by public accountants at KPMG. There still existed some audit-work that was partially direct up until 2008 by the Treasury OIG as their annual assessments of the mint\u2019s Custodial Schedule statement included direct checks of statistical samples, using a 95% confidence criterion, to verify the number of gold bars in each melt, the melt number for each gold bar, and the fineness stamped on each gold bar.\nBut what of the official annual audits of the Federal Reserve System, conducted by accounting firms hired by the Federal Reserve System and conducted under rules established by the FED?\nBy 2008, the Treasury"}

Losing any first-degree relative to suicide increases the mourner\u2019s own chance of suicide by about threefold, according to the action alliance.\n\"No parent should ever have to bury their child, and for those who do, it is a nightmare that haunts you forever,\" ex-wife Mia St. John said in a 2017 statement to Entertainment Tonight.\nIndeed, parents who lose a child to suicide face increased rates of depression, anxiety disorders and marital breakup, as well as an increased rate of physical disorders, such as heart disease and hypertension, a 2013 study published in JAMA Psychiatryfound.\nOn Jan. 21, St. John retweeted a tweet about the loss of a child that reads: \"Grieving the loss of a child is a process. It begins on the day your child passes, and ends the day the parent joins them.\"\nHe also responded to the tweet, writing: \"Never a truer word was spoke. Thanks for posting this.\"\nSuicide loss survivors are at risk of \"complicated grief,\" which is when the intense, painful emotions associated with loss last so long that it interferes with your ability to return to reasonably normal functioning. Parents of suicide loss survivors, especially, may have lifelong needs as a result of their loss and be especially afflicted with feelings of guilt and responsibility, according to a 2012 article in the medical journal Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience.\nWhen Debbie Baird lost her 29-year-old son, Matthew, to suicide in 2009, she didn't think she would ever let go of her grief.\n\"If you had told me in the early days that I would feel better again, I would never have believed you,\" she said.\nOne of the most painful truths a suicide loss survivor must learn to accept is that they may never get the answer they want most: why?\n\"I miss my son every single day, and it's just senseless that this had to happen this way and even though I can talk to other loss survivors I still can't understand it myself,\" Baird said. \"I think I still have that 'why?' I have a pretty good idea of why, but the true reason left with him.\"\n\"How did it happen ??? How ??? Why did you leave so early ???? and left me alone .....\" she captioned the image, that has since been deleted. \"I can\u2019t believe \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94 you were everything to me .... you were a loving father, a loving"}

But the online conversation is far less united on the matter.\nSaudi Arabia adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law and it is still taboo to have open discussions about religion. Apostasy - renouncing Islam - carries the death penalty, and in 2008 Badawi was arrested and accused of that crime (although he was later released). So it came as little surprise to Saudis that the authorities would carry out the lashing.\n\"He established a network to spread apostasy and to offend religion and the prophet's verses and some people cry for him, I say he deserves more than this,\" one Saudi twitter user commented.\nBut there were many who expressed their anger and dismay at the sentence, especially at a time when Saudi Arabia is battling with extreme fundamentalism.\n\"It's religious extremism that deserves punishment because it's what brought us the Islamic State and not liberalism which fights extremism\" commented another Saudi on Twitter.\nAnd while #JeSuisCharlie trended worldwide after the Charlie Hebdo attack, some of those who support Badawi started #JeSuisRaif to raise awareness about his case.\nMaryam Namazie tweeted \"All those tweeting #JeSuisCharlie should also tweet #JeSuisRaif. @raif_badawi sentenced to 10 years prison & 1000 lashes. Saudi Govt STOP\".\nBadawi's wife, Ensaf Haider, who is currently living in Canada, said she was hoping the authorities wouldn't carry out the sentence.\n\"I've been in shock since hearing the news yesterday. My husband doesn't deserve this,\" she told BBC Trending.\nBut Haider was less surprised with the reactions online.\n\"I found supporting messages from around the world more than I did from Saudi Arabia. I suppose people are scared of the authorities,\" she said.\nElham Manea, an associate professor of politics at Zurich University, believes that there could be a possible number of reasons why the punishment was carried out.\n\"It could be because Saudi Arabia wants to show that it will not submit to international pressure,\" said Manea, who has been campaigning for Badawi's release. \"It could also be about an internal struggle and rivalry inside the ruling family.\"\n\"But I'd say the most likely possibility is that the ruling family needs the support of the religious establishment against the tides of Arab Spring and dissident voices inside the kingdom, so this is what they are offering in exchange for their support,\" said Manea.\nBoth Manea and Haider are sceptical about the authorities responding to international pressure.\n\"I hope that our efforts to try to free Badawi will succeed"}

{"idx": "3518", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Can India lead on corporate sustainability, green buildings and clean energy?\nVariations on this sentiment have been frequently repeated throughout the 21st century by all kinds of leaders: Ban Ki-Moon, UN secretary-general; Jorma Korhonen, director general of external economic relations for Finland\u2019s foreign affairs ministry; Nasa climatologist James Hansen; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; environmental nonprofits, such as World Wildlife Fund for Nature; Jasmine Huggins, policy and advocacy officer for Haiti at hunger and poverty nonprofit Church World Service; and executives, such as Jean-Pascal Tricoire, CEO of Schneider Electric.\nBut the phrase has never been truer than it is right now: the longer we wait, the worse it will be.\nAnd while urgent action is needed across the world, particularly in the developed nations, the four largest developing economies \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively known as the BRICs \u2013 are critically important to the cause.\nThese four countries, with a combined population of 3 billion people and a GDP of $16tn, will have a huge direct impact on global emissions. Perhaps just as importantly, if they can get sustainable development right, they could pave the way for other developing countries to create economic opportunities without destroying the planet and oppressing workers and residents.\nThe routes the BRIC nations take will, for better or for worse, shape the path of sustainable development for the rest of the world. Clean energy or fossil fuels? Human rights or cheap labor? The decisions being made in the BRICs are top of mind for everyone reading the world\u2019s economic and environmental tea leaves.\nBut what about the countries that sit in the shadow of the BRICs? Countries such as Colombia, Ukraine, Nepal, Indonesia and many others are on the path to becoming the next generation of economic powerhouses and sustainability leaders \u2013 or laggards. How are the BRICs\u2019 practices and policies shaping, and shaped by, developments in neighboring countries as well as countries farther afield?\nFor example, Brazil has invested in development projects in Guyana, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and more. And while Brazil looms large in Latin America, it simultaneously lives in the shadow of China, its largest export partner. China\u2019s current economic slowdown demonstrates the country\u2019s impact on Brazil and other Latin American economies.\nIt goes without saying that Russia heavily influences Ukraine, as evidenced by its annexation last year of the Crimean peninsula in a crisis that already has killed thousands. Sanctions from the European Union, the US and others have resulted in quid-pro-quo sanctions from Russia, including a ban on food imports from the EU.\nIn India, a desperate search for energy to meet rapidly growing demand is sending energy companies high into the Nepalese Himalayas to tap massive and undeveloped hydropower resources. Billion-dollar hydropower deals could bring prosperity to one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, but hasty development could have wide ranging negative impacts on ecosystems and human rights.\nMeanwhile, the labor issues that China has long been known for \u2013 sweatshops, corruption, heedless pollution \u2013 are far from eliminated. But as China makes progress, improving regulations and worker livelihoods, these issues are rapidly spreading around the developing world, with factories in Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and even Myanmar taking up the yoke.\nThis could spell trouble for global workers: Bangladesh, which captured global attention after the Rana Plaza disaster, was one of the first countries where manufacturers moved as Chinese costs rose.\n"}

By enlisting people from Oakland\u201ds neighborhoods to tell Oakland stories, the project unravels tales of tragedy and triumph that are not covered by mainstream media. Often, the stories told are positive, community-building pieces about protests, elections, the LBGTQ community and even a large community farm in East Oakland. Sometimes they are stories that are just not seen by mainstream readers.\nErick Chavarria wrote a detailed story about an LBGTQ gym in East Oakland, one that caters to the special needs of that community. He also wrote about transgender Oaklander Aubrey Mariko\u201ds suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge, an act done in response to the violence that transgender people of color face across the globe. The story has only been reported one other time since his story was published, in a LBGTQ publication, while other white transgender suicides have been covered nationally.\nChavarria said this program gave him \u2014 a queer, undocumented resident \u2014 the voice he\u201ds never had as someone who can\u201dt vote and who faces homophobia in his Latino community.\n\u201cI always thought that my voice didn\u201dt matter but Oakland Voices made me feel like it does.

Opening arguments are expected to begin Friday afternoon.\nShirley Carter, 68, died from two gunshot wounds from a medium-caliber rifle in the kitchen of her rural Marion County home. Jason Carter was charged two days after the civil jury in December 2017 ordered him to pay $10 million to his mother's estate.\nCarter's lawyers have accused law enforcement of withholding exculpatory evidence they said indicated someone else may have killed Shirley. The new evidence, they claimed, included interviews detectives conducted with witnesses who said a group of three people broke into her home to burglarize it, killing her in the process.\nBut Jason Carter knew information about the homicide that only the killer would have known, authorities said. He provided information to law enforcement that incriminated himself that included multiple inconsistent statements, investigators said.\nJason Carter pleaded not guilty to murder, a charge that, if convicted, would send him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nWhen Jason Carter arrived at his parents' home on June 19, 2015, a Friday afternoon, he was preparing for a delivery of chemicals to spray on nearby fields, he told investigators.

He told arriving officers her home was burglarized, according to a criminal complaint.\n\"She's lying in a pool of blood,\" he told the dispatcher, according to a transcript of the call. \"I don't get it.\"\nAt first, detectives thought Shirley Carter interrupted a burglary and was killed by the offender. But investigators found monetary items in the home, such as her purse, prescription drugs and checks that had not been taken.\nOffice and bedroom drawers were pulled out and emptied elsewhere in the home, making the killing look like a burglary turned deadly.\nAs part of their case, investigators said Jason Carter's latent prints were on evidence at the crime scene, though he testified he never touched the evidence.

He said that he received updates on the situation Tuesday morning from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, FEMA head Craig Fugate and National Hurricane Center Director Dr. Rick Knabb.\nWhile the president says the federal government is prepared to respond to the storm, he runs the risk of appearing unsympathetic or unresponsive to the storm by campaigning as it makes landfall.

Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 7.9 percent, up from 7.8 percent in September.\nGovernor Neil Abercrombie also issued a statement on Thursday, saying the news was a clear indication that his administration\u2019s economic strategy is working.\nThe seasonal fluctuations in the number of employed and unemployed persons reflect hiring and layoff patterns that accompany regular events such as the winter holiday season and the summer vacation season. These variations make it difficult to tell whether month-to-month changes in employment and unemployment are due to normal seasonal patterns or to changing economic conditions. To deal with such problems, a statistical technique called seasonal adjustment is used. This technique uses the past history of the series to identify the seasonal movements and to calculate the size and direction of these movements. A seasonal adjustment factor is then developed and applied to the estimates to eliminate the effects of regular seasonal fluctuations on the data. When a statistical series has been seasonally adjusted, data for any month can be more meaningfully compared with data from any other month or with an annual average.\nThe labor force statistics are derived from a survey based on the week including the 12TH of each month of Hawai\u2018i residents with a sample size of about 1,000 households. A series of questions are asked to assess whether a person is currently part of the labor force, and if so, what is their current employment status. Employed persons consist of: 1) all persons who did any work for pay or profit during the survey reference week, 2) all persons who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-owned enterprise operated by someone in their household, and 3) all persons who were temporarily absent from their regular jobs, whether they were paid or not. Persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work. Workers expecting to be recalled from layoff are counted as unemployed, whether or not they have engaged in a specific job seeking activity. Persons not in the labor force are those who are not classified as employed or unemployed during the survey reference week.\nThe 2011 and 2010 labor force estimates have been revised to incorporate updated inputs, updated population controls, re-estimation of models, and adjustment to new division and national control totals. The updated population controls reflect the annual updating of population estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThis release incorporates revised job count figures from 1990 through 2011 for the seasonally adjusted series. The reconstructed data reflects data from historical corrections applied to unadjusted supersector or sector level series. For years, monthly employment estimates for Hawai\u2018i and our metropolitan areas have been developed by analysts with the State Department of Labor \u2013 Research and Statistics Office. These estimates were based on a monthly survey of Hawai\u2018i businesses and analysts\u2019 knowledge about our local economies. Beginning with the production of preliminary estimates for March 2011, responsibility for the production of State and metropolitan area (MSA) estimates was transitioned from individual state agencies to the U.S."}

But that's exactly what it was in the early 1980s when Tony and Chip Kinman retired their Doc Martens after years in the seminal L.A. punk band the Dils, moved to Austin, Texas, slipped on cowboy boots and launched a new musical hybrid soon dubbed \"cowpunk.\"\nWith Tony's booming baritone carrying echoes of Johnny Cash, Chip's soaring tenor and a muscular rhythmic drive forged in the late-'70s hotbed of Southern California punk rock, the Kinman brothers created Rank and File, an influential band that wedded the narrative storytelling lyrics and twangy musical textures of country with the raw power and take-no-prisoners attitude of punk.\nIt was one of several distinctive musical incarnations also including Blackbird, Cowboy Nation, duo performances and Chip's latest band, the punk-blues group Ford Madox Ford, a.k.a. FDMDXFD.\nYet the brothers were still collaborating: Ford Madox Ford's debut album, \"This American Blues,\" released in February, was produced by Tony, who died Friday after a recent battle with cancer, Chip Kinman posted this week on Facebook.\nOn Thursday, Chip Kinman's Facebook page alerted fans of his brother's condition: \"Tony is home with his family. He is no longer receiving treatment and is comfortable and at peace. I have read him everything that people are posting and he is very moved. I will let everyone know when it is done. I love you all. Thank you, Chip.\"\nHe was diagnosed with cancer in March, and had begun what had been expected to be a six-month program of chemotherapy, according to the CaringBridge page Chip's wife, Lisa Kinman, created to keep fans informed. But the cancer turned out to be extremely aggressive.\nTony was born in 1956 and grew up with his family in Carlsbad in San Diego County. In 1977 he and Chip formed the Dils, a stridently political punk group known for songs including \"I Hate the Rich\" and \"Class War.\"\nThe Dils were so poorly received in San Diego that the trio moved briefly to San Francisco, which had a more thriving punk scene.\nThere they associated with bands including the Avengers (for whom Tony briefly played bass) and the Nuns, before heading south again, where the group plied Los Angeles' erupting punk scene at Hollywood clubs such as the Masque.\nQuickly, the Kinmans began to move in another direction.\n\"There were louder and faster bands who were pushing even farther into punk,\" Tony said. \"That wasn't the kind of music we were interested in anymore. It was frustrating to write songs for a punk audience that didn't like them.\"\nChip moved to New York for a time, and teamed up there with guitarist Alejandro Escovedo, whom he knew from the Nuns. Soon Tony joined them, they relocated to Austin, found Austin drummer Slim Evans through an audition, and Rank and File was born.\nThe group's 1982 album \"Sundown\" was declared the year's \"best debut album by an American rock band\" by The Times' pop music critic, Robert Hilburn. The Austin Chronicle crowned Rank and File the country band of the year.\nEven those heaping praise on the group couldn't settle on what Rank and File was \u2014 just that they liked what they heard.\n\"'S"}

Candidates for naturalization have to demonstrate good moral character for the five year period preceding the application date (three years if the application is based on marriage to a U.S. citizen).\nOne of the ways that good moral character must be shown is compliance with U.S. tax regulations.\n\u201cAn applicant who fails to file tax returns or pay his or her taxes may be precluded from establishing [good moral character],\u201d the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) advises.\nIt\u2019s not necessary for a naturalization candidate to have paid all taxes in full \u2013 what\u2019s important is showing a good faith effort to do so.\nYou say that cleaning up your tax history would cost you money, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) often works out payment plans tailored to individual needs. Such an arrangement would suffice when it comes to meeting the naturalization requirement.\n\u201cAn applicant who did not originally file tax returns or did not pay the appropriate taxes may be able to establish [good moral character] by submitting a letter from the tax authority indicating that the applicant has filed the appropriate forms and returns; and the applicant has paid the required taxes, or has made arrangements for payment,\u201d USCIS says.\nThe N-400 naturalization paperwork specifically asks if the applicant has complied with U.S. tax regulations.

Who hasn't?\nNeoTrace from NeoWorx Inc. gives you a simple way to find out whether your packets reach their destination.\nThe ping and whois software tracks a signal from your computer along every router to the destination server of any Web site.\nIt then gathers all the information about the trek and relays it back to you in an electronic folder.\nFour tabs on the virtual folder delineate the trace in different ways. They appear, from top to bottom, as Map, Nodes, List and Graph. The Map tab starts a trace by mapping your immediate geographic area. It expands to show the signal's entire journey. With mouse clicks, you can zoom in to see each node and zoom out to see the country for a local trace or the world for a trace overseas.\nYou scroll around the map by holding down the left mouse button, moving from node to node easily and accurately.'When the mouse passes over a node, it lists the name of the computer, the IP address, the longitude and latitude, the physical address, and the number of the node in the chain of nodes between your computer and the destination.\nThe Nodes tab demonstrates what goes on during a trace. It graphically represents every computer and router with an icon for its domain type. For example, a globe icon indicates a .net domain extension, a computer icon refers to .com, and a German flag refers to a .de for the Deutschland domain extension.\nThe trace starts in the upper left-hand corner of your screen. Lines connect all the icons. NeoTrace initiates a trace every 12 seconds. During a trace, data lines and icons light up in succession. The icons change colors to signal speed and connectivity differences. When the icons are green, transfer speed is good, roughly 250 milliseconds or less. Yellow signifies a slow transfer taking up to 1 second. Red means very slow, up to 5 seconds. Gray signifies either a firewall or a server that is down. If a router is set not to relay any information, it also will show up as gray.\nThe List tab catalogs all the nodes in order, the IP addresses, the names of the computers and the networks to which they correspond. But the most useful feature is that this tab tells the length of the trace in milliseconds.\nThe Graph tab demonstrates the differences in connectivity and speed between traces. It's most useful for administrators who want to discover slow sections in a network.\nNeoTrace seems as if it's doing something complicated, but in reality it works by pinging'sending short packets of incomplete data to all the computers through which it passes. Using the Unix whois utility, it derives the IP and physical addresses of the systems along the traveling data's route.\nThe $30 software comes on a 3.5-inch floppy disk. You can also download it from the NeoWorx Web site. Installation is easy; the only information you must supply is the physical address of your system and where you want to store the 1.4M of program files.\nThe Net can't give you a dial tone; NeoTrace is the next best thing."}
{"idx": "3540", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: October3, 2008: The U.S. Army is developing a one pound sniper detector that can be carried by individual infantrymen. The two sound sensors are on the shoulders, while the cell-phone sized electronics package is clipped to the uniform. An ear bud provides verbal information (\"shooter at 7 o'clock, 125 meters\"). There might also be a small visual display worn on the wrist. The main problem at this point is not the technology, which has been around for a while and can be miniaturized, but putting it together so that the soldiers will be able to use the information quickly and effectively enough to locate the sniper.\nSniper detectors have been a work in progress for the last five years. So far, vehicle borne acoustic detectors have had the most success, and over a thousand of them have been shipped to Iraq and Afghanistan. Another 8,000 are on order.\nSniper detection systems provide directional information about where the snipers are. Several generations of these systems have showed up over the last four years. The usefulness of these anti-sniper systems has increased as the manufacturers have decreased the number of false alarms, and improved the user interface. There other reasons for all this progress, including major advances in computing power, sensor quality and software development. The latest improvement is providing nearly instant, and easy to comprehend, location info on the sniper.\nNot all the manufacturers are American. The French firm Metravib, has been turning out several generations of their Pilar system, since the 1990s. This is a high end system, costing about $70,000. That gets you the acoustic array, a laptop size device containing the signal processor (specialized computer) and a laptop that displays the results, and controls the system. Pilar has recently received a companion system, Pivot, which will automatically point a camera at the source of the fire, and display the video wherever it is needed. Pivot costs $200,000, and could substitute a machine-gun for the camera. But no one wants to go there just yet.\nThe U.S. firm, iRobot, which makes the most widely used combat robot, the PackBot, has developed a similar system. Called REDOWL (for Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost with Lasers), it mounts a 5.5 pound device on a PackBot that contains an infrared (heat sensing) video camera, laser rangefinder and acoustic gunfire detector. When the device is turned on, the camera and laser will point to any gunshot in the area. This makes it a lot easier for nearby troops to take out the sniper. REDOWL can also be mounted on vehicles, or anywhere, for that matter. In tests, REDOWL has been right 94 percent of the time. Some developers suggested equipping REDOWL with a machine-gun in place of the laser. But the U.S. Army isn't ready for an armed robot that will identify and fire on targets all by itself. Pilar has one edge over REDOWL, longer range. Pilar can find snipers who are as far as a thousand meters out, about twice the range of the iRobot system.\nIsrael has produced a similar system, SADS (Small Arms Detection System), that also has a thousand meter range.

{"idx": "3542", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Trump wants to privatize air traffic control. Here\u2019s what that means.\nChange could soon be coming to the skies above America. At least that\u2019s what the Trump administration is hoping for.\nEarlier Monday, President Trump laid out his vision for overhauling the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \u2014 the agency that oversees all aspects of civil aviation. Part of Trump\u2019s vision involves privatizing the agency\u2019s air traffic control (ATC) function. Here\u2019s what you should know about it.\nHow does air traffic control currently work?\nAir traffic services are provided by the FAA. The agency has within its ranks more than 13,000 licensed controllers who are spread across the country at regional control centers. The agency also employs tens of thousands of engineers, technicians and specialists who maintain the technology and infrastructure needed to keep the skies open and safe.\nThe FAA is largely funded by aviation user fees. Taxes are imposed on such things as passenger tickets, air travel miles and jet fuel, with the revenue being deposited into a trust fund. However, the use of these funds must be authorized by Congress as part of the annual appropriations process.\nWhat exactly has Trump proposed?\nWhite House officials say the new entity will be funded entirely by user fees and overseen by representatives from airlines, unions, general aviation and airports among others.\nTrump\u2019s plan is based largely on legislation crafted by Rep. Bill Shuster. The Pennsylvania Republican, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, pushed for privatization last year but his efforts stalled. Presidential backing gives those efforts new life.\nWhat are the main criticisms of the current system?\nThere are several. Some argue that because the FAA gets its funds from Congress, the agency ends up obliging political interests rather than the passengers it is set up to serve. According to the FAA, the budget uncertainty created by this model affects its ability to perform its duties.\nAnother concern is the agency\u2019s organizational structure. In addition to providing air traffic services, the FAA also provides safety oversight for those services. This, some worry, creates an inherent conflict of interest. Advocates of change point to a 2001 International Civil Aviation Organization recommendation that signatory states (including the United States) separate air traffic functions from safety oversight within two years.\nFinally, critics say that government bureaucracy makes it hard to adopt new technologies that benefit the flying public. They suggest a nongovernmental organization would be better positioned to do so, more nimbly cutting through the bureaucratic red tape that has long hindered the FAA.\nWhat are the main criticisms of Trump\u2019s proposal?\nMany Democrats argue that changing the status quo is unnecessary given that flying in the United States is as safe as it\u2019s ever been. They also point to recent computer glitches at major U.S. airlines, questioning whether these carriers can actually handle more advanced technologies.\nCorporate jet pilots also oppose the plan as do their counterparts in general aviation. Both groups worry that user fees levied by a private corporation will drive up the cost of flying. Others argue that privatized governance gives too much control of the nation\u2019s skies to a select few \u2014 most notably airline executives \u2014 for their own benefit.\nCan this actually be done?\nThe White House certainly hopes so. Privatizing the largest and arguably most complex air traffic system in the world would be a huge political win. But it won\u2019t be easy.\nMany Democrats disagree with the idea of turning over taxpayer funded infrastructure \u2014 like control towers, navigation"}

While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.\nLebanon, where one in four residents is a refugee, has offered a lesson that trusting the needy pays off.\nInstead of directly supplying blankets and heaters, aid organisations gave cash to thousands of Syrian refugees living in the country's mountains this year in the hope they would spend it on blankets and heaters for the winter. They didn't.\nBut the money wasn't squandered either. The refugees, among the millions who have escaped the Syrian war, had a better sense than the agencies helping them of what they needed most: they spent the money on food and water.\nIn the first rigorous evaluation of cash aid to refugees, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) found in Lebanon that the money was not spent in any significant amounts on drugs and cigarettes. Neither did it fund an increase in crime or corruption, which donors had feared would accompany cash aid, or discourage people from working.\nFaced with such evidence, some humanitarian organisations are considering a change of tactics. But persuading private and government donors to trust the people they want to help, coupled with the inertia of aid groups themselves which have for decades decided what people need, has slowed cash aid programmes.\n\"There is a tension between people knowing what their own needs are, and the humanitarian sector not being structured in a way that allows people to make their own choices,\" said IRC official Radha Rajkotia.\nDaniel Masterson, a Yale University academic who conducted the research for IRC, said people who got money from the United Nations and other aid groups were also less likely to do dangerous work, send their children to work, or sell assets such sewing machines which could be used for earning an income.\n\"Cash recipients also less frequently relied on lower quality foods, skipping meals, or having smaller portions of food,\" Masterson said. \"There was even an increase in school attendance\"\nYet monthly cash payments still account for only three percent of U.N. aid in Lebanon, which has the highest concentration of refugees in the world as a proportion of its population. Worldwide, the bulk of aid is delivered in the form of materials chosen by relief workers, such as tents and blankets.\nHumanitarian organisations also worry that donors are less likely to fund cash programmes than more traditional aid, where they know exactly what people receive. \"Existing organisations operate with a specific mandate. Cash aid cannot be contained,\" said Masterson.\nIRC's findings in Lebanon are supported by research in Africa and South America. One study found that when $200 was given to drug addicts and petty criminals in the slums of Liberia, they spent it on simple necessities or starting their own legitimate businesses.\nCash aid has another advantage: it's cheaper. Traditional humanitarian work involves huge costs. Items must be procured, transported and handed out, often for long periods. Large staffs are required and people's needs must be regularly reassessed.\nBy contrast, there are no high transport fees for cash, says Ninette Kelley, representative of the U."}

But can we afford to send humans into space?\nAmerica\u2019s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond.\nIn many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists. A return to sending men and women to other parts of the solar system \u2013 years after the US scrapped its last manned space vehicle, the shuttle \u2013 cannot come soon enough for them.\nBut for others, the test flight was viewed as a distinctly unhappy event. Putting humans into space is futile, expensive and ultimately harmful to real science, argue researchers who believe that robot craft represent the future of space exploration and are dismayed by the US\u2019s commitment to return to expensive manned missions.\nScientists like Weinberg point to missions such as Europe\u2019s Rosetta and Philae probes which have successfully begun an exploration of Comet 67P. They argue that these missions represent the real future of the solar system\u2019s exploration. Men and women will remain expensive nuisances when it comes to discovering other worlds, they say. Relatively cheap robot probes are the future.\nThe existence of these two camps \u2013 manned versus unmanned \u2013 reveal a deep division in attitude to space exploration. On one hand, enthusiasts such as astronomer Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck College, London, believe that, although modern robots are capable of highly sophisticated tasks, only humans can carry out some forms of exploration.\nCrawford envisages setting up a handful of lunar colonies that would mirror the establishment of research bases in the Antarctic. From these, small numbers of astronauts would survey the lunar landscape, make observations and collect samples.\n\u201cThese missions would use robot vehicles as assistants but would depend on human intuition and leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cHumans and robots would work together.\u201d And after the Moon, targets such as Mars and possibly the asteroids would be explored in a similar manner, he added.\nThis vision is not shared by all scientists. Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, believes the cost of putting humans in space is harder to justify because of the rising sophistication of robots. \u201cIf you look at the great discoveries that have already been made in the solar system\u2019s exploration, the vast majority have been carried out by robot probes: the discovery of the great hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn\u2019s moon, Titan, and the discovery of the underground ocean on another of its moons, Enceladus, are good examples,\u201d he said.\nFrom this perspective, relying on humans to carry out scientific exploration in space is unjustified, a point emphasised by Weinberg, who describes the International Space Station \u2013 claimed by Nasa to be an orbiting multidisciplinary laboratory \u2013 as \u201can orbital turkey\u201d.\nNo important science has ever emerged from it with the exception of one cosmic ray experiment which could easily have been done on an unmanned satellite, he believes. Indeed, he adds, the whole manned spaceflight programme, which is so enormously expensive, has produced very little of scientific value.\nManned space flight crowds out real science, Weinberg argues. As an example, he points out that in 2004, president George W Bush announced a new vision of manned space missions for Nasa in"}

United States of America, which challenged the Obama administration's executive order regarding immigration.\nAfter Groth filed suit in Marion County Superior Court, a judge ruled in favor of Pence, saying the redactions the administration made to the public record were \"proper.\"\nThe ruling left open the possibility that the executive branch could claim that its redactions were nonjusticiable, a legal term that means not for the court to decide. That finding was based on an earlier Supreme Court ruling in Citizens Action Coalition, et al. v. Indiana House Rep. about redactions made by the legislature.\nGroth appealed the decision in April. This January, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled that Groth does not have the right to view the political white paper, but disagreed with the governor's contention that it would violate the separation of powers doctrine for the judiciary to second guess the redactions.\nThat was an important finding to advocates of government transparency, who feared a Pence victory in the suit could set a broader precedent that would embolden future governors to refuse to disclose or heavily redact public documents with no court oversight.\nEarlier this month, Groth petitioned the Indiana Supreme Court to take up the case.\nIndianapolis attorney Greg Bowes filed the 19-page petition on behalf of Groth claiming the appeals court erred in determining that the white paper did not have to be released because it was \"deliberative material\" for the purpose of preparing for litigation.\nGroth is arguing the Court of Appeals improperly applied the attorney-client relationship doctrine because the white paper was emailed to a wide range of people outside of the attorney-client relationship. He is also asking the court whether the court of appeals improperly created a \"deliberative materials exception\" to state public records.\nCalling Groth's lawsuit \"unfounded\" in court documents, Joseph Chapelle, Pence's attorney from Indianapolis law firm Barnes & Thornburg, last week filed the 30-page response.\nChapelle told IndyStar that the appellate court majority\u2019s decision should stand and that if the Supreme Court takes on the case, \"it will be an opportunity for the court to clarify the separation of powers doctrine.\"\nIn the latest court documents, Chapelle maintains that Pence will use executive privilege as a defense in the future. \"There are policy reasons for executive privilege,\""}

Superstar Kawhi Leonard recently stated disinterest with the San Antonio Spurs and would like to be traded. Leonard prefers playing with the Los Angeles Lakers but does not mind playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. Either way, he has made it very known to other teams that he will be going to Los Angeles by the summer of 2019. However that doesn\u2019t stop other teams trying to get their hands on Leonard. One of teams are the Boston Celtics. Leonard would make the Celtics even more of a title contender, however, the Celtics should stay as far away as possible from Leonard.\nIt might not make sense for the Celtics to not go after Leonard. After all, Leonard is a top 3 player in the league as he provides elite defense and scoring. The Celtics do have the assets required to make a move for Leonard as they have multiple draft picks and players like Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kyrie Irving. Celtics general manager Danny Ainge is very aggressive when it comes to making transactions and he will do whatever is right for the Celtics franchise moving forward. Ainge made a transaction last summer with the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving who had wanted out then. Irving had a list of teams he preferred playing for and the Celtics were not one of them, however, he seems very happy with the Celtics as reports state he is \u201cmotivated\u201d to sign an extension with the team. Though Leonard told other teams he wouldn\u2019t re-sign with them by the summer of 2019, the Celtics could still trade for Leonard as he has no power of where he goes.\nTrading for Leonard would be very risky for the Celtics as they already have a team that could contend for the title. The Celtics were only one win away from making the NBA Finals as they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Keep in mind that both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward were out with season ending injuries. If Irving and Hayward had both played, the Celtics would most likely have made it to the NBA Finals. The team is already a title contender so it doesn\u2019t make sense to trade for Leonard who had just recently told teams not named the Lakers and Clippers that he would not re-sign with them. The Spurs are asking for a lot in return for Leonard so if the Celtics were to make this trade happen, they\u2019d most likely give away players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or even superstar Kyrie Irving. If they lost all those key players for nothing, it\u2019d set the Celtics drastically behind.\nThe Celtics should use their assets correctly as they could get players like Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, or even DeMarcus Cousins. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for the Celtics to trade away their young and talented players for someone who doesn\u2019t have interest in re-signing after this year. On top of that, Leonard is coming off a quad injury that forced him to miss 73 games last season. Nobody knows how Leonard will play next year as trading for him would be too risky. The Celtics have a team in place and they should only be trying to add talent without subtracting too much. It\u2019s a risky move as it could put the team in a bad position moving forward."}

People in Louisiana and East Texas are, as of this writing, begging for assistance, and it\u2019s not there. Oh, it\u2019ll get there eventually. After all, FEMA has awarded a whole bunch of no-bid, noncompetitive contracts. And Michael Brown, the incompetent director who was removed from his duties and resigned, is still being paid as a consultant. Only the government would pay a man let go for incompetence as a consultant.\nOf course, after one of the Florida storms last year, FEMA paid out millions of dollars to people in Dade County who had suffered no losses. Just a minor accounting hitch, I suppose. They even paid to bury people who had died of natural causes. But who cares about that? It\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 money, and everybody in Washington treats taxpayer money as if it were play money.\nNow, President Bush, who is the king of bad ideas, is contemplating asking Congress to change the laws so the U.S. military can step in and take charge after catastrophic events. Granted, the military is more competent than FEMA, but putting the military in charge means declaring martial law. The military doesn\u2019t want that job, and it\u2019s not really trained to do it. It has trucks and backs and bulldozers, but its primary training is in fighting a war. Besides, it\u2019s stretched thin as it is. A better idea would be to return the National Guard to state control and stop sending its members overseas.\nThe best performers in the second storm were the state and local officials. They got people evacuated \u2014 a great achievement despite the traffic jams. They secured the towns. Now, if FEMA would deliver food, water and fuel, they could get on with cleanup and rebuilding.\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, when liberals failed to achieve their agenda through the democratic process in state legislatures, they went to the federal courts and asked them to legislate by decree.

They created the impression that state and local officials were a bunch of country bumpkins, while federal officials were enlightened philosopher kings.\nThat\u2019s total hokum.

The answer to that problem is devolution. Give the authority and the tax sources back to the state and local governments.\nIf the federal government obeyed the Constitution and did only what it authorizes the federal government to do, it could get by on a comparatively small budget. Nothing in the Constitution authorizes the federal government to involve itself in education, welfare and health care.

Of course, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may have tactical or strategic reasons to put the vote off, but we understand Dicks really wants to get this done.\nDicks, chairman for a few months since the death of Rep. Jack Murtha, is likely to run head on into Rep. David Obey, outgoing chairman of the full committee and a resolute opponent of war and -- sometimes -- defense spending. Obey actually announced his opposition yesterday to the war supplemental. In the end, Obey was swept away by the 308-114 vote for the supplemental, which included many Democrats. That may well have helped Dicks decide to push for a vote instead of waiting for party leadership and Obey to decide the bill's course.\nPassage of a defense bill is seen by many lawmakers and by defense observers as a key measure of congressional effectiveness and as a commitment to troops serving in two wars and many conflicts. When defense spending is wrapped up in a continuing resolution, as has happened several times in recent years, it lessens congressional inputs on the administration's request since it usually means adopting the administration's budget request.\nOn the F-136 fight, Dicks opposed adding the second engine for the Joint Strike fighter to his bill after conversations held with Rahm Emmanuel, and Defense Secretrary Robert Gates. He believed their threats of a presidential veto. Many of his congressional colleagues -- most of whom have not sat down face to face with senior administration officials and taken their measure on this issue -- believe the Obama administration will not veto the defense bill over a relatively paltry sum and over a policy issue about which many senior defense lawmakers feel quite passionately.\nThe House version of the defense bill includes substantial, though unspecified, spending for the intelligence community. But Dicks, who has publicly discussed his interest in intelligence matters more often than did his predecessor, slapped some restrictions on the IC. His statement says that the spending bill includes \"language that: prohibits new programs from being initiated without Congressional notification; prohibits contracting out of inherently governmental functions; curtails the growth of Senior Executive positions in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; and prohibits use of foreign intelligence unless it has been lawfully collected.\"\nFor the list of other adds, see the earmark list and Dicks' statement."}

During low tides, this is a great beach to jog on the hard sand that is unveiled with low water. It is also one of the best beaches anywhere to find sand dollars. To the south, the beach extends for miles past Funston to remote Center Hole and beyond to Mussel Rock off Pacifica.\nBlack sand: At the southern end of the beach, the black sand is magnetite, a derivative of iron ore (not the residue of an oil spill). If you bring a strong magnet to the beach, the particles will stick to it. The magnetite is from the iron of the rust-colored cliff walls. The lighter granules of sand, on the other hand, come from the flow of silt from rivers being washed out to the bay and eventually placed onto the beach with the tides.\nSabertooth past: In the cliff walls, you can find a white, chalky substance, about a foot thick. This is a vein of volcanic ash, created from an ancient eruption, deposited by the flow of rivers. Rangers once found sabertooth tiger teeth in a vein here.\nHang gliders: A staging area for hang gliders at Fort Funston attracts more than 50,000 takeoffs and landings per year. It is an ideal site for the sport because of the cliffs and onshore winds, which create a natural updraft that provides the lift needed to stay aloft.\nSurfing: When the waves are right, Ocean Beach is a favorite destination for surfing. The inshore ocean floor changes its contours, which adds to the unpredictability of currents.\nRip tides: Do not attempt to wade out, body surf or swim without a board (which will keep you on the surface, above the rip). Rip tides are dangerous here. They are created by inshore underwater troughs. Wade out a bit, step in one and it can be goodbye. Stairwell 21 can be a treacherous area.\nDogs: Dogs permitted, check for leash rules, which can vary according to site, with some areas closed at Ocean Beach and Fort Funston.\nContact: Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Fort Funston, 415-561-4700, www.nps.gov/goga.\nFrom San Francisco: Take Geary Boulevard west.

In the game against Towson, goalkeeper Julia Gluyas played all 70 minutes. However in the 3-1 defeat to William & Mary, goalkeeper Julia Ennis played 62 minutes. In addition, Ennis has a better save percentage compared to Gluyas, .737 to .514 respectively.\nAlthough Northeastern did participate in the Terrier Classic in August, Starr said she did not see any advantage in having seen the Huskies play."}

Then he would reappear in front of the cameras in the afternoon, providing just about the only sighting of an English cricketer on terrestrial TV since the 2005 Ashes series.\nNow the ECB can contemplate another victory of sorts, which is so much more complicated to interpret. One of its employees has been found not guilty of affray and is available to go about his business, but it must also consider whether it is appropriate for him to do so. This was not a day for triumphalism from Stokes or those who employ him at Lord\u2019s.\nIt must have been an ugly week for Stokes while his teammates were enjoying a glorious victory in London but in the end he could allow himself a mild smile. The verdict means that he can concentrate on being a cricketer again. The incident may soon become a tiny blot on a glittering career; he could easily become one of England\u2019s greatest all-rounders. Even so, some stern self-assessment would not go amiss.\nThe court case may have been survived but there is no escaping that Stokes has brought the game into disrepute. The video footage of a feral night out does not reveal the kind of images that the ECB, so desperate to promote the game to families, wants to be identified with. Indeed, it would be a minor disaster if the verdict leads Stokes to think that he did nothing wrong in Bristol last September, and there is a danger that this might now be the case.\nThe very best cricketers often ooze invincibility; they are never out and never wrong. They feel invulnerable, capable of dominating any situation. I have witnessed this at close quarters when playing alongside Ian Botham or while keeping an eye on the careers of Andrew Flintoff, Brian Lara and Kevin Pietersen. Such was their predominance in the game that they sometimes concluded that the normal rules did not apply.\nIn part this explains why some players are so good; self-belief is the most cherished asset among sportsmen. The great ones do not seem to fear failing; instead they take control of what happens in the middle, and sometimes this glorious feeling of power extends beyond the boundary. Which is when it becomes dangerous.\nThe easy suggestion to such sportsmen when they are in trouble off the field is to be just a bit more careful, more sensible, but this advice seldom hits home. Such caginess is not in their DNA. Perhaps they are great because they live dangerously or ignore some of the basic rules of the road for a professional cricketer. These men rarely function if instructed to wear carpet slippers.\nStokes lives in an era of management teams as well as ever-present iPhones that can record and relay every second of every day \u2013 and night.

A note from the law firm Fisher & Phillips spells out some areas where the firm thinks changes will come, and these include immigration, labor relations and workplace safety. With regard to immigration, the firm expects an increase in enforcement actions, including mandated employment eligibility ID checks to keep illegal immigrants out of workplaces and increased raids on workplaces. What is unclear, said Kim Thompson, chair of the firm's global immigration practice group, is whether Mr. Trump he will attempt to accomplish this by reducing the number of work visas issued or by increasing wages and other actions to encourage the hiring of U.S. citizens.\nIt\u2019s probable a Trump administration will curtail pro-union and anti-employer activities by the National Labor Relations Board\u2014and eventually replace current NLRB members with more business-friendly successors, said Steve Bernstein, a partner in the firm\u2019s labor relations practice group. Republicans support requiring transparency so union members know how their dues are being used and back right-to-work laws permitting workers to opt-out of forced union membership\u2014positions Mr. Trump showed support for during his campaign. Since executive orders are easy to repeal, partner Howard Mavity said he expects Mr. Trump will overturn the fair pay and safe workplace executive order\u2014the so-called \u2018blacklist\u2019 rule\u2014as well as similar government contractor executive orders. \u201cI suspect that the very burdensome new EEO-1 electronic recordkeeping obligations will be changed, modified, delayed or eliminated,\u201d said Mr. Mavity in an email.\nIn the area of workplace safety, Fisher & Phillips attorney Travis Vance said he expects a Trump presidency to streamline the Occupational Safety and Health Administration by repealing some or all of its recent rules on increased penalties that saw fines rise as much as 80%. It\u2019s also likely Mr. Trump will seek elimination of rule set to take effect July 1, 2017 that mandates certain employers to report injury and illness information to OSHA. Also, Mr. Mavity and Mr. Vance both said the next administration will almost certainly shift resources away from the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, especially when it comes to reporting injuries. Mr. Vance said OSHA currently enforces the whistleblower provisions of approximately 22 statutes and Mr. Trump may attempt to eliminate OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction over many of these, as well as heighten the threshold for a claimant to establish a whistleblower claim. \u201cThese changes would allow OSHA to focus on high-hazard industry enforcement, accident and fatality inspections, and safety outreach consultations with employers,\u201d said Mr. Vance.\nThe art of the internal investigation.

Most servers are grossly underutilised, processing at a fraction of their potential capacity, while still eating up a nice chunk of your IT budget. By optimising those underachieving servers, you can harness that capacity more effectively.\n-- Logical Consolidation: This refers to an IT department that implements a unified management system across its servers. Although logical consolidation does not relocate or consolidate any servers, it does simplify management and eases the IT workload.\n-- Centralised Consolidation: This involves moving servers to one or two locations. Rather than maintaining servers at various branch offices, everything is housed at centralised locations \u2014 at the company headquarters or datacentre, for example.\n-- Physical Consolidation: With physical consolidation, an organisation reduces the total number of servers by merging the workload onto fewer, more powerful servers.\n-- Operational Consolidation: Also called application consolidation, operational consolidation is the most complex. Unlike physical consolidation, an operational consolidation runs multiple platforms and diverse applications on a single server (or cluster). This technique uses partitioning and virtualisation to run many virtual servers on a single machine.\n-- Plan: Begin by taking an environmental profile, which includes the number of servers and applications you have, the amount of disk space and your current utilisation rate. Use this data to outline a plan of action and to determine the potential financial and operational savings associated with optimisation.\n-- Phase: As with your other IT initiatives, structure the plan in phases, so the implementation affects discrete parts of the infrastructure one at a time. Phasing in your implementation not only minimises the risk to your infrastructure, it may also help you to fund one optimisation project with the savings from a previous project, reducing the upfront cost of upgrading your infrastructure.\n-- Implement: Once you have a phased plan of action with desired performance outcomes, focus on configuration and implementation. Unfortunately, every market and business model has an IT infrastructure to support it, so single-brand, pre-fabricated optimisation solutions will probably not have the customisation required to fit your organisation. Work with an IT provider who can deliver a wide range of optimisation solutions from multiple vendors, and do not hesitate to look at multiple options before committing to one.\n\u2014 Manage and assess: After each phase of implementation, schedule time to manage and assess the new infrastructure to identify any problems and to measure the financial and operational gains. This will help you avoid any major gaps created during implementation and provide valuable metrics for justifying the continued investment in optimisation.\n-- Evolve: Although server optimisation technologies are now fairly mature (many in their third or fourth generations), vendors will continue to make strides in both software and hardware. Periodically review your utilisation and capacity figures to assess whether your organisation could benefit from either the new technologies or the next level of server optimisation.\nFinally, do not forget that any of the server optimisation approaches will likely change your datacentre environment. New servers often consume more power and require more cooling than older, less efficient servers. As a result, your smaller number of optimised servers may have different environmental and power requirements than your previous set-up. Make sure you have the power and cooling infrastructure to address the changes.\nUltimately, server optimisation is both a technology and a business decision. Although the benefits to IT are substantial, CDW's research shows that 66% of IT managers consolidate to reduce costs. As business leaders are always looking for ways to improve shareholder value, investing your time and effort in an optimisation initiative is a proactive way of highlighting how"}

Only this time the battle has been low-key and less vocal \u2014 at least so far.\nThe public-private group is set to expire on Oct. 1 if lawmakers don\u2019t act to extend it, meaning House Speaker and Visit Florida critic Jose Oliva doesn\u2019t have to do anything to allow its funding to fade away.\nA Senate bill that would make it a permanent fixture has advanced to the floor, but it\u2019s going nowhere in Oliva\u2019s House.\nThat makes advocates who say the group is vital to the tourism industry very nervous.\nThe promotion was the first indication Visit Florida will again, as they did in 2017, rally industry-wide support to lobby lawmakers to not eliminate the program or drastically cut it.\nThat year, then-Gov. Rick Scott made it a top priority to tout Visit Florida, as then-House Speaker Richard Corcoran pushed to defund the group and end \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d saying taxpayers shouldn\u2019t subsidize private businesses.\nScott ran attack ads against his fellow Republicans and pressured House members not to vote on bills to remove the program. Tourism interests responded with their own loud rallies urging \u201cfull funding.\u201d The fight ended when Scott agreed to a top education priority of Corcoran\u2019s in exchange for more transparency at Visit Florida and level funding of $76 million.\nBut Oliva, a Miami Republican and Corcoran\u2019s successor, has the upper hand thanks to the Oct. 1 deadline.\nTourism interests are getting behind the Senate bill, but the series of loud rallies in the Capitol by tourism industry workers haven\u2019t materialized yet. The battle could again come down to budget talks between the two chambers.\nSenate President Bill Galvano said he believes in Visit Florida\u2019s mission to bring more tourists to the state, especially in the wake of a natural disaster to convince prospective visitors to pick Florida for their vacations.\nEven with the Senate\u2019s support, however, Visit Florida could face a stiff budget cut. The Senate\u2019s initial budget only has $50 million, a $26 million cut on the current year.\nSen. Travis Hutson, the Senate\u2019s top economic development budget writer, said $50 million is a starting point, and he\u2019d like to boost spending in further talks with the House. But eliminating the program completely doesn\u2019t make sense, he said.\nThat\u2019s still more than the House\u2019s initial spending plan, which has $19 million for the group, enough to keep it funded until Oct. 1.\nVisit Florida was created in 1996 as a public-private partnership, with tourism interests acting to promote the state as a whole brand. Prior to its creation, though, Florida had a Commerce Department that kept track of tourism numbers for one of the pillars of the state\u2019s economy.\nNow, Visit Florida has that task. Its numbers show 126 million tourists came to Florida in 2018, a six percent increase from 2017.\nOliva said if Visit Florida goes away, they\u2019ll look into replacing its functions that don\u2019t directly support the industry."}

The National Park Foundation is amassing funds\u2013and volunteers\u2013so the parks can recover once the government reopens.\nThe current U.S. government shutdown\u2013at over three weeks now and counting\u2013is the longest shutdown in the country\u2019s history. As President Donald Trump has brought the government to a standstill with his demand for $5 billion in funding for a border wall between Mexico and the U.S., some 800,000 government workers have been placed on furlough. A few have turned to the gig economy to bridge their lost income, and others have continued to work without a paycheck.\nBeyond the human suffering, the country\u2019s National Parks system is also under threat. The majority of National Parks Service staff have been furloughed, but many of the larger parks, like Yellowstone in Wyoming and the Everglades in Florida, are still open to visitors. In some instances, states have put up funds to keep their parks staffed and fully operational; Arizona has paid to keep the Grand Canyon open, and Utah has done the same for Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Arches.\nBut where that has not happened, like at many California parks, the lack of maintenance is growing into a disastrous problem. With amenities like restrooms locked, human waste has piled up in parks like Yosemite. And with no staff on hand to monitor them, visitors are not behaving well. Over the weekend, reports emerged from Joshua Tree that unsupervised visitors have driven off-road in the park, and in come cases, chopped down some of the rare namesake trees to clear new paths.\nThe first question on many peoples\u2019 minds is, until the government reopens, what can be done? The National Park Foundation (NPF), the official umbrella nonprofit for the whole parks system, has established a fund that they will dole out to the various parks according to need. People can donate now to the Parks Restoration Fund to create a pool of money the individual parks can draw from as soon as they can begin restoration. On the same site, interested people can sign up to be alerted for volunteer opportunities once parks staff are back online and able to coordinate requests to help. Each of the parks also has a more local nonprofit partner that helps upkeep them, and NPF is coordinating with those entities directly to manage donations and volunteer requests.\nThe Parks Project, a brand that sells apparel and homewares related to the National Parks and coordinates both volunteer trips and donations to specific maintenance projects in the parks, is rerouting all of its donations through the Parks Restoration Fund. Founder Keith Eshelman says that the brand will also be coordinating volunteer programming with the specific parks once they\u2019re back up and running.\nOnce the parks reopen, says NPF president Will Shafroth, the reinstated staff will have to work quickly to assess the full extent of the damage during the shutdown\u2013and how much funding and volunteer assistance will be needed to get the parks back on track.\nBut apart from contributing to centralized fundraising and volunteer coordinating efforts, people can also call their elected officials. Organizations like the National Parks Conservation Association, Indivisible, and the Access Fund have set up simple online portals for people to continue to raise awareness of the effect of the shutdown on the parks. None of the portals prescribe how people should address the issue of the border wall\u2013disagreement, which is causing the shutdown.

Public debate has so often become short-term, shallow and acrimonious. It can seem as if we are locked into a struggle we did not choose, along competitive and ideological divides. It tempts us to resign ourselves to feelings of hopelessness for the future\u2026 to lock the doors\u2026 to close our ears to the reality that we are all in this together.\nAmong the bad news stories competing for our attention, one stands out. That's not just because we hear about it so often, but because its existence is something that most people and politicians appear to agree on! Many of us have been calling it 'the housing crisis'. Today I want to challenge all of us: to reconsider how we understand and respond to that portrayal.\nFor many people in our society, finding and remaining in stable housing is little more than a dream. For many, the realities they face include a rise in insecure jobs; rising gaps between their pay, rent and house prices, and rapid rises in the costs of healthy food. Large numbers of people rely on voluntary food banks to survive. Some young people delay starting a family - if they had a child, they would not make ends meet. Our charities regularly encounter dangerous overcrowding among families in privately rented accommodation. Many people of all ages and health conditions face little choice but to leave their families and communities, just to find a space they can manage to live in.\nChristians are called to be a people of Good News. The contagious joy and hope of lives redeemed by grace and truth are to speak for themselves, first and foremost in our love for the neighbour in front of us. Charitable activities and advocacy should reflect the goodness, truth and beauty of an abundant Creator. For Christians, a crisis is an opportunity. It nudges us to renew our mission in our own time and place, to be confident in entering on what might be a long haul, and to learn to love with fewer conditions. In that light, we are compelled to ask ourselves, 'What more can Catholic social thought and action contribute on housing?' With the bishops' support, CSAN's national team and the ecumenical Centre for Theology and Community have been addressing that question together in some depth. The Centre's Director, Angus Ritchie, will be saying more on that shortly.\nToday I am delighted to launch the first fruit of that collaboration, our new report, Abide in Me, together with a set of case studies on CSAN's website.\nLast week the bishops of England and Wales met for our bi-annual plenary meeting. We welcomed the work undertaken by CTC and CSAN. We recognised the need in society for the availability of housing. And we agreed to encourage Catholic charities and associated institutions to make this work a shared priority until 2030. That timescale aligns with international engagement by the Catholic Church and her official agencies on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. It is the intention of the Bishops' Conference to write an open letter to the leaders of Catholic charities, with some further encouragement on working together.

Shetty, PhD, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine at the Texas A&M College of Medicine, associate director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine and a research career scientist at the Olin E. Teague Veterans' Medical Center, part of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, is working on a better and permanent treatment for epilepsy. Their results published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSeizures are caused when the excitatory neurons in the brain fire too much and inhibitory neurons--the ones that tell the excitatory neurons to stop firing--aren't as abundant or aren't operating at their optimal level. The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is called GABA, short for gamma-Aminobutyric acid.\nOver the last decade, scientists have learned how to create induced pluripotent stem cells from ordinary adult cells, like a skin cell. These stem cells can then be coaxed to become virtually any type of cells in the body, including neurons that use GABA, called GABAergic interneurons.\n\"What we did is transplant human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived GABAergic progenitor cells into the hippocampus in an animal model of early temporal lobe epilepsy,\" Shetty said. The hippocampus is a region in the brain where seizures originate in temporal lobe epilepsy, which is also important for learning, memory and mood. \"It worked very well to suppress seizures and even to improve cognitive and mood function in the chronic phase of epilepsy.\"\nFurther testing showed that these transplanted human neurons formed synapses, or connections, with the host excitatory neurons. \"They were also positive for GABA and other markers of specialized subclasses of inhibitory interneurons, which was the goal,\" Shetty said. \"Another fascinating aspect of this study is that transplanted human GABAergic neurons were found to be directly involved in controlling seizures, as silencing the transplanted GABAergic neurons resulted in an increased number of seizures.\"\n\"This publication by Dr. Shetty and his colleagues is a major step forward in treating otherwise incurable diseases of the brain,\" said Darwin J. Prockop, MD, PhD, the Stearman Chair in Genomic Medicine, director of the Texas A&M Institute for Regenerative Medicine and professor at the Texas A&M College of Medicine. \"One important aspect of the work is that the same cells can be obtained from a patient.\" This type of process, called autologous transplant, is patient specific, meaning that there would be no risk of rejection of the new neurons, and the person wouldn't need anti-rejection medication.\n\"We will need to make sure that we're doing more good than harm,\" Shetty said. \"Going forward, we need to make sure that all of the cells transplanted have turned into neurons, because putting undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells into the body could lead to tumors and other problems.\"\nThe development of epilepsy often happens after a head injury, which is why the Department of Defense is interested in funding the development of better treatment and prevention options.\n\"A great deal of"}

The company\u2019s Canada unit also initiated a recall. IKEA said it would continue to sell others chests of drawers that are compliant with U.S. standards.\nIKEA\u2019s U.S. president, Lars Petersson, said IKEA\u2019s chests and dressers aren\u2019t built to be free standing and are meant to be secured to the wall. \u201cWe would like to create a culture of attaching chests of drawers to the wall,\u201d said Mr. Petersson. \u201cIt should be as simple and natural as putting on your seat belt when driving a car.\u201d The company also issued a recall notice offering full refunds or partial store credits, and free wall mounts and free installation of those mounts. The company said response was so strong, there were long wait times to its call center. It also made a video to show people how to attach the dressers to a wall.\nMelissa Agnes, president and co-founder Agnes + Day: \u201cWhile it took IKEA long enough to respond appropriately to this issue, they finally seem to be taking the situation seriously. They\u2019ve finally issued a recall of the dressers and chests and have promised to ensure its furniture adheres to the American American Society for Testing and Materials standard moving forward.\n\u201cBut the trouble with a recall is that it will be extremely difficult to reach and ensure awareness to [the millions of] owners of these furniture pieces. The risk of not reaching each and every one of these customers doesn\u2019t get more severe than the potential death of a child. So while the recall and the free wall-mounting kits are a good start, IKEA needs to take strong proactive measures to ensure that a child\u2019s death is never attached to its name in this way again.\nDaniel Laufer, head of the School of Marketing and International Business at Victoria University, New Zealand: \u201cDuring a product recall, the main objective of a company is to maximize compliance in order to prevent injuries. Two elements of a successful product recall include convincing customers that the product poses a serious threat, and minimizing the amount of effort needed to comply with the product recall.\n\u201cI believe IKEA is incorporating these elements in its product recall efforts. In its communications, IKEA mentions that \u2018consumers should immediately stop using any recalled chest and dresser\u2019 and provides an explanation: \u2018The recalled chests and dressers are unstable if they are not properly anchored to the wall.\u2019 Finally, the company is clear about the serious consequences, mentioning that the products pose \u2018a serious tip-over and entrapment hazard that can result in death or serious injuries.\u2019 IKEA goes even further, and provides information about incidents that have already occurred involving deaths and injuries. Clearly, IKEA is effectively conveying the serious threat of the products.\n\u201cThe second element of a successful product recall involves minimizing the effort needed to comply. IKEA is incorporating this as well. The company mentions \u2018consumers can order a free wall-anchoring repair kit. Consumers can install the kit themselves or IKEA will provide a one-time free in-home installation service, upon request.\u2019 By providing options, the company is making it easier for customers to comply with the recall.\nPeter LaMotte, senior vice president, Levick: \u201cIkea has shown surprising sloppiness in dealing with this high-profile product recall.

But what were the stumbling blocks which led to more than a year of fraught negotiations and saw Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government threaten to walk away - even if it meant losing out on these new powers?\nWell, up until this year, the Scottish Parliament has been largely funded by a \u201cblock grant\u201d - an annual cheque of about \u00a330 billion direct from the Treasury. That changes this year when the \u201cCalman Commission\u201d powers were enacted, which see MSPs gain some controls over income tax, to add to limited property and environmental taxes.\nThe referendum campaign saw Scots promised even further new powers, in line with the Vow, if the country voted to remain in the UK. This means Holyrood getting far greater control over raising what it spends itself. This ncludes power over income tax rates and bands, air passenger duty, aggregates levy and an assigned share of VAT.\nAlong with the council tax, this amounts to about \u00a319 billion. But if Holyrood is to start raising a major chunk of its spending through direct taxation, then the block grant coming directly from the Treasury will naturally have to be reduced. The dispute has been how to do this fairly, in line with the \u201cno detriment\u201d principle at the heart of the Smith Commission which drew up the blueprint for the new powers.\nIt has been this question which has left the Scottish Government in Edinburgh and Treasury officials in London at odds over the past year. The \u201cno detriment principle\u201d did not mean either Government could escape the impact - positive or negative - if they chose to raise or cut taxes. But it did mean neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be worse off financially as a result of the devolution of extra powers if economic performance and tax rates remained the same.\nThe current population-based \u201cBarnett\u201d formula can be applied in the first year. But this becomes difficult in future years as population rates diverge.\nThe UK Government backed a \u201clevels adjustment\u201d model which would see the block grant adjusted taking into account Scotland\u2019s population share.\nBut the SNP Government warned this could see Scotland lose out to the tune of billions of pounds as it has a traditionally slower rate of population growth than the rest of the UK. In the end a compromise was reached which was based on the Treasury adjustment model, but with a \u201cno detriment\u201d outcome for the next five years.\nIt meant the same outcome would be delivered as the per capita index deduction system, and a review will be held in 2021 with no assumed \u201cdefault\u201d to the transitional system."}

But I don't know.\"\nBut Trump continued the firestorm on Sunday morning, suggesting that Comey be jailed for his actions.\n\"The big question in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more?\"\nTrump also brought up the now-infamous meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac at the height of the Clinton email probe.\nThe intense scrutiny over the meeting prompted Lynch to say she would accept whatever outcome Comey recommended as a result of the probe.\nBut Comey wrote in his book he found her position \"very strange,\" as she did not fully recuse herself.\n\"In effect, she was removing herself but not removing herself.

(If the governments they labor under are oppressive, they will have to find a way to change that. Starving them through trade wars won\u2019t help.)

Army Lt. Gen. Austin Scott Miller, America\u2019s ninth commander, is preparing to take charge of the effort but has already admitted to his lack of innovative thinking. At his confirmation hearing in June, he told the Senate that he couldn\u2019t guarantee a timeline for bringing U.S. troops home. This is unfortunate\u2014and expected. Despite the change of command, Miller represents the same stale thinking that has permeated U.S. foreign policy for the last two decades.\nLast Wednesday, outgoing Afghanistan commander Gen. John Nicholson, held his final press conference, where he repeated the same talking points on making progress with nothing to show for it. This comes on the heels of a very violent past few weeks in Afghanistan featuring multiple suicide bomb attacks that killed dozens. If there were true progress, America would be creating an exit plan instead of supporting indefinite sustained commitment.\nBut the Pentagon continues to argue that the Afghanistan mission is about protecting the homeland, asserting that Al Qaeda\u2019s unmolested presence there in the 1990s allowed them to carry out the attacks on 9/11. In reality, those terrible attacks were coordinated from multiple points across the globe\u2014including inside the United States. Moreover, the intelligence community missed almost two dozen opportunities to stop them. Additionally, there are now multiple Al Qaeda-inspired groups across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\nBut the deadliest threat to America since 9/11 comes from domestic terrorists. In the grand scheme of things, terrorism is a small threat, and American military presence in Afghanistan is not necessary to mitigate it.\nU.S. policy in Afghanistan is to build and train a competent Afghan security force that can stand on its own two feet. Seventeen years of investment has not produced that. Fed by corruption and bureaucratic incompetence that results in poor support for troops, desertion rates were 30 percent annually until 2016, when those figures became classified. Another sign of the Afghan army\u2019s failure is the amount of territory contested or controlled by the Taliban, which has consistently risen since the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) began tracking it.\nYet open-ended American involvement is still defended. For instance, Max Boot, a columnist for the Washington Post and proponent of the American presence in Afghanistan, doesn\u2019t even bother with the idea of training Afghan fighters. Instead, he argues that the United States should keep 14,000 troops in Afghanistan indefinitely, calling it \u201cthe least bad option.\u201d As his guide, Boot uses the British, who competed with Russia for control of Central Asia in the nineteenth century. But his own source says the British were unable and unwilling to hold Afghanistan because it was too big a burden. Therefore, the \u201cleast bad option\u201d is to leave Afghanistan\u2019s security problems to the Afghan people, especially considering America\u2019s involvement is making a long-term solution less likely.\nIn spite of best intentions, a permanent U.S. presence would not only exacerbate conflict\u2014 but it would also further traumatize the Afghan people. The Afghan people have endured immense trauma over four decades of unbroken war, with U.S. involvement in nearly the entirety of the last two.

John Nicholson, the top American commander in Afghanistan, speaks to reporters last week at Bagram air base north of Kabul, Afghanistan.\nRussia has fired back at accusations by U.S. Army Gen. John Nicholson that the Kremlin is providing material support to the Taliban.\nIn an interview with the BBC last week, Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said in an interview taped there: \"We've had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and [they] said this was given by the Russians to the Taliban.\"\n\"Clearly, they are acting to undermine our interests,\" he said.\nAs NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman reported last year, it is not the first time that the four-star general has made the accusation. Last year, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis also discussed the concern.\nA statement by the Russian embassy in Kabul dismissed Nicholson's comments as \"idle gossip.\"\nOfficials in Russia have said they only have limited contacts with the Taliban and that they are aimed at encouraging peace talks and protecting Russian citizens.\nAfghan officials last year also called on Moscow to halt its support for the Taliban.\nIn October, Brig. Gen.

For the last few years, the only residential developments being built in Seattle were apartments, minus a few outliers like Insignia and Gridiron, but we are starting to see a flood of new condominium projects hitting the scene again.\nWhy the switch from apartments to condos? Well, we think it is due to apartment buildings not being as profitable as they once were. Major investment groups who were once willing to buy apartment buildings at high price/unit price tags are not as bullish right due to the softening of the rental market. That softening is likely due to an oversupply of apartments entering the market, around 6600 rental units are coming just to the South Lake Union neighborhood by 2019. It is now more profitable to build and sell condos. Developers are very market driven so they will make these decisions based on what is happening right now in the apartment and condo markets, but it seems to us that they don\u2019t put onus on the future market conditions that their developments might cause. For instance, if we had built a mix of condos and apartments over the last few years perhaps we wouldn\u2019t have an apartment building glut right now and be starved for condos, we might just have balance. Instead it appears that their decisions are reactionary, if apartments are profitable then they build a ton of apartments, flood the market, the apartment market softens, then they switch to building condos and so forth and so on. Perhaps someday we will see a balance of what is being built, helping both the rental and real estate markets stay more stable over time."}

Although the iPhone 5 released later that month there were no details given for a precise release for the new iPod touch lineup. However it seems that a slip on an Australian website could have revealed that the launch will take place in three weeks time.\nAt the time the new iPod touch was revealed Apple only gave a release timeframe of sometime in October and indeed if you check out the US Apple store online right now you\u2019ll just see \u2018October\u2019 listed as a shipping date. This is where the website leak comes in useful as the Apple online store in Australia briefly listed a 2 week shipping time for the new iPod nano and a 3 week time for the new iPod touch 32GB version in red.\nThis still seems a long time from the initial debut but at least it means an October release is still on although we imagine many potential customers were hoping Apple would release it at the beginning of October. The news of the website leak comes from BGR, sourced from Today\u2019s iPhone and although of course we shouldn\u2019t take this as confirmation, it does seem promising. There is a possibility that this was a simple error by the Apple Australia online store but it appears more likely that this is genuine information and that\u2019s why it appeared only briefly.\nIf you\u2019d like a reminder of what the latest addition to the iPod touch line will offer then we can tell you that it will be available in either a 32GB or 64GB model at $299 or $399 respectively. It has a 4-inch IPS Retina display with resolution of 1136 x 640, music playback of up to 40 hours, video playback of around 8 hours, the new Earpods, 5-megapixel rear camera, 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera for FaceTime and also a Lightning to USB cable. A neat feature is the special button that pops out for use with a loop lanyard attachment.\nThe new iPod touch comes in various color options including black and slate, white and silver, blue, pink and also yellow as well as a special (PRODUCT) red edition.

But the nearly 275-mile-long waterway that threads through the heart of the Prairie State served as the main setting for a groundbreaking \u2014 make that waterbreaking? \u2014 cruise this past summer. That\u2019s when the 166-passenger American Duchess paddle-wheeler made its way from the Mississippi River town of Alton, up to Ottawa, on the Illinois.\nI witnessed that excitement firsthand in August on the ship\u2019s inaugural trip along the Illinois River, a route typically populated by commercial barges and smaller pleasure boats. Tagging along was my 13-year-old niece, Sara, a good half-century younger than most of the passengers.\nDuring our deep dive into the Land of Lincoln, the year-old Duchess made maiden calls at several ports, including Peoria, whose riverfront bustled with a Saturday morning farmers market, and the sleepier town of Havana, where the mayor, a Dixieland jazz band and camera-toting residents turned out to greet the Victorian-style vessel as she cozied up to shore.\nIn these parts, the Duchess was a bona fide aquatic anomaly. The limited-but-growing inventory of overnight cruise boats plying U.S. rivers tends to cluster on bigger, better-known waterways. And many of these ships simply aren\u2019t a good fit for the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi that basically flows southwest of Joliet, at the confluence of the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers, all the way down to Grafton, not too far north of St. Louis. The vessels are often too tall to navigate the northern reaches of the Illinois; in the game of limbo between the boat and some of the low-slung bridges that straddle the water, the boat loses.\nEven the relatively compact Duchess had to collapse its black smokestacks and sun-deck umbrellas to squeeze under spans carrying trains and trucks roaring overhead. If heavy rain had caused water levels to rise too much, that would have been the end of our river road.\nCruise companies are willing to tackle these kinds of logistical headaches if it means giving the growing riverboat market new and off-the-beaten-path itineraries like this one, dubbed \u201cLincoln\u2019s Illinois.\u201d By venturing deeper into domestic waterways, they\u2019re catering to a clientele that craves the intimacy of riverboat cruising but doesn\u2019t necessarily want to fly to a foreign country to experience it. They\u2019re targeting folks who are eager for longer, overnight journeys on U.S. rivers but have already \u201cdone\u201d the Mississippi or the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest.\nJust about everyone I talked to aboard the Duchess \u2014 one of three paddle-wheelers owned by American Queen Steamboat Co., which has a fourth on the way \u2014 had previously traveled with the New Albany, Ind.-based riverboat cruise line.

But is it?\nBy reading between the lines, we often find the story within the story. It's called the hidden agenda, the gray area. The law then becomes more elastic, requiring additional scrutiny. Thus, in order to decipher the invisible ink, critical thought requires viewing circumstance within the spirit of the law.\nI don't need to dissect the issues to formulate an opinion regarding this argument. There is absolutely no ambiguity in my analysis. The Islamists' intent to build this mosque adjacent to ground zero is an abomination of good will, sensitivity and judgment. It is offensive and obtrusive to the most basic of sensibilities.\nDo we not remember what happened there on Sept. 11, 2001? Should we believe that under the pretext of tolerance we could ostensibly eradicate the scars of 9/11? What about the sensibilities of the exponential numbers of family, friends, and friends of friends who lost someone? How about the 360 firefighters who lost their lives? Does a mosque solemnize their slaughter?\nA place is made sacred because it was visited by the miraculous or the transcendent such as Fatima or by the presence there of great nobility and sacrifice such as Normandy or by the blood of martyrs and the suffering of the innocent such as ground zero.\nGround zero is hallowed ground. It belongs to those who suffered and died there. We are obliged to preserve the dignity and memory of the place, never allowing it to be forgotten, trivialized or misappropriated.\nWe are prisoners of the 1st Amendment. Thus, it's their right to build the mosque even though it is morally offensive for them to do so. Even President Obama sanctioned the rights of Islam under the guise of freedom of worship. How noble. Too bad he didn't have the courage to do some peaceful proselytizing and remind Islam of their lack of religious tolerance.\nFreedom of worship is not specific to just Americans. It is a basic human right, and where it lacks protection there is serious injustice. How many churches or synagogues are allowed in Mecca?\nI am tired of being lectured to by Mayor Bloomberg and his progressive supporters regarding my lack of religious tolerance and support for the Constitution. At 22 I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, then picked up a rifle and walked the walk. What did they do? This is not an issue of intolerance or bigotry.

There is nothing in the design that resembles an interfaith component. Subsequently, Akbar Ahmed, a leading Islamic educator, said, \"To have an Islamic center is like rubbing salt in open wounds.

And those modes and data will only proliferate in the coming years. In the new era of advertising, stalwart, storied brands such as Coca-Cola and GE vie for awareness, engagement and consideration with startup, modern, even renegade brands such as Airbnb, Casper, Vice and Shyp. Advertising agencies, traditionally partners of brand marketers, have been undergoing radical change too: They\u2019re redefining how they work, what services they deliver, and what collaboration looks like in a multiplatform, data-rich world. Meanwhile, as the target audience gets younger, it is brands\u2019 responsibility to advertise and market deftly and in a way that\u2019s palatable to a discerning, critical and savvy Millennial and GenZ prospect.\nDriving the transformation in all facets of the industry are young people who intimately know how to reach that generation because they are that generation.

The Buffalo Bills will officially kick off their 2018 regular season by taking on the very team that they stole a playoff bid from with the help of Andy Dalton and company.\nThe Bills take on the Baltimore Ravens in what is sure to be a litmus test game -- just as most contests in Week One represent. While you usually have a good handle on who these teams are within the confines of their depth chart after a summer of work, they're strengths and weaknesses start to emerge with the first game of the season.\n1) A different Nathan Peterman?\n- The last regular season memory many around the country have of Nathan Peterman has nothing to do with his actual previous start, but instead the game in which he made national headlines for all the wrong reasons. We all know full well what happened against the Los Angeles Chargers last season in Peterman's first start, but the Bills are banking on that version of their starting quarterback being the anomaly. The game that many don't associate with Peterman, mainly because he was injured halfway through it, was the snow game against the Indianapolis Colts later in the season. Through the conditions, Peterman was instrumental in getting the Bills their first touchdown of the game and had them in the driver's seat for the majority of the contest. Peterman then suffered a concussion, and Joe Webb took it from there. To this day, head coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane don't believe that Peterman gets enough credit for that game, nor do they think that the Chargers game was an accurate representation of what Peterman is. If the summer was any indication, the Peterman we'll see on Sunday is one that has a good command of the offense by hitting receivers in stride over the middle, and will also take some chances down the field. But, Peterman is also a player that lacks the arm strength necessary to make some of the throws that come naturally to other quarterbacks in the league, which is why it remains a matter of when, not if, that Josh Allen gets into the lineup during the 2018 season. However, for the game against the Baltimore Ravens and the tough defense that they have, this will be a real test to see how far Peterman has come in his development, and if that game in Los Angeles can just become a distant memory.\n- The offseason was unkind to the Bills along the offensive line, both from an unexpected and self-inflicted standpoint. Three separate offensive linemen that played a lot of snaps for the Bills in 2017 -- Cordy Glenn, Eric Wood, and Richie Incognito -- are now no longer a member of the team which has left the remaining players in a significant rebuild effort with that group. The bright spot is Dion Dawkins, who showed real signs of improvement both as the 2017 season went along and then into the summer at training camp and the preseason. His matchup with pass rusher Terrell Suggs will be a great test for how far he's come in his development. The rest of the line has plenty of questions. On the right side, the Bills have a starting five of players that all were on the team's roster last season which could help them in their overall cohesion. However, based on what we witnessed last season, the right side of the line specifically could be a massive area of concern. Right guard John Miller has struggled in two of his three seasons in the NFL -- however, the other one, his second year, he showed incredible signs of promise. Right tackle Jordan Mills"}

The iPhone 5s is too much at $874, but the iPhone 4 is \"still an upgrade.\"\nThat idea seemed to have double Apple's sales in India and become a competitor with Samsung and domestic manufacturers. That's quite a feat in a country where most of the population lives \"on less than $2 a day,\" Bloomberg reports.\nIf that idea takes hold around the world, this will be Apple's model for other markets including Brazil, Russia and Indonesia. India will buy 225 million smartphones a year, and Apple has sold 325,000 iPhones last year. But Apple faces competition from China's Xiaomi, which already is a competitor with Apple in China.\nPart of the reason is that unlike the United States, Indian carriers don't subsidize phone costs because customers don't usually sign two-year contracts. The reason? Carriers also don't check credit or enforce contracts. So most Indian customers buy phones from retailers and use prepaid cards for talk time. The iPhone 4 sells at about half the price of the iPhone 5s, which is a reasonable deal to many Indian customers.\nFor Apple, this is a way to rid itself of its older and refurbished phones and still manage to snag new consumers in the developing world. If Apple's sales do well, the sales model will be repeated in other countries, too."}

Lawmakers also would have the authority to allocate state aid in a manner that \"mitigates local disparities in educational opportunity and fiscal capacity.\"\nEvery school district would have to get a reasonable share of aid, but the amendment specifies no minimum.\n\"This amendment meets the goals of affirming the state's responsibility for education and allowing New Hampshire to direct more education aid to the communities with greatest need,\" said Gov. John Lynch, who has been lobbying hard for a constitutional change.\n\"In addition, this amendment includes the two language changes that a number of Republicans said were necessary as a condition for their support \u2014 specifically, allowing the Legislature to consider fiscal capacity of communities when distributing aid, and adding the word 'reasonably' to ensure the Legislature has flexibility to direct aid to communities most in need,\" added Lynch.\nThe committee voted 16-9 to reject an alternative, similar amendment supported by Republicans. That amendment called for the state's actions to reflect a shared responsibility with communities. It also called for some state aid to be shared on a per pupil basis.\nHouse Finance Chairwoman Marjorie Smith sponsored the successful amendment. She said she did not want to limit the state's aid distribution to a per pupil basis since some towns, especially smaller ones, might not fare as well under that aid system.\nBoth amendments contain the word \"reasonably,\" which some legal experts argue would lower the court's standard of review of education aid issues.\nSmith, D-Durham, disagreed. \"The word reasonably is in there to provide encouragement to those people who believe the court might have been too demanding on the Legislature,\" she said.\nEducation is a fundamental right in the state, she added.\n\"What this amendment is designed to do is to clarify how the state can best fulfill its obligations,\" she said. \"The Legislature \u2014 and each successive Legislature \u2014 will have control to determine that if only so much money is available to education, it can target it without having first paid all of the costs covered by a definition (of adequacy),\" she said.\nSmith said her amendment is what Lynch and Republicans wanted.\nLawmakers have been struggling with school funding since a landmark state Supreme Court ruling in 1997 found the state's reliance on widely varying local property taxes unconstitutional. A recent study by the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies found that per-pupil spending has risen overall since then, but poor towns have not gained ground on towns with greater property tax wealth.\nLynch and other legislative leaders believe making the state pay the full cost of an adequate education in every community would create an intolerable financial burden, without necessarily making schools better.\nTwo years ago, Lynch proposed a school aid plan that phased out aid to wealthier towns.\nThe Legislature is working to meet a July 1 Supreme Court deadline to define an adequate education.

There are several reasons this information is critical, but the short answer to \u201cwhy\u201d is this will help you determine your customers\u2019 priorities and make yourself as relatable to them as possible.\nFor instance, your target consumer\u2019s age alone can help you choose the right communication channels for advertising (more on that below). You could even select aspects of your business to emphasize based on a given group\u2019s general buying habits. A good example of this is the rising dominance of millennials as the largest share of the population. Because millennials tend to have strongly-held views and value philanthropy and sustainability, you may notice more businesses emphasizing their charity initiatives or responsible use of resources in advertising campaigns.\nFree information on the general buying habits (i.e. priorities) of various age groups are just a google search away, and an easy way to start yourself on the right path to a usable buyer persona.\nQuestion 2: What is the best way to reach our customers?\nAttempting to contact customers via a channel they tend to neglect is like trying to have a conversation in a language you don\u2019t speak; you may be able to express some basic information with gestures but will likely fail to get your message across. Additionally, failure to meet your customers where they are may demonstrate neglect to understand them and thus damage any relatability you\u2019ve worked hard to develop.\nFinding the right communication channels for your audience is a mixture of process of elimination, research and asking existing customers. Starting with the research, build from your established buyer persona(s) and do what you did to create them: search for free, reliable information.\nThis Gallup poll and this fact sheet from Pew Research Center are great illustrations of how channel preferences differ by age group, and can act as a springboard for the more precise answer pertaining to your business and customers.\nQuestion 3: What are our success metrics?\nThis last question/answer will rely heavily on what you conclude from the first two questions, as well as your company\u2019s business model and goals. Perhaps it\u2019s a reduction in churn rate or an increase in dispute resolutions. Perhaps you just want to gauge the engagement level of a particular group or incentivize past customers to return.\nEstablishing a clear, specific success metric is how you or your customer service team will create a roadmap to improvement; if you want to gauge a group\u2019s engagement, you\u2019ll plan a campaign through their preferred channel and set a desired response rate. If you want to incentivize your customers, you\u2019ll do the same but target incentives to your buyer persona (a charitable donation based on responses, a special discount code, etc.).\nAnother point to consider is how success metrics go hand in hand with identifying pain points. Ideally, a success metric will directly address (or at least shed light on) a pain point you or your team encounters fairly regularly.\nFor pain points and initial information on the devices your visitors tend to use, Google Analytics is invaluable.

{"idx": "3641", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Big Bets \u2013 If you want marketing to be valued, you have to understand, and link, to what the organization values. It\u2019s that simple. If it\u2019s market share, connect marketing objectives and activities to acquisition or account penetration, or both. If it\u2019s profit, understand the drivers of profitability and align your teams\u2019 efforts to those drivers. Plan top down, not bottom up.\nBig Strategy \u2013 Once you understand how to link marketing to the business objectives, your job is then to connect those big bets to day-to-day marketing activities. Your smarts will be needed to take requirements for the product and sales organizations (which may be very tactical) and link them to the overall marketing strategy that aligns to the big bets. Warning: This will require math; perhaps lots of it.\nBig Plays \u2013 To execute, organize your marketing objectives as defined by your internal stakeholders into two or three big plays. If market share is a key growth objective, a big play should focus on an area that has the greatest opportunity to do that, like a specific market, product and customer. All marketing activities/campaigns should be nested around that \u201cplay.\u201d Messaging is critical here because it is the \u201cbig play\u201d wrapper that creates consistency in the communication across execution. Think \u201cSmarter Planet,\u201d which contains, for example, a big data analytics play across industries and solutions/products. IBM discovered years ago that the best-performing campaigns stayed in market the longest, and had the highest level of integrated tactics. It takes focus and discipline to do, but if you can get there, it can make your life easier by enabling you to organize everything under an umbrella, and if things don\u2019t fit...then maybe you don\u2019t do them.\nBig Results \u2013 The first rule here is to understand that measurement and reporting are different. Measure everything, but report only \u201cprocess\u201d or \u201cresults\u201d metrics. Executives care about outputs, not inputs. Inputs are activities; outputs are results. Know the difference.\nBig Balls \u2013 Ya gotta have \u2019em. You are going to have to get comfortable enough with risk to embrace it. If you do this right, you will be placing bets that you don\u2019t know how \u2014 or if \u2014 they are going to pay off. Years ago, I worked with a CEO who committed to double the size of the business in three years. The CMO calculating sales cycles realized that to support such growth, marketing needed to double the number of leads that year. She had no idea how she was going to do it, but it caught the attention of senior management, focused her team, and it happened. But as she learned, you don\u2019t try to go it alone. Reach out to others with your plan and secure their buy-in and support. Level-set expectations. For some, this may take a while. Set big goals, but be realistic in getting there.\nThe other interesting, and important nugget from the research is that marketing is playing a bigger role in influencing corporate strategy, and other functions. Make sure you\u2019re capturing this opportunity at your organization by thinking, executing and by being -- \u201cBig\u201d.\nScott Gillum is the president of gyro Washington D.C."}

ET reported on November 28 that consumers were complaining of the spike in utility bills, in some instances increasing more than 100%. The company had described the complaints as malicious propaganda.\n\u201cThe commission, prima facie, feels that increase in billed consumption for October 2018 appears to be unduly high this year. It would need more detailed inquiry to verify the explanation of Adani Electricity,\u201d the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission said on Friday. MERC had earlier sought an explanation from Adani Electricity after the media reports and social media uproar. But unsatisfied with the company\u2019s response, it has now set up a two-member fact-finding committee.\n\u201cThe commission needs to safeguard the interest of all the consumers, particularly those who are affected by the sudden increase in electricity bill. In this context, the commission deems it fit to appoint a fact-finding committee to go into, inter alia, the reason for the sudden upsurge of consumption/ other reason which might have led to increase in electricity bill in Mumbai and Mumbai suburbs and recommend corrective steps, if any, to ensure that such incidents of sudden hike in electricity bills do not reoccur,\u201d MERC said.\nSome Adani consumers witnessed an increase in the bill for September, which the company attributed to its inability to read meters in certain areas due to an employees\u2019 strike. But the company told the regulator that upon meter reading, the amount was adjusted in subsequent demands.\nMany consumers complained on social media of a substantial increase in their bills in October, some saying the demand has almost doubled from the previous month, which Adani attributed to an increase in energy consumption due to seasonal changes.\nThe regulator has told Adani Electricity that while the investigation is on, it should verify metered consumption, refund any excess amount that is found and run special camps to address consumer grievances. Electricity distribution is a regulated business in India, with prices determined by the regulator after taking all fixed and variable costs into consideration."}

A stream of exhibits, stores and restaurants have come and gone since its opening in 1999, including the Way Things Work, Where the Wild Things Are, Microsoft, Discovery Channel and Montage.

The elements of Matthes\u2019 departure mentioned in the column persist and will remain important after he is gone. Not least is the matter of community policing.\nThis transformation in law enforcement philosophy has been in the news and hearts of proponents for some time and enjoys widespread acceptance among the public. Successful trial deployments have been launched in four city precincts deemed most in need. City budgets have not accommodated the larger spending increases for police personnel urged by some parties to the debate, while others contend the idea of community policing relies first on a change of police department philosophy, after which resources and changes in deployment strategy can follow.\nColumbia police chief Ken Burton says police officers prefer traditional strong arm crime fighting involving arrests and other physical reactions to criminal behavior, and are resentful of peers engaged in outreach activities while real police protect the public against thieves, drug dealers and other would-be assailants.\n\u201cI believe that if we continue to promote the function of the police primarily as law enforcers (crime fighters), instead of public servants, we risk the further alienation of our minority communities,\u201d Tapia says.\nColumbia Police Department Sgt. Robert Fox, who wrote a report weeks ago on the local transition to community oriented policing, said to make it work 60 additional officers should be hired at a cost of $7.9 million per year. Sure, that would be nice, Tapia said, but more officers are not essential to getting underway; the approach first should be incorporated as part of CPD training and strategy.\nChief Burton favors the idea of community policing but says many officers don\u2019t see neighborhood schmoozing as part of real police work and reflect that opinion in morale surveys. They see more value in building relationships through traditional police work, not \u201cBBQ-ing, dancing on social media sites and doing other non-law enforcement related activities,\u201d according to one such anonymous survey respondent.\nTapia says the stress over change must be eliminated and every officer should adopt the role of community ambassador. The local activist group Race Matters, Friends agrees.\nThe sort of difficult discussion now underway is necessary for progress. Clearly we aren\u2019t there yet, but Matthes\u2019 resignation and associated discussion of community policing help focus the issue. It\u2019s not an easy moment, but we Columbians should be willing to face the question. Soon enough we will incorporate community policing more fully and become a more estimable community in the process.\nMeanwhile, let us be kind to each other while we have the debate.\nInvention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos."}

He jump-started the Red Sox\u2019s ninth-inning rally by grounding a leadoff single into center field.\nThe offensive production came despite Holt playing in the outfield for the first time in his professional career. Holt started in left field, and even made a terrific running catch in the third inning to rob Ian Kinsler of extra bases and prevent a run from scoring.\n\u2014 Dustin Pedroia went hitless but worked a key one-out walk in the ninth inning to set the stage for Ortiz\u2019s heroics. Chamberlain threw Pedroia six straight breaking balls before firing a 3-2 fastball in the dirt.\n\u2014 Xander Bogaerts made his first error at third base this season.

Or is it the American people at large \u2014 the demand side?\nIf it\u2019s demand side, like during the Great Depression the panelists said, then it could require a President Franklin D. Roosevelt-style New Deal bevy of programs. In the 1930s, those programs stimulated the economy through government programs that provided jobs for the unemployed, relief for workers and banking reform laws.\nIf it\u2019s a supply-side crisis like during 1970s \u201cstagflation,\u201d then it might be time to use President Ronald Reagan\u2019s approach to controlling money and reducing government spending, regulation and income taxes.\nPanelist David Jaffee, UNF sociology professor and assistant vice president for undergraduate studies, said the crisis is a demand-side predicament caused by 28 years of Reaganomics.\n\u201cThis is not your father\u2019s economy, it is your grandfather\u2019s economy,\u201d Jaffee said. He suggested an FDR New Deal approach. He said efforts to stabilize the economy could necessitate temporary nationalization of financial institutions paralyzed by bad loans, and blamed the current downturn on an under-regulated economic boom and decades of policies favoring the financial sector and businesses.\nMason said Obama\u2019s $787 billion economic stimulus is brimming with wasteful special interest pork and would do nothing to help the economy. In fact, he said, there isn\u2019t much Obama can do to turn the economy around \u2014 especially not trying to spend the country\u2019s way out of it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with these bailouts is way too much,\u201d Mason said.\nThe stimulus has become part of the problem, he said, because banks are at a standstill, waiting for a handout.\nMason said he opposed any nationalization of American banks, but said he thinks the government should relieve them of their bad assets through a government-owned entity similar to the Resolution Trust Corp., which liquidated bad assets during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\nPanelist Sid Rosenberg, UNF professor of real estate in the university\u2019s accounting and finance department, said the government should work with banks adjusting mortgages to reflect current assessed values \u2014 not boom-time, inflated values that left many Americans owing more on their homes than they are worth.\n\u201cThe Obama administration is tiptoeing around this,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cI think what they need to do is immediately reform bankruptcy laws,\u201d he said.\nRosenberg said something has to be done to return financial institutions to normalcy soon, or the economic problem will drag on for years, as Japan\u2019s did in the 1990s.\n\u201cThe longer you let the zombie banks run around, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said."}

The father of two teenage boys died just before midnight in Beersheba's Soroka Medical Center after he was critically wounded Tuesday morning when a Palestinian-launched Kassam rocket hit the factory where he worked on the outskirts of Sderot. Four other workers were lightly wounded. \"I saw him lying on the ground with blood on his face,\" his co-worker Tanya Basov told The Jerusalem Post. She was among the lucky factory workers who made it safely out of the building after the warning siren rang out around 8:30 a.m. A video released to the media showed how the workers ran for the safety of a nearby protected room. Yaakobov, who immigrated from Russia 12 years ago, is the last one seen heading out from behind a stack of boxes before the Kassam crashed through the roof and the room filled with smoke from the fire that broke out upon impact. \"People were still holding their hands to their ears because the noise had been so loud,\" Basov said as she sat in the factory's office across the way. As she spoke, workers cleared away the burnt timber from the factory. On a table to the side, the half-filled coffee and teacups were still where some workers had left them. They had been on break at the time of the explosion. It's the second attack on the city with serious casualties in less than a week. Last Wednesday, a Kassam rocket killed Sderot resident Fatima Slutsker. Tuesday's attack on the factory occurred as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour was on a planned visit to the city as part of her five-day trip to the region. On Monday, she visited Beit Hanun, the city from which many of the Kassams are launched and which has been the target of IDF retaliatory operations. UN spokesman Christopher Gunness said that upon their arrival in Sderot, two Kassams landed some 200 meters from their car as they were parked on the side of the road. They continued to the mayor's office and were meeting with him when the factory was attacked. Arbour asked to be taken to the scene and Sderot Mayor Eli Moyal later told the Post he was only too happy to oblige. According to Gunnes, Arbour condemned the attack and said, \"Kassam rockets are illegal under international law because they are too inaccurate to distinguish between civilian and non-civilian targets.\" In addition, Arbour said that Israel \"has a responsibility to defend its citizens, but has to do so only by legal means. It has to do so in line with international law, including international humanitarian law, but it has a primary responsibility to protect people who are under its authority.\" While Moyal said he was pleased by Arbour's visit, not everyone was happy to see her. According to footage of the scene, a few workers at the site of the rocket attack shouted some curses at her and one threw a stone at her vehicle as it drove away. Gunness downplayed the significance of the attack on the high commissioner. He said she was well received and a welcomed guest in the city during her two-hour tour which included a visit to a kindergarten class. Arbour also got a first-hand look at the way Kassam attacks induce panic in children when a warning siren rang out while she was in the classroom.

Those pop stars failed, he knew, to recognize the sudden appearance of inspiration as the prompting of their own subconscious. And by pretending that the songs arrived already finished, those lazy pop stars rationalized their unwillingness to do the work of crafting an inspiration into a finished song.\n\u201cI work on songs all the time,\u201d he told me. \u201cI still work on songs that were written 20 years ago. If there\u2019s a line that I never liked, and all of a sudden a better line pops out of my mouth on stage, I\u2019ll use the new line forever after. For example, one of my favorite songs is \u2018Better Days,\u2019 but there was a line that never suited me. I tried to change it but I couldn\u2019t think of a better one, so I went ahead and recorded the song as it was.\nThe original version was the title track of Clark\u2019s 1983 album, the last part of a trilogy he did for Warner Bros. Records. All three LPs were later released as a two-CD set on Philo, Craftsman. That word defined both his process and his achievement better than any other. The revised version of \u201cBetter Days\u201d can be heard on 1997\u2019s Keepers\u2014A Live Recording.\n\u201cKeepers\u201d was Clark\u2019s phrase for songs that are worth recording. Like a fisherman, he implies, you hook and reel in a lot of songs from the subconscious but most of them are too scrawny and ill-shapen to take home. So you throw them back into the pond with instructions to eat a lot of plankton and fill out. He learned that\u2014and so much else\u2014from his best friend and greatest influence: Townes Van Zandt.\nThey met in 1963, the 21-year-old Clark was a college dropout who dabbled in building boats and playing folk music in Houston. Van Zandt was 19 at the time, a scrawny, laconic dark-haired kid with a dry wit. When Clark first met him, Van Zandt had only written two songs, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Here in the Morning\u201d and \u201cTurnstyled, Junkpiled,\u201d but they were enough to give Clark a whole new perspective on songwriting. He had always assumed that folk songs were so old that no one could remember writing them and that pop songs were so silly that no one gave much thought to writing them.\n\u201cThe first time I heard Townes, I went, \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Clark remembered. \u201cHere was someone who was writing new songs that weren\u2019t talking about girls and beer in moon-June rhymes. There was something intelligent about the way he used the English language. I said to myself, \u2018Here\u2019s a reason to write a song.\u2019 I started writing the day I met him.\nClark was divorced and working as an art director at the CBS station in Houston when he met his future wife Susanna at the end of 1969. She told him, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re going to be a songwriter, be a songwriter. Don\u2019t dabble at it and then spend the rest of your life wondering what might have been.\u201d With that challenge ringing in his ears, Guy moved to L.A. and brought Susanna with him.\n\u201cWe were living in this garage apartment in this straight neighborhood in Long Beach,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cWe woke up one morning"}

Right now its available on the company's website and in a few retailers.\nKeurig faces a saturated market for its hot drink brewing machines, which means a lot is riding on the Kold \u2014 which can deliver a carbonated, chilled beverage in 90 seconds without using a CO2 canister.\nThat trick could give the Kold an edge over rivals like SodaStream.\nThere's a lot of technology - and money - behind this. The company filed more than 50 patents, and has another 100 applications pending, over the course of five years as it developed the system. Keurig invested about $100 million in the device in fiscal 2015, and said in September it planned to spend a similar amount in 2016.\nCritics of the Kold have been quick to point out some big flaws in the device: it's expensive, large, needs to get warmed up and isn't more convenient than popping open a soda, according to some complaints on Keurig's website and Facebook page.\nBut a closer look at how the device works also reveals a few hints to how Keurig might be able to do to address some of these issues.\nIt starts with a chiller.\nWhile much of the press surrounding Keurig Kold has focused on the machine's carbonation features, the process starts with chilling.\n\"There are a lot of ways to make something hot quickly, but there are few options to make something cold quickly,\" Keurig spokesperson Suzanne DuLong told Business Insider.\nAs soon as users insert a pod with the flavor of soda they are after, and start the machine, water is drawn into a chiller from the external water tank. The chilling process begins as an impeller spins, cooling the water.\nIf the water isn't cold enough, it will not absorb carbonation as well. Plus, the changing temperature of the water is responsible for setting off the chain of events that follows in the next 90 seconds.\nThe cold water then flows into the pod.\nAs the chiller does its job, a small amount of water is brought to the cartridge chamber, where the flavor pod is located.\nThe drawings in this August, 2014 patent by Keurig's Thomas Novak, Ross Packard, Peter Peterson and Shawn Gulla for a \"Method and apparatus for cartridge-based carbonation of beverages\" are not the exact schematics for the Keurig Kold machine. However, they do show the tech that underpins it, as water moves from one chamber to another.\nThe carbonation comes from \"beads\" in the upper chamber.\nThe flavor pod is divided into the two chambers. One contains beads that are made with a blend of minerals - primarily aluminum silicate - with tiny porous spaces that hold carbon dioxide captive until they're exposed to water. Keurig calls them \"Karbonator\" beads.\nThe second chamber contains the beverage syrup, which comes into play later.\nOnce the system registers the water in the chiller has reached the optimum temperature of approximately 37 degrees, the Keurig Kold releases the small amount of water into the top of the pod, wetting the beads and releasing the carbon dioxide.\nThe released carbon dioxide then has to travel back into the chiller to carbonate the water.\nMixed"}

The other issue: \"It's caused a lot of bad publicity for the city it doesn't need right now.\"\nHe told water officials to be back in court Monday to update him on city initiatives to help residents in arrears keep their water on.\nFailure to collect undermines the financial stability of the water department and forces higher rates on customers who pay, water officials have said. The city also is stepping up collections against commercial customers.\nMany residents who receive shutoff notices do not contact the city for help in paying their bills, Latimer said. He acknowledged the department does not have the staff to visit those people before contractors are sent out to disconnect water service.\nThe average Detroit water bill is $40 to $70 a month, and the average delinquency is 90 to 120 days, Latimer said. A bill of $150 or more that is 60 days past due will trigger a water shutoff.\nRhodes said the city needs to create a \"much more aggressive plan\" to inform residents about overdue bills, payment plans and financial help.\nEmergency manager Kevyn Orr's office had no immediate comment Tuesday.\nActivists have fought the shutoff program, prompting condemnation of the city's effort as a human rights violation by a United Nations commission and criticism from politicians. Mayor Mike Duggan, who doesn't have control over the water department, has said the shutoffs were handled poorly and should have come with more public notice and information.\nDetroit filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, citing debts and projected long-term liabilities of $18 billion."}

A covert team within Asio was tasked with conducting a top secret investigation.\nAsio later decided to hand the investigation over to the federal police, who launched Operation Liver. The investigations started with a \u201csignificant number of suspects\u201d the history says, but eventually centred on George Sadil, a Russian translator who had worked for Asio since 1968.\nSadil was arrested in 1993, and police found classified documents at his home. Police didn\u2019t find direct evidence of espionage, and he was charged with removing classified documents without authority.\nFurther leads led to the Cook report, undertaken by the former director of the office of national assessments, Michael Cook, in 1994 \u2013 which remains top secret.\nIn 2004, an ABC Four Corners program broadcast an investigation about the penetration of Asio which interviewed a range of intelligence officials, and alleged a mole had been passing secrets to the KGB.\nBlaxland told reporters after the launch on Wednesday the Soviet penetration needed to become a matter of record. \u201cWe agreed it was appropriate to be included, even though it was painful to Asio to do that,\u201d the historian said.\n\u201cThis was the most contentious part of the story ... it is arguably the most embarrassing to Asio.

Following the example set by its raid on an Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak 1981, it drew up plans to bomb the Syrian compound.\nBut Washington was not satisfied. It demanded clear evidence of nuclear-related activities before giving the operation its blessing. The task of the commandos was to provide it.\nToday the site near Dayr az-Zawr lies in ruins after it was pounded by Israeli F15Is on September 6.

Logic and reason tell us that reaching the AFC Championship is a success. Emotion tells us that the Patriots were frustrating, maddening and downright disappointing on Sunday night.\nRegardless, the question is always the same in the wake of a season-ending defeat.\nHow do they get better?\nOf course, we all have theories on what the Patriots need. Assuming that Aqib Talib and Wes Welker both return, what follows is strictly one set of thoughts.\nBy contrast, the Patriots were trailing by a 21-13 score and appeared to be driving when Ravens safety Bernard Pollard rocked Stevan Ridley's world and forced a fumble in the fourth quarter on Sunday. A quarter before, Pollard was the same guy who drilled Welker (and drew a 15-yard penalty) just a few plays before Welker's huge drop on third down. The Patriots simply do not have a safety that physically changed the game the way Pollard did, and complementing McCourty with someone of the like would make a huge difference.\nThe good news? By the end of the season, the Patriots had corners that were actually pretty decent. McCourty generally did fine at safety. But the other safety spot was a train wreck.\n2. A linebacker. Respectively, Jerod Mayo, Dont'a Hightower and Brandon Spikes were drafted in the first, first and second rounds. They all offer something. But not a single one of them excels in coverage, which is part of the reason the Patriots had such difficulty defending tight ends and running backs.\nFor what it's worth, opposing quarterbacks this season completed 68.5 percent of all pass attempts to the tight end against the Patriots. That's a big number. The Patriots certainly tightened things up in the red zone once McCourty moved from corner, but Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta caught five passes (on seven targets -- 71.4 percent) for 55 yards and a touchdown on Sunday.\nIn this area, Patriots coach Bill Belichick seems to have some choices. Tavon Wilson was a surprise second-round pick because, in theory, he is a hybrid linebacker-safety who can cover the tight end. Rob Ninkovich is a hybrid defensive end-linebacker who is good on coverage.\nWhatever the solution, the the Pats have to get better at this.\n3. A defensive lineman. Maybe the solution is in house, but the absence of Chandler Jones, who played only in goal-line situations Sunday, left the Patriots without much of a pass rush, particularly on the interior.

Or Armond Armstead, the former Southern Cal defensive lineman whom the Patriots signed on Tuesday out of the Canadian Football League.\nThe point is this: a year ago, Vince Wilfork dominated the Ravens. This year, in two games against Baltimore, Wilfork was virtually invisible. The Ravens offensive line manhandled the Patriots in this game and the Patriots got no rush against Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco.\nCertainly, a healthy Jones will help.

It\u2019s used ubiquitously in construction from building foundations to sidewalks, roads and bridges. Its lifespan tends to be only about 50 years, and its manufacture is associated with significant negative environmental impacts \u2014 including emissions of air pollutants and about 5 percent of global CO2 levels. If exposed to water, its lifespan is reduced even further.\nUniversity of Utah geologist Marie Jackson recently discovered the reason behind the durability of Roman concrete.\nThe material is made of quicklime, seawater, volcanic ash and rock. After curing, when the porous cement was placed in the ocean, the water filtered through it and broke down components of the volcanic ash. New minerals, called Al-tobermorite and phillipsite, formed. With small crystals shaped like plates, the rare minerals locked together to strengthen the structure. The concrete grows stronger with time as more exposure to seawater means more mineral growth. It also means the cement has some capacity to heal itself.\nMaking the concrete is also considerably more sustainable than the manufacture of modern concrete.\nWhile she is primarily interested in the process itself, Jackson said the concrete would work well for the type of structures the Romans used it for \u2014 breakwaters and seawalls. However, she noted that those structures have negative environmental impacts of their own \u2014 they can destroy tidal ecosystems, which harms wildlife and can make their surroundings more vulnerable to storms.\nThe material wouldn\u2019t be useful in all circumstances, because the process requires time and the concrete isn\u2019t as strong under compression as modern concrete is. However, Jackson would like to see the material used as barriers around waste repositories and for nuclear waste treatment and disposal.\nShe has also advocated for its use in a tidal lagoon that\u2019s being proposed in the United Kingdom. It would need to operate for about 120 years to recuperate the costs of construction, and modern concrete would not be able to last that long.\nBefore it can be used in construction, though, the recipe for the material must be found. Scientists know what\u2019s in the concrete, but they don\u2019t know exactly how to make it. Even if they did, the volcanic rock and ash component isn\u2019t readily available in most of the world.\nJackson traveled to Iceland on July 17 to drill into a volcano named Surtsey to look for more insight into the process, which sometimes happens naturally at volcanic sites. She and a team of researchers hope to drill a core 500 meters deep. Jackson is also working with a geological engineer to find substitutes for the volcanic ingredients."}

Yet even as Waste Management (NYSE:WM) reported earnings earlier today that beat expectations, Republic Services is looking for ways to produce even more growth and catch up with its longtime rival in the business.\nRepublic Services and Waste Management have both done a good job over the years of producing growth through consolidation. Yet although acquiring smaller players could continue to provide growth opportunities for both companies, Republic has attracted more interest from Bill Gates' Cascade Investment, which has a $3 billion investment in Republic compared to having less than $500 million invested in Waste Management. Could Gates see greater growth potential from Republic than from its rival? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Republic Services over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.\nCan Republic Services earnings grow faster this quarter?\nAnalysts have made only the smallest of moves in recent months on their views about Republic Services, cutting their third-quarter earnings estimates by a penny per share but leaving longer-term projections unchanged. The stock has stayed near its highs but failed to produce further advances, falling 1% since late July.\nUnfortunately, Republic Services had a bad start to the quarter, as adjusted net income plunged 28% from the previous year's second quarter. Revenue rose a modest 2.5%, but declines in recycling commodity revenue held back the company's sales growth. Still, Republic kept its guidance on earnings and free cash flow for 2013 unchanged, helping to minimize the damage on the stock.\nThe nice thing about the trash and recycling business, though, is that it has never-ending demand. Cyclical changes affect both supply and demand, as a sluggish economy leads to fewer people buying new things and therefore throwing away less. Boom times lead to greater disposal and often higher prices for recycled materials. In the long run, though, those cycles balance out and leave room for both Republic and Waste Management to grow as populations increase.\nYet the most interesting new development for Republic, Waste Management, and peer Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN) is an increasing emphasis on natural gas. As a gas user, Republic has about 10% of its fleet fueled by natural gas, and its plans are to make half of its new truck purchases compatible with the clean-burning fuel. At current price levels, Republic actually saves money using natural gas fuel. Republic has also taken steps toward harvesting landfill gas, with the company claiming 70 active projects nationwide. With potential uses that include collaborations with local businesses, electrical generation, and diverting gas to households for heating purposes, the industry is taking recycling to a whole new level.\nIn the Republic Services earnings report, look at how much the company is able to move forward with its energy efforts. With so much growth potentially available from the energy aspects of waste handling and recycling, Republic has a chance to compete better against Waste Management to become an even more important part of the industry.\nClick here to add Republic Services to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks."}

The West African outbreak has been blamed for more than 2,400 deaths, and experts say it is out of control. The U.S. has called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council for this week to discuss the crisis.\nAt a heated news conference Monday, a Sierra Leonean government official read a statement saying that the Buck is the second doctor from that country to die because negotiations on evacuation had dragged on. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, the country's top Ebola expert, was being considered for evacuation when he died of the disease in July.\n\"In both the cases of late Dr. Khan and Dr. Buck, we have observed a sluggish willingness by WHO in facilitating medical evacuation of Sierra Leonean Ebola-infected doctors for advance treatment abroad,\" according to a statement from a presidential communications task force read out by Deputy Minister for Political and Public Affairs Karamoh Kabba.\nHe added that the two doctors died while their fates \"hung in negotiations.\"\nBut the World Health Organization responded Monday that it can only evacuate its own staff and that, given the number of health workers becoming infected, the solution is not to evacuate them all anyway. Some 300 health care workers have been infected so far, about half of whom have died.\n\"We would like to help everyone, but we cannot help every health worker that gets infected,\" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman at WHO. \"We need to ensure enough quality health facilities in those countries so everyone can get treated, firstly health workers.\"\nSierra Leone had requested funds from WHO to transport Buck to Europe. But on Monday, Kabba said that money was not the main impediment to evacuating Buck. It would have cost $70,000, he said, and the government had the money, but it needed WHO's help to facilitate the evacuation. He did not elaborate on what that meant.\nJasarevic said that WHO is \"not a medical evacuation agency.\" Earlier, the agency had said that it would instead work to give Buck \"the best care possible\" in Sierra Leone, including possible access to experimental drugs.\nSeveral foreign health and aid workers, including a Senegalese epidemiologist working with WHO, have been evacuated when they became infected. In at least some of those evacuations, the patients' home governments and employers played a role in getting them out of West Africa.\nBecause Ebola is only transmitted through bodily fluids of people who are symptomatic, health care workers are at a particular risk. Some 300 have become infected since the outbreak began, exacerbating shortages of health care workers in countries that had too few doctors and nurses to begin with.\nMeanwhile, International SOS, a medical and travel security risk services company, said it flew two Dutch doctors who may have been exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone to the Netherlands on Sunday. The National Institute for Public Health and Environment said last week the doctors, who were working with an aid group, were not showing symptoms of Ebol"}

As he submitted his 16th and final budget proposal Wednesday, for fiscal year 2018-19, I was thinking what a long, strange trip it\u2019s been for both of us.\nAlthough the governor is a lawyer and I\u2019m a CPA, we both are \u201cnumbers guys\u201d who like to get into the nitty gritty in the back pages and dig into the weeds.\nGood: The budget acknowledges that, despite some pension reforms, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s unfunded liabilities continue to rise\u201d because \u201cpoor investment returns and the adoption of more realistic assumptions related to future investment earnings and demographics have grown the state\u2019s retiree long-term costs, debts and liabilities to $272 billion.\u201d Unlike other numbers, the governor commendably also mentions the $76.7 billion in retiree medical liabilities.\nBad: The budget includes spending of $6.2 billion for contributions to CalPERS and $3.1 billion for CalSTRS; these contribution amounts were minuscule 20 years ago before pension spiking. That\u2019s $9.3 billion that could have gone to pay for more teachers, cut college tuition, build roads \u2014 or be refunded to taxpayers. Even worse: Brown kicks any real pension solutions into the future when he\u2019ll be gone.\nGood: In his press conference, the governor again warned the current prosperity will not last forever and \u201cit\u2019s important to prepare\u201d for the next recession. With an appropriate supplemental payment of $3.5 billion, the budget fills the \u201cRainy Day Fund\u201d all the way to the constitutional Proposition 2 requirement of $13.5 billion which voters passed in 2014.\nBad: As the governor noted, a recession likely would mean $20 billion in yearly deficits. In three years, that would equal $60 billion. That could mean $46.5 billion in cuts. What\u2019s needed is for the Legislature, on its own, to start saving more toward that higher amount.\nGood: The budget\u2019s general fund spending would only rise by 4.1 percent, to $131.7 billion.\nBad: Over the last eight years, spending increases total 52.4 percent since Brown\u2019s budget of just $86.4 billion for 2011-12. That\u2019s way above the original spirit of the Gann Limit of 1979, which the governor supported, capping spending at the increase in population plus inflation.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, California\u2019s population has grown 5 percent the last eight years; while the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online calculator figures the Consumer Price Index rose 12 percent. Total: 17 percent. That indicates Brown\u2019s own spending increases couldn\u2019t be sustained in a recession.\nGood: No tuition increases for Cal State and UC students, making tuition, adjusted for inflation, below 2011 levels.\nBad: Unfortunately, this does not address the administrative bloat detailed in an April 2017 audit by State Auditor Elaine M.

Eight percent of Iranians approved of U.S. leadership in late 2011 and early 2012 -- one of the lowest ratings the U.S. receives worldwide. While nearly half of Iranians (46%) support cutting ties with countries that impose economic sanctions on Iran, nearly one in three (31%) do not, showing a sizable minority of Iranians still value relations.\nIssue at Hand: The U.S., the U.K., and the EU in recent months have imposed some of the toughest economic sanctions on Iran yet to thwart its nuclear program. Iran has responded with threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, the route for one-fifth of the world's oil. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on state TV last week that, \"no obstacles can stop Iran's nuclear work.\"\nTensions over Iran's disputed nuclear program escalated further last week after Iran refused to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) officials to investigate nuclear activities at a military base. The IAEA reported after its recent trip that Iran had stepped up its uranium enrichment, sending oil prices soaring to a nine-month high Friday amid concerns about a confrontation with the West.\nThe U.S. and Israel are not ruling out strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, but the U.S. is urging Israel to give the sanctions additional time to work. Iran is anticipated to be the focus when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with President Barack Obama next week.\nObama Administration's Stance: Calling Tehran's refusal to give IAEA officials access to the military site \"disappointing,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said last week that the U.S. still wants to see negotiations move forward. \"There is that diplomatic track,\" Toner said. \"But we're not going to ease up on the sanctions.\"\nAlthough the administration has not taken any options off the table to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Obama said in his State of the Union address that he believed that a peaceful resolution is still possible, and, if Iran abides by its international obligations, it can \"rejoin the community of nations.\"\nIranians' Approval of U.S. and Other Key Players: The 8% of Iranians who approved of U.S. leadership in late 2011 and early 2012 is similar to the 9% measured in early 2011, and remains one of the lowest ratings the U.S. receives worldwide. Other countries that are tightening sanctions, such as the U.K., Germany, and the EU, also have few admirers in Iran. Seven percent of Iranians approve of the U.K.'s leadership, while slightly more approve of the leadership of Germany (13%) and the EU in general (13%).\nRussia and China, which have criticized the West's sanctions, fare better.

{"idx": "3711", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Teachers of computer courses have long suspected that computers encourage students to work together rather than separately. Researchers say they now have evidence to confirm that suspicion.\nMarion Perlmutter, professor of child development at the University of Minnesota, says an experiment involving preschool children revealed that children work together more when they use computers than when they work on other projects.\nAfter giving 60 3- and 5-year-old students about 30 minutes of instruction in using the keyboard and other features of a computer, researchers at the university's Child Care Center allowed students to use computers during their one and one-half hours of free time. The researchers observed 60 students for three days a week over a nine-week period.\nThe average child spent about 75 percent of his time on the computer working with other children, Ms. Perlmutter and her research associate, Alexandra Muller, found.\nMost children of that age spend little time working with their classmates, Ms. Perlmutter said. When students worked on jigsaw puzzles, they spent only about 10 percent of the time with other children. The way students worked on the computer, she said, \"was not very typical of preschoolers.\"\nPrior to starting the research last fall, Ms. Perlmutter said, she shared the reluctance of many educators to introduce the computer to such young children. She said she thought such children might be able to use only computers that had speech-synthesizers. But she said students learned to use the keyboard quickly.\nMs. Perlmutter said she would expand her research to other preschool programs in the Minneapolis area over the next three years with a $70,000 grant from the National Education Association. The new research will concentrate more on \"problem-solving skills\" as well as the social environment that computers create.\nA growing number of guidance counselors have begun to use computers to analyze the capabilities of their students and how those capabilities can be put to work in classes and the workplace. Two projects in California now offer comprehensive information on such uses.\nThe Santa Clara County Office of Education in California is updating its directory of computer software produced for guidance counselors. The next edition will be available in January. The county agency's book is believed to be the only compilation of information about the software.\nThe H.B. McDaniel Foundation in Fullerton, Calif., is funding a study of the issues that guidance counselors will face in the next 20 years. The educators working on the project--led by H.B. Gelatt, the director of the Future Directions Project at Stanford University--released their first findings this summer.\nThe year is 1994, and President Daniel Patrick Moynihan finds the public-school system in dire need of federal support. Public schools enroll only 13.2 percent of all students nationwide--a situation that has resulted from the proliferation of microcomputers in society and the passage of tuition-tax credit legislation.\nThat is the vision of Robert C. Snider, a research assistant for the National Education Association. In one of 11 articles about computers in education published in this month's Phi Delta Kappan, the monthly magazine of the education fraternity, Mr. Snider warns that computers could undermine all of education.\nThe microcomputer is such a revolutionary machine, Mr. Snider fears, that it could transform schools into places where only \"the most visible technological underclass of the 1990's will be found.\"\nAmong the other topics covered in the Kappan issue devoted to computers in education: the extent to which tommorow"}

But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top.\nHe was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.\nPlushenko\u2019s exit only cleared a bigger runway for Japan\u2019s Yuzuru Hanyu, who won the short program, smashed his own world record and became the first to break 100 points with a score of 101.45.\nHanyu\u2019s coach Brian Orser \u2014 the Canadian who won two silver medals and coached South Korea\u2019s Kim Yu-Na to gold in 2010 \u2014 jumped up and down behind the boards. The slender teen flew through his spins, nailed a triple-triple combination and danced through a jazzy step sequence. His movements have a loose elegance to them.\nHanyu hails from Sendai, which was struck by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. He held fundraisers to help victims and repair his home rink.\nHanyu\u2019s performance was so distinctly superior it was surprising that Patrick Chan was awarded 97.52 points. It was another instance of what the skating world calls \u201cChanflation\u201d for the Canadian, considered the favorite here because of his three-time world championship resume. His interpretation of a dreamy Rachmaninoff piece was sweet yet blase. He hit his quad-triple but stepped out of his triple axel and was late on his ending.\nJudges generously kept Chan within striking distance of Hanyu for Friday\u2019s long program climax. Without Plushenko they could use the suspense. Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, who trains with Hanyu in Toronto, placed third and Japan\u2019s Daisuke Takahashi is fourth.\n\u201cNow I can go out and enjoy my program whereas I think Yuzuru has a bit of a target that he\u2019s not quite used to having, and on the Olympic stage the target\u2019s kind of doubled in size,\u201d said Chan, who has a burden of his own trying to become the first Canadian man to win Olympic gold.\nThe Americans comported themselves ably in two vastly different ways. Jason Brown was charming and as slick as his ponytail skating to Prince and putting himself on the edge of the podium picture with 86 points in sixth place.\nJeremy Abbott was plucky. He fell on his quad jump, as is often the case, except this time he fell so hard on his right hip it looked like he wouldn\u2019t be able to get up. He slid into the boards and lay there crumpled on the ice for 10 seconds, then suddenly sprung back to life, continuing his program in stride with the music. Spectators cheered his persistence, and rose to a standing ovation. His score of 72.58 placed him 15th.\nEven more amazing is how Abbott was able to improvise under pressure.\nFigure skaters are among the most creative of athletes but their skill gets obscured by questionable costumes and musical arrangements.

I felt like a drill sergeant.\"\nBut this school year, time is on Rusack's side.\nMonday, the first day of school for Bethlehem Area School District students, almost 900 kindergartners will be in school all day for the first time ever \u2014 thanks to the district's new universal full-day kindergarten program.\nThis makes Bethlehem the largest Lehigh Valley district to offer universal full-day kindergarten.\nFor Rusack and other Bethlehem kindergarten teachers, that means more than enough time to learn the alphabet and how to count. There also will be plenty of time for nursery rhymes, science units on the weather and a plethora of art projects to complete in just a day.\nThere's even recess for kindergartners this year, something that half-day students did not have.\n\"Having that full day \u2014 it's great,\" Rusack said. \"It's where the kids need to be. I think they'll be more ready for first grade.\"\nBethlehem administrators were ready to commit an extra $500,000 to offer full-day kindergarten for several reasons, including the convenience for working parents and the hope students will stay in the district rather than leave for charter schools that offer full-day kindergarten.\nBut a big factor was the adoption of the state's version of Common Core, which demands students learn more at an earlier age. Half-day has always been a challenge, Rusack said, but ever since implementation of the Pennsylvania Core Standards, it's been more of a trial.\nBy the end of the school year, kindergartners in Pennsylvania not only have to recognize letters but must be able to tell the difference between similarly spelled words. In math, they need to write numbers 0 to 20, count to 100 and solve word problems.\nSo the songs and story times that have long been a staple of kindergarten were pushed to the back burner.\nWhen Rusack's half-day students had playtime, they often played \"school\" with one another, she said, so there was always an emphasis on academics.\nEducators say expectations under the new standards are tough enough, but with kindergarten teachers having less than four hours a day to fill their students' brains with information, it becomes almost impossible.\n\"There are so many things that children are expected to master in kindergarten, and having more time really helps them build the foundations,\" said Janine Bacquie, director of Early Childhood Policy and Practice for the Washington, D.C., advocacy group Children's Defense Fund. \"The demands are becoming greater.\"\nSo far the state has made no effort to mandate full-day kindergarten.

I knew what was expected of me, and I knew I had to date and marry someone of the same faith.\nI remember that conversation with my father.

The plan focuses on mechanisms to reduce the energy requirements of existing buildings - public buildings in particular - and the role of dissemination projects in introducing energy-efficient measures.\nMany countries encourage the dissemination of green roofs because they offer a number of benefits that increase the quality of urban life. Green roofs are considered an important addition in the effort to create sustainable cities but, unfortunately, in Malta they have not as yet gained ground.\nThe LifeMedGreenRoof project aims at a better understanding of the performance of green roofs, especially in the local context, and to demonstrate the benefits of the technology to a wider audience.\nAs a project partner, the MCCAA's role is to draft the Green Roof standard for Malta based on the results obtained from research being carried out at the University of Malta, the project's lead partner. To date, the project has identified base line information, including a list of local flora that can be grown on a roof, confirmed that green roofs improve the thermal insulation of buildings and reduce storm water run-off to mitigate flooding. They also provide important habitats and feeding grounds for wildlife, increase ecosystem benefits and provide visual amenity.\nFollowing the workshop that was held in May 2016 that launched the process of developing the national standard, a technical committee comprised of various stakeholders was established and a number of technical meetings (14) have been held in the last six months to draft the standard.\nThe second workshop, held on 11 January, launched a public consultation on this draft standard, during which technical committee members explained the benefits of green roofs and the technical details of constructing and maintaining them in Malta.\nThe final standard will be launched at a public event in the coming months.\nFurther information about the LifeMedGreenRoof project is available from the website www.lifemedgreenroof.org or the LifeMedGreenRoof project Facebook page.

But as packs continue to multiply their taste for livestock and big game herds coveted by hunters has stoked a rising backlash.\nWildlife officials say that without public wolf hunting, they need greater latitude to eliminate problem packs. Montana and Idaho held inaugural hunts last year but an August court ruling scuttled their plans for 2010.\n\"As the wolf populations increase, the depredations increase and the number of wolf removals will increase. It's very logical,\" said Mark Collinge, Idaho director for Wildlife Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture branch that removes problem wolves, typically by shooting them from aircraft.\n\"You just have to accept that part of having wolves is having to kill wolves,\" he said.\nBut wildlife advocates and animal rights groups contend the response to depredating wolves has become too heavy-handed. They say a string of court decisions in their favor underscores that the species remains at risk.\n\"The draconian lengths they are poised to take really are a throwback, to when the same agency was gassing wolf pups in their dens almost a century ago and setting poisoned baits and trapping them,\" said Michael Robinson with the Center for Biological Diversity.\nAt least 1,700 wolves now roam Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

Pictures of teenagers jumping up in the air clutching pieces of paper, stories about twins with a string of A*s who are now off to Cambridge, and a parade of people trying to explain all the changes that have happened that year and how it is now all different to before.\nStudents receiving their A-level results on Thursday will be the first to do so in the latest wave of redesigned qualifications in England. The changes, which began during Michael Gove\u2019s tenure at the Department for Education, mean a move away from modular qualifications and coursework towards linear assessment at the end of two years of study \u2013 largely through examinations.\nThis year, subjects such as geography, modern foreign languages and music join the likes of English, the sciences, and art and design in being assessed in this way. The new qualifications are designed to better meet the needs of universities and employers.\nDespite the changes, many of the trends that we have seen in recent years persist. Girls continue to outperform boys in most subjects, the notable exceptions being mathematics and chemistry. There are large disparities in entry rates, around four-fifths of entries to physics are from boys, in English literature just one-fifth are.\nThe upward trend for entries into STEM subjects continues and now account for over a third of all entries. But modern foreign languages continue to slide with French down 8%, and German down 16%. The reforms to A-levels include the decoupling of the qualification from AS-levels. This means that, in England at least, the AS-level does not count towards the overall A-level qualification. This has inevitably led to a sharp decline in entries, with a fall of nearly 60% in the last year alone.\nFor many students, results day will be less about reflecting on what they have achieved and more about determining what happens next \u2013 whether they go to university, which university they will attend, and which course they will take. But for a growing number of students that uncertainty was removed long before they opened their results.\nThis year, Ucas reports that just over 42,000 18-year-olds have chosen their university and course based on an unconditional offer. In 2013, it was just 1,700. In fact, there has been an increase of 40% in the last year alone.\nThis inevitably raised concerns that without the incentive of meeting a university offer, some students may not strive for the highest grades possible. That may well have happened in some cases, but at a national level the proportion of entrants achieving an A* or A is largely unchanged, although there has been a slight dip in the very highest grade. It does however, raise questions about how our universities admissions system should operate.\nBut overall these are concerns for policymakers. For now, let\u2019s recognise what students and teachers have achieved through the recent upheaval."}

{"idx": "3738", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The government recently issued interim guidance on undertaking domestic violence homicide reviews. Presented to parliament in 2004 as section 9 of the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act, these reviews are not yet in force but many areas are undertaking them.\nFollowing personal tragedy, I inquired widely about responses to these murders, including talking with experts about \"fatality\" reviews in the US and \"death\" reviews in Canada. In 2008, the Pemberton homicide review into the murders of my sister and nephew was published. Later, I was offered a role contributing to the review model, including this interim guidance.\nThe legislation states that the purpose of reviews is to identify lessons to be learned. That certainly means fixing problems with current services but it's also an invitation to identify new ways to protect people. If the reviews have a broad outlook and input from a range of sources including the families, perhaps of the perpetrator as well as of the victim, it's more likely that innovation will occur.\nThis approach means reviewers may access where those being abused are sharing information. The Pemberton review, described by Professor Neil Websdale as a \"landmark achievement\" setting a \"gold standard\", included interviewing the perpetrator's employer, the family's general practitioner, the family and many friends of the victims as well as approaching the Catholic church (which then produced guidance but its publication is delayed).\nThese people may hear about the abuse way before any criminal justice agencies, but will almost certainly not recognise the level of risk. Although we had made many strenuous efforts to engage police, when my sister reminded me, 10 days before the murders, that her husband Alan was coming for her, I replied that he wouldn't do it while I was alive. We should spread knowledge of risk factors to help communities begin to conceive safe and early interventions.\nFamilies can help professionals to see the tragedy through the victim's eyes so they can understand the context in which they made decisions, for example not leaving the home. A strong theme of fatality review development in the US is that until this perspective is taken effectively, public bodies may still design services based on what they believe they can offer rather than what is required.\nCritically, family and friends may hold information that public bodies are unaware of, for example contact made with agencies where no records were made.\nMeeting families bereaved in these tragedies can help reviewers to appreciate and engage with the huge emotional toll of domestic violence. Professionals shouldn't miss the opportunity to inform their thinking so powerfully.\nThe government recently set up the National Victims Service partly to help secondary victims of homicide. Participation in reviews may help these people too. So far, they are usually held in private with limited publication. This allows families to disclose more than they might at say an inquest that is public. It may satisfy their needs to tell someone their story and to feel they have done their bit to help others \u2013 crucially, without risking full public glare.\nThe victim's perspective should permeate these reviews throughout, and they should take place after every domestic violence murder. It's not just about preventing murder but increasing understanding so other victims can be helped to become free of abuse. We should review some suicides, serious injury and near misses too, so we can avert tragedy without having to study one first.\nComprehensive, fearless and thorough reviews should conceive action plans that are clear and capable of being tracked. Readers should simply be able to follow actions that address findings of the review and which lead to defined outcomes being states or events that better protect vulnerable people."}

The electropermanent motor is similar in principle to the giant electromagnets used in scrapyards to lift cars, in which a powerful permanent magnet is paired with a weaker magnet whose magnetic field direction can be flipped by an electric current in a coil.\nThe two magnets are designed so that their fields either add or cancel, depending on which way the switchable field points.\nIn the new miniature version, a series of permanent magnets paired with electromagnets are arranged in a circle and drive a steel ring around them. They don't take power in either the on or off state, but use power only in the changing state.\n\"This result brings us closer to the idea of programmable matter - where computer programs and materials merge to form a new kind of matter whose shape and function can be programmed - not unlike biology,\" says Hod Lipson, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and computing and information science at Cornell University.\n\"Many people are excited today to learn about 3D printing and its ability to fabricate any shape; Gershenfeld's group is already thinking about the next episode, where we don't just control the shape of objects, but also their behavior.\"\nThe milli-motein is part of a family of devices, ranging from protein-based 'nanoassemblers' to a version where the chain is as big as a person. Ultimately, says the team, the work could lead to robotic systems that can be dynamically reconfigured to do many different jobs rather than repeating a fixed function, and that can be produced much more cheaply than conventional robotics."}

But people fear that once the Fed steps back, rates will inevitably rise.\nIndeed, mortgage rates have recently risen from their record lows. Last week, average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 3.98%, up from 3.35% in early May, according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac.\nThe recent rate increase amounts to about $100 more a month on a $300,000 mortgage, totaling $36,000 more over the course of 30 years, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage information company.\nUnlike most consumer lending, mortgage rates are tied to long-term interest rates. While they probably won't climb much further, they are unlikely to fall back to record lows, he said.\nMeanwhile, most borrowers will likely continue to enjoy rock-bottom rates on everything from auto loans to private student loan bills.\nOf course, there's a downside to low interest rates: savers get stuck with measly returns from savings accounts and low-risk investments like CDs. The low rates have been particularly hard on retirees living on fixed incomes.\nThese consumer credit and savings products are largely tied to short-term rates, which the Fed has kept near zero percent since December 2008.\nShort-term rates aren't expected to move higher anytime soon, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. Even when long-term interest rates start moving up, the Fed has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero until the economy strengthens considerably.\nIn turn, the so-called \"prime rate,\" the interest rate around which banks lend to their best customers and the most common benchmark used for setting credit card and other loan rates, has been stuck at 3.25% for years.\nWhile borrowers with poor credit have seen credit card rates increase slightly this year, rates for consumers with excellent credit have continued to fall.

{"idx": "3745", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Paint scratches from chairs on your dining room walls are a homeowner\u2019s nightmare. You can use different methods to fix these nicks and dings, but the most common solution is patching up your walls and repainting. This kind of repair can become both time-consuming and costly; instead, use preventative measures that will protect your walls, such as adding protective buffers to your chairs and using durable materials.\nAn easy and simple solution to keep chairs from scratching your dining room walls is to cover them with slipcovers. Slipcovers soften the contact to your walls, and, if the chairs hit the wall, create minimal buffs or marks. If you cannot find slipcovers within your budget or color scheme, cover the top half of your chairs with a pillowcase. Choose a high-thread-count case -- 300 or more -- to offer the best quality and protection for your walls. When deciding on the color or design of your slipcovers or pillowcases, choose a simple pattern that incorporates the room\u2019s secondary color. If your wall color is a soft beige or taupe, the primary color, and your curtains have a yellow-orange pattern; the yellow-orange is your secondary color. Choose a pattern or color similar to your curtain\u2019s design.\nAdding clear- or light-colored rubber or felt bumpers to the backs of your chairs helps prevent scratches and damage to your dining room walls. Most hardware stores have many different colors, types and sizes of bumpers that are unnoticeable on your chairs. The trick is to find the spots on the back of your chair where it hits the wall, then simply remove the paper on the back of the bumper and stick them on your chair. Clear plastic bumpers -- use dime-sized -- blend in nicely; if you do not care for the clear bumpers, they also come in other colors -- black, light and dark browns -- that match most chair finishes and colors. The felt bumpers are another option, but they come in an array of browns so they blend in better with natural wood finishes.\nWhile a chair rail is normally an aesthetic feature for your dining room, it can be applied to your dining room walls to protect them from chair dings. A chair rail is placed at 1/3 the height of the wall to keep the overall design balanced; for example, in a room with an 8-foot ceiling, install a chair rail 32 inches from the floor. Chairs normally rest at 36 inches, so use a large piece of trim that is 4- to 5-inches long placed at a height of 32 inches. If you decide to use a chair rail, install wood painted with a high-gloss paint that matches the floor trim as well as the window and door frames in your dining room. A chair rail adds a decorative touch to your dining room and provides the opportunity to add another color or pattern to your walls. Typically, another paint color, wallpaper or wainscoting panel is added below the chair rail for a traditional, classic look. These color and design options should be planned, so your color scheme and patterns match and complement each other; for example, if you plan to use complementary color scheme, paint a light blue on your walls above the chair rail, with a yellow-orange wallpaper pattern below the chair rail with white trim and accents.\nApplying a high-quality wall covering or border to your dining room wall protects it from chair scratches.

GPT2 is just using methods of statistical analysis, trained on huge amounts of human-written text \u2013 40GB of web pages, in this case, that received recommendations from Reddit readers \u2013 to predict what ought to come next. This probabilistic approach is how Google Translate works, and also the method behind Gmail\u2019s automatic replies (\u201cOK.\u201d \u201cSee you then.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fine!\u201d) It can be eerily good, but it is not as intelligent as, say, a bee.\nThis is quite baffling for many reasons. Since the narrator cannot have a job in Seattle and also a job in \u201csome school\u201d in China at the same time, the story must be set in 1945, with the narrator imagining their future educational career \u201ca hundred years from now\u201d, thanks to some unreasonably optimistic expectations about their lifespan. Even in 1945, though, he is driving a car that can be refuelled from the inside (\u201cI was in my car \u2026 I put the gas in\u201d) and apparently doesn\u2019t need to be consciously driven (\u201cand then I let it run\u201d). Unless, that is, the story is darker than at first glance and he is running the engine while stationary in his garage.\nIs there greater cause to worry further down the literary food chain? There have for a while already been \u201cAI bots\u201d that can, we hear, \u201cwrite\u201d news stories. All these are, though, are giant automated plagiarism machines that mash together bits of news stories written by human beings. As so often, what is promoted as a magical technological advance depends on appropriating the labour of humans, rendered invisible by AI rhetoric. When a human writer commits plagiarism, that is a serious matter. But when humans get together and write a computer program that commits plagiarism, that is progress.\nAs a news reporter, GPT2 is, to put it generously, rather Trumpian.

LUST, the companys top-of-the-line video-processing card, supports two channels of HD-SDI video and 12 channels of digital audio. Both cards are expected to ship this summer, although pricing has not yet been announced.\nDiscreet, the Autodesk animation and effects division, uncovered a suite of new video and effects products, including Lustre, a color grading system developed by Colorfront, which Discreet recently acquired. Lustre simplifies color grading and color correction in film at the processing stage. Users can now shoot their film or video normally, and do their color manipulations digitally\u2014such as turning sunny day shots into moody shades of blue\u2014using standard desktop PCs and off-the-shelf color calibration hardware.\nThere was no shortage of luster in the rest of Discreets press-conference-by-the-pool at Caesars Palace. The company also launched Cleaner XL, a Windows-only version of its batch video-compression system, which has been rewritten from scratch to support Intel hardware and the latest Windows codecs. The company said Cleaner XL serves up major speed improvements as well as unique new features for multiplatform video processing, such as the capability to filter color palettes automatically and to export video in many formats (such as HD, NTSC, PAL and streaming media) with a single click.\nFinally, Discreets Combustion, a video compositor, has been upgraded to Version 2.1. Enhancements include new particle effects and a deep price cut\u2014from $4,999 to $999.\nIf Discreets trumpets were a little hard to hear, it might have been thanks to the roar coming from the golden towers of the Mandalay Bay Hotel a couple of miles down the Strip, where Phil Schiller, Apple Computer Inc. senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, convened a media event at precisely the same moment as Discreets.

{"idx": "3749", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: T.M. Shine, whose writing style defines \u201cgentle humorist,\u201d takes aim at the Great Recession and the unemployment epidemic in his latest novel, chronicling the weird journey of a man who held the same job for nearly two decades, and was then cruelly cast aside without any other marketable skills. Shine\u2019s tone is well-suited for the tale, and his voice repeatedly rises off the page in the dulcet tones of a humorous anecdote related on NPR.\nThe problem is that Nothing Happens Until It Happens To You: A Novel Without Pay, Perks, Or Privileges crams in too many ideas and anecdotes. Over the course of the novel, 30-some major and minor characters collide with main character Jeffrey Reiner, and Shine has no idea what to do with most of them by the novel\u2019s end, when he tries to bring the majority of them together in a series of vignettes. Characters pop up for a little while, disappear for hundreds of pages (in a book just under 300 pages long), then come back, speaking in vague, motivational platitudes. The middle section of the book consists of Jeffrey frantically racing from plot strand to plot strand, to the point where Shine devotes less attention to the changing psyche of his hero than he should.\nAt first, Jeffrey is a trying character for a first-person narrator. His general approach to life is to mope and be skeptical of anything that might come his way. Shine tries to trace the course of how Jeffrey goes from being a guy who turns off everyone around him\u2014including his wife and kids\u2014to the guy in whom everybody sees something vital. Unfortunately, Jeffrey wouldn\u2019t recognize something vital in himself if it were tap-dancing, so this results in lots of scenes where a random character struts in from some out-of-the-way location and says \u201cYou\u2019re really getting it together, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Which runs counter to the way Jeffrey seems to be falling apart in his own head.\nBut Shine\u2019s talent for relating humorous vignettes keeps the book from going entirely off the rails. Read less as a cohesive novel and more as a collection of little humorous pieces that just coincidentally feature the same characters, the book works much better. Jeffrey\u2019s assorted adventures\u2014particularly when he\u2019s working for a shady man who runs an odd-job operation around south Florida\u2014all have their own rises and falls, and Shine is good at sneaking sly jokes into the course of the narrative. They aren\u2019t laugh-out-loud jokes, but nearly every page will surely provoke a smiles.\nShine also has an ace in the hole: His portrayal of how Jeffrey\u2019s unemployment causes problems in his marriage to the lovely but slowly fraying Anna is often marvelous, and Shine doesn\u2019t bother bringing it to an unrealistic resolution. Anna is a fantastic character, particularly because Jeffrey seems as interested in figuring out what makes her tick as Shine clearly is, and every time she\u2019s on the page and sparring with Jeffrey, the novel comes to life. As a chronicle of American unemployment, Nothing Happens leaves much to be desired. As a tale of a marriage in distress, it offers a bevy of riches."}

This is the first time these two cars have ever been together in one place, unless you\u2019re playing Forza with your mom, and you\u2019ve chosen the old Ferrari to give her an advantage because she\u2019ll probably hit the wall more often than the puck in an ice hockey game.\nBut you probably have a few questions about my Skyline\u2019s museum appearance. For example: what kind of museum displays a middle-aged Japanese car? Why is my Skyline in a museum? How exactly do you get your car displayed in a museum? And most importantly: who plays Forza with their mom? I\u2019ll be tackling all these challenging queries and more in today\u2019s column.\nLet\u2019s start with: What kind of museum displays a middle-aged Japanese car? The answer is: an awesome one.

If there\u2019s a fire, they will not be saving my Skyline first.\nSo why the hell would a museum with a legitimate, impressive collection of multi-million dollar cars want my 1990 Nissan, which includes a) a mini-disc player, and b) roughly the same amount of alloy wheel curb rash as a sorority girl\u2019s 328i?\nWell, you see, my Skyline is playing an integral part in the museum\u2019s Legends of Japan display, which includes a wide range of the most exciting, enjoyable, seminal Japanese cars ever made, and also that CRX. There\u2019s a Subaru Impreza 22B, a Lexus LFA, a Toyota 2000GT, a perfect Mark IV Toyota Supra, a gorgeous 1993 Mazda RX-7, and several other highly unique vehicles, including my Skyline. This is an excellent display, and if you\u2019re in the Philadelphia area, you should certainly check it out, and then send me a picture of my car so I can be certain that it\u2019s still silver.\nNow on to the more pressing question of how the hell your do you get your car in a museum? Here\u2019s the general overview: as some of you know, I occasionally write for a website called Jalopnik, which is an online community for people who turn their heads when a Saab 9-4X passes by.\nAnyway: one of those interesting characters is my friend Joe, who works for the Simeone Museum.

{"idx": "3754", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Sales of newly built homes rose to their highest level in five years in May, according to numbers compiled by the U.S. Census, but those numbers are at risk of being wrong. They are based on signed contracts, not closings, for homes, many of which have not yet been built. Those contracts were signed well before a huge spike in mortgage rates, and those closings could be up to nine months away, when the homes are completed.\n\"We've been talking a lot with salespeople across the country to get a read on the current situation,\" says Stephen East, a home building analyst with ISI Group. \"Sales people are very worried about it. Customers are worried that they cannot yet lock in, and they are watching the rates get away from them. I do think cancellations will climb.\"\nThe 100 basis point move higher affects the monthly payment by 13 percent, according to East.\n\"That can be make or break to many buyers,\" he adds.\nOf the sales contracts signed in May, according to numbers compiled by California-based analyst Mark Hanson, 31 percent were for completed homes, so buyers likely would have locked in their mortgage rates near record lows. Those deals would close easily. And 24 percent were for homes under construction. Some buyers may have locked in a rate if the home was almost done, but some likely did not.\nThe biggest risk is with the rest of the contracts. Of the signed contracts in May, 36 percent were for homes that were not yet started. Completion and closing would be anywhere from three to nine months out. Those buyers, in most cases, could not lock in mortgage rates yet. Rates are up a full percentage point from the beginning of May and continue to rise.\n\"Bottom line, 70 percent of all May 'sales' are suspect with respect to locked mortgage financing, which is a key metric to how much the buyer can pay for the house,\" says Hanson.\n\"Not all of these will fall out. Some will move to a higher-risk adjustable rate mortgages in order to save the deal. However, builder sales fall-out will spike and the May new home \"sales\" number will be revised sharply lower unless rates comply or builders help to soften the blow of the house being 20 percent more expensive to own than originally thought.\"\nStephen Paul, of Mid-Atlantic Homes, a small private builder based in Maryland, says he is now getting calls from concerned customers asking about rate locks.\n\"The challenge of course for a loan lock for a home that's under construction is that they never know when they are going to actually have their closing dates,\" says Paul. \"The cost of doing a loan lock up to nine months runs 2 1/2 points and a lock for three months is 1/2 point, so people are trying to judge on whether they want to invest in that loan lock.\"\nLengthy loan locks could cost buyers thousands of extra dollars, which on the lower end might not be affordable and could scuttle the deal. While some builders can complete a home in 100 days, labor constraints have been slowing construction across the industry.\n\"A lot of the sub-contractors are seeing an increase in business, yet they're reluctant to hire staff or have an inability to hire skilled labor, so we're seeing delays with framers coming onto our properties to frame the houses, we're seeing challenges with drywall finishers and painters,\" says Paul.\nMany builders are also seeing supply constraints, as they did not expect to see such a surge in demand. Demand is strong in large part because there is such a small supply of existing homes for sale"}
{"idx": "3755", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For the first time in a decade, a bipartisan climate bill is on the table in Congress. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act would institute a national carbon tax. If it passes (and that\u2019s a giant if) the money would be returned to American households, meaning that each of us could get a nice check for about $500 each year.\nThe bill was proposed last week by a collection of members of the U.S. House of Representatives from the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. And it\u2019s pretty ambitious for legislation with support from both sides of the aisle. If Congress passed the proposal next year, it would put the U.S. on track to outdo promises the Obama administration made as part of the Paris climate agreement, according to analysis from Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\nBut again, please don\u2019t hold your breath. Pigs will fly before the 2019 U.S. Senate passes a carbon tax and President Trump (\u201cIt\u2019s cold! Whatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d) signs it into law. So if this legislation isn\u2019t going anywhere, what\u2019s the point of putting it out there?\nAccording to a handful of experts, Deutch has a point. Even if the proposal dies, it could bear fruit down the road.\nPaul Sabin, professor of history and American studies at Yale University, points to the DREAM Act as an example. The proposal was introduced in 2001 to offer a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants. Congress failed to pass it, and the many attempts that followed. But President Obama, frustrated by these failures, signed an executive order to protect the Dreamers in 2012. The template was already established, even if it didn\u2019t pass in its original form.\nThe Affordable Care Act was also the result of decades of refinement. Consider the Clinton health care reform plan from 1993. That died in Congress, but it tested the waters and provided valuable lessons for the Obama proposal that eventually passed in 2010.\nIn other words, the proposed carbon tax could provide something just as useful \u2014 a template for future legislation, says Columbia\u2019s Kaufman.\n\u201cAs of a few years ago, no one was really talking about a federal carbon tax,\u201d he says. This year has already brought a couple carbon-tax proposals from conservatives, including one from Florida Representative Carlos Curbelo which went nowhere. Another was floated by a bipartisan organization called Americans for Carbon Dividends.\nSo why would the Climate Solutions Caucus bring forth another plan now? It could be a response to the midterm elections, when many Republican representatives who spoke out on climate were voted out of office \u2014 including Curbelo (a Grist 50er), Barbara Comstock of Virginia, and John Faso of New York. The remaining caucus members \u201cwant to make a bold statement that bipartisanship in the climate space is not over,\u201d says Megan Mullin, associate professor of environmental politics at Duke.\nOther factors could be playing a role. The National Climate Assessment came out just before the Deutch plan was announced, predicting widespread consequences for all regions of the United States. And with the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d backers pushing the Democratic Party for ultra-progressive legislation, conservative-leaning politicians might worry that they\u2019re going to be left out of the conversation.\nAlthough any debate over climate action may be framed as a fight between progressives and moderates, there\u2019s middle ground between the Green New Deal and market-mechanism approaches.

In this segment, Joe Magyer, Chief Investment Officer at Lakehouse Capital and regular contributor to Fool Australia, talks to Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp about why you shouldn't get wrapped up in an investment premise that \"everyone\" agrees on.\nAlison Southwick: So that was the BRIC. A lot of articles I read lately say the BRIC is dead, but they somehow turn it into a pun.\nSouthwick: So what's the lesson here going forward? If there is one at all.\nRobert Brokamp: Yeah, when everyone is agreeing on an investment premise, it probably means that the money has already been made, and it's not necessarily the best place to be. Then it turned for the BRICs, and they did not do so well, and then everyone hated them. Well, what's been the best-performing country so far this year? Brazil, because after a few years of being among the worst countries, everyone hated it, and everyone talked about how the BRICs were falling apart. That's probably the time to start buying.\nMagyer: Honestly, it really is great.

Comic book fans might recall that Greg Berlanti is no stranger to the DC Universe. He created the superhero family drama No Ordinary Family and also wrote and produced Green Lantern (though you shouldn't hold that against him). Comic book and TV scribe Andrew Kreisberg, who has written for Fringe, has signed on to write the pilot episode of the show.\nHaving his own TV show w0uld be a fitting development for Booster Gold, whose gimmick involves being a fame-hungry time traveler who uses future technology to become a modern-day superhero. Booster Gold was played by Eric Martsolf in Smallville, and alongside fellow superhero Blue Beetle proved to be popular with fans. Gold was also an important character in DC's Flashpoint comic book event, which preceded the company's New 52 relaunch.\nThe Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the news, notes that Syfy has only ordered a script for the show, not a full pilot. However, given the potential for the character, as well as the overwhelming popularity of comic book properties with mainstream audiences, I wouldn't be surprised to see Syfy move forward with the series, eventually.\nWhile I've liked him as comic relief, I've never been a big fan of Booster Gold as a serious character. He's definitely grown on me over the last year though, because of his unique backstory. The concept of a flashy, egotistical superhero from the future has a lot of potential for a TV series, particularly because, as THR writes, \"the future doesn\u2019t happen without first protecting the present.\"\nTo those Booster Gold fans out there, what would you like to see in this TV series?

What are the circumstances that brought Jon Snow (Kit Harington), Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) and the Seven Kingdoms' other heroes and villains into their current conflicts? Look no further than Series Regular for the answers to those questions and more, as the final season unfolds.\n1. A New Beginning. For the first time since the launch of the series, Game of Thrones radically altered its opening credits sequence. While the drama still begins with a crawl across Westeros, the focus has narrowed on granular details: Winterfell and King's Landing, up close and personal. Exciting enough on its own, but is there more to be gleaned from the change? The speculation begins at the 1:25 mark.\n2. The Power of the Past. In \"Winterfell,\" the action begins with the arrival of a queen from the south. Sound familiar? It should: \"Winter is Coming,\" the series premiere, featured a very similar story arc as King Robert (Mark Addy) and company came to visit House Stark. There are callbacks to the first episode littered throughout the final season premiere. Is it pure nostalgia fuel, or something more? Not to spoil the podcast, but\u2026it's something more. Lean more about that something at the 4:05 mark.\n3. The Mad Queen. Heading into the final season, the official Hollywood Reporter prediction on the field sees Daenerys Targaryen winning the Iron Throne. After watching \"Winterfell,\" however? Maybe not so much. The series wants viewers to question Daenerys' readiness for the task, and as such, the question is very much engaged in this week's Series Regular, starting at the 7:50 mark.\n4. The Night King. The White Walkers' ruthless ruler was missing from the season premiere, but his handiwork was all over the penultimate act. (Pour one out for Ned Umber, the young lord of Last Hearth.) In his first act of violence in Westeros proper, the Night King issued a stern warning to those who stand in his way \u2014 and according to some corners of the Thrones fandom, the warning tips off the Night King's true Targaryen purpose. But does it really? We take aim at the truth around the 16:00 mark.\n5. The Raven and the Lion. The final season premiere ends with one of its most powerful callbacks of all: a reunion between Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Both actors spoke with The Hollywood Reporter following the season premiere (here and here for reference), and it's worth taking a beat to connect their respective insights. What should we expect from the next episode, based on where we left Bran and Jaime in the premiere? The speculation begins at the "}

Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan to lift an injunction that had barred Argentina from paying its creditors and eventually led the country to default in 2014.\nThe ruling caps years of bitter legal wrangling that goes back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on nearly $100 billion of bonds. A small group of holdout investors, including the hedge fund billionaire Paul E. Singer, refused to take part in two debt restructurings by Argentina since then.\nIn March, the United States government weighed in on the battle, lending its support to Argentina in a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d or amicus curiae brief.\nArgentina is now poised to raise more than $12 billion through bond sales, the proceeds of which will pay its holdout creditors. Top officials from Argentina will travel to New York and other American cities this week to meet with potential investors.\n\u201cThis is going to be settled next week,\u201d Alfonso Prat-Gay, Argentina\u2019s economy minister, told journalists in New York, where he is pitching Argentina\u2019s multibillion bond sale to investors, according to news media reports in Argentina. Mr. Prat-Gay, according to the reports, said Argentina would issue the bonds on Monday and Tuesday and that the holdout creditors would receive payment by Friday.\nOn Feb. 29, Argentina agreed to pay $4.65 billion to four hedge funds including Mr. Singer\u2019s NML Capital. As part of the deal, Argentina\u2019s Legislature had to repeal domestic laws that prevented the government from paying the holdouts, which it has now done. Argentina was also required to pay the investors by April 14, after which the hedge funds could walk away from the deal.\nDuring the nearly two-hour hearing on Wednesday morning, lawyers for some of the hedge funds explained that they would be willing to extend the deadline by a few days since Argentina would probably not be able to raise all the money by the original deadline.\nArgentina asked that Judge Griesa\u2019s original injunction be lifted after it made an offer to pay $6.5 billion to settle lawsuits from other holdout bondholders on Feb. 5. There are still some disgruntled bondholders who were not part of the $4.65 billion deal with the four hedge funds. They have argued that they will receive far worse terms if they agree to Argentina\u2019s $6.5 billion proposal."}

Get ready to wield the Heavy Splatling Deco while visiting the Kelp Dome.\nDuring this week's Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that two new weapons and two new maps would soon arrive in Splatoon 2. One of those weapons and one of those maps is set to arrive at 7 p.m. PT this very evening, so get ready to dive back into the Nintendo Switch game that just keeps on giving. Seriously, these free updates have been constant, and this latest one is sure to especially please fans of the original Splatoon.\nWhile I missed out on the first Splatoon, folks who played that Wii U exclusive have been begging for a return to Kelp Dome. Splatoon 2 already boasts a couple of re-imaginings of older maps, but this is the one that kept popping up in conversations across various forums.\nThis evening, Kelp Dome will finally join the Splatoon 2 map rotation and, according to Gamespot, it'll boast a few new twists including extra grates connecting the various sections. Those grates offer a fun spin on strategy, as players can freely shoot through them. In other words, whether you're running across a catwalk or inking turf below, you've got to keep verticality in mind if you want to avoid having someone surprise you.\nAlong with that new map, players will also get their hands on the Heavy Splatling Deco weapon tonight. If you're a high enough level, all you'll need to do to pick it up is drop by the Ammo Knight shop in the plaza and purchase it with the in-game currency you've been earning.\nApparently, the gun works the same way as the Heavy Splatling already in the game, but its sub-weapon and special ability are different. Also, the gun itself is totally bejeweled, for those of you who want to look fresh. The sub-weapon with this version is a Splash Wall, which creates a temporary barrier to help control the flow of battle. The special ability is the recently released Bubble Blower, which lets you fling a trio of ink bubbles into the world. If your team shoots them enough, they explode with oodles of ink.\nNintendo also announced the next duo of updates, though no release date has been revealed. A new Snapper Canal map will be coming at some point in the future, which features a dangerous river flowing between the two sides of the map. And then there's the Tenta Brella, which creates a rather massive ink-blocking barrier."}

Metro Denver got light rail; Boulder will be jumping straight to light-speed tubes with cars in pods.\nArrivo is a startup based in Los Angeles and headed by former SpaceX design engineer Brogan BamBrogan. His name combines his last name with his wife Bambi's first. Cute!\nThe Colorado Department of Transportation has given them space near E-470 to build a half-mile of test track. The state has also agreed to give them up to $760,000 in grants over five years if they meet certain criteria and also receive matching funds from local governments. Arrivo is planning to invest $10-$15 million for the test track and R&D center. With all that money the sky's the limit on what they can accomplish.\nIt is important for us to think big about our transportation problem, but to invest in more mature technologies. Brogan and Bambi are living in a fantasy world. In their world, CDOT is a cutting-edge organization with vast resources to spend and the citizens of Colorado readily support paying for transportation infrastructure.\nIn the real world, we spent years adding one HOV lane in each direction to the Denver-Boulder Turnpike and had to sell it to a private company to pay for it.\nArrivo could provide a solution to Front Range transportation problems or become the antecedent to yet another Front Range transportation cautionary tale.\nBetween 1908 and 1926 we had a perfectly good trolley line between Denver and Boulder run by the Denver & Interurban Railroad that was put out of business by the automobile/highway cartel.\nFrom 1947 to the mid-'70s we had the Denver-Boulder Bus Company that did a workmanlike job of moving folks around until it was subsumed by RTD.\nAs the folks who will pay for and maybe use transportation solutions, we need to remember that we continue to pay a RTD tax for a rail line from Denver to Boulder that will not happen during our lifetimes. RTD asked for the money for the Northwest Rail Line (NRL), got it, and then failed miserably to complete their part of the bargain. Additionally, in spite of a long history of gobbling money at the tax trough, RTD is now in debt for a little less than $4 billion that will further impede the NRL.\nTwo points: First, a transit system between Boulder and Denver has never been particularly profitable. Even if Arrivo's system materializes, we may keep driving and not use it. Second, it's fine to use tax dollars as seed money for companies to test transportation ideas, but the next time we implement a grand transportation plan like NRL, the way forward must be clear and achievable.\nE-470 was fully completed in 2003.

The day before, armed gunmen in the Sinai had kidnapped Egyptian soldiers on their way to Cairo. To express their dissatisfaction with the deteriorating security conditions in the area, the Egyptian personnel at the Rafah terminal called for a strike leaving Gazans stranded on both sides of the border. While the border finally opened after the release of the Egyptian soldiers, Palestinians in Gaza have since been pensively watching and wondering the fate of their seemingly only lifeline to the outside world.\nAs Gaza got wind of the planned protests on June 30th, most knew that tumultuous times loomed ahead. For some time before the demonstrations, fewer and fewer Palestinians were allowed to register to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing. On June 22nd, owing to a \u2018system failure\u2019 thousands were refused entry into Egypt. As of now, Egyptian officials have completely closed the border citing security concerns in the Sinai. The tunnels, now an institutionalized mode for the transportations of goods and people, were also largely inactive in the days leading up and after the protests. At the same, the Egyptian army seemed to be in \u2018combat mode\u2019 in Sinai. In a region still scarred by the memories of Mubarak-era atrocities, the armed forces were prepared to quell any violence that may erupt as a spin-off from the opposition protests. Regular army patrol of the border region was, according to locals, \u201ca normal occurrence.\u201d Simultaneously, the road between Cairo and Rafah was also dotted with armed vehicles, tanks and army staffed check points making sure that Palestinians in Egypt hadn\u2019t crossed in illegally through the tunnels.\nWith the demise of Egypt\u2019s first elected president and the Muslim Brotherhood from the helm of the country\u2019s politics, Gaza has seemingly lost an important partner. In keeping with his policies towards Egypt\u2019s own Islamist opposition, Mubarak had concertedly shunned the then new Hamas-led administration in Gaza and had choked the Strip\u2019s population of essential resources and mobility. Morsi in power was a welcome respite. Hailing from the Muslim Brotherhood, he forged an almost natural alliance with Hamas, historically an offshoot of the Brotherhood\u2019s branch in the Gaza Strip. Showing contempt for the previous regime\u2019s policies of effective-siege of Gaza, Morsi was able to open the Rafah crossing and had, to a large extent, eased the crippling impact of border closures. In Morsi and the Brotherhood, Hamas also found a key partner and interlocutor, that was seemingly on \u2018its side\u2019 during negotiations.\nWhile Hamas officials have insisted that the ouster of Morsi will have little impact on the Islamic Resistance and the Gaza Strip, a long and treacherous path lies ahead for its search for a new partner in Cairo. For months the anti-Morsi clique has ridden on the waves of growing anti-Palestine sentiments in Egypt. Hamas and its cadets have been blamed for several instances of violence in the Sinai, for attempting to violate the sovereignty of Egypt and for sending in fighters from Gaza to prop up the Morsi regime. While the evidence behind these allegations remain \u2018thin\u2019 at best, Egyptians have kept suspicious eye on their Palestinian neighbors.

Charles and Anatole both think the dollar rally will continue, though Anatole thinks it will not strengthen against the euro.\nLouis has a more nuanced opinion, which I'll quote in full.\nIt all depends on what happens to return on invested capital. Whether the US dollar rises or falls will be the primary driver of performance for almost any asset class in 2017.\nIf no, then the dollar falls back, US equities underperform, and emerging market debt outperforms big-time.\nIs it at the expense of ROIC outside the US (i.e., protectionism)? If so, then the concern is that we are seeing a rearrangement of the post-World War II world order. In this case, the US will no longer be willing to provide excess liquidity when needed through a widening current account deficit. Investors should start worrying about a global depression and consider buying long-dated treasuries pretty soon.\nIs it through tax cuts and deregulation? If so, then real rates should rise, and the whole world will grow faster. In this environment, sell all assets that have done well from financial engineering, scarcity assets (gold, art, collectibles), and private equity; and buy cyclicals and financials everywhere.\nSo far, the market is clearly pricing in this latter scenario.\nI agree with this logic, and I think the full answer is still pending. In my view, people are focusing too much on President-elect Trump's rhetoric and not enough on his actions.\nYes, he intends to demand better trade terms from other countries, but I think his threats are mostly a negotiating tactic. He has placed fellow deal-maker Wilbur Ross in charge of trade negotiations because he wants to make deals.\nThey will favor the US more than current arrangements do. However, Trump and Ross don't expect to get everything they demand. They will make deals that promote US employment without rearranging the post-war order, as Louis calls it.\nTax cuts and deregulation are a bigger question mark, mainly because they must go through Congress. We are already seeing substantial division on the Republican side on other issues.\nThe sausage making could easily end somewhere far short of what markets currently expect.\nThis wildly popular newsletter by celebrated economic commentator, John Mauldin, is a must-read for informed investors who want to go beyond the mainstream media hype and find out about the trends and traps to watch out for.

However, unfortunately it has a negative impact on our hunting industry.\"\nA executive member of the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa, Rudman says the game industry annually contributes between five and seven billion rand (up to 908 million dollars, 745 million euros) to the economy.\nHunts are usually booked in advance with deposits paid but trips over the World Cup were called off for reasons ranging from congested airports, worries over transporting rifles, higher accommodation costs and inflated airfares.\nSome operators have tried to entice football fans with special World Cup hunt packages, like Rudman, whose family business is offering a three-night package for 6,800 rand for two trophies.\n\"The soccer fans are not fellows who are really hunters. We have had interest, we are having a few hunters coming through, but it's not an avalanche,\" said Rudman.\n\"We haven't got the quantities that we should have in the middle of our hunting season which is June and July. I think we are going to be down 30 percent overall for the year.\"\nThe clients have postponed until 2011 but the gaps this year come after the global recession that saw foreign bookings in 2009 fall by 20 percent.\n\"At the end of the day, we could be in the region of 40 to 50 percent down on 2008 figures,\" estimates Rudman, who has been running hunts since 1978.\nHunting is big business in several parts of South Africa which is home to Africa's big five: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino.\n\"We also had a lot of cancellations,\" said Werner van der Walt of Cheetau Safaris, an operator in the central Free State region which charges 35,000 dollars for a large male lion trophy.\n\"Our main business is lion hunting.

But as shoppers at a South Philadelphia Acme recently found out, the prepared foods can carry a risk, including contracting hepatitis A.\nOn Saturday, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health issued a warning to shoppers who bought precut fruit and vegetables at an Acme at 1400 E. Passyunk Ave. between March 17 and 29, encouraging them to get the hepatitis A vaccine as soon as possible. One of the employees at the store was being treated for the highly contagious viral liver infection.\nThe hepatitis virus can be spread when individuals don\u2019t wash their hands after using the bathroom or by eating contaminated food. There are no medications to treat the illness and the best method of protection is the vaccine, officials said.\nAcme has waived any insurance co-pays and provided the vaccine for free for customers without insurance, said Dana Ward, a spokesperson for the grocery.\nThe incident is one of a number of recent foodborne illnesses reported throughout the country including those for E. coli, salmonella, and listeria.\nBut before you swear off the precut foods, there are some things to keep in mind and precautions you can take, said Martin Bucknavage, a senior food-safety extension associate with Penn State Extension.\n\u201cWe see these cases and think so many people have gotten sick,\u201d said Bucknavage. But given how many people are eating meals, and how often, we really don\u2019t have a lot of issues, he said.\nGenerally, food operations do have good sanitary policies in place. Food is washed before it is cut up, and measures \u2014 such as employees wearing gloves \u2014 are used to prevent contamination before food is put in containers to be sold, he said.\nFruits and vegetables are so important for overall nutrition, he said, that you don\u2019t want to avoid them over a small risk.\n\u201cThere are ways to avoid the risk,\u201d Bucknavage said. If you are still concerned, purchase whole fruits and vegetables and wash and prepare them at home.\nAlways buy from a reputable food source such as a licensed grocery or food truck.\nMake sure the fruits and vegetables are cold and stored in a cooler.\nCheck to see if the eatery has good handwashing policies in place and if those preparing the food are wearing gloves.\nMake sure the establishment has a food-safety-certified person and the required employee training.\nSign up for grocery customer cards, which companies use to communicate any food recalls or health warnings.\nBucknavage said there is ongoing discussion in the food-safety industry about whether to require the hepatitis vaccine for workers.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not currently recommend all food handlers receive the vaccine, since most outbreaks involve those who use illicit drugs or are homeless.\nSince 1996, the vaccine has been recommended for children. But many adults remain susceptible, the agency reported.\nRequiring vaccination for food handlers would be tough, said Bucknavage. Many smaller operations are constantly turning over workers and there would be issues over who pays for the vaccine, and how it would be enforced.\n\u201cWhen you make a rule, you have to stick to the rule,\u201d he said."}

{"idx": "3837", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the early 1990s, Republicans turned Ronald Reagan into an icon; they hailed him for \u201cwinning the Cold War;\u201d they used his name to put conservatism beyond challenge. But this deification was hollow, a reality that today\u2019s thoughtful conservatives, like the Independent Institute\u2019s Ivan Eland, recognize.\nAs usual, at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), speaker after speaker idolized the stylized image of Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, humans believe images, which often diverge from reality; that\u2019s why advertising on TV works. The same is true in politics.\nAnd since politics depends heavily on selling yourself, accusations from the Left were misplaced that Reagan, as a mere actor, was not qualified to be president. Since William McKinley, the president\u2019s main role is that of cheerleader-in-chief (it is another illusion that the charismatic Teddy Roosevelt pioneered the president\u2019s use of the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d), using the media to go over the heads of members of Congress to sell his policies to the American public.\nThus, given this relatively recent primary presidential role and that Reagan had been an actor, Reagan was possibly the most qualified man ever to hold the modern presidency. He was an expert at creating an image, that of a conservative, and getting everyone to believe it.\nYet during the last years of his presidency, 1986 to 1988, most conservatives were furious at Reagan for having sold out the movement. Reagan\u2019s image, however, benefited from the presidency of Bill Clinton, ironically a man who was in some respects more conservative than the Gipper. During the Clinton presidency, certain Republican operatives dusted off an idolized Reagan image and began using it to attack Clinton.\nMoreover, Reagan came in second among post-Truman presidents in average annual increases in the number of federal civilian employees in the executive branch as a portion of the population, exceeded only by the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson period.\nReagan is most famous as a tax cutter; yet Reagan is last among post-World War II Republicans in reducing average annual taxes as a percentage of GDP. Although he did reduce taxes as a portion of GDP slightly, his spending increases as a percentage of GDP rendered his net tax cuts largely fraudulent.\nThus, he ran big federal deficits, thus tripling the national debt and turning the U.S. from being the largest creditor into being the largest debtor nation. He was number one in post-Truman presidents in increasing average annual debt as a proportion of GDP.\nWhen these uncomfortable facts are noted, Reaganophiles usually then fall back to the position that he had to adopt such ruinous fiscal policies to build up military spending in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union and win the Cold War. The problem with this line of reasoning, and the corollary that especially Reagan\u2019s spending on the Star Wars missile defense program made the Soviet Union insolvent, don\u2019t square with the facts.\nEven senior members of the Reagan administration\u2019s national security team, for example, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Frank Carlucci, Cap Weinberger, and Jack Matlock, later admitted that Reagan had no master plan to bring down the USSR. Reagan\u2019s close ally, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, also concurred that the Gipper had no goal to topple the Soviet Union.\nNations as powerful as the USSR rarely succumb to foreign pressure, but instead usually change mainly from domestic causes; the Soviet Union was no exception.

That changed after the White House said it didn't want tax increases next year, so the rate was raised and the effective date delayed until 2013.\nIt would still raise an estimated $452.8 billion over 10 years, enough to pay for Obama's jobs plan. An estimated 317,000 people, less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, would be subject to the surtax.\nThe plan has a positive political effect for Democrats, bringing them together under a tax increase plan.

Democrats control 53 of the 100 seats.\nObama said the White House was open for negotiations with congressional Republicans, but that he'd tried to bargain for more than two years without success.\n\"I have gone out of my way in every instance \u2014 sometimes at my own political peril and to the frustration"}

Presumably, users will be able to access these services from the Camera Roll and Photos app within iOS to push media out to their friends. While The Wall Street Journal didn't mention it, there's also the possibility Apple might introduce AirDrop for iOS, which would gel well with the \"with other iPhone users\" part of the report.\nIn previous versions of iOS, Apple has included Facebook and Twitter integration for sharing statuses, photos, and more, from across the mobile operating system. Now, it makes sense for Marissa Mayer's (Yahoo) Flickr and high-quality video network Vimeo to join the fray. Why wouldn't we see Google's YouTube integrated throughout iOS?

Shouldn't the Polk Award Lydia Polgreen accepted last week for her courageous and incisive coverage of Darfur fill us with the same pride as the honors handed out today? How is it that Tyler Hicks was voted Newspaper Photographer of the Year by a jury of leading American picture editors, but neither Tyler nor any of our amazing photo staff is a finalist for today's prizes?\nI don't mean to sound ungrateful. I'm just saying prizes, like newspapers, are put out by human beings.\nNo, Bill, you don't sound ungrateful at all. Not at all.

By next April we will be settled into a new home, and, presumably, whining and kvetching about the facilities.

The move comes just in the nick of time, since we had pretty much filled up the hallway up on the 11th floor.\nBefore we get to the good news, I'd like to say what I say every year, come rain or come shine. Prizes are not the reason we do what we do, and they are not the most important measure of what we do. They are nice to get and very nice to get, but there is a long honor roll of world-class journalists \u2014 some of them standing in this room right now \u2014 who have not been singled out for a Pulitzer \u2014 at least, not yet.\nThis year the resourcefulness, intelligence and artistry of our journalists has been acknowledged with a cascade of prizes \u2014 the Polk, the Overseas Press Club, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, professional associations of business editors and sportswriters, photographers and graphic artists, and so on.\nOkay, that's enough cloud. On to the silver lining.\nThis year we had three Pulitzer finalists \u2014 two of them emanating from that engine of excellence known as the Metro Desk.\nIn the explanatory category, The NYT Staff was a finalist for our national wake-up call on the epidemic of diabetes. Sonny Kleinfield, Richard Perez-Pena, Marc Santora and Ian Urbina kicked off the year with an eye-opening series, and throughout the year we had contributions from other departments, accompanied by great video narratives and slide shows that brought the problem vividly to life.\nIn the commentary category, Joe Nocera was a finalist in his first full year as a Times business columnist. Joe's tough-minded and richly reported columns have made him a destination for those in business, those interested in business, and anyone who just love a good, thoughtful story, beautifully told.\nOur Pulitzer winner this year, in the feature-writing category, is Andrea Elliott. Andrea won for taking us into a Brooklyn mosque and illuminating the life of an imam in America. Her series was a thrilling piece of journalism \u2014 an intimate tour of a world we ought to know better. Her writing was clean and clear without glossing over the complexities. It was humanizing"}

It said that officials should be closely examined to insure that they are not merely mouthing revolutionary language but actually practicing it.\n''In choosing people, in assigning people, in educating people, we must take a revolutionary outlook as the prerequisite, to insure that party and Government leaders at every level are loyal to Marxism,'' the paper quoted the party leader, Jiang Zemin, as saying.\nThe commentary was a reinterpretation of the previous commitment to ''si hua,'' roughly translatable as the ''four changes.'' The four changes, widely heralded in the early 1980's and written into the 1982 party constitution, aimed to make party officials more revolutionary, more youthful, more educated and more competent.\nAt the time the four changes were promoted, however, they were used by China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, as a way of easing the revolutionary old guard out of power.\nIt is not clear, however, how seriously the editorial should be taken as a sign of the mood or direction of the leadership. The publisher and editor of People's Daily were replaced in June, and the newspaper is now regarded as in the hands of hard-liners. There have been mixed signals from the leadership in recent months, possibly reflecting a power struggle.\nIn general, language in the official press has been more restrained in the last month. Even the article today did not use particularly harsh language, despite its hard-line position.\nIn arguing today that a revolutionary outlook was a prerequisite in promoting party officials, People's Daily was leaning toward the Maoist view that it is better for cadres to be ''red'' than ''expert.'' In contrast, for most of the last decade, with occasional exceptions in recent months, the accent has been on expertise rather than ideology."}

According to the company, the classic hip-hop format is safe.\nThe original KDAY at 1580 AM was the station that did the groundwork for the format that eventually landed on 95.5 FM, known at one time as KFOX. The original 1580/KDAY had great success in the late 1970s and early 1980s playing hip-hop and rap music that previously had never made it to commercial radio stations anywhere else. It truly was a trendsetter. That KDAY featured a staff of some phenomenal DJs that included one of my all-time favorites, J.J. Johnson, and \u201cKing News,\u201d aka legendary newsman (and current voice of Tony the Tiger in commercials) Lee Marshall.\nThe problem with KDAY today is the limited signal.

In contrast Mr. O\u2019Malley proposed \u201can aggressive goal \u2014 to give every student and their family the opportunity to go to college debt-free,\u201d said Lis Smith, his deputy campaign manager.\nHillary is Hillary, so I\u2019m sure when this is announced it will be accompanied by a detailed policy paper that makes a very good case for how it can work. My initial reaction is that it sounds kind of complicated, and I wonder if this kind of incentive can really keep states from finding ways to spend less and less on higher education. Will tuition costs go down only to be replaced by ever-increasing \u201cfees\u201d?\nAt the same time, this is pretty carefully crafted to appeal to multiple constituencies. It will appeal to middle-class voters by guaranteeing that tuition costs at state universities will be kept to a reasonable level. But it will also appeal to low-income voters with little chance of sending their kids to college. They probably wonder why taxpayers should subsidize a free education for mostly middle-income kids who are going to use that education to make more money after they graduate. Clinton has threaded this needle by insisting that families still have to contribute and students should work at least part-time.\nI doubt this will become a major campaign issue. However, it will cost $350 billion over ten years, and Democrats have to be careful about how many programs like this they propose. Once you put a price tag on them, Republicans can start adding up the damages and asking where the money will come from. In this case, Clinton says it will come from effectively raising taxes on the rich, but that can only go so far. If she has very many more of these programs to announce, eventually middle-class families will have to shoulder some of the bill. That\u2019s catnip for Republicans."}

Outside groups, led by the Kochs, pumped a few million into the district, largely hitting Sink over Obamacare, which she said needed to be improved although she still trumpeted its benefits for senior citizens.\nRepublicans will say more: that they had a flawed candidate in Jolly, a former lobbyist; that Barack Obama carried this district in 2012. The Republicans won\u2019t say that Obama carried it over Mitt Romney by just 2 percent, and this is the very definition of a swing district. But both of these statements are factual, and Republicans will spin them hard today and tomorrow.\nMost of all, Republican spin doctors will say this is a bellwether: The Democrats put loads of money and troops into Sink\u2019s race, precisely to prove (in a winnable district) that 2014 wasn\u2019t going to be a disaster for them. They still couldn\u2019t win it, which, the GOP will say, just demonstrates what a bruisin\u2019 Democrats are cruisin\u2019 for this fall.\nNo denying, they might be right. For one thing, this was one of the few Republican-held House districts (held by lifer Bill Young, whose death necessitated this special) the Democrats had a shot at taking. So on that basis alone, it\u2019s a blow to whatever remote shot Nancy Pelosi had of moving back into the Speaker\u2019s office.\nIt would be absurd to deny that Obamacare, wasn\u2019t a factor the race and maybe the crucial one. The outside groups went big on it, no doubt about that. But there were other issues in this race. Jolly attacked Sink for using a state plane to \u201cget to a vacation in the Bahamas.\u201d Politifact judged the Jolly ad half-true, but in congressional campaigns, half-true is usually true enough. The ad had bite, and that surely made some difference too. It seems to be the case that the lion\u2019s share of the undecided swing voters broke for Jolly late in the game, and a pile of data suggests that swing voters care about good-government things like the use of state planes. Their minds were probably made up about Obamacare, so it\u2019s not implausible that something else swung them.\nBut there\u2019s no doubt that the issue going forward is going to be health care. What health-care-related lesson is each party going to take out of this? For the Republicans, it\u2019s easy: push push push. And there\u2019s reason for them to do so: Sink, remember, wasn\u2019t in Congress; she didn\u2019t even vote for the thing. Kay Hagan and Mary Landrieu and Mark Begich and all the other vulnerable Senate Democrats defending their seats this fall did.\nThe Democrats are likely to take, as they often do, the wrong lesson. They\u2019ll want to run and hide. But they should look a little more closely. Sink was no warrior for Obamacare. Her campaign was a textbook exercise in trying to thread the needle (unsuccessfully). Does her loss mean that Democrats should run away from it?\nI say no. Let\u2019s watch how this result affects the"}

In a dispute over terms about the wholesale and retail price of e-books, Amazon has blocked pre-orders of Hachette print books, imposed artificial delays and made it more difficult to find the publisher's books in its site's search.\nMore than 900 authors -- many of whom publish with other publishers -- signed an open letter to Amazon appealing for fair treatment of Hachette's books. The signatories are loosely affiliated as Authors United; the letter will appear as a print ad in Sunday's New York Times and is online at authorsunited.net.\nClearly taking its cue from that open letter, Amazon launched its own headlined \"A Message From the Amazon Books Team\" late Friday. In it, it reiterates its claim that \"e-books can and should be less expensive.\" A company representative confirms that the website is an official Amazon statement.\nThe URL is notable, however: It's readersunited.com.\nThe fact that the mammoth online retailer has launched an official statement on a website appearing to represent readers might be called Orwellian doublespeak -- particularly since Amazon's statement leans heavily -- and misleadingly -- on George Orwell himself.\nAmazon begins by citing the advent of World War II and paperbacks, saying that their debut was resisted by major publishers. Amazon writes, \"The famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if 'publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.' Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.\"\nIn fact, as the New York Times has pointed out, Orwell was suggesting a joke. He was all in favor of Penguin's cheap paperbacks, and the above quote is from a review of 10 of them that appeared in the New English Weekly in 1936.\nApart from using more colorful examples (Orwell, World War II), Amazon's statement is not saying anything new. It makes the case that e-books should be $9.99 (here's our analysis of what their numbers are and aren't telling you). It contends that Hachette has placed authors in the middle of the dispute -- one Amazon representative has even told Publishers Weekly that Hachette \"should stop using their authors as human shields.\" (The Authors United signatories disagree, saying it is Amazon that has put authors in the middle).\nWhat Amazon has done differently is issue a call to action. It calls on its supporters to e-mail the chief executive of Hachette, Michael Pietsch, and publicly provided his e-mail address.

According to medical reports, the gruesome procedure conducted by a quack has affected her uterus, resulting in recurring urinary tract infections.\nMary\u2019s family has had to spend thousands of shillings to meet the cost of corrective surgery.\nMary\u2019s case is one of many that have caused health and reproductive rights advocates to demand the gazettement of standards and guidelines on maternal morbidity and mortality that have been finalised by the government.\nThe advocates are accusing the government of dragging its feet as women continue to suffer from unsafe abortions.\nIn 2012, almost 120,000 women were admitted to public hospitals and health centres for abortion-related complications, likely due to unsafe abortions.\nAn estimated 266 Kenyan women die per 100,000 unsafe abortions annually.\nOne key focus of the standards and guidelines is to ensure that health facilities assist women who deserve safe abortion services.\n\u201cThough post-abortion care is accessible in nearly all health facilities, it is the extreme cases that are difficult to manage,\u201d Dr John Ong\u2019ech, a leading reproductive health specialist in Nairobi says.\nHe says unsafe abortion complications that lead to heart, renal or kidney failure can only be managed at Kenyatta National Hospital or Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.\n\u201cThere are no other county hospitals with a dialysis machine or with the capacity for kidney dialysis,\u201d he says.\nReproductive health advocates believe that if the guidelines are adopted, then resources will be allocated to help some of the health facilities to provide these critical services.\nA case has been filed in court demanding the reinstatement of the guidelines. The petitioners are challenging a memo that was issued by the Ministry of Health in 2014 regarding the Standards and Guidelines on safe and legal abortion that were withdrawn by the ministry.\nAccording to the petitioners, the memo further stated that it is illegal for health workers to participate in training on either safe abortion care or the use of the drug Medabon for medical abortion.\nThe memo warned that health professionals who disregard the directive would be slapped with legal and professional sanctions.\nThe memo came shortly after the withdrawal of the ministry\u2019s \u201cStandards and Guidelines for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Unsafe Abortion in Kenya\u201d, adopted in 2012 as part of implementing the Constitution and its abortion provisions.\nThe guidelines, withdrawn nearly a year after they were released, were said to be essential in clarifying when medical professionals could perform safe abortion services under the Constitution.\nThe petitioners in their case argue that the ministry\u2019s actions have created confusion among healthcare workers and denied women access to safe and legal abortion services.\nThey are seeking to have safe abortions as a right recognised by the Constitution, meaning that the government would be obligated to proactively provide an enabling environment to procure a safe abortion.\nThe Constitution states that trained health professionals are allowed to perform safe abortions when the health or life of a pregnant woman is at risk, in cases of emergency, or if allowed by any other written"}

{"idx": "3868", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Quite often when we see traders referring to \u201cprice action\u201d we see them talking about one facet of a chart or one singular part of a price. For example; traders will quite often point out and focus in on the support and resistance zone or an entry candlestick signal such as the Pin Bar Reversal.\nThe best price action traders will look at the overall price action story. Whilst the best traders will have a firm grasp and be able to use all the same points of confluence such as support, resistance and candlesticks signals, they will use these not just by themselves, but rather as one piece of the puzzle.\nSupport and resistance levels make up a very large part of the price action story. These levels determine where price has been in the past and more importantly where it will be able to go in the future. Price action traders reading their charts can plot and learn a lot from marking previous levels.\nAnother key element of the price action story is the current market structure I.e. are there any current trends or are we currently in a range or boxing situation. This may be the most important factor of them all. The biggest edge a trader can have on their side and also the one they most often don\u2019t is the trend!\nThe biggest mistake with the trend is traders think that every market must be always in a trend and the truth is that more often than not most pairs are NOT in trends. More often than not price spends on consolidations and in ranges and in what we call boxing situations. This is where price makes a large move and then moves sideways in a box. This is important to know because if you enter when price is in a box you need to be prepared to sit and wait for price to move sideways.\nThere are many price action entry candles a price action trader can use to enter the market. Please check my profile for a few free tutorials on price action entry signals. One entry signal example price action traders can use is the engulfing bar. If a trader was to enter the engulfing bar in the Forex market randomly, they are going to be a losing trader. If however, that same trader enters the engulfing bar and matches it up with the price action story, then their chances of success are far higher. It is all about the price action story and not the entry signal.\nA lot of price action educators and mentors get wrapped up about the last candle and teaching only the last entry candle. The major problem with this is the entry candle is only the last candle on the whole chart that is made up of many candles. The price action trader needs to be able to read the whole price action story which means evaluating and assessing the information and the whole chart.\nWhen you are assessing your next price action chart remember this article and remember about looking at the whole price action story. Get rid of all your indicators and learn to read the raw price and exactly what story price is trying to tell you and where it is telling you it is heading.\nI hope you have enjoyed this article and if you want to become a top price action trader, the only way is to get the education and then put in the time.\nJohnathon Fox is a professional Forex and Futures trader who also tutors and mentors aspiring traders worldwide.

The law so enraged Russian President Vladimir Putin that he halted the adoption of Russian children by American families. Veselnitskaya told the NYT that she \"never acted on behalf of the Russian government,\" but her anti-Magnitsky campaign is obviously a cause that's deeply personal for Putin.\nGoldstone is a friend of Trump Jr., often involved in the Miss Universe pageant, who claimed to set up the meeting for Veselnitskaya to discuss the adoption issues caused by the Magnitsky Act, per a WaPo report.

It's the first off-planet automobile ride.\nForty years after Neil Armstrong made his giant leap for mankind, the Apollo program remains a singular cultural and technological achievement. The application of so much technology to a single goal was nearly without precedent. Amongst all the gadgetry born of the Apollo program, the lunar rover ranks near the top of the cool scale.\nThe rover was the most famous electric vehicle until that slick little two-seater from Tesla Motors came along, and it remains a technological marvel. The amount of tech packed into that little buggy still boggles the mind.\nThe rovers were used to give the astronauts greater leeway in exploring the moon during the later, more science-heavy Apollo missions. Those space suits are bulky, and walking in them wasn't easy. So, having a set of wheels expanded the astronauts' range, because they weren't restricted to walking short distances.\nBoeing built the rover and needed just 17 short months to develop it. Not only did the rover have to carry two men wearing space suits, but it also had to haul whatever rocks and dirt the astronauts found interesting. The main design concerns were, as always, weight and performance.\nCost was not a big concern. The original budget was $19 million for four rovers. Cost overruns \u2013 in a government program? I'm shocked, shocked! \u2013 doubled the final price tag to $38 mil (worth about $200 million in today's cash).\nThe rover didn't arrive on the moon ready to roll. It was folded like a Transformer and packed into a cargo hold. When the time came, the astronauts used a system of pulleys, reels and tapes to lower the vehicle from the payload bay. After that, the rover took over. Its wheels unfolded automatically and locked into place as the rover opened like an Autobot.\nThe LRV was 10 feet, 2 inches long with a 7.5-foot wheelbase and a 6-foot tread width. It was less than 45 inches high.\nWeight is the enemy of all things that fly, especially those things flying into space. Boeing made the rover supermodel-light. It tipped the scales at a featherweight 463 pounds, a figure that must have made Colin Chapman swoon with envy.\nThe frame was made of welded 2219 aluminum-alloy tubing. Everything else was aluminum, magnesium or other exotic light alloys. Light, but strong: The little lunar runabout could carry a payload of 1,080 pounds.\nThe \"tires\" weren't tires at all, but zinc-coated woven steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. On top of the zinc and steel mesh were titanium chevrons that covered 50 percent of the contact area to provide traction.\nThe electric motors \u2013 made by GM subsidiary Delco \u2013 mounted within the wheels. Each 54-amp DC series-wound motor cranked out 1.9 kilowatts at 10,000 rpm and was attached to its wheel by an 80:1 harmonic drive. The brakes were mechanically operated.

The nation's youngest adults may find it difficult to become homeowners, qualify for auto loans, start small businesses, and delay saving for retirement.\nFor many 20- and 30-somethings, paying off the cost of college takes priority.

New federal student loan borrowers may see their interest rates double unless lawmakers strike a deal to extend a 2007 law that cut the rates. The law expires July 1.\n\"You could have generations that never get in the economic mainstream,\" says Ted Beck, president and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education. \"If you never get into the whole U.S. economic system because you've been held back by too much early debt ... we could have a lot of people who just never really come anywhere near their potential.\"\nThough hard data linking student loan debt to a delay in these financial commitments are elusive, personal finance experts say that when one is saddled with any kind of debt, economic lives can grind to a halt.

Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty.\nOne of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.\nAccording to Marques Porto, supporting family farms \u2013 which currently provide 70 percent of the food eaten by Brazilians \u2013 is central to poverty alleviation.\nThe success of Fome Zero was due to three elements, thinks Oxfam International\u2019s Luca Chinotti: the strong leadership provided by President Lula; the broad partnership involved in devising and implementing the platform, which included ministries, civil society, representatives of small farmers and rural workers; and shifting most public sector food purchases to family farm suppliers.\nBrazil is sharing its experience with family farm produce purchases for poverty alleviation with other countries around the world, as part of the World Food Programme\u2019s Purchase for Progress framework, says Marques Porto.\nOver the past decade, Brazil has been deriving much of its wealth from food exports. Yet its large-scale soy and beef production for export are also responsible for deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Amazonian region. Furthermore, clearing of land for industrial agriculture is threatening livelihoods of local communities.\nOxfam and other NGOs are now calling on all countries around the world to implement those guidelines in order to secure smallholders\u2019 access to land and natural resources.\nThis year, the U.N.\u2019s High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda proposed that clear targets on land tenure are included in the development framework that will replace the Millennium Development Goals after 2015.

Mason Ramsey, the 11-year-old whose version of a Hank Williams classic has been watched more than 50 million times on YouTube (one version here) and spawned multiple remixes, will put out his first album on July 20, per the AP. Titled Famous, the EP includes a mix of new songs and country classics, including the song that made Mason an overnight internet sensation, \"Lovesick Blues.\" Raised in the small town of Golconda, Ill., Mason says his grandfather taught him to sing when he was 3, and he started performing at nursing homes, restaurants, and fairs. But it took him weeks to discover that his impromptu Walmart performance had gone viral, because his family didn't have internet access at their home.\nThey got a call from producers with The Ellen Show, and Mason was flown to Los Angeles\u2014his first-ever plane ride\u2014to be a guest on the show.

{"idx": "3886", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If recent history has taught us anything it is that the New York Giants' rookie draft class will be unpredictable.\nTake last year as an example. On the positive side\u2014despite being a first-round pick\u2014no one could have predicted that Justin Pugh would not only start all 16 games at right tackle for Big Blue, but also be the team\u2019s best offensive lineman, according to his 7.1 Pro Football Focus rating (subscription required). Negatively, Damontre Moore appeared to be a strong candidate to have an impactful rookie season after his first preseason game last August.\nHowever, he didn\u2019t register a sack in 136 defensive snaps and saw his only highlight come on special teams.\nWe can even go back several years to 2007, when a diminutive running back named Ahmad Bradshaw was selected in the seventh round and initially stayed true to his draft position by gaining only 39 rushing yards as a third-stringer over the first 14 games of the season.\nBradshaw, though, burst out of the shadows with a memorable 88-yard touchdown run in Week 16 against Buffalo that all but sealed a Giants playoff berth. He went on to play a key role in Big Blue\u2019s playoff run to a Super Bowl title with 208 yards rushing and one touchdown in four postseason games.\nThe point of this mostly pleasant look back is that some of the seven players New York drafted last weekend will perform better or worse than their draft position. In rare cases, it may be a drastic swing one way or the other.\nThe following four slides are my take on which players will surprise. The slides are ordered based on the boldness of the prediction\u2014from least to most bold.\nThis may seem like a very bold prediction on the surface, but it really isn\u2019t once we take a look at all the facts.\nFor starters, Weston Richburg doesn\u2019t have a lot of competition to beat out at the center position. His main threat is J.D. Walton, who hasn\u2019t played since early in the 2012 season due to a severe ankle injury and wasn\u2019t that effective even when he was on the field. In 2010 and 2011 with the Denver Broncos\u2014his only two full seasons in the NFL\u2014Walton posted minus-15.9 and minus-31.9 PFF ratings, respectively.\nThe other competitor is 30-year-old Dallas Reynolds, who did start 14 games at center for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2012, but\u2014like Walton\u2014wasn\u2019t good with a minus-8.7 PFF rating. Reynolds played only 103 snaps last season at guard and center in his first year with New York.\nRichburg also happens to play a position that is one of the easier to become a rookie starter at in the NFL. For example, Travis Frederick started all 16 games at center for the Dallas Cowboys last season as a rookie. In 2011, Mike Pouncey matched Frederick\u2019s feat with the Miami Dolphins.\nMost importantly, though, Richburg projects to be a very good pro, especially given the blocking scheme the Giants implement.\nThe Colorado State product was considered one of the top two or three center prospects in the draft. Two of his main strengths are his intelligence and quickness. These are key attributes for a center in the Giants' zone-blocking scheme, which requires a heady player with the ability to move and block in space"}

Here, The Quad analyzes some of the biggest stories of week nine.\nUCLA housing officials recently reported a lack of security officers in the dorms. Housing Access Control, the UCLA housing department in charge of security surveillance on the Hill, has had a large number of openings since the beginning of the school year. However, annual trends show that low levels of employment are typical in the fall.\nJunji Toshima, the assistant director in Housing & Hospitality Services\u2019 Safety & Emergency Preparedness told The Bruin the safety of students is not compromised, in spite of the short staffing. When Access Control experiences staff shortages they pull from other security departments on campus so as to avoid sacrificing students\u2019 safety.\nMelody Zaki, a first-year physiological science student, told the Daily Bruin having someone posted at the entrances and elevators makes her feel safer and more comfortable in the residence halls.\nBecause of the staff shortage, the current Access Control employees have been on the clock with more hours than typically delegated. In recent weeks they have hired 25 new employees to fill the large number of vacant positions.\nAfter walking to class in the rain on Thursday, students and administration officials alike were greeted by flooding in Murphy Hall. According to UCLA Facilities Management, flooding began at around 8 a.m.\nThe financial aid office temporarily relocated and the registrar\u2019s office had to close until 10 a.m. Unfortunately, this meant a handful of students needed to reschedule impending appointments.\nAfter the failure of yet another pizza joint in Westwood, the previous co-owner of KONY Pizza, John Chung, opened a Japanese-and-Korean style fusion restaurant named Meat Your Seoul. Chung told The Bruin he believes the new restaurant adds to the diversity of cuisine in Westwood and thinks it will appeal to the large international student population at UCLA.\nThe trendy, cook-it-yourself eatery is just another addition to the Westwood\u2019s ever-growing menu. Additionally, in the light of the success of the Westwood Forward Initiative, more restaurant establishments targeted at students are likely to spring up in coming years.\nThe UCPD recently arrested Winston Ekpo for attempting to access a building off of Midvale Avenue. He was additionally charged with telecommunications harassment and vandalism targeted at a student resident in De Neve, reportedly a high school friend of his.\nThough students are unsure of when Ekpo started visiting the student, they believe he was misrepresenting himself as a student to access the De Neve residence hall for some time.\nDenise Wang, a De Neve resident and second-year computer science and engineering student, told The Bruin he believes students should be held accountable for keeping nonresidents out of residence halls.

{"idx": "3904", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: On April 30th a very rare, non-albino, white buffalo calf was found dead, slaughtered by unknown individuals. The calf\u2019s mother was also killed, poisoned by whoever killed the calf. The calf, Lightning Medicine Cloud, born at the Lakota Ranch in Greenville Texas, was considered sacred, and a reward has been offered for information leading to the capture of the perpetrators.\nWhite buffalo are sacred in several Native American religions, and their killing can trigger outrage in Indian Country, even though breeding programs and knowledge of genetics makes them easier to create. Lightning Medicine Cloud was especially rare because the calf was naturally occurring, a one-in-ten-million event. At the Lakota Ranch\u2019s website, an information page tries to convey the spiritual importance of a buffalo calf like Lightning Medicine Cloud.\nThe Native Americans see the birth of a white buffalo calf as the most significant of prophetic signs, equivalent to the weeping statues, bleeding icons, and crosses of light that are becoming prevalent within the Christian churches today. Where the Christian faithful who visit these signs see them as a renewal of God\u2019s ongoing relationship with humanity, so do the Native Americans see the white buffalo calf as the sign to begin life\u2019s sacred hoop.\n\u201cThe arrival of the white buffalo is like the second coming of Christ,\u201d says Floyd Hand Looks For Buffalo, an Oglala Medicine Man from Pine Ridge, South Dakota. \u201cIt will bring about purity of mind, body, and spirit and ;unify all nations\u2014black, red, yellow, and white.\u201d He sees the birth of a white calf as an omen because they happen in the most unexpected places and often among the poorest people in the nation. The birth of the sacred white buffalo provides those within the Native American community with a sense of hope and an indication that good times are to come.\nWhat happens when an omen of unity and prosperity is slaughtered? Lakota Buffalo Ranch owner Arby Little Soldier, a descendant of Sitting Bull, says that his death would strengthen, not weaken, the calf\u2019s purpose.\nWe as a people crave stories that seem mythic, constantly searching for sign, omens, and portents in our daily lives. So it isn\u2019t too unexpected that the killing of Lightning Medicine Cloud would spark a response in the mainstream media. The question now is what do we do now that attention is focused on this incident? I would argue that if you are horrified by this action, if you felt some kinship and understanding as to the importance of this animal, then you should funnel that outrage and sadness into paying more ongoing attention to Native American and indigenous issues here in America, and worldwide. Too often, the concerns and struggles in Indian Country are ignored, a specialty news item covered only on specialty news sites. If we are to help bring about the unity promised by Lightning Medicine Cloud, then the practice of solidarity might be a good start.\nFor example, we could examine the \u201cgutting\u201d of environmental review in Canada, a move opposed by Canadian aboriginals and environmentalists. We could ask why the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives opposes Native American protections in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization bill (even though 1 in 3 Native women will be raped during their lives and 2 in 5 women in Native communities will suffer domestic violence), or why the simple question of restoration of lands is regularly blown out of proportion every time it\u2019s mentioned.

It is a high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) pebble-bed generation IV reactor partly based on the earlier HTR-10, a 10 MWt prototype pebble bed reactor at Tsinghua University in China.\nWork on the HTR-PM power plant, consisting of two reactors driving a single steam turbine, began in December 2012 at the Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant, on the east coast of the body of water that separates China from the Korean peninsula.\nThe power plant is expected to come online later this year and is said to be China's first \u201cGeneration IV\u201d reactor to enter service. And while the new design is being touted as safer \u2014 researchers in the U.S. and Germany warn this does not eliminate the possibility of a serious accident.\nDiagram extracted from Generation IV roadmap and cleaned up to remove excess grouping.\nThe warning in the form of a commentary published August 23, in the journal Joule, recommends continued research, additional safety measures, and an extended startup phase that would allow for better monitoring.\n\"There is no reason for any kind of panic, but nuclear technology has a risk in any case,\" says first author Rainer Moormann, a nuclear safety researcher based in Germany, Reports Science Daily. \"A realistic understanding of those risks is essential, especially for operators, and so we urge caution and a spirit of scientific inquiry in the operation of HTR-PM.\"\nWhat makes a pebble-bed reactor different?\nThe two HTR-PM units are scaled up versions of the HTR-10 with 250-MWt capacity. The HTR-10 was modeled after the German HTR-MODUL. Like the HTR-MODUL, the HTR-10 is claimed to be fundamentally safer, cheaper and more efficient than other nuclear reactor designs.\nThe HTR-10 has gone through extensive testing and experiments, according to China's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology and the reactor has an all-around computerized protection system and in-depth defense principles.\nControl room of HTR-10, experimental high temperature gas cooled reactor at Tshinghua University, Beijing (China, June 2004).\nThe newer HTR-PM, like all pebble-bed reactors, has a different reactor core configuration from conventional pressurized water reactors (PWR). The reactor fuel is not packed into rods and arranged in an array surrounded by a liquid coolant.\nIn a pebble-bed reactor, the fuel - which contains uranium enriched to lower degree than conventional nuclear fuel \u2013 is packed into spherical particles surrounded by layers of ceramic and the coolant is helium under moderate pressure (around 30 atm).\nThis fuel configuration was originally used in Germany with the HTR-MODUL in the 1960s to breed uranium from thorium fuel. Outlet temperature ranges between 700 and 950 \u00b0C (1,300\u20131,750 \u00b0F), compared to 300\u00b0C for a PWR, which allows these reactors to generate hydrogen as a byproduct efficiently.

If we\u2019re being honest, there probably wasn\u2019t that much drama here. We didn\u2019t know for sure if things would go exactly as planned, but we could be pretty sure the main character wouldn\u2019t die. That didn\u2019t make the action any less suspenseful, though, particularly when Superian showing up threatens to spoil Arthur\u2019s plan. Ultimately, things work out; the VLM shrinks, and while Superian has a \u201cBismuth hangover,\u201d he\u2019s no worse for wear, and the city is saved.\nBut while Terror\u2019s initial plan is foiled, he would never go down that easy. As it turns out, the T from his cola company building doubles as a ship, and he flies into town hoping to get his message out. Arthur and Tick find out and track him down, but his real undoing comes when Lint escapes without him, making him a sitting duck. The tension between Lint and Terror had played out in a subtle way. Unlike Ramses, Terror at least partially appreciated what Lint could do, but he could never quite grasp exactly how essential she was to the plan. Now, she escapes, and we\u2019re left to wonder how she\u2019ll be used next season. She\u2019s arguably the most interesting character on the show, and she has reason to target The Terror, as well as Tick and Arthur, not to mention her past romance with Overkill. There\u2019s quite a few directions the show could take things with her.\nAs for Arthur, despite saving the day, and stopping both of The Terror\u2019s plans, he still winds up on the wrong end of a shotgun. At the exact moment that Terror is contemplating whether or not to kill him just for the hell of it, Superian arrives and freezes him, becoming the hero of the day even though Arthur and Tick has done far more. The real show, though, comes when Arthur finally expresses his rage at the Terror; as he points out, despite his firm belief that everything he does is planned and structured, he basically makes things up as he goes along (did he just watch Whiplash one night and decide he wanted to make jazz drumming part of his thing?). The eccentricity that makes The Terror such a fascinating villain ultimately lead to his downfall.\nThe last few episodes have long been hinting at Arthur repairing his relationship with Walter, and sure enough, they come together here. One of the best scenes involves the pair taking down a group of The Terror\u2019s minions together, and as much as Arthur has been trying to understand where Walter is coming from, Walter is now reciprocating.

The time is not far off when there will be no living witnesses to share their part in this story, to say: yes, this happened, and this is how.\nThis week, Pope Francis will be making a pilgrimage to Poland, visiting Auschwitz, the notorious death camp in which 1.1 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. Auschwitz is comprised of two camps: Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II (also called Birkenau). Birkenau is the actual \u201ctheater of death,\u201d where the vast majority of Jews were murdered.\nAt Birkenau, there exists a large church in what was once the Nazi commandant headquarters. The church is in direct violation of a 1987 agreement signed by four European cardinals and European Jewish leaders which declares, \u201cThere will be no permanent Catholic place of worship on the site of the Auschwitz and Birkenau camps.\u201d It is necessary for the pope to recognize this affront and ask that the church be moved.\nThis is not the first time a Catholic place of worship was established at Auschwitz. In 1984, Carmelite nuns took over a building at Auschwitz I that had once stored the Zyklon B gas that Nazis used to murder Jews. With the full support of Polish cardinal Franciszek Marcharski, local authorities granted the nuns a 99-year lease to convert the building into a convent, where they sought to pray for the souls of the murdered.\nIt was around this time when the local Catholic community established the church at Birkenau, called the Parish Church of Brzezinka.\nAs a rabbi, I have deep respect for all places of worship.\nI also feel that Christian houses of worship do not belong at what is in effect the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. And so in July 1989, I joined a group of seven activists protesting against the Carmelite convent.\nWe climbed over the fence surrounding the convent and peacefully assembled. Polish workers inside the convent poured a bucket of water mixed with urine on us, as nuns watched from the windows. In 1993, Pope John Paul II himself ordered the nuns to leave, and the convent was shut down.\nThe church remains, and its very existence at this sacred Jewish space is inappropriate, misleading and a violation of Shoah memory. A hundred years from now people will look to the camp for evidence of what occurred there. If the church structure remains, its large cross casting a shadow over Auschwitz II, the site could suggest to the uninformed that the Holocaust was either an attempt at Christian genocide or that the church defended Jews at that time \u2013 when in fact the church turned its back on the attempted annihilation of the Jewish people. If we as a species are to learn from our history, to strive for a better future, we need to know what has befallen in the past. Otherwise, we perpetuate the possibility that the atrocities of the past will repeat in the future, and that untold suffering will prevail.\nIt\u2019s up to people of moral conscience to raise a voice for the sake of Holocaust memory and declare loud and clear: A church has no place at Auschwitz II. As pope John Paul moved the Carmelite convent, Pope Francis \u2013 who has shown himself to be a great friend to the Jewish community \u2013 has the power to order the Birkenau church to be moved. The building should become a museum, specific to Birkenau, showing how the Nazis carried out their atrocities there."}

They are not loth to employing filthy tactics to achieve their selfish ends.\nCan we rely on technology to keep our data safe? Can we rely on the cybersecurity experts? To a certain extent, yes. But security doesn\u2019t work that way \u2013 especially in this day and age.\nIt is a responsibility shared by all. The German hacker I mentioned just guessed passwords to steal data. Many were still using passwords like \u201c123456\u201d or \u201ciloveyou\u201d.\nHere in the Philippines, people get duped by phishing websites where they give all their personal information.

They don\u2019t exert effort to know even just the basics of online security. They even willingly give passwords over the phone.\nCan cybersecurity experts, businesses, financial institutions, and other private or government entities take the sole responsibility for cybersecurity? Can we all relegate awareness to somebody else?\nThat would have been a perfect world. But the reality is that impregnable cybersecurity is a myth. So far, the only way to make our data safer is to combine technology, human expertise, and general awareness.\nThat makes each one of us a protector of our own data."}

No dismissal paperwork is listed in federal court records, and attorneys for the plaintiff, Michael Gonzales, could not be reached Friday.\nUber attorneys, in a legal response to the lawsuit, said that Gonzales is alleging only that Uber used \"commonly available software\" to collect data that would be accessible to anyone using the Lyft app. \"The communications were therefore 'readily available to the general public' and the Wiretap Act does not apply,\" the Uber lawyers wrote.\nNews of the investigation was reported earlier Friday by The Wall Street Journal.\nUber's other legal problems include a lawsuit filed by Waymo, the autonomous car unit spun off from Google, alleging that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer, stole trade secrets before departing in January 2016 to found a robotic vehicle startup that Uber acquired seven months later.\nThe lawsuit maintains that Uber then transplanted the property into its own fleet of self-driving vehicles \u2014 a charge that Uber has adamantly denied.

{"idx": "3926", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Recently, there has been a great deal of press coverage comparing the competing economic plans of President Obama and the Republicans, both in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. This has spurred many conversations with my friends and neighbors as they navigate an improving, but still sluggish, economy. What has most impressed me is how devoid of partisanship these discussions have been. Regardless of whether I am speaking to a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, the people on the street are remarkably consistent in the sort of help they want government to provide.\nThe people I meet say that what would help most would be some reasonable tax relief for the middle class, coupled with incentives for business to start hiring again. They are not interested in token gestures, which serve only to provide cover for additional tax breaks for people who already have so much. They see through the usual euphemisms for shoveling even more of our nation's resources to special interests and those who can afford high-priced lobbyists and slick TV commercials.\nThe differing priorities of our leaders are elucidated by comparing the positions of President Obama and the Republican Party on reducing the payroll tax. As many Americans know, President Obama cut the payroll tax by 2 percent last December. This saved a Pennsylvania family earning the state's average wage about $1,000 this year. If new legislation is not passed by Dec. 31, the tax will go back up to where it was. This would essentially be a tax increase on hardworking, middle-class Americans when they can least afford it.\nPresident Obama understands the importance of keeping this tax cut in place. He has put forward a very specific proposal that would actually provide an even larger tax cut to working families by reducing the rate workers pay by half, from 6.2 percent to 3.1 percent. In addition, the plan would make it easier for employers to hire by cutting in half the amount of payroll tax businesses pay on the first $5 million they pay in wages. For the average family in Pennsylvania, this will mean an additional $1,490 to spend next year. This tax cut for the middle class will not increase the budget deficit. It is paid for completely by a modest surcharge on those making more than $1 million per year. This is exactly the sort of common-sense, targeted and effective help my constituents across the ideological spectrum say they need.\nUnfortunately, Republicans have largely opposed this proposal. Recently, leading Republican Sen. Jon Kyl astonishingly claimed that the payroll tax cut does not create jobs.

By way of contrast, Mitt Romney's tax plan would give a typical middle-class family $54 per year, far less than the almost $1,500 that the president's proposal would provide.\nWhat makes this Republican opposition particularly disappointing is their history of justifying much larger tax cuts for the wealthy as necessary for job creation. Somehow, in their world, giving a multimillionaire hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks they don't need and are unlikely to spend somehow stimulates the economy. But giving a break to average folks so that they can buy groceries, clothes and other necessities is unproductive.

{"idx": "3929", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Cannabis smoke is not as carcinogenic as tobacco smoke. In a review article published today in Harm Reduction Journal, Dr. Melamede from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, USA, writes that although cannabis smoke and tobacco smoke are chemically very similar, evidence suggests that their effects are very different and that cannabis smoke is less carcinogenic than tobacco smoke.\nThe pharmacological effects of tobacco and cannabis smoke differ in many ways, mainly because tobacco smoke contains nicotine while cannabis smoke contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The cancer-promoting effects of smoke are increased by nicotine, while they are reduced by THC.\nTobacco and cannabis smoke contain the same carcinogenic compounds - and depending on which part of the plant is smoked, cannabis smoke can contain more of them - but, whereas nicotine activates these carcinogenic compounds, THC has been shown to inhibit them in mice cells. THC is very likely to have protective effects against the carcinogens present in smoke in humans too, but cannabis smoke remains nonetheless carcinogenic.\nWhile nicotine and THC can act on related cellular pathways, they bind to different receptors to activate these pathways. The cells of lungs and the respiratory passages are lined with nicotine receptors, but do not appear to carry THC receptors. This explains why cannabis smoking has not been associated with lung cancer, a main cause of death from cigarette smoking.\nCannabis has also been shown to kill cancer cells and to reduce tumour growth, in part by reducing the formation of blood vessels that feed tumours. But \"the effects of cannabinoids are complex and sometimes contradicting\", warns the author. In addition, as cannabis is frequently smoked with tobacco, the effects of the two drugs may interact in complex ways.\nCannabis is a class C drug in the UK and the USA. It has been linked to an increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia, in a small group of vulnerable individuals. But there is increasing evidence that the drug has significant medicinal uses and can greatly improve the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease and insomnia. In spite of this, governments have been reluctant to legalize cannabis for medical use, on the grounds that the risks associated with the drug still outweigh its benefits.\nChavez, Daniel. \"Cannabis smoke less carcinogenic than tobacco smoke.\" Medical News Today.

He regularly hit or cleared the boundary, smashing 47 4s and ten 6s on his way to averaging 54.89 with the bat at a Strike Rate of 133.51. In addition, he claimed 14 wickets with 59 dot balls from just 150 balls bowled, averaging a miserly 14.80 runs per wicket, albeit at a high Strike Rate of 8.28. He was Player of the Match in a third of his 12 appearances, and it was no wonder his SuperCoach average was over 35 points per game higher than his nearest teammate.\nSandeep Lamichhane was an incredible find for the Stars, and what they wouldn't have given to have had him available for the full campaign. At season conclusion he had played seven games, claiming 11 wickets at a miserly 6.97 Strike Rate and an average of 16.30, with 68 dots from 154 balls bowled. He regularly bamboozled facing batsmen with his thrilling leg-spin and looms as one of the most in-demand signatures for the BBL|09 season. Replaced by English speedster Liam Plunkett whilst he was playing in the BPL, the Stars would have loved to have had both these imports available at the same time.\nGlenn Maxwell's leadership as the BBL|08 season came to a conclusion was a key part of the Stars' ride to the Final, with his batting, bowling, and field placements against first the Sydney Sixers then the Hobart Hurricanes absolutely superb. He lead the way and had exactly the sort of season that he needed to have ahead of the ODI World Cup in England later in 2019, showcasing that his experience and nous will prove invaluable to Australia no matter where he comes in in the order.\nDwayne Bravo might have finished fifth overall in the SuperCoach scoring averages for the Stars, but it's arguable that he could just as easily slide into the top 5 disappointments list. Brought in from his cross-town rivals, he really only had a couple of standout moments and too regularly failed with the bat, with his run-out against the Sixers in the final regular"}

Negative correlation means two assets move in opposite direction, while positive correlation means they tend to move in tandem. Zero correlation means assets move independent of each other.\nLow or negative correlations between assets in a portfolio usually reduces overall volatility and enhances returns\u2014in this case of the S&P 500, according to modern portfolio theory.\n\u201cLast November, after presidential elections, correlation between S&P 500 sectors collapsed from about 70% to 50%.

The much-lauded (and awarded) Nike Fuelband had gained mainstream acceptance, becoming the Christmas present of choice for gadget-obsessed fitness fanatics, Samsung had launched its James Bond-style smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, and there were rumours circulating of the launch of a similar Apple product coming soon. Meanwhile, Google Glass was finally a reality, and industry commentators were certain it would revolutionise how we interact with technology and the internet.\nThe idea of wearable technology is certainly tantalising. Most of us grew up watching science-fiction films that promised us jet packs, interstellar travel and robot servants. The revolutionary prospect of wearable technology gives us the opportunity to live this future now.\nClearly it's bound to be a success. Isn't it?\nWell, six months on and it hasn't quite panned out that way. Nike has stopped production of the Fuelband. Ebay is awash with sellers trying to get rid of their Galaxy Gear and the public's general perception of Google Glass wearers is creepy, invasive \"glassholes\".\nSo what's gone wrong for wearable tech?\nFirstly, it's not particularly wearable. Our identity is fundamentally tied to the clothes we choose and the accessories with which we adorn our bodies. The limitations of the tech element of wearable tech mean the products lack style. They don't really fit into contemporary consumers' wardrobes, so they aren't inclined to wear them often, which means they don't develop the habit of using them.\nBut it's not just looks that hinder the appeal of wearable tech. People just don't know what it's for, or how to use it. They don't serve any existing user need or behavioural pattern. People have been exercising for years without the need to sift through mounds of data telling them how they are performing. Regardless of how useful it can be, it's not something people generally need in their lives.\nAnother concern is cost and obsolescence. Wearable tech isn't cheap. Consumers don't want to spend hundreds of pounds on equipment that will be outdated and outmoded almost instantly.\nRecent research from social listening provider Brandwatch reinforces this. From the 8m social mentions of wearable tech they monitored in the first six months of this year, only 8% showed any sentiment at all (6% positive to 2% negative) \u2013 suggesting that it's just not a topic on many people's radar.\nThe truth is that we already have the perfect piece of wearable tech: the smartphone. It's flexible to our lifestyle, discreet and can be easily customised to meet our personal style and needs. Not to mention that it's become invaluable to most people's lives.\nThat's why brands such as Nike have moved away from creating hardware to focus on apps such as RunKeeper, Nike+ Running and Strava Run, which offer various features to help plan and map your jog. More general exercise apps include Fitness Buddy, 7 Minute Workout Challenge and All-in Fitness.\nLikewise, Fitness First is in the process of building a digital platform, including an app with around 1,000 workouts, allowing users to make their smartphones the hub of their fitness activity.\nFitness is at the forefront of this technology at the moment, but as widely predicted, it's only a matter of time before we see this shift into areas such"}

However, it has blossomed into one of the world's most respected and successful independent data storage companies in the last decade, and its prospects look excellent going into the next year. This slide show looks ahead at some of the important trends in storage technology in 2010.\nAs different vendors clamor to be part of the cloud, unified management of the entire technology stack is critical. Whether public or private, tying together the different infrastructure layers - including applications, VMs, systems, networks and storage - with a comprehensive set of management tools reduces complexity by providing end-to-end service visibility, performance monitoring, and automated provisioning.\nAlthough it is still early in evolutionary process, Darwinian selection is already starting to happen in the cloud service provider space. Super-efficient aggregators are emerging who have figured out how to get the most out of a virtualized infrastructure. Early adopters of the cloud business model will decide to abandon services delivered from their own data centers and partner with these successful service providers who have shown that they can offer enterprise class IT as a Service cheaper and with better service levels than they can do it themselves.\nData centers that are deploying a cloud architecture are shifting from application centric silos to virtualized shared infrastructures. This shared environment results in multiple \"tenants\" or users occupying the same virtualized infrastructure. As a result, the tenants need to be assured that safe sharing occurs both from a security perspective and a performance perspective. A secure multi-tenancy solution enables this.\nMost IT departments over time have accumulated a diverse set of hardware and software platforms. This model may be fine in a siloed structure where each business application has its own server and storage resource. However, in a cloud environment, this model will pose serious challenges. As a result, companies who want to realize a true service-oriented architecture will need to start by planning to standardize and consolidate first, in order to build a shared virtualized infrastructure.\nData security is a challenge today, even in closed IT infrastructure environments. For many financial, military defense, and public security companies this issue will be even more profound in a shared and open cloud environment. Cloud service providers will need to develop a proven practice to gain the confidence of wary customers who value data security as the number one criteria in choosing a service provider.\nThe cloud will fundamentally change how IT services are offered, both internally and externally. For emerging cloud service providers, offering the right-sized Service Level Agreements will be critical to winning business and market share with potential customers. For internal cloud deployments, IT departments will need to create SLAs so that the business units and IT can determine the most efficient use of resources.\nMany IT organizations are recreating themselves as internal \"services providers\" in the effort to standardize offerings and reduce costs, yet still meet the requirements of the business. By implementing \"service catalogs,\" meaning a finite set of configurations with associated service levels, costs, and delivery times, IT organizations are able to reduce their procurement and management costs. The limited set of resources available in a catalog enables standardization which in turn creates a more predictable cost model and increases time to market.\nStandardization is critical to any service offering because it gives both the provider and the consumer a set of repeatable, measurable resources. Without standardization, every offering would be custom which would not only increase up front deployment costs and on-going management costs, but also make it difficult to measure the effectiveness of each offering as there would be no baseline.\nThe move toward cloud architectures will not happen overnight. Most companies have a"}

The angle of the blood spatter may indicate that somebody next to and taller than her was terribly injured. Then again, maybe she finally snapped and let loose on somebody, which would be totally understandable after her experiences in Season 1. Alternately, this photo could be of June prior to her final transformation into a Handmaid.\nIf this photo does depict June sometime after the Season 1 finale in the timeline, then she may not be in much physical danger.

Pregnancy is the one thing that could reasonably keep a Handmaid safe on The Handmaid's Tale. Depending on where June is taken after the Season 1 finale, perhaps she won't be forced into Handmaid garb all over again.\nThe Handmaids in this image are not wearing their regular red clothes and white bonnets. According to EW, these women are attending the funeral of another Handmaid, which does explain both the black garb and the fact that they were allowed to attend. Interestingly, the Aunts (as seen in the bottom right corner) seem to be dressed in their regular daywear, indicating that only the Handmaids are expected to change what they wear for the funeral. The presence of a drummer and the crosses in the ground may point to funerals on The Handmaid's Tale actually not being so different from real-life funerals nowadays, although we'll obviously have to wait and see.\nThese two pictures are only the beginning.

The Colonies are the polluted and contaminated areas of North America, and we learned in Season 1 that those who break rules in Gilead may face the sentence of exile to those terrible places. When given the choice of becoming a Jezebel in a brothel or being sent to the Colonies, Moira decided to become a Jezebel, which is a big sign of just how awful life in the Colonies must be.\nWe only have a few more months to wait before we find out.

The second is that the goal difference bonus racked up in the 8-2 defeat of Arsenal in August has now been wiped out.\nThe third may concern the fixture list which sends United to Eastlands for the return derby on April 28 in the third from last game of the season, when the fine detail of the for and against section may prove critical in deciding the title. The sense of majesty and power now being translated by City is already leading to suggestions that the title is now theirs to lose.\nYaya Toure, James Milner, Gareth Barry and David Silva crushed and dazzled United in midfield on Sunday. But it\u2019s a longer, harder haul to make it across the line in England than anywhere else.\nEven Roberto Mancini, smart, confident and appearing masterfully in control of things at the moment, won\u2019t have experienced before the sheer rawness and relentlessness of keeping the challenge going. Not even while winning three Serie A titles with Inter Milan.\nFerguson wrote the manual for that part of the job. It\u2019s why last season he could happily concede that he landed another championship despite the fact his team lost four times and drew 10 more games away from home \u2013 18 wins and a draw at home more than compensating.\nBefore Sunday, Old Trafford had hardly been open house for visiting Premier League teams, either, with only three goals conceded until Mario Balotelli got to work.\nYet there are underlying statistics that may point to fundamental trouble.\nWhen he chose to play cautiously eight days earlier at Anfield, Ferguson was unduly criticised. It may have happened because he sensed that some uncertainty had crept into his side after their explosive start to the season. Even before this weekend, David De Gea had made more saves than any other Premier League goalkeeper (36 to Joe Hart\u2019s 23).\nIn one way, that\u2019s a sign of how well De Gea overcame his early-season problems. In another, it suggests that he had to adapt quickly because United had been more porous in front of him than usual.\nAnother worrying fact for Ferguson is that he has been forced by injury to use nine different central defensive partnerships this season. Rio Ferdinand has managed to appear in six fixtures so far but Nemanja Vidic has played just once.\nFerguson is surely yearning for the kind of settlement that a prolonged resumption of the partnership between Ferdinand and Vidic might bring.\nHe lamented the fact that United conceded so many on Sunday because they kept pushing forward.

Three others (four if you include Mike Aviles in that mix) are vying for playing time as the final month of the regular season begins.\nIt's up to Francona to not only fill out the lineup card each day of September, but also to see which guys will be the biggest help if and when the playoffs roll around. There are no concrete answers.\n\"I can't sit here today and tell you I know what to do,\" Francona said.\nEach of the three healthy options \u2014 Josh Reddick, Darnell McDonald and newly acquired Conor Jackson \u2014 can make a claim for his a particular role. However, the last two figure to get locked into a good old-fashioned battle for at-bats.\n\"How we fit both of them in, some of that's going to be determined by how they swing the bat. There's no getting around it,\" Francona said.\nThe first order of business is seeing what Jackson can provide. Brought up primarily as a first baseman, he is newer to the outfield, but says he is comfortable playing there and knows he has needed to take on some part-time role to have longevity in this game.\n\"Whatever they need,\" the 29-year-old Jackson said. \"If I'm a bat off the bench, get in there against left-handers. Whatever my role is going to be I\u2019m going to be ready for it and prepared.\"\nWhen asked how often Jackson will be in there ahead of McDonald, Francona stressed how open-ended that is right now. It\u2019s all about having more options, just in case.\n\"How he's going to be used, I really don\u2019t know, or how extensively, we really don\u2019t know,\" Francona said. \"Just think talking to [general manager] Theo [Epstein], the chance to get a bat with a chance to impact, especially against left-handed pitching \u2026 If something were to happen in September, say to [McDonald], and we don't have somebody, that\u2019s not good.\"\nFrancona said he likes that he knows what he is going to get from McDonald and is itching to see what he has in Jackson.

Can you play them enough to where they get hot? That'll be something we need to think about.\"\nDefense also comes into play. Aside from a high-profile error Wednesday night against the Yankees, Reddick has played a pretty good right field. Drew plays an excellent one, but there is no timetable for his return. McDonald is at least familiar with the environs. Jackson, according to Francona, is here more for his bat but will not hurt the team when out there.\nRight field has been in a state of flux all season. That will remain the case going forward with several of the parties fighting for playing time."}

The place they used to stay in? It sunk into the melting permafrost.\nWhen Dutch artist Rob Sweere visited Greenland for an art project, there weren\u2019t many hotels to choose from. After traveling hundreds of miles north of the Arctic Circle to a tiny town where sled dogs outnumber people four to one, he ended up staying at a local shelter that houses abused and neglected kids. Months later, he went back in the village to build something for the kids: a mobile house on a sled that they could use for overnight excursions.\nThe children at the shelter come from the indigenous Inuit culture, and used to travel to a nearby island to spend time with Inuit hunters. But the old house where they used to stay can no longer be used\u2013it was built on permafrost, which is disappearing because of climate change.\nEnter the house built on a sled. The sled itself uses a traditional design, built by locals, that\u2019s safe enough to travel over sea ice, pulled by sled dogs. Inside, things are cozy: There\u2019s just enough room for six people to sleep (close together, since that\u2019s a good way to keep warm in one of the coldest countries on Earth), and though there\u2019s no power source for heat, the house is insulated and warms up quickly.\n\u201cBecause of the dry climate, you can light a few candles and the sledge is warm and comfortable,\u201d Sweere says.\nThough it might sound like rough living, the kids love it, and the shelter lets them live out on the ice, along with an Inuit hunter, for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\nSweere built his first mobile sled-homes along with a Danish man who was working at the children\u2019s shelter (who Sweere describes as \u201ca very big strong Viking\u201d) and a local hunter who couldn\u2019t speak English. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand each other, but because we are both builders we could easily work with hand signs and pointing fingers,\u201d Sweere says.\nThe building process wasn\u2019t easy\u2013the island had no electricity or supplies, and everything had to be brought in by boat.

So to get clear complexion, I asked the nutritional experts at Mount Sinai Hospital and Karin Hermoni, Ph.D.\u2014skin care expert and Head of Science and Nutrition at Lycored\u2014about the best beauty foods.\nHere are their top picks.\nTomatoes are a great beauty food mainly due to antioxidants like carotenoids and vitamin C. It contains lycopene\u2014a powerful antioxidant and red carotenoid known for fighting free radicals, inducing the body\u2019s protective mechanism against oxidative stress and inflammation. In other words, your skin can improve overall appearance and texture plus cope better in different environments.\nGreen leafy vegetables like kale promote general eye and skin health. As the ideal dietary source for Lutein\u2014a yellow carotenoid great for enhancing skin hydration and balancing skin\u2019s response to stress\u2014it\u2019s also well known for helping eyes adjust better to different parts of the light spectrum such as blue-, UV- and even visible light.\nFor better skin elasticity and moisture, go for salmon, which consists of a beneficial red carotenoid called Astaxanthin. Known for its antioxidant activity, the pigment is best absorbed when consumed with healthy fats such as olive oil or avocado. Try cooking salmon with olive oil, then add lemon and rosemary for flavor and extra benefits. When in doubt, pair the fish with tomato and green leafy vegetables.\nHealthy fats such as Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for glowing skin, since they retain cell hydration and fight against harmful elements. To get a healthy dose, choose walnuts. Not only are they high in fiber, they\u2019re also packed with vitamin E, which is a potent, free radical fighting antioxidant. What\u2019s more, walnuts can help improve and protect skin texture, leaving you with fewer lines and wrinkles.\nSoups are a terrific beauty food. But rather than going for creamy soups, which may be loaded with cream and dairy that could wreak havoc on your skin, try bone broth instead. Jam packed with calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin C, bone broth is a much better source for natural collagen to keep skin firm, smooth and elastic.\nMultiple studies have shown that diets with ahigh glycemic load can trigger acne in some people. This suggests a carbohydrate-richand sugar loaded diet can increase acne due to the effects sugar has on insulin,oil production and gut bacteria. For a glowing complexion, eat foods that are high in fiber and healthy fats, filled with antioxidants and low in sugar such as avocado, blueberries, walnuts and salmon."}

Construction expected to be completed by end of month.\nThere is good news and bad news regarding CSU\u2019s $2.4 million renovation to Jack Christiansen Memorial Track.\nThe good news? After two years and several delays, the track along College Avenue will open at the end of this month. The bad news? The public and CSU students who aren't track and field athletes will no longer be able to use the popular track.\nThe city of Fort Collins and CSU previously had an agreement to allow the public to use the facility because the city had invested money in it. This time, the $2.4 million renovation was funded solely by CSU with no city funds or student fees used. It was the first renovation of the facility since 1990.\nBedard said several issues necessitated locking the upgraded facility. He said homeless people were sleeping under the stands and in the port-a-potties, and the high jump and pole vault pits were damaged by vandals. The track's first lane was badly worn by so much use, and at times there were so many people using the track that it was difficult for CSU's track team to practice on its own facility.\nChris McCullough is one of those who contacted Bedard about wanting to continue to use the track. McCullough has headed up the Fort Collins Running Club's Tuesday Night Track Club for the past 12 years. For many years, the club has used the track for its workouts, which can draw up to 50 people, McCullough said.\nHe said he understands CSU wanting to protect its investment but is hopeful the group can come to an agreement and get back on the track.\n\u201cMy ask of them was let\u2019s think of creative ways to partner,\u2019\u2019 said McCullough, who added the group has donated money to the CSU track team as a way to say thanks for sharing the track.\nBedard pointed out CSU does not allow public or student use of its other athletic facilities, including the soccer, softball and football fields.\nPoudre School District rents its tracks for $20 per person per year but does not offer public rental of French Field at Rocky Mountain High School, which is locked like the new CSU track. An exception was the CSU track team rented French Field while its own track was being renovated.\nMcCullough said during the two years the CSU track was undergoing renovation, he didn\u2019t rent PSD facilities because the district requires each person to rent a key. Instead, he said the group got creative and practiced at the CSU Oval and on city trails, but that it was not ideal.\nBedard hopes to pay back PSD for use of French Field by hosting a large high school track meet annually as soon as this spring to reduce the wear and tear on the French Field track. He also wants to hold three to four collegiate meets at CSU, whose teams are coming off some of the most successful seasons in school history.\nHe said the Jack Christiansen Memorial Track renovation should wrap up by the end of this month. He said CSU agreed six months ago to allow the Rocky Mountain Senior Games to use the facility in September. An Oct. 13 alumni event will also be held at the track. Other than that, the track will largely be under lock and key.\nIt's a reality McCullough hopes is only temporary.\n\u201cWe just want to find a way back on the track,\u2019\u2019 he said."}

And that is why people die from an overdose.\"\nHowever, Naloxone has the power to reverse a life-threatening overdose.\n\"What Narcan does is it enters the bloodstream, goes to the very same receptor, and actually knocks the opiate off and binds to it extremely tightly in order to reverse those side effects,\" says Dr. Peak. \"So when someone who has had an opioid overdose, they can wake up and start breathing on their own. The most important thing to remember if that happens, you need to call 911 because there are a lot of steps that need to be done to help that individual.\"\nDr. Peak says someone who is not breathing can start to die within five minutes, but Narcan starts working within seconds to help reverse that process and save a life.\n\"It is like insurance, it is better to have it and not use it than to need it and not have it,\" says Gaddie. \"Every house should have some because you never know when that time comes when you are going to need it.\"\nDr. Peak and Gaddie have the same plea for everyone to carry Narcan and learn to use it.\n\"Lives are valuable, regardless if they are addicts or"}

Sniper fire killed one man and wounded two others, residents said.\nMikati's resignation on Friday came after a ministerial meeting was deadlocked by a dispute with Hezbollah.\nThe Shiite militant and political movement has dominated Lebanese politics in recent years and helped put Mikati into office after toppling the previous government.\n\"Now it is important for dialogue to begin and for a salvation government to be established during this difficult period,\" Mikati wrote on his official Twitter page after handing in his resignation to the president.\n\"I thank God that I left office the same way I came in, with integrity.\"\nHezbollah opposed extending the term of a senior security official, Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, and the creation of an oversight body for the planned June election, which may now be delayed after the collapse of Mikati's government.\nRifi, head of Lebanon's internal security forces, is due to retire early next month. He, like Mikati, is a Sunni Muslim from Tripoli, and is distrusted by Hezbollah.\nPutting together a caretaker government could take months. It took Mikati five months to put together his government after he became prime minister in 2011 when Hezbollah and its partners brought down the unity government of Saad al-Hariri.\nBut tensions over Syria have put him at odds with the group that brought him to power and which strongly backs President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.\nUnder Lebanon's division of power, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the president a Maronite Christian and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim.\nFormer Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, a close political ally of Hariri who had frequently called for Mikati to step down, said the resignation \"opens the possibility of fresh dialogue\" between Lebanon's political camps.\nMikati had sought to distance his country \u2014 which fought its own 15-year-long civil war \u2014 from Syria's strife. But in the ex-prime minister's home city of Tripoli, two people died in clashes on Friday between militants supporting opposing sides of the Syria conflict.\nThe influx of Syrian refugees, as well as Lebanon's own political divisions, have caused a sharp slowdown in Lebanon's economy and a 67 percent surge in its budget deficit last year.\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm in a statement after Mikati's resignation.\n\"At this challenging time for the region, the Secretary-General calls on all parties in Lebanon to remain united behind the leadership of President Suleiman,\" the statement said.\n\"He also calls on them to work together"}

{"idx": "3975", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Grant Clauser, author of \"Magician's Handbook.\"\nAs its title makes plain, the latest collection from Hatfield poet Grant Clauser boasts a unifying theme: magic, both the stage variety associated with pulling rabbits out of hats and sawing ladies in half, and the more mystical sort connected to omens, portents, and the paranormal.\nCenter-stage, of course, is the magician himself. Indeed, the sequence chronicles his life, from high school to when he meets his wife to when he turns 40, then 60, to when he's on his deathbed, and much else in between. The range of thought and feeling is shrewdly bracketed by Magic in Theory and Practice, which precedes the entire collection, and the title poem, which begins Part 3: The Magus.\nBut when we get to the title poem, we learn that \"It's not the lost loves / he regrets / or the lean years \u2026 but that he'd spent / so much time / hiding how it's done / that he forgot / how it ends.\"\nSuch melancholy correspondences between hiding and escape occur throughout. On turning 40, the magician worries that someday, after performing tricks for children, \"an enthusiastic parent / will pat him too hard on the back / and shake loose / every dove and throwing knife, / and he'll be caught naked / like a tree in winter \u2026 \" On turning 60, \"He's sure someone / in the audience / is snoring \u2026 \"\nbut not knowing how it's done.\nThis harks back to that prefatory Magic in Theory and Practice, which assures that \"The real magic / is that we choose \u2026 knowing all the time / it's a trick.\"\nThis is, in short, a tightly integrated collection. The correspondences are no surprise. Alchemy, after all, was a kind of magic derived from chemistry, grounded in such axioms as \"as above, so below\" \u2014 that this life on earth is prefigured in the chemistry of the stars.\nNowhere is Clauser's sense of this clearer than in Darwinian: \"At some point we all need / to evolve like animals, crawl / from water into air and leave / another skin behind \u2026 \" The problem, though, is \"skins have their own / lives, vestiges of love / and scars we try to hide \u2026 \" What an insightful connection between biology and heartache.\nThere is little sense of the transcendent at work here, though that may be an illusion. The History of Magic Part I tells of the discovery of fire, how they \"carried it from / camp to camp / scaring and bewildering the children / who grew so fond of it / they gave it new names.\" Then, \"One day as they carried the body / of an elder out to a field / one of the children / remembered the fire \u2026 fetched it / and touched it / to the old man's body / and in that moment / invented god.\"\nsend the dark back into corners.\nBut apparently we can ask, and we have received gifts. The magic at work here is that Clauser never invites you to think as he does, but to figure things out for yourself to your own satisfaction.\nFrank Wilson is a retired Inquirer book editor.

A new study predicts these futuristic vehicles could be good for your commute and good for the environment \u2014 as long as they\u2019re used on long-distance trips with several carpool buddies.\nThe finding, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, could help guide the development of flying cars so they\u2019ll have more in common with a plug-in electric vehicle than a gas-guzzling SUV.\nThese flying cars \u2014 known officially as vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or VTOLs (pronounced \u201cv-tolls\u201d) \u2014 won\u2019t be getting off the ground regularly for a few more years, at least. But engineers already have a pretty good idea of how they would operate.\nGenerally speaking, they would begin their flights by rising straight into the air like a helicopter, then climb to at least 1,000 feet. Once they reach cruising altitude, they are capable of flying about 150 miles per hour. When it\u2019s time to land, the final descent would be vertical as well.\nA VTOL could get in and out of tight spaces. The amount of real estate needed to park four school buses side by side would be more than enough.\nBut could a VTOL compete with traditional cars in terms of greenhouse gas emissions?\nThis is an important consideration, because scientists say the world needs to begin reducing its total emissions within the next decade to avoid the worst effects of climate change. By 2050 or so, they say, net carbon emissions will need to be nearly zero.\nCleaning up the transportation system will be a big part of that. Transportation is responsible for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S, and 60% of those emissions come from light duty vehicles like passenger cars, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nTo see whether flying cars have a role to play in a sustainable future, Kasliwal and his coauthors from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Co. compared a hypothetical battery-powered flying car to two vehicles that travel on the ground: a regular car powered by an internal combustion engine, and a battery-powered electric car.\nThe researchers simulated a variety of scenarios.\nFirst, they considered the emissions that each kind of car would produce if it carried a single passenger. The regular car releases greenhouse gases through its tailpipe. The electric car and the flying car wouldn\u2019t produce emissions directly, so the researchers considered the pollution associated with generating the electricity needed to power them.\nFor short trips up to 35 kilometers (about 22 miles), the regular car produced fewer emissions than the flying car. For longer trips, the flying car was cleaner to operate.\nBut in this analysis, the flying car could never match the low emissions of the electric car. In fact, it didn\u2019t even come close unless the trip was more than 120 km (about 75 miles).\nHowever, the researchers noted that people won\u2019t always be traveling solo. So they redid their calculations assuming that the regular car and the electric car had 1.54 passengers (which is the actual average in the U.S.) and that the flying car had 3 passengers (not including the pilot).\nWhen they considered the greenhouse gas emissions per passenger for a trip lasting 100 km (about 60 miles), they found that the flying car was 52% cleaner than the regular car and 6% cleaner than the electric car.\nThe key for the flying car is to spend enough time in the air \u2014 and carry enough passengers \u2014 to justify the"}

{"idx": "3987", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A new study found that when resources were scarce, white people had different definitions of \"black\" and were less generous toward people with darker skin tones than toward people with lighter skin.\nThe Labor Department said on Friday that employers hired 217,000 workers last month, bringing the job market back to 2008 levels.\nIt took more than four years to get back to this point after the recession wiped out more than 8.7 million jobs in just two years. And most economists think we\u2019re not out of the woods yet: As my colleague Derek Thompson points out, the labor force participation rate is still at a multi-decade low.\nBut according to a new study, jobs and wealth weren\u2019t the only things we lost in the recession. All of those economic woes might have also influenced how people perceive other races and have made people less generous toward those who look different from them.\nFor a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, David Amodio, a psychology professor at New York University and Amy Krosch, a graduate student, performed a series of experiments that showed that their predominantly white study subjects tended to view biracial people as \u201cmore black\u201d when they were primed with economic scarcity, and that the subjects were stingier toward darker-complexioned people overall.\nFirst, the researchers asked 70 people to fill out a questionnaire that assessed their concern about economic competition between races. (The statements included things like, \u201cWhen blacks make economic gains, whites lose out economically.\u201d) They were then asked to identify the races of an array of images of faces, which had been created by fusing different percentages of a picture of a white person with an image of a black person.\nFinally, in a money-allocation game, the subjects were given $15 and told to split it between two versions of one image\u2014one lighter and one darker in skin tone. They gave about 70 cents less to the darker face.\nOf course, past studies have also shown that scarcity and resource competition fosters distrust between groups. The ingroup/outgroup cognitive bias theory holds that we prefer people who resemble us. But this research suggests that financial strain can cause the very definition of the \u201cout\u201d group to change, as well, by nudging us to view people of other races as even more dissimilar to ourselves.\nBlack Americans were especially hard-hit by the recent economic slump: From 2007 to 2009, median household wealth decreased by 16 percent for whites and 53 percent for blacks. In hard times, it could be that minority groups are disadvantaged not just by structural economic factors, but also by our attempts to alienate those who look different from us.\nKrosch and Amodio write that although many people harbor subtle prejudice on some level, those negative thoughts are \u201ckept in check through effortful cognitive control.\u201d But economic scarcity is mentally taxing \u2013 poverty makes it harder to maintain socially acceptable beliefs and allows ugly prejudices to sneak through.\nAnd that\u2019s a critical thing to keep in mind, since attitudes toward race can literally make or break lives and communities. Past studies have found, for example, that in death-penalty cases with white victims, the more \u201cstereotypically black\u201d the suspect looks, the more likely he or she is to be sentenced to death."}

Through three weeks of play, BC was averaging 52.7 points and 577.7 yards of total offense, both good for seventh in the country. Fans even went as far to compare the 2018 Eagles to the Matt Ryan-led teams of the late 2000s\u2014that was, until the second quarter of BC\u2019s Week Four matchup against Purdue.\nThe 0-3 Boilermakers outplayed the Eagles on both sides of the ball, outgaining head coach Steve Addazio\u2019s team, 200-37, in total yards during the first half of action. Fifth-year senior quarterback David Blough carved up BC\u2019s secondary, tossing a trio of touchdowns for 296 yards. Meanwhile, Anthony Brown put on the exact opposite kind of performance, throwing four interceptions, three of which came on successive drives. To make matters worse, A.J. Dillon had the worst game of his career as a starter, averaging just 3.1 yards on 19 carries.\nHonestly, Addazio and Co. looked reminiscent of the same Eagles that started the 2017 season 2-4\u2014a group haunted by turnovers, missed tackles, and predictable play-calling. Granted, it\u2019s important to remember that one game hardly defines a season, and if BC was to lose any contest this year, it was a non-conference matchup in West Lafayette, Ind.\nMoreover, personnel-wise, the Eagles are way better than the team that showed up to Ross-Ade Stadium on Saturday. Regardless, after that kind of outing\u2014one that had Addazio telling reporters \u201cI don\u2019t know what that was\u201d in the postgame press conference\u2014it\u2019s pretty clear the Eagles aren\u2019t the 23rd-best team in the nation, at least not yet.\nNon-conference or not, the blowout was still costly. The 17-point drubbing stripped the Eagles of not only their national ranking, but also a spot in the receiving votes section of the AP Poll. Just like that, the number next to BC\u2019s name, as well as the corresponding hype, vanished.\nLuckily for the Eagles, they weren\u2019t the only ones that were humiliated on Saturday\u2014actually, it was a theme throughout the ACC, a pattern that could very well linger on for the rest of the year. We\u2019re a quarter of the way through the regular season, and it\u2019s apparent, especially after what transpired last year, that the conference just isn\u2019t what it used to be.\nVirginia Tech\u2014one of several ACC teams affected by Hurricane Florence\u2014had about two weeks to prepare for Old Dominion, a team that started the season 0-3, even losing its season opener to Liberty, 52-10. It was all but assumed that the Hokies would cross the state and walk away with their third win of 2018. Instead, they were handed one of the biggest upsets in school history.

Notre-Dame de Paris, \u201cOur Lady of Paris\u201d, built between the 12th and the 14th centuries on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, the larger of the two islands in the river Seine in the heart of Paris, counted undoubtedly among them in its incomparable Gothic splendor.\nBut the fire has ripped the heart out of the building. The body of the church from the transept in the middle up to the two towers and down to the choir has been burned, leaving only the bare side walls standing.\nWhat 800 years of history with wars, revolutions and natural calamities have not done was destroyed within a couple of hours by a raging fire, likely set off by workmen renovating the exterior of the roof.\nYet a first look in the morning after the fire, with the last ambers barely extinct, seemed to allay one's worst fears of seeing a building in ruins.\nThe frontal view - though distant due to the police barricades blocking off half of the island, including the famous Cathedral Square Parvis de Notre-Dame, a familiar sight to any and all Paris tourists - is reassuring.\nBoth famous clock towers, known to millions around the world as the haunts of the \u201cHunchback of Notre-Dame\u201d, are still standing, barely blackened.\nBut it was quite another sight however from the back of the cathedral. The quays of the smaller sister island Ile St Louis, immediately upstream from Ile de la Cit\u00e9 and the main bridge linking it to the Left Bank, offer a full picture of the disaster.\nThe entirely wooden roof of the church is totally gone, the metallic scaffolding surrounding it for the said renovation blackened, bent and partly collapsed.\nThe sparkling, rose shaped stained-glass windows on both ends of the transept, even though looking intact from a distance, appear dark and blind.\nNo wonder then that dozens of TV transmission vans are parked there and thousands of spectators mingle. Europe, if not the world, seemed to have skipped a heart beat in the face of seeing such a symbol almost disappear.\nThe fire broke out an hour before a scheduled major speech by French President Emmanuel Macron, which was supposed to have detailed the government\u2019s answer to public dissatisfaction, spearheaded by the Yellow Vest movement.\nWhen Macron cancelled his speech due to the unfolding disaster at Notre-Dame, some speculated that the calamity\u2019s timing did suspiciously help Macron to switch to his favorite role of \u201cpater patriae\u201d (father of the country) in a dark hour for the nation.\nThe Paris Fire Brigade did, according to experts in the media, a very credible job of being able to save the towers and most stone walls. They also evacuated some priceless treasures from the inside the blazing building.\nOne picture that went around the world was the church\u2019s spire, high over the transept falling in flames \u2013 the medieval one having been brought down by the French revolutionaries at the"}

Whether following media coverage of the Long Island Serial Killer or watching Dexter, the public possesses a seemingly insatiable appetite for the macabre.\n[eventbug id=\"comic-con-2011\"]Comic book fans are no strangers to stranglers and other killers. Batman's notorious rogues' gallery boasts multiple serial murderers among its members. While some of these fictional characters reflect real-life aspects of serial murder, others perpetuate long-standing misconceptions.\nThe FBI defines serial murder as \"the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events.\" Specific motives for murder are commonly seen in the offender: sexual gratification, anger, thrill, attention and the alleviation of anxious urges, among others. Serial killers may also demonstrate a modus operandi, ritualized behaviors or signature aspects; for example, a killer may manipulate or mutilate the body after a murder.\nSometimes comics characters mimic the hideous acts of real-world serial killers. In the story arc \"The Last Arkham,\" by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle (from Batman: Shadow of the Bat, issues 1-4), Mr. Zsasz positions his victims' bodies in lifelike poses. In real life, one victim of Gary Leon Ridgway, aka the Green River Killer, was found fully clothed, with two fish placed on her chest, a wine bottle on her stomach and sausages in her hands.\nSome serial murderers keep trophies of their kills. In Batman: Cacophony, by Kevin Smith and Walt Flanagan, Onomatopoeia displays in his \"man cave\" masks of the heroes he has killed. Real-life serial killer Ed Gein fashioned trophies from the remains of his victims; a mounted human head was discovered in Gein's possession, ready to be hung.\nBroadcast Thought's comics-dissecting doctors (left to right): Praveen R. Kambam, M.D.; Vasilis K. Pozios, M.D.; H. Eric Bender, M.D.\nScientific and legal jargon can contribute to confusion about serial murderers, their methods and their motives. By analyzing fictional characters, we at Broadcast Thought passionately educate audiences about mental health topics and excite them to learn more about mental illness. We'll be discussing these ideas Thursday during \"Detecting Deviants in the Dark Night: Profiling Gotham City's Serial Killers,\" our panel at Comic-Con International.\nHow do we fit into the entertainment world? With our expertise as physicians specializing in forensic psychiatry, we offer a unique opportunity for collaboration with writers and other creators to add nuance and realism to characters and storylines that can make them even more compelling.

That would fit in with some of the more macabre jokes I got from crowdsourcing the question \u201cHow will \"Mad Men\" end?\u201d on Facebook.\nFirst there were the Durst jokes: two people suggested it ends with Don wearing a hot mike in a cold bathroom, looking in the mirror, and blathering to himself, \u201cWhat did I do? Why, I killed them all.\u201d That\u2019s the shockeroo ending for the HBO documentary, \u201cThe Jinx\u201d \u2014 and in real life, what got Bobby Durst arrested for the murder of his friend Susan Berman. Fade to black.\nCertainly, Don, the poor orphan boy, had a very different background from the mad real-estate scion. But they were both hugely hurt by their mothers\u2019 early deaths, a profound loss that was probably the root of much of their underlying sadness. Of course, Durst is far more mentally ill than Don, but he also had a propensity for changing identities. In the case of the murder of his neighbor Morris Black, Durst took a woman\u2019s name, claimed he was mute, and wore a wig and a dress.\nHigh heels don\u2019t seem to be part of Don\u2019s wheelhouse, though.\nAnother key difference is that Don seems to have a conscience, and feels shame about the messes he creates, which he sometimes self-medicates away with drinking. He did come clean to the agency during the Hershey meeting debacle, and to his kids, even dragging them to see the crumbling House of Ill Repute he grew up in. He tries to make amends, repeatedly, which is very un-Durst like.\nHow about the D.B. Cooper scenario, which I have written about previously? It was first suggested in a story on Medium that Don will turn out to be the legendary skyjacker known as D.B. (actually, Dan) Cooper, who in 1971 hijacked a Boeing 727 and jumped out of the rear of the plane somewhere between Seattle and Reno, never to be heard from again. In many accounts, the details of Cooper\u2019s looks, dress, and manner seemed to uncannily match Don\u2019s.\nThough I\u2019m attracted to the whole set-up, I doubt that showrunner Matthew Weiner would use something that has already circulated so widely in the culture. By now, there are so many people obsessed with the Dan/Don link that Julia Turner of Slate recently interviewed Geoffrey Gray, whose 2012 book \u201cSkyjack\u201d chronicled Cooper\u2019s disappearance.\nBut consider this: in the promo photos, it seems that the cast has all adopted '70s wardrobes, and apparently, Roger has even grown an impressive silver 'stache. Not Don, who seems to stick with his '60s duds.\nI worried last week that the character who opens the window and actually jumps, fulfilling the promise of the credit sequence, is Pete, who also wants to hold on to his ex-wife and seems very lost. Jamie Malanowski, a writer, suggested on my FB post that Pete gets recruited by H. R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman for Nixon\u2019s White House. That sounds just right"}
