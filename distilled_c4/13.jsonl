{"idx": "13001", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In developing economies such as Myanmar, microfinance is often viewed as a means for lifting people out of poverty. As of 2015, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) comprised 99% of the country\u2019s businesses, and many of those are micro-businesses.\nMicrofinance is often cited as an essential tool in helping women in particular rise from poverty. The theory goes that when you empower women to grow their businesses, they\u2019re able to secure their families\u2019 finances and create pathways toward education and improved quality of life for their children.\nDespite this optimistic premise, however, NPR wrote last year that \u201cbased on the economic studies that have been done to date, it doesn't appear that increasing access to microloans is an effective strategy for helping more women start businesses that will allow them to vault themselves out of poverty, at least not on a large enough scale to be detected.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that microfinance fails universally. But it does illustrate the complexities of getting microfinance right.\nMicrofinance options are often deployed to serve the underserved -- people who lack credit or banking histories. These people are often poor and considered high-risk borrowers, too high-risk to interest traditional banks and lenders. In many cases, they turn to independent lenders who may charge extremely high interest rates on relatively small loans. Al Jazeera recently chronicled the cycle of indebtedness that plagues many in Yangon and forces women to become prostitutes or borrow endlessly just to stay ahead of their interest payments.\nMicro-loans from qualified lending organizations can provide alternatives, though these come with their own sets of problems. They, too, can charge high interest rates and the group loan approach often applied to high-risk, micro-entrepreneur communities obscures whether the financing has benefitted individuals on a long-term basis.\nFrom a lender\u2019s perspective, the tendency toward high interest rates is understandable. The borrowers are by definition high-risk, and their business ventures are susceptible to ruination by climate disasters and economic or political upheaval, said Phyu Yamin Myat, managing director of Myanmar Development Partners in Yangon. She noted that most microfinance institutions (MFI) apply a \u201ctemplate\u201d approach to lending. The template includes group-guaranteed loan systems that rely on peer monitoring to ensure repayment.\nMyat said many MFIs also emphasize quick scalability and cost-efficiency above allowing time for substantial economic change to take root. She said that the microfinance organizations need to work on longer time-scales, helping their borrowers become more financially literate and stable and accounting for cultural factors that have inhibited growth thus far.\nWhen Rang De launched a pilot program to study performance among micro-credit borrowers, the organization saw a dramatic difference between those who received business mentoring during their loan cycles and those that did not. Repayment rates were high among both groups. But those that had been mentored were on track for sustained improvements. Ram said that many micro-entrepreneurs work on several income sources at a time. When they receive financing, they\u2019re unsure of how to use it effectively.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know where to apply this loan. Is it into their tailoring business, is it buying cattle, is it buying inputs for agriculture? In order to make these decisions, I think access to knowledge and information is extremely important. And that is grossly missing in the sector currently,\u201d Ram said.\nRang De recently redoubled its literacy efforts after discovering that a lack of understanding about products and widespread myths"}

The parts musicians put in their mouths were the most contaminated.\nPlaying music in the band is good for kids, but maybe not so much if that clarinet is a cesspool of bacteria and fungi.\nThat's the provocative suggestion from the Oklahoma State University for Health Sciences, where researchers found germs galore growing on brass and wind instruments that were used in high school band programs.\nThe researchers in Oklahoma City Tulsa swabbed 13 brass and wind instruments, then rubbed the swabs on petri dishes and waited to see what would grow. They found 295 different bacteria as well as yeasts and molds. The parts that musicians put in their mouths were more contaminated than the rest of the instruments, and the two clarinets showed more contamination than the other instruments. The results were published in the latest issue of General Dentistry.\nOK, that's gross. But does having bacteria in your bassoon really pose a health risk?\nYes, says Thomas Glass, a dentist and professor at Oklahoma State who was lead author of the study. In the past he has tested for pathogens on toothbrushes, dentures, and athletic mouthguards. So he wasn't too surprised to find gunk growing on band instruments. \"The bacteria can produce local infections in the mouth, in the gastrointestinal tract, and in the respiratory tract,\" Glass tells Shots. Molds can cause allergic reactions, and skin infections are a risk, too, he says.\nGlass's study didn't look to see if the high schoolers who played these grubby instruments had health problems. And there's precious little evidence of rampant infections associated with practicing \"Stars and Stripes Forever.\"\nBut a few pulmonologists have reported patients coming in with lung problems. A letter from 1988 in the journal Chest told the tale of a 67-year-old saxophone player with a cough and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pulmonitis from candida, and it turned out the saxophone mouthpiece was contaminated with that fungus. The symptoms disappeared after the musician started washing the instrument's mouthpiece with soap and water.\nMore recently, a 48-year-old French saxophonist with inflamed lungs from a moldy saxophone also got a write-up in Chest. In the same issue last September, a pulmonologist at the University of Connecticut Health Center reported on a 35-year-old professional trombone player who had been suffering from a cough and shortness of breath for 15 years.

Caterpillars start out as minuscule tube-like creatures when they emerge from their tiny eggs. Then they go about their only purpose which is to eat as much as they can. Most caterpillars, and all the ones we have here, eat leaves. This understandably alarms gardeners. Some types of caterpillars get to be the size of a burly thumb.

Two years ago the public\u2019s expectations for virtual reality\u2019s potential was at its peak. Many believed (and still continue to believe) that VR would transform the way we connect, interact and communicate in our personal and professional lives.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why this excitement exists once you put on a head-mounted display. While there are still a limited number of compelling experiences, after you test some of the early successes in the field, it\u2019s hard not to extrapolate beyond the current state of affairs to a magnificent future where the utility of virtual reality technology is pervasive.\nYet, the virtual reality market has continued its slow march to mass adoption, and there are tangible indicators that suggest we could be nearing an inflection point.\n2018 has seen disappointing progress in aggregate headset growth. The overall market is forecasted to ship 8.9 million headsets in 2018, up from an approximate aggregate shipment of ~8.3 million in 2017, according to IDC. On the surface, those numbers hardly describe a market at its inflection point.\nHowever, most of the decline in growth rate can be attributed to two factors. First, screenless viewers have seen a significant decline in shipments as device manufacturers have stopped shipping them alongside smartphones. In the second quarter of 2018, 409,000 screenless viewers were shipped compared to approximately 1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Second, tethered VR headsets have also declined as manufacturers have slowed down the pricing discounts that acted as a steroid to sales growth in 2017.\nLooking at the market for standalone HMDs, however, reveals a more promising figure. Standalone VR headsets grew 417 percent due to the global availability of the Oculus Go and Xiaomi Mi VR. Over time, these headsets are going to be the driver of the VR market as they offer significant advantages compared to tethered headsets.\nThe shift from tethered to standalone VR headsets is significant. It represents a paradigm shift within the immersive ecosystem, where developers have a truly mobile platform that is powerful enough to enable compelling user experiences.\nThere are a few names that come to mind when thinking about products that are available for purchase in the VR market: Samsung, Facebook (Oculus), HTC and PlayStation. A plethora of new products from these marquee names \u2014 and products from new companies entering the market \u2014 are opening the category for a new customer segment.\nFor the past few years, the market effectively had two segments. The first was a \u201cmass market\u201d segment with notorious devices such as the Google Cardboard and the Samsung Gear, which typically sold for less than $100 and offered severely constrained experiences to consumers. The second segment was a \u201cpro market,\u201d with a few notable devices, such as the HTC Vive, that required absurdly powerful computing rigs to operate, but offered consumers more compelling, immersive experiences.\nIt\u2019s possible that this new emerging segment will dramatically open up the total addressable VR market. This \u201cpremium\u201d market segment offers product alternatives that are somewhat more expensive than the mass market, but are significantly differentiated in the potential experiences that can be offered (and with much less friction than the \u201cpro market\u201d).\nThe Oculus Go, the Xiaomi Mi VR and the Lenovo Solo are"}

{"idx": "13022", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The government may be picking up the tab for nearly half of the nation\u2019s health care expenses by the end of the decade, but very little of the increase will be due to the health care reform law, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs.\nAnalysis from government number crunchers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded that the law will help insure 30 million Americans who currently lack coverage, while increasing health costs by 0.1 percent more than what would have been expected without the overhaul.\nThe report from the CMS Office of the Actuary projected that health expenses will rise 5.8 percent annually over the next decade \u2014 1.1 percent higher than anticipated economic growth.\nThat kind of growth will mean the nation\u2019s total health tab will come close to $4.6 trillion in 2020, accounting for about one-fifth of the U.S. gross domestic product.\nAccording to the report, the federal government\u2019s share of the bill is likely to increase from 27 percent in 2009 to 31 percent by 2020. Add to that expenses incurred by local governments and states, and the overall government portion of health care comes in at 49 percent, according to the report.\nEven so, the study found that last year\u2019s national health spending grew at 3.9 percent \u2014 the slowest rate ever recorded, and one that was probably due to the lingering effects of the recession. When millions of Americans lost their jobs and health insurance, they were forced to skip pricey but needed medical procedures and drugs. As the economy recovers, that rate is expected to bounce back.\nIn 2014, when the major coverage expansions take effect, health spending will probably surge to 8.3 percent as 30 million additional Americans gain coverage through Medicaid and private insurance plans, the report concludes. But the rate is expected to drop back to 6.2 percent in the second half of the decade as cost-control mechanisms of the reform law begin to take hold.\nAmerica\u2019s continually expanding health care costs can generally be traced to a variety of factors, including a growing and aging population, increased Medicare enrollment and expensive medical innovations.\nBut many of those forced to sign up for coverage under the reform law will be younger, healthy Americans who don\u2019t need the high-dollar treatments. For that reason, health insurance coverage, prescription drugs, and physician visits will likely grow in the next 10 years at a faster pace than hospital costs. Spending on prescription drugs alone is expected to increase by about 5 percentage points in 2014, to 10.7 percent. And with better access to needed drugs for preventive care, costs for expensive emergency treatments are also expected to dip.\nDemocrats and liberal groups warmly embraced that view Thursday.\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d with the findings.\nShe added that other provisions of the health reform law \u2014 such as Accountable Care Organizations, which will aim to bring down costs by getting doctors and hospitals to coordinate care \u2014 were not considered in the report.\n\u201cWe know these new provisions will save money for the health care system, even if today\u2019s report doesn\u2019t credit these strategies with reducing costs,\u201d she wrote.\nKathryn Nix, a policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, interpreted the numbers much differently. She noted that the same CMS actuaries behind Thursday\u2019s report have warned that the cost-cutting measures embedded in the health care reform law may turn out to be unsustainable if the reform law does not"}

But last year a war veteran in Ho Chi Minh City filed accusations with the central government saying that Quang's credentials were fake.\nThis prompted the ministry to check the doctorate's authenticity again and it then concluded that degree was actually a pre-doctorate.\nAccording to the VTC News report, Quang claimed that he declared his educational degree was a doctorate in accordance with the health ministry's decision assigning him to his post.\nAmong other accusations against Quang are those made by the HCMC-based BV Pharma Joint-venture Co.\nThe company claimed that Quang has falsely accused the company of illegally selling Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The substance is used to produce common flu and allergy remedies, but can also be used to make illegal methamphetamine.\nIt also accused Quang of abusing power by asking the company to lend him VND1 billion (US$48,000) in 2007.\nEarlier, in 2009, the deputy health minister received a warning from the Party's inspectorate for several violations, including false accusations against the US-owned Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) Vietnam.\nQuang had sent a letter to MSD's chief executive officer and administrative president for the Asia-Pacific region complaining about the company's unethical lobbying activities related to a vaccine against the human papillomavirus, according to the inspectorate's report at that time."}

In terms of sticking on the roster, it helps that he\u2019s a cheap, serviceable starter.\nKilgore has two years left on his contract, with a $2.2 million base salary in 2019 and a $3.0 million salary in 2020.\nPro Football Focus gave Kilgore a 52.9 grade for his four games last season, which would have ranked 31st of 38 centers if Kilgore had enough snaps to qualify.

Is it me you're looking for?\"\nThe 66-year-old American star looked on in open-mouthed astonishment and delight. \"Glastonbury, what the hell is going on?\" he repeatedly asked. \"There's people here know these songs better than I do.\" Once a superstar of pop and soul who enjoyed two decades of global sales in the multi-millions, both solo and with The Commodores, Richie\u2019s hits started drying up in the Nineties.\nThough he still commands arena-sized audiences today, he looked genuinely moved at the lusty response to songs like Dancing on the Ceiling, Three Times a Lady and Say You, Say Me. The sound made by 200,000 people singing in unison is quite something to behold. It was a sincere affirmation of his real standing in pop culture as a hit-maker of the highest order.\nRichie benefited from what has become a traditional Sunday afternoon slot at Glastonbury, when mainstream artists not usually associated with muddy festival counterculture are invited to perform. Essentially their role is to provide a break from the hard partying on the festival's final day, and a point of common ground to unite the huge range of pop subcultures in attendance. Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers and (though he has a more rock credibility) Paul Simon have all fulfilled this role and enjoyed similarly massive and effusive crowds.\nThis kind of performance works partly because it has novelty value in such a setting. With all the silly hats, colourful costumes and glittery face make up, the festival gives audiences an excuse to release notions of coolness and constraint and just have some fun. And what it reveals is that, whatever opinions rock and rave audiences might think they hold about the triteness and triviality of commercial chart music, at heart we are all suckers for a big, meaty tune delivered with technical aplomb and emotional sincerity. That, after all, is the ground pop culture was built on.\nThe sight and sound of Glastonbury festival uniting to sing \"We are the world, we are the children\" is one neither Richie nor anyone else present is likely to forget."}

But that whiz-bang wow factor only goes so far when your narrative plays like little more than a two-hour trailer for the next film and your characters are about as emotionally resonant as the enchanted suitcase that drives much of the plot. It doesn\u2019t help matters that the J.K. Rowling\u2019s script exposits in all the wrong places, setting up plotlines for the next film while failing to give us a reason to care about what happens in this one.\nIn concurrence with my opinions on the prior film, this installment of Fantastic Beasts benefits from its period setting. Unlike director David Yates\u2019 last outing in the Wizarding World, however, Grindelwald\u2019s Paris setting lacks the specificity of the previous movie\u2019s New York. There\u2019s an anonymity to the geography that persists despite the arbitrary insertion of landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, and as a result, the film feels less well-considered than its antecedent. Still, the magic battles look pretty cool if you don\u2019t care why they\u2019re happening.\nSo, should you see The Crimes of Grindelwald? I don\u2019t know. Do you want to find out what Johnny Depp did with his contacts from Black Mass? If you\u2019re absolutely hellbent on getting some more Potter in your life, I guess this is your best bet \u2014 but why anyone would feel the need to beat this particular dead horse is beyond me. I guess there\u2019s still money to be milked from the Fantastic Beasts franchise, so I\u2019ll presumably be here in a couple of years complaining about the same paper-thin characters and talking about budget"}

Lawn signs reading \"We're watching you\" and \"How many surgeries were cancelled today?\" are creeping across B.C. Signs that reflect anger over cuts to health services are just one tactic adopted by groups formed across the province in the past two years. Groups in the Interior, on Vancouver Island, and in the Lower Mainland are taking creative approaches to their advocacy because, they say, negotiating with the government and its agencies alone is a waste of time.\nThe Delta Health Coalition is one group whose members are tired of talking. Coalition steering committee member Al Webb says the community is still suffering from cuts the Fraser Health Authority made to the Delta Hospital two years ago. The coalition has lost patience with the boardroom, says Webb. \"We are of the opinion that if we can create a big enough disturbance and embarrass this government in as many ways as we can, and embarrass the Fraser Health Authority, then we can have some sort of a reprieve.\n\"After a failed campaign to recall their MLA Val Roddick, who they say spearheaded the cuts to B.C. hospitals, the coalition appealed to the Corporation of Delta to take the Fraser Health Authority to court. The municipality filed a claim in B.C. Supreme Court last February, saying the health authority is violating the Health Authority Act, the Health and Social Services Delivery Improvement Act, and the Hospital Act.\nThe health services available in Delta are not up to snuff, says George Harvie, chief administrative officer of the Corporation of Delta. \"The mayor and council and the community are quite frustrated over the reduced services.\" Harvie says the cuts to Delta's hospital, including the removal of all 65 acute care beds, are costing the corporation, which must pay to transport patients to other hospitals. He couldn't say how much Delta is spending, because they're still tallying the costs.\nAt the urging of the health coalition, Delta city council set up a phone hotline in April for patients to call with their hospital horror stories. Those stories will be used as ammunition in the court case, says Webb. \"What they're doing to Delta, and what they're doing to Deltapatients, is next to criminal,\" he says.\nThe lawsuit is a last resort. Community groups have met repeatedly with the health authority but without success. \"[We can't] go cap in hand and say 'Please sir, may I?' That, with these guys, just doesn't work. You've got to smack them with a two-by-four a couple of times before you get their attention,\" says Webb.\nHe is hopeful the lawsuit will succeed. \"I'm sure that council [would] not going to undertake a lengthy and costly legal fight if they didn't have some expectation that they might be able to win it.\"\nDelta isn't the only B.C. community to try taking a health authority to court.\nThe Nelson Save Our Services group launched a suit in July 2002, saying the reorganization of health services in the West Kootenay violates the Canada Health Act and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which state all Canadians should have equal access to adequate health care.\nRobin Cherbo, president of the Nelson SOS, says the society is collecting incident reports as evidence lives are at risk.

State, get ready for our upcoming Emerging Issues Forum, ReCONNECT to Community, which will focus on civic engagement.\nOn Sept. 17 in Asheville and on UNC-TV\u2019s North Carolina Channel, we\u2019ll bring together some of the nation\u2019s and the state\u2019s leading thinkers and doers on rebuilding community. We\u2019ll hear from New York Times columnist David Brooks and top elected officials. But we\u2019ll also hear from communities across the state that are making real progress in re-energizing civic engagement.\nSome people have asked us: what\u2019s the return on investment on that? I don\u2019t know that you can put a dollar figure on it, but let me tell you about the generational ripple effects such a \u201creconnection to community\u201d has had on my family.\nI had an aunt who grew up to run a factory in China, and my mother served as a laboratory director at Rex Hospital by the end of her career. My brother works as a computer programmer, I just had a cousin graduate from East Carolina University with honors and I\u2019m sitting here writing this column.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just about job titles or economic opportunity; it\u2019s about the way my family\u2019s lives have been and will be richer and full of more options for generations to come because of the decision that one community made so long ago. It is the way my family members are in better positions to be the helpers for others in need.\nThat is the power of community. We lift ourselves up when we lift everybody up and we can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re not talking and connecting with each other.\nIt\u2019s not 1953 anymore and it might not be so easy to know most of our neighbors, but we can learn new ways to know a lot of them, and our lives and communities will be richer for it.\nBeth Hatcher is a communications specialist for the Institute of Emerging Issues.

It would help grandparents if they understand some basic teachings of the Church about baptism of their grandchildren, because sometimes well-intentioned grandparents violate the Church\u2019s teachings about baptism without even realizing it.\nWhat joy to welcome the birth of a grandchild.\nSo many dreams are fulfilled, and each new baby brings great hope to the entire family. Yet what are grandparents to do when their son or daughter does not want to baptize his or her child?\nGrandparents know that the parents are depriving the grandchild of the most necessary of graces, failing to direct the newborn to his or her supernatural end.\nAfter conversations fail to bear immediate fruit, some grandparents are tempted to secretly baptize the grandchild without the consent of the parents. However, grandparents need to know that this practice is contrary to the law of the Church and sinful.\nThe Code of Canon Law states, \"For an infant to be baptized lawfully, it is required that the parents, or at least one of them, or the person who lawfully holds their place, give their consent\" (868).\nIn his Summa Theologiae, St. Thomas Aquinas explains that parents are, by the natural law, responsible for their children, and \"it would be contrary to natural justice if such children were baptized against their parents\u2019 will\" (III, q. 68, a. 10).\nUnder normal circumstances, no one, not even a grandparent, has the right to baptize a child contrary to the parents\u2019 will.\nNot only would the baptism by a grandparent be a violation of the natural law, but, as St. Thomas writes, \"Under the circumstances, it would be dangerous to baptize the children of unbelievers; for they would be liable to lapse into unbelief by reason of their natural affection for their parents.\"\nThe danger here is failing to bring the grace of baptism to fruition. For this reason, the Code of Canon Law explains the requirement \"that there be the well-founded hope that the child will be brought up in the Catholic religion. If such hope is truly lacking, the baptism is, in accordance with the provisions of particular law, to be deferred\" (868).\nThe only exception to this law would be if the child is in danger of death. Canon law states, \"An infant of Catholic parents, indeed even of non-Catholic parents, is lawfully baptized in danger of death, even if the parents are opposed to it.\"\nIf death is near, the salvation of the child\u2019s soul then prevails over the rights of the parents.\nThere is also an issue of honesty here. Grandparents who secretly baptize their grandchildren without the consent of the parents are being deceptive, willfully deceiving the parents.\nWhat will happen some years later if the grandchild finally comes for baptism, either through the parents\u2019 consent or as an adult? The grandparents will need to explain that the baptism has already occurred some years before.\nThe parents will rightfully feel betrayed, only beginning another painful conflict in the family"}

It just got even worse.\nThe founders of Instagram, the photo-and-video app that Facebook agreed to buy shortly before its 2012 IPO, are leaving the company. Bloomberg News reported that the founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, grew frustrated as Facebook impinged on their autonomy.\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Instagram was the best acquisition in the technology industry for at least the last decade, and the founders were symbolically and pragmatically important to the most important growth asset that Facebook has right now.\nBut this, my friends, is a truly terrible time for the Instagram founders to leave.\nThe optics are terrible, first off. Facebook is trying to project confidence that it\u2019s moving past its two years of near constant crises involving foreign propaganda infecting the social network, of people and government officials using Facebook and its WhatsApp app to incite violence, and realizations stemming from this year\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal that Facebook may not be worthy of people\u2019s trust with their private time and digital lives.\nBut the blow to Facebook is far more than optics. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s CEO, made a (probably disingenuous) claim recently that Instagram grew far faster under Facebook\u2019s corporate umbrella than it could have if Instagram had stayed an independent company. It\u2019s fair to say that Instagram could have died as a little startup in Facebook\u2019s long shadow, and it definitely benefited from the discipline, infrastructure and advertising sales machine that it accessed as a semi-autonomous region inside of mother Facebook.\nMore recently, though, it\u2019s been Facebook that needs Instagram more than the other way around, and that makes the departure of the Instagram founders a particularly painful sting.\nHow does Facebook need Instagram? First, there are the pragmatic needs. Facebook hasn\u2019t been cool for many years, and people have always proclaimed they were using Facebook less even as data showed they were using Facebook more. But it does seem that people feel less good about using Facebook now for a variety of reasons, and it\u2019s running out of untapped users. Daily users of Facebook have flat-lined in North America, the most important market for advertising.\nInstagram is a different matter. It\u2019s still growing fast, it\u2019s among the go-to apps for young people, and people aren\u2019t embarrassed to say they love it. Instagram is that fresh-faced woman who breezes onto the airplane at 5 a.m. with not a care in the world. Facebook is the bedraggled one boarding last with so much baggage.\nFacebook also needs Instagram financially. The company has started to disclose that the increasing number of ads on Instagram is a significant contributor to Facebook\u2019s revenue growth. As people spend more time in Instagram, that\u2019s where companies want to be if they have shoes or movie tickets to sell. The company spooked investors in July by forecasting a significant slowdown in revenue growth, and a significant slimming of Facebook\u2019s fat profit margins. I imagine the company\u2019s crystal ball into its own future would look much cloudier without the growth and advertising potential of Instagram.\nStrategically, too, Instagram is the center of Facebook right now. The company has proclaimed what it believes is a major and permanent shift of people\u2019s behavior toward \u201cstories,\u201d the short videos-plus-photos diaries that Snapchat pioneered and that Instagram copied to much success. Every part of Facebook, including the main social network and WhatsApp, are now emphasizing Stories, and Facebook is trying to push advertisers"}

When opening the first production train of the Yamal LNG project in late 2017, Mr Putin said the region gives Russia the opportunity to take up the fuel\u2019s \u201cniche it deserves\u201d.\nNovatek, whose biggest shareholders include Russian billionaires Leonid Mikhelson, also the chief executive, and Gennady Timchenko, as well as French energy giant Total, became Russia\u2019s top LNG producer after starting up its plant in the Yamal peninsula almost two years ago. The facility reached its full capacity at the end of 2018, ahead of schedule, doubling Russia\u2019s share of the global LNG market to 8 per cent.\nThe gas producer has aggressive plans to command a 10th of the global market by 2030, Mr Gyetvay said, and position Russia as one of the world\u2019s largest exporters.\nAll three of Yamal LNG\u2019s production units, with a combined actual capacity of 17.5 million tonnes a year, are now online. Novatek is attracting partners for a second plant, the so-called Arctic LNG 2 project, which is expected to come online in 2022.\nThe company is also considering commissioning a third facility and may increase its LNG production target for 2030 by about 20 per cent, to as much as 70 million tonnes a year.\nNovatek\u2019s resource base at two Arctic peninsulas - Yamal and Gydan - allows the company to raise production volumes to as much as 140 million tonnes a year in future, according to Mr Mik"}

The autism breakthroughs are also geared towards developing a better understanding of diagnosing autism symptoms that may or may not be an integral part of the autism spectrum.\nGenetic studies and metabolic research have contributed to autism spectrum breakthroughs in 2009. Genetic profiling of certain chosen chromosomes has shown that autistic children have a different genetic makeup on chromosome eleven. The development of glutamate receptors is closely linked to the affected part of the chromosome. These receptors are vital for the normal functioning of the brain and its other related processes. The lack of sufficient and healthy glutamate receptors might explain some common problems that fall under the broad category of the autism spectrum.\nScientists have now developed a urine test that might help detect autism in children. This is among the biggest autism breakthroughs. Autistic children have problems with the absorption and digestion of food; the lining of their gut has intestinal bacteria with a markedly different blueprint. The analysis of their urine shows that these children have a distinct metabolic urine fingerprint that is different from that of a child not suffering from autism.\nAutism treatment can start immediately once the test results are confirmed. It saves the parents and the child many traumatic years of trying to understand the problem and coming to terms with it.\nAnother amazing discovery is an intelligent speech test software.

Furthermore, the decriminalisation for private use might not be where the commercial value lies. The focus should rather be on exploring the possible benefits for the country through the controlled international trade in cannabis and its products, and also medicinal-use purposes in the domestic market.\nPotential export markets include the US, Canada and China, as some regions within these countries have decriminalised cannabis. In the state of California in the US, the value of the cannabis industry was estimated at $3 billion in 2017.

Their increasing desire for cannabis and its product is thus interesting. It would offer extra value if South Africa was to follow the route of producing the crop for international trade and medicinal use within a clearly regulated environment.\nI am not arguing for any particular policy position regarding cannabis, but rather for increased research that would assist policymakers in evaluating the benefits, and possible unintended consequences, of growing and trading cannabis. The research should take stock of the changing perceptions surrounding this crop globally, as week as its growing demand and commercial value.\nIn the coming years, depending on whether South Africa\u2019s policy position on cannabis follows global developments, the ideal provinces would be Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo due to favourable climatic conditions.\nWandile Sihlobo is an agricultural economist and head of research at Agbiz.\nWe should, but let\u2019s just remember that while marijuana is legal in for example Canada, California, Colarado \u2013 they do not permit imports at all.\nOn the positive side, we already have ten million skilled growers, so getting going will be easy.\nSeems logical although is that the only thing that can be grown in those areas?

{"idx": "13069", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Quality improvement, process improvement, physician leadership development, patient safety, physician professionalism.\nPURPOSE: Physician disrespectful behavior affects quality of care, patient safety, and collaborative clinical team function. Evidence defining the demographics, ethnography, and epidemiology of disrespectful behavior is lacking.METHOD: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of reports of disrespectful physician behavior at Stanford Hospital and Clinics from March 2011 through February 2015. Events were stratified by role, gender, specialty, and location in the hospital or clinics where the event occurred. Event rate ratios were estimated using a multivariable negative binomial regression model. Correlation of rates of faculty and trainees in the same specialty were assessed.RESULTS: One-hundred-ninety-nine events concerned faculty; 160 concerned trainees. Events were concentrated among a small number of physicians in both groups. The rates of faculty and trainee events within the same specialty were highly correlated (Spearman's rho: 0.90; P < .001). Male physicians had an adjusted event rate 1.86 (95% CI = 1.33 - 2.60; P < .001) times that of females. Procedural physicians were 3.67 times (95% CI = 2.63 - 5.13; P < .001) more likely to have a disrespectful behavior event than non-procedural physicians when adjusting for other covariates. Most common location for faculty was the operating rooms (69 events, 34%); for trainees, the medical/surgical units (43 events, 27%).CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of physician disrespectful behavior differed by role, gender, specialty, and location. Rates among faculty and trainees of the same specialty were highly correlated. These patterns can be used to create more focused education and training for specific physician groups and individualized remediation interventions.\nBecause of modern challenges in quality, safety, patient centeredness, and cost, health care is evolving to adopt leadership practices of highly effective organizations. Traditional physician training includes little focus on developing leadership skills, which necessitates further training to achieve the potential of collaborative management.The aim of this study was to design a leadership program using established models for continuing medical education and to assess its impact on participants' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance.The program, delivered over 9 months, addressed leadership topics and was designed around a framework based on how physicians learn new clinical skills, using multiple experiential learning methods, including a leadership active learning project. The program was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's assessment levels: reaction to the program, learning, changes in behavior, and results. Four cohorts are evaluated (2008-2011).Reaction: The program was rated highly by participants (mean = 4.5 of 5). Learning: Significant improvements were reported in knowledge, skills, and attitudes surrounding leadership competencies. Behavior: The majority (80%-100%) of participants reported plans to use learned leadership skills in their work. Improved team leadership behaviors were shown by increased engagement of project team members.All participants completed a team project during the program, adding value to the institution.Results support the hypothesis that learning approaches known to be effective for other types of physician education are successful when applied to leadership development training. Across all four assessment levels, the program was effective in improving leadership competencies essential to meeting the complex"}

Regardless of clear and present danger, journalists continue to fight the good fight.\nWhile reporting on the political process in Malta (ranking No. 65 on the index), Maltese reporter Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb outside her home.

The ranking should come as no surprise, as U.S. news media increasingly has experienced hostility over the past several years, particularly after the 2016 presidential election.\nAccording to RSF, this mainly is due to President Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the free press.\nRead up on America\u2019s role in a \u2018climate of hatred\u2019 for journalists on Columbia Journalism Review.\nMost surprising with the new RSF rankings might be the decline of press freedom in Europe. The United Kingdom, falling 18 places since 2002, remained at No. 40, one of the worst in Western Europe. One of the primary reasons have been new media laws in the UK which have aided in creating a hostile climate toward journalists.\nIn Myanmar, journalists face violence and threats in their commitment to hold institutions accountable. Myanmar ranks No. 137. It\u2019s been reported that two Reuters reporters have been accused of possessing secret government papers and have been arrested, potentially facing 14 years in prison.\nRanking at No. 138 (down two spots), India Prime Minister Narendra Modi is using prosecutions to gag journalists who are overly critical of the government.

To help answer these questions, I recently moderated a sponsored podcast on the new semantic search opportunity and explored how business relationships and the Business Web can be brought to bear on information overload and ecommerce value discovery.\nJoining me for the discussion are Russ Glass, vice president of product and marketing at ZoomInfo, and John Blossom, president of Shore Communications and a noted industry analyst.\nSearch engines have become a natural first point for not just Googling individuals to find general information or haphazard information, but to solve real, specific business and sales problems. In today\u2019s environment, with so much information being published by individuals and institutions, search engines don\u2019t necessarily provide the level of filtering that the average businessperson needs to be able to do solve problems effectively.\nBusinesses are getting much more intelligent about how they use the Web to present themselves as not just companies with shareware sites, but as publishers that provide in-depth information about their activities. At the same time, individuals in business are learning how to expose themselves through that instrument also.\nWhy bother? Well, our research shows that most people in business start on the open Web when they\u2019re trying to solve a business problem and find business information, as opposed to going to internal subscription services. Certainly, subscription content is still a very important part of the equation, but many people -- knowing that companies are out there publishing information on the Web -- are going out to search engines to find the answers to their business questions.\nWeb 2.0 is probably best described as the read/write Web, where there is an increasing proportion of content that\u2019s being pushed out by individuals as opposed to institutions. We have a broader mix of sources and a broader mix of information going out from a range of publishers. It has some default structure in it because of the standards that are being applied, but it\u2019s still fairly loose information.\nBusiness publications and corporations are all beginning to latch onto this idea and to use Web 2.0-style publishing to be able to reach people. We have individuals out there in business with Weblogs. We have CEO\u2019s with Weblogs. We have PR departments with Weblogs. Everybody is pushing out and trying to engage the world in a conversation. Now, with all that information out there, the question is how we structure it. What we\u2019re beginning to see in the Web environment is the use of more sophisticated content extraction technologies and analytics to be able to take those relationships and to present them more effectively to information systems.\nThere is a great example that Don Tapscott uses in his new book, Wikinomics. He talks about a gold mining company up in Canada that recognized all of a sudden that they had all sorts of potential deposits of gold, but they had no idea exactly where they were, and they wanted to get at them most efficiently. Their CEO happened to go to a seminar that was talking about"}

The growth of online retail is blamed for the closed shopfronts on American and European streets and dead malls in India and China. At the same time, Amazon is opening physical stores and buying offline retail operations in the US and in India, whereas the world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart, is busy digesting India\u2019s e-commerce market leader (Flipkart). India\u2019s online fashion and lifestyle websites too \u2014 including Myntra, FirstCry, Yepme and FabAlley \u2013 are acquiring offline brands or opening stores.\nWhat in the world is going on? The short answer: consumers want choice and retailers have no choice.\nTwo decades on, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment later, online retail is estimated to be about 12% of the global retail market. E-commerce is 10% of the US market, of which Amazon takes up about half. In India, the figure is in the vicinity of 2%, and that share is virtually stitched up between Walmart-owned Flipkart Group and Amazon.\nClearly, consumers value offline retail stores, either for convenience or as holistic brand ambassadors. Over at physical retail businesses, managers have been terrified of \u2018channel conflict\u2019. Senior management has squeezed resources for online, even when return-on-capital was demonstrably better than a new store. Some have refused to publicise their own company\u2019s website through in-store banners, fearing that customers would get sucked away from the store. It has been strange to see this opportunity being passed up \u2013 if customers trust you to walk into your physical store, why would you not want to connect with them at other points of time when they are not near your store?\nRetail is not and should not be divided between \u2018old-world physical\u2019 and \u2018upstart online\u2019. Successful retailers and brands have always been able to integrate multiple channels and environments to reach customers.\nFor instance, British fashion retailer Next has long used a combination of physical stores as well as mail-order catalogues side by side, and then e-commerce as the digital medium grew. British retailer Argos took another angle and embedded a catalogue inside the physical store \u2014 first a paper catalogue and then on-screen.\nNo doubt, for older companies, integration is tough; business systems and people are in disconnected silos, incentivised narrowly. Each channel needs different mindsets, capabilities, processes and systems to ensure that the optimal customer experience is appropriate for the interface \u2014 whether it is a store, mobile app, website or catalogue. But e-tailers opening physical stores have their own challenges, too, tackling the messy slowness of the physical world, where you can\u2019t instantly switch the store layout after an A:B test. They now need to develop those very \u2018old-world skills\u2019 and overheads that they thought they would never need.\nVarying circumstances make customers choose different buying environments. Successful retailers that outlast their competitors have used a variety of formats and channels to meet their customers, and will continue to do so.\nTo my mind, retailers have no choice but to see the retail business as one, even as it is fluid and evolving. A retailer\u2019s only choice is to bend with the customer\u2019s choice."}

With Windows 10 Mobile out, the clan of operating systems will be in place.\nThose branches will separate Windows 10's users into different update tracks, getting fixes as well as new features and functionality to customers on different schedules.\nBranches are a radical departure from Windows' historic servicing and maintenance model, which offered updates and upgrades to everyone simultaneously, then let customers decide whether they moved forward or stayed in place. As a crucial component of the \"Windows as a service\" theme Microsoft has promoted, branches will deliver the constant cadence of changes that will let the company evolve the OS over time rather than simply replace it with the next in line. In most cases, users will be required to accept the updates on their given branch; not doing so will mean a stoppage of security patches.\nFor example, the Current Branch (CB) -- the only available to consumers running Windows 10 Home -- will deliver updates before the Current Branch for Business (CBB), the track accessible from Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise. The third mainstream branch, dubbed Long-term Servicing Branch (LTSB), can be adopted only by devices running Windows 10 Enterprise that are also covered by Software Assurance plans.\nIn Microsoft's scheme, updates distributed to the CB reach systems first, with the same updates delivered to CBB devices at least a month later (in some cases as much as a year later). LTSB machines can forego all but security updates indefinitely.\nMeanwhile, within each branch there will exist at least two \"rings,\" or sub-divisions, that allow users to jump to the front of the queue, or delay deliveries for days or even weeks.\nBut Microsoft has yet to debut either branches or rings. Rather, in the two-plus weeks since the operating system's July 29 launch, it has distributed a series of cumulative updates -- their contents described in only the most general terms -- to all users at the same time.\nThat will probably be the practice for the next several months. \"Microsoft has enough to be worried about, especially getting this [initial] rollout of Windows 10 to go smoothly,\" said Steve Kleynhans of Gartner.\nThe company's focus on getting Windows 10 into customers' hands will require its complete attention until at least September, probably longer, Kleynhans argued. \"We're definitely looking at months [to complete the Windows 10 rollout]. Microsoft is being pretty cautious at looking at machines\" to authorize upgrades only to those capable of running the new OS, he added.\nIn fact, there's little rush for Microsoft to enable branches and rings, in large part because while some small businesses or organizations running Windows 10 Pro may leap at the free upgrade -- a deal valid until late July 2016"}

The United States will end up with a 7.8% stake in Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden told CNBC.\nThat would surpass the roughly 4.9% stake that the government of Abu Dhabi took in the company last year, and it also tops the 5% stake unveiled last week by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.\n\"The U.S. government's creative ring fencing of Citi's $306 billion in troubled assets is a strong positive for the system and for Citi shareholders,\" wrote Betsey Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a note.\nThe deal marks the latest of several government moves to support the financial sector and shore up investor confidence in it.\nThe Treasury's initial plan to buy up the industry's troubled assets gave way to direct investment in banks to bolster their balance sheets, and Citi already has received a previous $25 billion federal investment.\n\"It's TARP III,\" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \"Buying toxic assets didn't work; direct capital investment didn't work; so now they are guaranteeing these assets, they're just spinning their wheels, their plans just aren't working.\"\nAs Citi's shares fell more than 60% in the last week alone, the government decided to try yet another approach to avoid a collapse in Citi and a further loss of faith in the entire U.S. banking system.\nThough time will tell if the measures are successful, \"the U.S. government is lowering risk while not significantly diluting shareholders, keeping them engaged in the sector,\" Graseck told clients.\nThe rescue plan came together after a weekend of intensive negotiations involving the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., according to published reports.\nFederal officials and company management desperately were seeking to avoid a replay of the disastrous failure and subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ earlier this year as stabilization efforts fizzled. Many observers have identified that event as the tipping point between dangerous market and economic conditions into a market crash with potential for a depression.\nCiti shares closed up 58%, at $5.94. Collectively, the financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.02% measured by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF, posted their biggest one-day percentage gain ever, rising about 17%.

Agrostar plans to provide the image recognition feature free to farmers. RML AgTech, however, offers a basic version of the app free, but charges anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 3,000 annually for the app with the image-recognition feature.\nAgrostar, which recently raised $10 million in a funding round led by Accel Partners, plans to scale up and develop the image recognition technology over the course of this year. \"We are targeting crops like cotton and groundnut, we are getting data in terms of images from the farmers themselves. More than technology, the biggest challenge currently is having a repository of images that can be mapped to the image that a farmer has taken on his phone and determining the problem and solution in real time, without any manual intervention,\" said Shardul Sheth, cofounder of Agrostar.\nThe services offered by the platform are used by over 10 lakh farmers; over 1 lakh farmers have downloaded the the app. The startup is targeting less than 1,000 farmers in Gujarat for its pilot programme.\nThe image recognition feature on RML AgTech's paid app, called crop doc, is available in varied regional languages. The company, which raised $4 million in a funding round led by IvyCap Ventures in January, focuses on identifying pests and solutions related to tomato crops with this feature.\n\"In addition to technology , one needs to have insights.

Mitch Cox (of Johnson City) for Riverbend Villas and K.D. Moore (of Bristol, Tenn.) for a 168-unit complex called the \u201cOverlook at Indian Trail\u201d behind Kmart on E. Stone Drive.\nTIF occurs when the KHRA takes the projected growth in property taxes on a project and uses that money to secure a loan from a bank. That loan is then granted to the property owner to help offset the cost of the project.\nOriginally, Cox requested $3 million in TIF, but reduced the amount to $2.6 million. One-third of the money would go back to the city for the creation of an adjacent park along the Holston River. As for Moore, he requested $1.5 million in TIF, with the city and county keeping a minimum of 35 percent of the increase in property taxes generated by the development.\nThese incentive packages were approved by the KHRA and BMA in September, but when the matter went before Sullivan County, the commission made a small change and added the \u201c35 percent\u201d deal to the Riverbend package as well.\nBecause of this change, the Riverbend package had to go back to the KHRA and BMA for approval, which has now been done. But again, one other change was made.\nThe Riverbend TIF now stands at $2 million. Kingsport will still receive one-third for the park and the remainder will go to the developer. As with the Overlook package, Sullivan County will receive 35 percent of the growth in property taxes for the Riverbend development once it's complete, or about $53,000 a year for the payback on the TIF (up to 15 years).\nThe remaining 65 percent of the growth in property taxes (about $98,000) would go towards paying off the TIF.\nRiverbend is proposed to be a medium-density, town home style community with one-, two- and three-bedroom options. Amenities would include a club house, swimming pool, playground and garages. None of the buildings would be more than two stories, developers have said.\nOverlook will include a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units, with amenities similar to Riverbend \u2013 a club house, zero-entry swimming pool, playground, garages, wellness center and community fireplace.

More data on AP test-taking, including demographic information, will be released later in the year.\nThe College Board has touted growth in test-taking on the 12 STEM tests in recent years, and that growth continued this year. In 2016, 62,000 additional students took tests in calculus, physics, biology, environmental science, statistics, chemistry, and computer science. (There are several tests in calculus and physics.) There was a 4 percent increase in overall STEM test-taking, from 1,447,760 tests adminstered in 2015 to 1,510,177 in 2016.\nComputer science and physics in particular have seen rapid growth again: The number of students taking the computer science test grew from 48,994 to 57,934 between 2015 and 2016, an 18 percent increase, and Physics 2, a newer course, saw the number of test-takers grow from 20,533 to 26,384, a 28 percent increase.\nBut the subjects with the most new test-takers were actually in the humanities and social sciences: human geography, English language and composition, world history, and U.S. history each had more than 19,000 additional students taking exams in 2016 than in previous years. Biology had the most new test-taking students of STEM courses, with 14,539 new test-takers. Many students take a number of tests.\nMany of the tests that have increased participation have also seen scores increase or hold steady. Trevor Packer, the senior vice president of AP and Instruction at the College Board, said the course tests are designed to ensure that changes in scores over time show changes in mastery.\nPacker said in an interview that growth in scores in many fast-growing subjects shows that the students who are enrolling \"had every right to be there... . It's a tremendous act of justice.\"\nA study from the American Enterprise Institute released earlier this year found that the academic caliber of students enrolled in AP classes, as gauged by scores on the NAEP, had not dropped despite the fact that more students are taking the classes.\nPacker said that the growth in the program overall has come as a result of recruiting efforts on the part of the College Board and of growing interest among individual teachers, schools, and policymakers. Eighteen 18 states have passed laws that require state colleges to grant students credit for AP coursework, Packer said.\nCorrected: This post initially misstated the growth in the number of students taking the AP Physics 2 test.\nWill ESSA Make It Harder For Low-Income Students to Pay AP Fees?"}

There's also evidence that the Obama campaign has tapped into social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of the campaign's messages.\nNeither campaign, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages. But some groups working on social media for the Obama campaign did agree to talk.\nObama embraced Facebook and other social media during the 2008 campaign, and this year is no different. As of Thursday morning, he had 31.4 million followers, or likes, on Facebook, compared to 10.8 million likes for Romney. The Facebook race gets closer when adding in the vice presidential candidates: Republican Paul Ryan has 5.1 million likes on Facebook, while Vice President Joe Biden has just 485,000.\nOn Twitter, which was just two years old in 2008, Obama's lead is more pronounced. Obama has 21.3 million Twitter followers, while Romney has 1.6 million. Of course, Obama has had four years as president, plus the 2008 campaign, to build social media followers, noted Mike Gisondi, a consultant with Socialbakers, a social media analytics firm.\nOn both Facebook and Twitter, Romney's posts get circulated more frequently than Obama's do, but that's probably because Obama's campaign posts many more messages, Gisondi said. Obama's Twitter account generates nearly 15 tweets a day, compared to about one a day for Romney.\n\"Obama is much, much more active on social media than Romney is,\" Gisondi said. \"Obama tweets an insane amount. We don't tweet 15 times a day, and that's what we do, we're a social media company.\"\nRomney has posted larger percentage gains of followers than Obama in recent weeks, but he's starting from a smaller base.\nBeyond the pure statistics, the Democratic National Committee is using a private social media network to communicate with leaders in the U.S. Hispanic community, said Giovanni Rodriguez, CEO and cofounder of SocialxDesign, a social media consulting firm. SocialxDesign helped the DNC set up a private social network to educate and communicate with Democratic leaders in the Hispanic community who speak for the Obama campaign, he said.\nThe private social network, using an enterprise social network tool, is set up similar to Facebook. The DNC is distributing content to the Hispanic leaders on a daily basis, and hearing back from Hispanic users about issues in their communities, Rodriguez said. \"We're able to connect a lot more efficiently, a lot more effectively,\" he said.\nIn this election, it's not enough to count your number of Twitter followers or set up social networks, however. Companies like NetBase and Topsy are monitoring social networks to measure voter sentiment.\nTopsy, a social media analytics firm, has partnered with Twitter to publisher the Twitter Political Index tracking sentiment about the two major presidential candidates, said Jamie de Guerre, the company's vice president of products.\nRodriguez pointed to NetBase as an analytics company doing cutting-edge work to determine whether a group of tweets or Facebook posts has a positive or negative reaction to a candidate or, outside of election season, a brand."}

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, reported just $10.2 million in sales in 2013.

He initiated wage and price controls, blaming \u201cdetestable profit seeking\u201d rather than overspending and mismanagement for Rome\u2019s economic woes. And he levied crushing taxes on everyone.\nParticularly hard-hit were the Decurions: the rural gentry who often became city officials and by this time were the foundation of Rome\u2019s government everywhere outside the largest cities. In the Republic, these men accepted responsibility for certain public projects \u2014 baths and reliable water supplies, for example. They did this both out of a sense of civic responsibility and for the honor it conferred \u2014 and for goodwill, which often translated into support for higher office.\nBut by the mid-fourth century, the burden was unbearable. In 377, Decurions were ordered to support construction projects formerly paid for by the central government. In 384 the Emperor demanded all pay their \u201cfair share\u201d for building ports, aqueducts, roads and other \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d By 396 the cost of building and maintaining fortifications was distributed among \u201call landowners\u201d and Decurions were given financial responsibility for social welfare \u2014 food, housing, entertainments and the like. It was a burden that would bankrupt any who undertook it, but by then none were willing to try.\nMost hid their wealth or left collapsing urban centers for self-sufficient country estates. Others abandoned their loyalty to Rome, deserting to the Goths, Franks or others. They may not have been as cultured or wealthy as Latins and they were unpredictable, but the security they provided cost significantly less.\nSo when Aleric the Visigoth sacked Rome in 410, he crushed an empty shell. Rome in the West disappeared because the class of people on which it had relied for 800 years and more for survival no longer thought it was worth their time, their effort, their blood and treasure. It took the West a millennium to recover.\nThe foregoing is for those who think they have nothing to learn from history. In fact, history has invaluable information about government overspending and confiscatory taxation: Above a certain level they are ruinous. They may take time but \u2014 as a drop of arsenic a day will not kill a man immediately \u2014 if continuous the result is certainly fatal.\nOur national government has a familiar tripartite financial problem: burgeoning national debt due to many decades of unpaid bills; a tax system badly needing reform; want of money for a variety of necessary projects. And the clock is ticking. During the Obama years, low interest rates held down the cost of debt service. That will end \u2014 and our circumstances will be further straightened.\nReforming the tax system is central to resolving these problems. But by \u201creform,\u201d we cannot simply focus on our equivalent of Rome\u2019"}

Among other provisions, the bill would create a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers towards borrowers, and provide for a duty of good faith and fair dealing toward borrowers for all lenders. The Homeownership Preservation and Protection Act would also prohibit prepayment penalties and Yield Spread Premiums (YSPs) on nontraditional mortgages, similar to legislation passed last month by the House of Representatives. Dodd's proposal goes further than the House bill, however, and would provide for limited liability for holders of a mortgage made in violation of law, whether it is the original lender or a subsequent investment trust -- and also would exclude pre-empting state laws. Numerous consumer advocates immediately provided their support for the proposed legislation; the Mortgage Bankers Association had not yet issued a statement on the Senate bill at the time this story was published.

{"idx": "13124", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Republicans have agreed to put a price on carbon, at least temporarily. This CO2 credit might be enough to spur some new coal power investment.\nThe Furthering carbon capture, Utilization, Technology, Underground storage, and Reduced Emissions (FUTURE) Act, part of the recently enacted Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, extended and expanded the 2008 tax credits for capturing CO2. The credits can be used for either sequestering the CO2 in geological formations, or selling it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). If a firm decides to sequester the CO2, they receive a $50/metric ton (MT) credit and a $35/MT credit if they sell it for EOR.\nFor a power plant or chemical facility to claim these credits, they must remove 500,000 MT of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. For firms looking to either pull CO2 directly from the air, or make a product with that CO2, the total CO2 threshold is lower and the credit can be higher. To be eligible, projects must start construction within the next seven years; there is a 12-year window to claim the credits, but no limit to the amount of CO2 credits that can claimed.\nThe 45Q tax credits for CO2 act like the production tax credit (PTC) for wind, but instead provide a credit for the capturing and handling of the energy byproduct, not the energy itself. Nonetheless, the credit will have the same effect on natural gas and coal power plants as the PTC has for wind, and might make new some new gas and coal plants economic.\nThere are about 17 carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects in the world, two of which are in North America. The technology has received lackluster support and some high-profile project cost overruns including Southern Company\u2019s failed Kemper power plant have dampened enthusiasm. Although, the Petra Nova CCS facility in Houston is in operation and utilizing the captured CO2 for EOR.\nHow might this new credit affect the power sector?\nOne metric used to determine if it makes economic sense to build a new power plant is the levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE. Long story short, LCOE is the sum total of money that it takes to build, finance, and operate a power plant divided by the total amount of electricity it is expected to produce over its lifetime \u2013 essentially distilling the value of a power plant down to a single number. While this metric is far from perfect, it is commonly used to compare different technologies and can be thought of simply as the average price that a power plant must receive for its output in order to break even.\nTax credits reduce the LCOE of a power plant, making it cheaper and therefore more competitive.\nFigure showing the effect of the 45Q tax credits on new natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and coal power plants on their long-term LCOE and their short and long-term marginal cost to generate power. Scenarios include sequestering the carbon underground (SEQ, cost: $7/MT) and selling the carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR, price received: $15/MT). For capital cost, heat rate, O&M and other costs assumptions, see online spreadsheet model. Blended marginal cost means the average marginal cost for a power plant taking into account that it will not receive the carbon credit for its entire lifetime.\nThe LCOE of a new natural gas combined cycle power plant is about $42/MWh, and new coal about $80/MWh (assuming a 50% capacity factor), but"}

A worker paid on the last day of each month in 2018 could expect three assessment periods with two paydays and three with no paydays.\nIt cites the case of a working couple with two children who since claiming universal credit last year have seen monthly payments fluctuate from between \u00a31,185 to zero because of pay date and assessment period clashes. They have found it impossible to budget and are now in rent arrears for the first time in their lives.\n\u201cIn reality, the current monthly assessment system is a huge oversimplification which does not reflect the reality of people\u2019s lives and work,\u201d says CPAG.\nAlthough claimants often ask the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) to change their assessment period dates to eliminate the problem, they are routinely told that nothing can be done \u2013 in one case a claimant was told that this was simply \u201cthe nature of the beast\u201d.\nThe DWP has been much criticised for failing to act on evidence of problems in the benefit system, although last month the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, promised the DWP will be more responsive when glitches in universal credit were identified.\nCPAG said campaigners had warned the government about flaws in the monthly assessment period and payment cycle back in 2012 when universal credit was at the design stage but were ignored."}

That said, Microsoft did enhance the Search Companion, tweak error reporting and integrate additional online privacy information. You'll also find a new Contacts Bar, Personal Bar, and Media Bar. We hoped for more significant changes, but were pleasantly surprised by the stability of this preview and encountered no problems launching a variety of sites.\nBecause IE6 will be part of the Windows XP OS package, not just a standalone product, the browser features the same colorful interface and icons as the new OS. Despite the complaints about Windows XP's bright interface, we found the change refreshing.\nThe IE6 Search Companion allows you to ferret out info on the Web or on your computer and provides you with a choice of four animated characters as guides.

You can also customize your Personal Bar to include links to your favorite sites. The Contacts Bar lets you quickly access your contacts in Outlook or Outlook Express.\nIf you've used MSN Explorer, then the Media Bar will look somewhat familiar as well. Microsoft packs in a media player (which will be Media Player 8.0 in the IE6 final release), which you'll find in the bottom left-hand corner of the browser window. Open the bar and you'll see a list of entertainment, music, movies, and radio selections from WindowsMedia.com (Microsoft entertainment portal), that are accessible with one click. The site offers additional categories you can browse for your favorite music, movies, or other media and then play with the built-in media player. The player can be left in its default position or snapped off to float free of your browser.\nMicrosoft beefed up the way IE handles errors by giving the browser its own Dr. Watson that responds to crashes and automatically links you to a fix or to an article on how to correct the problem. You can also report crashes to Microsoft\u0097but don't expect a response. Eventually this might result in a fix being posted on the company's Web site, so the problem is probably worth reporting if you have a minute.\nAll in all, this public preview provides a promising look of things to come for IE 6. We were impressed by the stability and speed (this beta was much more stable than the Netscape 6 beta), but were a bit disappointed by the meager ration of new features.

For example, more girls prefer courses in art history, biology, English literature and composition, French language and culture, psychology, Spanish language, studio art, and drawing.\nMore boys like: Calculus BC; Computer Science; Computer Science AB; Physics C, Electricity and Magnetism; and Physics C, Mechanics.\nAs the number of couples marrying across racial and ethnic lines continues to grow in the United States, public attitudes toward intermarriage are also becoming more accepting, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center.\nCouples of differing races or ethnic backgrounds comprised 15.1 percent of all new marriages in 2010, while the share of all current marriages that are either interracial or interethnic reached an all-time high of 8.4 percent, Pew found. In 1980, just 3 percent of all marriages and less than 7 percent of new marriages were across rcial or ethnic lines.\nAsians and Hispanics have the highest rate of intermarriage, and, in 2010, more than a quarter of newlyweds in each group married someone of a different race or ethnicity, according to Pew.\nThe interracial couplings with the most education\u2014and earning the most money\u2014are those between Asians and whites. Hispanics and blacks who married outside their group are more likely to have college degrees.\nPew's survey of American attitudes toward this growing trend of intermarriage found that 43 percent of Americans view it as a good change for society, while around 11 percent say it's bad. The rest say it doesn't make a difference.\nOf course, there are important issues for schools to consider because with more intermarried couples will come more students who are biracial or multiethnic. It could certainly present challenges on the data-collection side of things for schools that must demonstrate that students of all races and ethnicities are reaching certain academic targets.\nIf a student has an Asian mother and a black father, do his scores get counted among those of Asian students or African-American students?"}

{"idx": "13151", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Artificial intelligence cyberattacks are coming -- but what does that mean?\nThe next major cyberattack could involve artificial intelligence systems. It could even happen soon: At a recent cybersecurity conference, 62 industry professionals, out of the 100 questioned, said they thought the first AI-enhanced cyberattack could come in the next 12 months.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean robots will be marching down Main Street. Rather, artificial intelligence will make existing cyberattack efforts -- things like identity theft, denial-of-service attacks and password cracking -- more powerful and more efficient. This is dangerous enough -- this type of hacking can steal money, cause emotional harm and even injure or kill people. Larger attacks can cut power to hundreds of thousands of people, shut down hospitals and even affect national security.\nAs a scholar who has studied AI decision-making, I can tell you that interpreting human actions is still difficult for AI and that humans don\u2019t really trust AI systems to make major decisions. So, unlike in the movies, the capabilities AI could bring to cyberattacks -- and cyberdefense -- are not likely to immediately involve computers choosing targets and attacking them on their own. People will still have to create attack AI systems and launch them at particular targets. But nevertheless, adding AI to today\u2019s cybercrime and cybersecurity world will escalate what is already a rapidly changing arms race between attackers and defenders.\nBeyond computers\u2019 lack of need for food and sleep -- needs that limit human hackers\u2019 efforts, even when they work in teams -- automation can make complex attacks much faster and more effective.\nTo date, the effects of automation have been limited. Very rudimentary AI-like capabilities have for decades given virus programs the ability to self-replicate, spreading from computer to computer without specific human instructions. In addition, programmers have used their skills to automate different elements of hacking efforts. Distributed attacks, for example, involve triggering a remote program on several computers or devices to overwhelm servers. The attack that shut down large sections of the internet in October 2016 used this type of approach. In some cases, common attacks are made available as a script that allows an unsophisticated user to choose a target and launch an attack against it.\nAI, however, could help human cybercriminals customize attacks. Spearphishing attacks, for instance, require attackers to have personal information about prospective targets, details like where they bank or what medical insurance company they use. AI systems can help gather, organize and process large databases to connect identifying information, making this type of attack easier and faster to carry out.

Complete with 16 tracks, this CD is targeted specifically to youths, though its messages are universal and meant to give hope to all listeners.\nThe title track, \"What Will I Stand For,\" calls on the youths of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to find the courage to make the right choices while they are young. The question-and-promise format of this song pulls into the lyrics a version of a familiar theme: \u201cChoose the right.\u201d Houskeeper has included the sheet music for \u201cWhat Will I Stand For\u201d on her personal blog at lyndsihmusic.blogspot.com.\n\"Shoes\" brings to mind the trials everyone faces, and urges listeners to have a thankful heart despite those challenges. The song \"Because I Love Him\" highlights Houskeeper's strong vocals, and infuses the listener with a simple message. Her rendition of \u201cHow Great Thou Art\u201d shows the depth of feeling she brings into each word of the song.\nAs a bonus, Houskeeper has included seven tracks as both voice and instrumental. The instrumental versions may be used freely to accompany youths' voices in firesides, New Beginnings, Evenings of Excellence and other activities.\nHouskeeper, a motivational speaker and mother of three, has grown a loyal audience over the past 10 years. Her desire in writing and sharing music is to uplift others with her gift. Her latest album does just that, and leaves the listener with a resolve to make better choices, seek for hope, and capture light while standing in holy places.\nAmy Jo Wilde is a writer living in Brigham City.

The requirement will most likely take effect in the 2014 fiscal year, which kicks off 21 months from Tuesday.\nJon Roskill, Microsoft's corporate vice president of worldwide channels, revealed his thinking on the matter in an interview Monday. \"I think that would be a very reasonable thing to spec out to people,\" Roskill said. \"It doesn't mean we don't love you if you're not doing [cloud sales] for some reason, but we also want to be very clear that gold is differentiating our best partners and there's an expectation around that.\"\nAsked what percentage of overall sales he expects cloud services to represent, Roskill said that is to be determined. \"It's too early to say,\" he said. \"We are talking about something that's a year and a half out.

One year ago, Vah\u00e9 Torossian, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Worldwide Small and Midmarket Solutions and Partners (SMS&P) Group, told partners that they were putting their businesses on the line if they ignored the cloud.\n\"If you don't do it, you will be irrelevant in the next four or five years,\" Torossian told partners at an International Association of Microsoft Channel Partners chapter meeting in New York.

The importance of a sound understanding of biomechanics and physiological systems for the design of suitable training protocols and trauma prevention is clearly explained, and in-depth information and guidance are provided on training and testing for elite skiers and return to sporting activity following injury. Among the other topics addressed in individual chapters are the relationship of changes in skiing equipment over recent decades to particular types of injury and the potential consequences of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia and other stressors at high altitude. The book will be of great value to all medical professionals who work with or care for Alpine skiers, as well as for trainers and the skiers themselves.\nBook \u2014 online resource (xvi, 346 pages) : illustrations (some color).\nThis edited book is a compilation of findings on the molecular and cellular toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs) in animal cell, human cells, invertebrates. The varied selection of test models will provide better understanding about the horizon of NPs toxicity. Interaction of NPs with cells and its organelles can induce toxicological consequences, including transcriptional and translational alterations, DNA damage, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. NPs can get internalized in cells through phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis and passive penetration, which can affect varied cell types. Readers will be benefited with the compilations on basic and molecular facet of NPs toxicity. The chapters will provide a comprehensive information on the state-of-the-art methodologies. The application of toxicogenomic approaches, which is already established in nanotoxicology, has been given special consideration to unravel the toxicodynamics of nanomaterials. Among these approaches, the high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which is able to build a complete map of transcriptome across different cell types and perturbations upon NPs exposure has been included. The readers are also introduced to the less studied topic on the adsorption of biomolecules (mainly proteins) on the NPs surface, constituting the so-called \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d.

Prigozhin has been dubbed \"Putin's chef\" because his restaurant businesses cater events at the Kremlin.\nBut the campaign to influence the U.S. election allegedly was mainly carried out by Concord and its Internet Research Agency \"troll factory\" in St. Petersburg, according to the indictment.\nWhile the agency posted and spread politically divisive material on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, Concord controlled funding, recommended personnel, and oversaw the activities of the propaganda campaign, the indictment says.\nConcord is the only one of the defendants named in the case that has formally responded to the charges in U.S. court. Earlier this year, it hired American lawyers to fight the indictment.\nUnder the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause, principal officers such as cabinet secretaries are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate while \"inferior officers\" may be appointed by courts or department heads if permitted by Congress.\nConcord's lawyers say that Mueller qualifies as a \"principal officer\" under the clause because of his vast prosecutorial authority. They argue that no matter whether Mueller is deemed an \"inferior\" or \"principal\" officer, his appointment still violates the constitution.\nAs a principal officer, they say, he should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\nBut even if a court disagreed and ruled that Mueller was an inferior officer, they say, his hiring is still unlawful because Rosenstein lacked \"express and specific statutory authorization\" from Congress.\nThat legal argument is similar to one put forth earlier this month by Trump, who said in a tweet that \"the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional.\"\nThe argument was also cited last month by Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society, who in a call with journalists argued that all of Mueller's actions were illegal because he was improperly appointed."}

Fronted by lead singer Belinda Carlisle and anchored by key songwriters Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey, their debut album was an important breakthrough for women in music. The multi-platinum Beauty and the Beat was the first number one album written and performed by an all-female group. It\u2019s now been remastered and expanded into a 2-disc set (and pink vinyl) to celebrate its 30th anniversary.\nBeauty and the Beat, one of the 1980s cornerstone albums of American new wave, was both groundbreaking and inspired.

That breakthrough hit was soon followed up by \u201cWe Got The Beat,\u201d which became the group\u2019s most successful song and spent three weeks at number two on the U.S. hot 100. The classic 80s anthem\u2019s lyrics \u201cSee the kids just getting out of school/They can\u2019t wait to hang out and be cool,\u201d left an indelible impression on pop culture.\nThis newly released 2-disc set gives fans a chance to hear both sides of the group: the raw energy and post-punk edginess of their live performances never captured on their studio recordings, as well as the smoothed out pop-gloss sound most associated with the band. Disc one is comprised of the full remastered album, while the second disc contains a previously unreleased live concert from 1981. The live disc includes songs that have never appeared on any Go-Go\u2019s album, in addition to an early version of the hit single \u201cVacation,\u201d complete with alternate lyrics that differ greatly from the well-known recorded version.\nThe anniversary edition of Beauty and the Beat shows this album still holds up surprisingly well thirty years later, which is a testament to the energetic spirit captured in this musical Zeitgeist of the 80s. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder that the Go-Go\u2019s were never able to equal or surpass the success of this landmark debut with the band\u2019s subsequent releases. Their beauty may have faded over the years, but their beat still sounds almost as timeless today on this seminal 80s album as it did thirty years ago."}

PUB investigations showed that contractor Sato Kogyo had, without informing the agency, built a temporary diversion drain that was undersized at the Upper Thomson MRT station construction site.\nThe unauthorised drainage diversions led to flooding that cost businesses thousands of dollars.\nAverage number of flood days each year, over the past three years.\nNumber of flood days in 2013.\nGA Construction general manager Joseph Liew said that while the company does not have the checklist yet, many of the recommendations are already present at some, if not most, of its sites.\nHe noted that there are already CCTV cameras at some sites. And while they were not put up to monitor flooding specifically, he said the hardware was in place. He added that the firm would adhere to PUB's recommendations.\nAt a briefing yesterday, PUB said it will focus more on construction sites that have major canals running through them.\nMr Choy Wai Kwong, PUB's chief engineer for drainage operations, said 28 sites have been identified.\nMajor drains traverse these sites, and any blockages would result in a knock-on effect during heavy rain.\n\"If there is a blockage, it will disrupt the flow of more minor drains, causing floods to affect more areas,\" said Mr Choy.\nPUB is also working with the Land Transport Authority to check critical areas such as road tunnels, vehicular underpasses and some MRT stations with flood protection barriers.\nAdvisories will also be sent to residents and businesses in flood-prone areas.\nPUB said the public can help by staying updated on weather warnings and ensuring that they keep drains clear.\nIn the past three years, Singapore has averaged nine flood days a year, with rainfall levels reaching 200mm to 300mm in some places.\nThis is much fewer than in the past. There were 36 flood days in 2013.\nThis year has already seen several incidents of flash floods around the island, with four locations flooding in the past three months.\nLast Thursday, heavy rain caused flash floods in Hougang that subsided after about 15 minutes.\nStudent Chris Wong, 24, who lives near Balmoral Road, which flooded earlier this year, said he did not know if his family had received a PUB advisory, but he makes use of the PUB app during inclement weather.\nHe said: \"It's good to keep track because if it starts flooding, I can avoid the hassle by staying at home or keeping away from the area.\""}

{"idx": "13175", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Privacy and security are two of the biggest concerns when social media, and rightly so. We\u2019ve got five tips for you to improve your Twitter privacy, so you can tweet knowing that you\u2019re secure.\nYour password is your first line of defense when it comes to Twitter. It keeps the hackers out and keeps you in control of your account.\nWhen creating your Twitter password, try to ensure that it is at least six characters long, and that it contains both letters and numbers. Make it something that cannot be guessed easily, and change it regularly.\nMost people use the same password or a variation of one on all of their online accounts. This is bad practice, as it means that once someone has cracked one password, they can access all of your accounts. So try to make your Twitter password unique.\nIf you\u2019re on a shared computer, you\u2019ve got to remember to sign out of Twitter when you\u2019re done tweeting. That includes signing out of any dashboards or third-party services as well.\nThis is a good habit to get into if you\u2019re concerned about your privacy, even if you\u2019re not on a shared computer. By remaining logged in to Twitter while you surf the web, you could be sharing your Twitter information with websites without even knowing it.\nThis one\u2019s important: don\u2019t click on a shortened link from within Twitter unless you trust both the source and the destination.\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate fact, but hackers can take control of others\u2019 accounts. And this means that even if you trust the person sending out the link, there\u2019s a chance that it is not actually them tweeting it.\nAlso, links on Twitter are usually shortened using a service like bit.ly. Because of this, you usually can\u2019t see the destination of the link until after you\u2019ve clicked it. However, there are some services out there, like TweetDeck, which will show you a preview of these links before you click through.\nDon\u2019t be a Weiner: learn the difference between Direct Messages and @replies on Twitter. Right now.\nDirect Messages can be sent to anyone who follows you, and they\u2019re private \u2013 only between you and that individual. @replies, on the other hand, are sent publicly. Although they will be directed to the user you mention, they\u2019ll be visible in your public timeline and in theirs.\nUnderstanding the difference between these two Twitter features can make all the difference when it comes to private tweets, pictures and thoughts.\nTwitter allows its users to tag their tweets with their geographical location. At first glance, this is a fun little feature \u2013 but it has a number of privacy and security implications.\nBy tweeting your location, you\u2019re letting everyone who is following you know exactly where you are. And Twitter is not like Facebook: those who follow you don\u2019t need your permission to do so. So by tweeting your location, you are potentially letting hundreds or even thousands of strangers know where you are.\nThere have been stories of people tweeting or posting their location to a social network, and then leaving their homes open to burglary when the thieves read that they were out of town.\nBe careful about using this feature."}

Two-thirds of them don\u2019t reach out for help, mainly due to the stigma attached to mental health issues.\nBut the problem\u2019s breadth is just one reason behind this campaign\u2019s popularity, said marketing and corporate social responsibility experts, who credit its stickiness to the ease of participating, Bell\u2019s long-term commitment, celebrity endorsements and the team behind the cause.\nMost importantly, they said, Bell chose the right issue at the right time, something Mary Deacon, chair of Bell Let\u2019s Talk, agrees with.\nDeacon joined the 138-year-old telecom in 2010 after almost a decade as president of the Toronto-based Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Foundation and 25 years of fundraising for not-for-profits. She said no one was talking about mental health, let alone spending millions on it, when she started cajoling businesses to donate to the CAMH Foundation in 1999.\n\u201cI used to recount the stories in our meetings about my epic failure in trying to recruit a Canadian corporation to adopt mental health in the way CIBC had adopted breast cancer,\u201d Deacon said.\nHer frustration mounting, she met George Cope, then president of Bell Canada, when he was volunteering with CAMH. After he was promoted to BCE\u2019s chief executive in 2008, a role he holds today, he started to revamp Bell\u2019s corporate social responsibility strategy. He brought Deacon on as chair of a new mental health program.\n\u201cI would not have come to Bell if I did not believe absolutely that there was a genuine, authentic commitment to make a difference,\u201d Deacon said.\nThey had a debate about whether to call it Bell Let\u2019s Talk or simply Let\u2019s Talk, but decided to use the Bell brand to combat the stigma around mental health issues. Besides, the \u201clet\u2019s talk\u201d aspect fit the company\u2019s core business of telephone, wireless and internet connections.\nAfter speaking with about 150 leaders in the mental health community about what they would do if they had millions of dollars, Deacon said Bell decided to also invest in"}

The adaptation of David Grann\u2018s true story of the same name has been written and directed by James Gray, and we\u2019ve been waiting to hear when this movie might finally get a release after the trailer leaked earlier this past spring (and was taken down shortly thereafter). Now we finally have an answer.\nAmazon Studios and Bleecker Street have announced that The Lost City of Z release date is April 21, 2017. As of now the only real competition that weekend is the Warner Bros. thriller Unforgettable starring Katherine Heigl and Rosario Dawson and a Disneynature documentary called Born in China. However, Fast 8 arrives the week before, and seems likely to dominate in its second weekend unless another big release ends up landing this weekend as well.\nIf you\u2019re not familar with The Lost City of Z, the film stars Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim, Crimson Peak) as Lieutenant Colonel Percy Fawcett, a legendary British explorer who ventured into the Amazon jungle in search of the titular fabled civilization but never returned. Many have tried to find him, but many have died in their pursuit, unable to find any evidence of this mysterious place.\nThe rest of the cast includes Robert Pattinson plays his exploration partner Henry Costin. Other supporting stars include Sienna Miller as his wife Nina Fawcett and Tom Holland as another explorer. That\u2019s a solid assembly of talent, and this could be a solid film to break up the monotony of April releases that has only recently been interrupted by the Fast and Furious franchise. At the very least, it will be some nice counter-programming to the action franchise.\nJames Gray\u2019s emotionally and visually resplendent epic tells the story of Lieutenant Colonel Percy Fawcett (a remarkable Charlie Hunnam), the British military-man-turned-explorer whose search for a lost city deep in the Amazon grows into an increasingly feverish, decades-long magnificent obsession that takes a toll on his reputation, his home life with his wife (Sienna Miller) and children, and his very existence. Gray and cinematographer Darius Khondji cast quite a spell, exquisitely pitched between rapture and dizzying terror. Also starring Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland, The Lost City of Z represents a form of epic storytelling that has all but vanished from the landscape of modern cinema, and a rare level of artistry."}

The weird part\u2014and yes, it gets weirder\u2014is that the man who called police said the clown they found in the bushes wasn't the clown he'd fired on.\nIdaho has not been immune to creepy clown sightings. In northern Idaho, the Shoshone County Sheriff's Office confirmed that an individual, dressed as a clown, had been exhibiting stalking behavior. In the Treasure Valley, creepy clown postings on Instagram threatened a Meridian school and the Idaho State Journal noted an increasing number of \"reports from local citizens to eastern Idaho law enforcement about clowns gathering or walking along streets.\""}

Britain lags behind awaiting its bounce back in the fourth quarter due to the relative size of its financial sector.\nIs the economic recovery sustainable ? Normalisation of the worlds economies from the economic free fall stage implies gradual withdrawal of unprecedented stimulus measures such as zero interest rates, deficit spending and quantitative easing, which means many negative measures will be adopted to fill the fiscal gaps, i.e. spending cuts and tax rises. This implies forward economic weakness for some countries more than others i.e. those that lack a manufacturing base which have basically funneled their stimulus into consumption of overseas manufactured products, which again puts Britain at the top of the list to suffer a double dip recession.\nIn the immediate future the UK government is going to continue to burn more money into the next general election which will set Britain up for deep second recession during 2011, as out of control perpetual money printing risks an eventual currency crash into hyperinflation so is NOT an option.

It\u2019s been exciting to see the growth of the organization and I always say I love my job because I get to work with our amazing nonprofits, donors, and community members. Since our inception in 2004, ACT has served as a community leader convening around challenging issues, encouraging collaboration among key stakeholders, strengthening the nonprofit sector, and connecting individuals with causes they care about. Most people know us as the Alexandria\u2019s community foundation, but did you know that ACT has been highlighted and sought-out as a best practice leader in philanthropy? Here are just a few of the areas where ACT has shared our experience.\nIn partnership with the City of Alexandria\u2019s Children Youth Master Plan, ACT is convening key stakeholders around the creation of a coordinated and aligned system of early care and education in the city to ensure every child in Alexandria has a strong start in life and in school. Our cross-sector systems building work has been highlighted and shared around the country in FSG\u2019s Improving the Odd: Seven Principles for Investing in Early Care and Education Guide and the American Public Human Services Association Policy & Practice Magazine \u2013 Public-Private Partnerships. ACT is also sending members of the Early Care & Education Work Group to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Professional Learning Institute Conference to present a session on our experience with professional learning communities.\nIn addition to our convening role, ACT is committed to strengthening the nonprofit sector through building the capacity of our local nonprofits, making sure they have a solid foundation in place so they can better carry out their mission. We do this through providing capacity building grants (investing more than $700,000 in funding nonprofit organization since 2005), hosting the IMPACT Forum (convening 200-plus nonprofit, board, business, city and community leaders annually to discuss innovations in philanthropy), and educating the nonprofits about best practices like The Performance Imperative, a framework for high-performing organizations. I, along with founding board member, Lori Morris, participated in developing the Performance Imperative Organizational Self-Assessment (PIOSA), a tool used around the country by foundations and organizations to assess their organizational learning and improvement. This framework helps to inform our grantmaking and our conversations with donors about investing in effective organizations.\nACT created Spring2ACTion, Alexandria\u2019s Giving Day, in 2011 after hearing about Give to the Max Day, an online giving day for the state of Minnesota that raised $10M in 24 hours. Our board chair Lauren Stack suggested we do something similar for Alexandria. Seven years ago, many of our nonprofits were not yet versed in online fundraising and some didn\u2019t even have web sites or a way to accept online donations. As the host of Spring2ACTion, we train nonprofits on how to use the online platform, as well as best practices in fundraising and specifically crowd funding and peer-to-peer fundraising, techniques that can be integrated all-year round. Our first year, Spring2ACTion raised $104,156 for 47 nonprofits and this year, together we raised $1,592,459 for 158 nonprofits.

I was curious how things looked upstream late last week so I took a quick drive up to the Dawson area in Lac qui Parle County around Dawson where the west and east forks of the Lac qui Parle River join and flow toward the Minnesota.\nThe further west I drove last Thursday the more snow I saw. There was much more snow than bare ground, confirming what we had heard about them having more snow than either Yellow Medicine or Chippewa Counties. And that snow looked deep. Now, just a few days later, much of that snow has turned to huge ponds of water covering fields, gravel roads and surrounding farms. Dawson saw record level flooding this week and the Lac qui Parle River, which last week was sleepy just upstream from the Lac qui Parle dam is now in full flood stage.\nThe Chippewa River at Benson and near Milan has been at near-record levels as well. And both those rivers will pour into the Minnesota River and make it swell this week and next in Monte and Granite. The National Weather Service (NWS) has predicted what they label as \u201cMinor Flood\u201d stage here in Granite by Thursday and that the river will continue to rise until at least Sunday, when it reaches 892.0 feet. That would make it the 11th highest flood here, just behind the second river crest in 2011 on April 27th of that year.\nThe NWS forecasts that the river will reach a plateau on the gauge readings for a bit after Sunday before beginning a long slow decline. That forecast can change depending on conditions upstream and, more importantly, the weather. The warm spell on Wednesday will speed up the snowmelt but then temperatures will moderate and cool down at night which always helps slow river flows. And fortunately, there isn\u2019t much, rain in the near-term forecast, which bodes well for river levels this week and next.\nMeanwhile, we\u2019ll keep watching and preparing for a possible flood response. Granite is fortunate to have accomplished so much flood mitigation work. One of our goals was to eliminate as much as possible the need to fill hundreds of thousands of sandbags. A flood elevation at the 2001 or worse yet, the 1997 level, would certainly require plenty of sandbags but not nearly the 750,000 we filled in 1997 or the 600,000 we filled in 2001.\nIf the river stays below the 2011 level, which peaked at 893.55 feet, just above the NWS \u201cModerate Flood\u201d designation, we should be okay. That year there was water covering much of the alleyway known as Lende Lane, along the river below the foot bridge and there was water up on Minnesota Avenue. The city crew put up barricades and life went on. That kind of flood is much easier to deal with. Let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed.\nQuestions about flooding have been a topic of conversation, even several miles away from the river. While sitting with Marshall Mayor Bob Byrnes last Friday at the Highway 23 Coalition annual meeting in Rockville it seemed like that\u2019s almost all we talked about.

He hopes to expand the Boardman-based business to another market.\nAs the branding agency enjoys its recent recognition, Hedrich recalled the company\u2019s humble beginnings 25 years ago.\nHedrich got his start in the industry working for a creative agency in downtown Cleveland. A few years into his career there, he went to the owner and asked for a raise. The owner said no.\nHedrich rented a small office and worked from a closet-sized room. He enlisted family members to sit in or call the office to make the business seem more bustling.\nProdigal got its big break when Hedrich convinced Farmers National Bank to hire his firm. Soon after, Prodigal brought on Sheely\u2019s Furniture & Appliance Co. Both companies remain with Prodigal to this day.\nProdigal faced some challenges when the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the financial crisis hit in 2008, but it survived thanks to client loyalty and Hedrich\u2019s conviction that an economic downturn is the right time to gain market share, he said.\nThe company sharpened its focus on branding and began developing the Brand MRI. Hedrich said the process is an answer to an issue that came up in meetings with prospective clients \u2013 every agency had its take on branding, but none of them had a strategy.\nBrand MRI combines the theory of brand positioning with the science of behavioral economics.\nWhat resulted was a 12-week process that begins with internal focus groups, then surveys existing and prospective customers. The results show what the client is good at, what it is better at than its competitors and what customers value the most about it.\nHedrich and clients who have gone through Prodigal\u2019s branding process say it delivers a message that will resonate with customers.\nSheely\u2019s General Manager Jeff Curry said the Brand MRI offered the business new insights.\nCurry said the MRI showed that customers value the shopping experience there, which is unique due to sales associates not working for commission.\nLooking to the future, Hedrich sees Prodigal emerging as a leading branding agency.\nThat might seem like a big dream, but Hedrich thinks it\u2019s possible."}

{"idx": "13222", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Today\u2019s Gospel highlights what a different world Jesus and the earliest Christians lived in by comparison with us today. Jesus and Luke\u2019s community unquestionably believed in slavery. In all the Gospels Jesus regularly draws on the image of a slave to make points about duty, respect or responsibility. In other passages Jesus and St Paul advocate for the just treatment of slaves or servants. It was an institution in their world that they never questioned. They never told the slaves to make a bid for freedom. They never told Christian slave owners to set their slaves free.\nLike society generally, the Church, for most of its history, followed this line. Much to our shame when the tide rightly turned against slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church was, generally, very slow to be converted to the emancipation movement and take a stand against the colonialism and racism that slavery enshrined. Our movement on the question of slavery is a wonderful study in the development of doctrine. Not all social realities that Jesus assumed in his day continue to be relevant to our world. It took Society 1800 years and the Church a bit longer still to see slavery for what it is \u2013 an assault on the children of God \u2013 both servant and master. It shows how we have to keep carefully discerning the movement of the Holy Spirit and God\u2019s guidance in the light of new thinking. The image of the slave in today\u2019s Gospel is invoked to underline our response to God\u2019s goodness. It is good to recall that the word \"redemption\" literally means, \"buying back.\" It comes from the practice in the ancient world where there were two types of slaves - ones who were born or forced into slavery, usually for life, and others who paid off a debt or a crime by becoming a slave, usually for a period of time. The second type of slaves could be set free when someone else paid their debts, or the ransom their master now demanded for them was settled. They would, then, either be the slave of the purchaser, or set free completely. The metaphor came into Christian theology to describe how we, who are enslaved by our destructive behavior, gained a liberator in Christ who entered into a sinful world, subjected himself to its violence and death, to succeed in setting us free. Christ shows us that we do not have to live destructively anymore. Now claimed by the love of Christ, we are no longer slaves, but his friends, indeed through the redeeming work of Christ we have been welcomed into God\u2019s family. Our work for God, then, is totally disproportionate to the gifts we have been given. Holding, as we do, that life, creation, all talents and, in our case, security and peace are fruits of God\u2019s love, Jesus is right to highlight which side of the ledger is more generous. To serve God in the world, in response to his invitation, is a privilege. We share in his creativity, compassion, hospitality and care. And often, through us, others come to know God and make a judgment if Christian faith is sincere. As respondents to many surveys tell us, they may like who Jesus is and his teaching in the Gospel, but the stumbling block for their joining us is the way they see that faith lived out in the Church. May the Eucharist, then, give us a sense of the dignity we have by being called the servants or slaves, friends and family of Jesus Christ the Lord. Richard Leonard, S.J.\nNicely done, Richard. Especially this line: &quot;As respondents to many surveys tell us, they may like who Jesus is and his teaching in the Gospel, but the stumbling block"}

She averaged just 3.5 points and 3.9 rebounds across 18.2 minutes per game in 32 games. Next season, she will be counted on to take a larger offensive role with the loss of Mavunga, the team\u2019s top frontcourt scoring threat.\nCalhoun also affirmed her intention to return next season after the loss to the Chippewas, answering with a simple \u201cyes\u201d before the question was even completed.\nStarting in all 34 of the Buckeyes\u2019 games this season, Calhoun scored 11.8 points per game, the fourth-most on the team. She was a primary ball-handler at times, taking the pressure off Mitchell, and often took the role as a sharpshooter. She shot 37.4 percent from the field, while making 35.8 percent of her 3-point attempts this season.\nCalhoun said she anticipates and is looking forward to becoming more of a scoring threat with Ohio State\u2019s three leading scorers \u2014 Mitchell, Mavunga and Harper \u2014 leaving the program.\nGiven the youth of next season\u2019s team, Waterman and Calhoun must take larger leadership roles, which Calhoun believes will not be too much different to their roles this season despite the loss of the five seniors.\nWaterman and Calhoun will be joined next season by sophomore guard Jensen Caretti, who averaged 8.7 minutes and 2.4 points in 29 games. A former highly regarded recruit, Caretti will almost assuredly move into a starting role next season despite her lack of experience.\nNext year, the Buckeyes will add Najah Queenland, a transfer from Pacific who sat out this season and will be in her fourth collegiate season. In 2016-17, her final season at Pacific, she averaged 4.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 22.1 minutes per game. With Harper, Mitchell and Doss graduating, the 5-foot-10 Queenland could fill the role as a primary ball-handler.\nOhio State will also add a crop of freshmen. It has three 2018 prospects \u2014 four-star guard Janai Crooms, three-star post Aaliyah Patty and four-star Hungarian forward Dorka Juhasz \u2014 committed to the program. Despite lacking collegiate experience, the trio could have an impact on the team given the graduations.\nRedshirt junior guard Chelsea Mitchell, the sister of Kelsey, took the semester off to focus on academics and her status on next season\u2019s team is unclear. Former walk-ons Savitha Jayaraman and Karlie Cronin will return, but neither are expected to have major upticks in their responsibilities.\nWaterman said she and Calhoun have often looked ahead to next year and thought about being the team\u2019s only seniors with a vastly different roster composition.\nNot only will it be weird for Water"}

I\u2019ll be posting 140-character thoughts about those on Twitter @bscritic and on Facebook through Sunday.\n1. Wonderstruck: Todd Haynes\u2019 movies (\u201cCarol,\u201d \u201cFar from Heaven,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Not There.\u201d) have been so technically proficient at evoking the past that they might just make us shrug and overlook what a great artistic leap forward \u201cWonderstruck\u201d is for him. Or we might overlook that because there are so many wonderful things to simply, well, look at in the new film \u2013 which is also very much about the nurturing pleasure of looking at great stuff. Adapted by Brian Selznick (\u201cThe Invention of Hugo Cabret\u201d) from his own illustrated children\u2019s book, \u201cWonderstruck\u201d combines two movies about deaf kids who run away to New York City 50 years apart. The 1927 episodes are presented, perfectly, like great silent movies. The 1977 portions have a gritty, era-capturing richness distinctly their own. And it\u2019s a sweet story about tough little folks determined to find what they need in the magical art all around them.\n\u201cPsycho\u2019s\u201d Alfred Hitchcock and Janet Leigh.\n2. 78/52: That title refers to the number of shots and cuts Alfred Hitchcock employed to make \u201cPsycho\u2019s\u201d cinema-changing shower stabbing sequence. This appropriately adoring doc delivers a good deal of behind-the-scenes info amid a barrage of geeky praise for the 1960 movie from the likes of Guillermo del Toro, Elijah Wood, Peter Bogdanovich and Jamie Lee Curtis, a scream queen just like her mother, \u201cPsycho\u201d pincushion Janet Leigh, in her own right. \u201c78/52\u201d will be an aesthetic education for some, somewhat old news for others and a little too fanboyish in any case. Regardless, it\u2019s a much more mature and worthwhile effort than director Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s movie from a few years ago about how George Lucas ruined whiny guys\u2019 childhoods.\n3. The Killing of a Sacred Deer: A modern dress goof on a Greek legend or two by the country\u2019s cinematic bad boy Yorgos Lanthimos, this film, like his other English language whatsit \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d is all intriguing, mostly unanswered questions played for absurd laughs. Until, that is, matters take unfunny, brutal turns. It becomes oddly poignant too, considering how the cast (led in this case by Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman) speak, act and make love like they\u2019re narcotized. Lanthimos keeps delivering amusement as the cruelty expands, which I guess is his way of saying ancient myths still have relevance in our nasty world. Maybe too much relevance.\n4.

That's why we partnered with Sherwin-Williams\u00ae to share a statement-making bookcase DIY in the hot hue that's perfect for your space.\nWith perfectly styled #shelfies taking over Instagram, it's never been a better time to give your lackluster bookcase a glamorous makeover in trendy, versatile lilac. The soothing hue is excellent for promoting tranquility, and the pastel shade also functions as a neutral among brighter home decor, making it the ultimate chameleon color for sprucing up your space. Read on to discover how to paint your very own lilac bookcase.\nBefore diving into your paint project, collect your supplies for the job. A drop cloth, wood wipes, a paintbrush, a sanding sponge, painter's tape, a ruler, and your bookcase of choice are the basic materials you'll need to complete the design. Inspired Lilac SW 6820 by Sherwin-Williams is a beautiful pastel color that will stand the test of time and make the perfect backdrop for your books. Be sure to choose a paint that aligns with the type of surface you will be refinishing.\nAfter you've assembled your tools, make sure to thoroughly clean your bookcase. Removing residual dust and dirt will allow for a smooth, bump-free paint job. A simple sponge and soapy water will serve to free the bookcase of any leftover grit.\nArrange your tape to map out exactly how the design will appear on the back of your bookcase by creating a crosshatch arrangement that will ultimately transform into a diamond pattern when painted. Use a ruler to ensure each strip of tape is the same length and to create the most precise blocks of color. To simplify the process of eventually removing the tape, lay down one continuous line of tape for each line instead of separating into sections. Once the tape has been applied to the wood, use the edge of your scissors or a ruler to ensure the tape is sticking to the surface.\nUsing even strokes, paint the outside of the bookcase with Inspired Lilac SW 6820 by Sherwin-Williams. Once you've finished painting the exterior of the shelf, use a smaller brush to paint inside the tape lines designating your geometric pattern. The painter's tape will serve to catch any color that strays. Wait until your first coat of paint is dry before beginning on your next coat to ensure the most even finish. Each coat will typically dry between one and two hours.\nWhile the paint is tacky, remove each piece of tape at a 45-degree angle to make sure the design stays intact. After removing the tape, allow the paint to dry completely. While you wait for the paint to dry, use the time to tidy your space and remove items like your drop cloth and paint tray.\nStep 7: Style Your Shelfie!\nOnce the paint is completely dry, it's time to decorate your shelf! Arrange your books, framed photos, and favorite objects on the shelves in a manner that allows the design to peek through. To create a cohesive look, select tomes and other items in neutral hues and other pastels like aqua or peach, including pops of bright hues throughout. Once you've created the complete look, be sure to snap a shelfie to document your DIY!\n*WARNING!

{"idx": "13229", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: After months of behind-the-scenes discussions and multiple drafts of bills to reauthorize the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, lawmakers are gearing up to take action on the landmark special-education law.\nSen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, introduced his reauthorization plan, S 1578, last month. House Republicans have not formally introduced a bill, but the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families released its third draft plan on Feb. 27.\nThe reauthorization is long overdue. In an attempt to carve out space in a busy election-year congressional schedule, the Senate plans to put S 1578 on a fast track, bypassing subcommittee consideration and moving the bill straight to the Labor and Human Resources Committee as early as March 20. The House subcommittee, which held a hearing on the IDEA last week, has not yet set a date to begin work.\nThey would require states to offer mediation as an alternative to the law's more formal appeals process, limit the conditions under which parents can recoup legal fees in disputes with schools, and relax some of the law's accounting and reporting requirements. Both would also reconfigure the IDEA's 14 discretionary programs, which include research, training, technology, and technical-assistance efforts.\nBoth plans also attempt to limit the circumstances under which public schools must pay for children with disabilities to be educated at private schools, especially when parents unilaterally enroll their children without notifying their public schools. Both the House draft and the Senate bill also strengthen provisions in current law that call for public agencies other than schools to help bear the cost of children's \"related services,\" such as physical therapy.\nOne big difference between the plans is how they would divide federal special-education aid among states and districts. The Senate bill would maintain the current formula, which is based on a count of students eligible for special education. The House plan would base allocations on a state's total school-age population in an effort to reduce incentives to place children in special education, and also steer more money to high-poverty areas.\nBut last week's hearing made clear that the most contentious issue facing lawmakers is how much latitude schools should have to discipline dangerous or disruptive disabled children and to remove them from the classroom.\nThe law's so-called stay-put provision, which requires that students stay in their educational placement until parents and school officials agree on how to change it, has been interpreted to bar certain disciplinary action. The law and its regulations require lengthy administrative procedures that sometimes wind up in court to change a child's placement without parental consent.\nThe latest Senate bill does not include discipline provisions because many details are still being worked out, aides said. Those provisions should be ready by the time the full Senate committee takes up S 1578.\nThe House draft would allow school officials to move dangerous children with disabilities to an alternative placement for up to 45 school days without parental consent and, in some cases, allow such students to be expelled from school if their behavior is not related to their disability.\nMany Democrats at the hearing questioned the need for such provisions and cautioned that they could make it too easy for schools to rid themselves of children who pose challenges.\n\"I'm not unwilling to make changes, but not based on anecdotes,\" said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont."}

But that may be about to change.\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week he wants to add a fee of 1.25 percent to fire insurance premiums to help offset the cost of state firefighting, which last year was $1 billion and rising.\nBut is such a fee smart? Why should we flatlanders pay extra to protect the homes of those who choose to build on fire-prone hills? And why a fee of 1.25 percent, which would raise only $125 million, a fraction of the costs?\nThis is beginning to sound like just an excuse for the equivalent of a tax increase, and a piddling one at that, considering the deficit next year will be at least $14 billion. And, as L.A. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has said, it looks like double taxation for residents of city of L.A., who in 2000 approved a $32-a-year bond measure for improved fire protection, and residents served by the L.A. County Fire Department, who a few years earlier approved a $50 tax.\nCompare that with San Diego residents, who twice rejected taxes to improve fire services, and, as the Los Angeles Times pointed out, Angora Valley residents in the Lake Tahoe area who are equally tax averse. Both areas have had devastating losses in recent wildfires.\nThere are 1 million homes built on land so far away from city, county or special-district fire services that the state must protect them. A fee added to their fire insurance seems more than reasonable, especially in places like San Diego and Angora Valley, where people seem to expect others to pay for their protection."}

Some of them -- Sarah Palin, for instance -- place themselves under a media spotlight of their own free will. Others -- her daughter, for instance -- wind up there through no fault of their own. Imagine yourself in her position: there you are, seventeen years old, pregnant, unmarried. Maybe you understand what happened and why; and maybe your parents and friends do as well. But zillions of bloggers and reporters and pundits are about to make the most personal details of your life into a political issue, and they don't understand it at all. And yet, despite that, they are about to use you and your unborn child to score points on one another, without any regard whatsoever for you and your actual situation.\nI want no part of this. None at all. To those of you who think otherwise: that's your right. But ask yourself how you felt when Republicans scored points using Chelsea Clinton, who didn't ask to be dragged into the spotlight either.\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's fair game to consider Sarah Palin's statements about her daughter's decision, and to compare them to her own views about abortion.\nThat's a story about whether or not Sarah Palin sticks to her beliefs when they affect her own family, not about her daughter. But it is not fair game to use her daughter, or any of her kids, as pawns in a political argument. To my mind, this extends to using her daughter as evidence that abstinence-only education doesn't work: presumably, no one thinks that it works 100% of the time, and that's the only claim to which this one counterexample could possibly be relevant. (That's why God created large-scale studies.) Likewise, I think that arguing about whether Sarah Palin is a good mother is out of line: we have no idea at all what arrangements she and her husband have made for child care, how their relationship works, and so forth.

It\u2019s a four-bedroom, five-bathroom 4,400-square-foot house in Frisco\u2019s prestigious Water Dance neighborhood. A single-family home in the Ski Home subdivision of Breckenridge, along with a couple condos and a vacant lot, also in Breckenridge, rounded out the five priciest sales of the month, according to the Summit County Assessor\u2019s Office.\nAnd March did outperform the two months leading up to it, January and February, but the month remained 32 percent behind the number of sales and 40 percent below their combined value compared to the record-setting March 2017.\nFor Slifer Smith & Frampton, the county\u2019s first-quarter decline can be blamed on a lackluster March, but moreover, the declines indicate a lack of available listings is starting to slow the pace of local real estate sales.\nAs proof, the company cites other statistics, like the falling number of days homes spend on the market, rising prices per square foot or a narrowing gap between asking and closing prices.\n\u201cResidential properties are still commanding higher prices and moving quickly,\u201d the company surmised, offering an assessment not unique among local real estate professionals.\nAccording to another monthly report, this one prepared by Coldwell Banker Mountain Properties, Summit County\u2019s average sale price for a home was $636,000 in March, up from $572,450 in March 2017.\nAdditionally, Coldwell\u2019s monthly market snapshot noted that the average price per square foot has risen at the same time the average number of days a home spends on the market has fallen to just 12 days.\nThe numbers can vary depending on town, price points and even neighborhood, but the trends reflect that demand is exceeding supply.\nIn fact, with 521 active listings on April 10, the number remains at record lows, according to Land Title Guarantee Company of Summit County, which breaks down those listings into 345 for residential properties and 176 for vacant land.\nLooking at where those properties are, 231 were in Breckenridge, 129 in Silverthorne, 87 in Keystone, 36 in Copper, 27 in Frisco and 11 in Dillon, according to Slifer Smith & Frampton.\nThe Summit County Assessor\u2019s Office also recently released March\u2019s sales of record with information on 139 local real estate transactions worth $86.4 million.

Right up to the BBC exit polls, it was assumed that Neil Kinnock\u2019s Labour would win. But John Major, always underestimated by a sneering metropolitan media class, triumphed against the odds.\nHe won more votes \u2013 14 million \u2013 than any other British prime minister has ever done. In popular terms, the margin of victory was immense. No less than 42 per cent of the voters came out for Major, 34 per cent for Kinnock. But the bias of the British electoral system hit the Conservatives hard.\nHad Labour enjoyed that 8 per cent lead in the popular vote, it would have secured a parliamentary majority of more than 100. Unlucky Major ended up with a majority of just 21, which was whittled away over the coming years until his government ended in ignominy and defeat.\nHis administration has enjoyed a terrible reputation and remains associated with sleaze, incompetence, drift and weakness. But as time has passed this verdict has started to look unfair. History may yet be much kinder to John Major than many would have thought.\nFirst, let\u2019s take economic management. Because of the Black Wednesday fiasco of September 1992, when sterling was evicted from the exchange rate mechanism, this is regarded as a disaster. But the big picture tells a different story. Under Major\u2019s two chancellors, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke, Britain navigated her way very surely out of the deep recession of the early 1990s.\nBy 1997 employment was rising, growth stable, and the deficit was well under control, meaning that Gordon Brown as chancellor inherited the most benign economic scenario for any British government of the last century. The situation was so fundamentally strong that it took three successive Labour administrations to wreck it.\nMajor\u2019s second great achievement concerns Northern Ireland. Tony Blair has taken all the credit for negotiating a peaceful solution to the Troubles. Much of it is deserved. But neither Blair nor anyone else has ever properly acknowledged the role played by Major in bringing the IRA to the peace table. Given that he was dependent on Unionist votes for his parliamentary majority, this was an act of sacrifice as well as political courage.\nPublic service reform is another area upon which Major can look back with pride. At the time, he was mocked as a useless meddler whose most substantive achievement was the derided Cones Hotline. But he was the first prime minister who seriously tried to tackle the vested interests that dominate the health service, introducing GP fundholding and patient choice.\nHe confronted the producer interests that have wrecked our education system, while Peter Lilley was the first welfare secretary to think seriously about the looming pensions crisis. Meanwhile, his home secretary, Michael Howard, bravely challenged the entrenched Home Office doctrine that rising crime was inevitable.\nSadly, most of these reforms were denounced by Labour \u2013 indeed, Blair deceitfully claimed that the Tories intended to abolish state pensions during the 1997 election campaign. Once in power, Labour scrapped Lilley\u2019s pension plan and the city technology colleges, while putting the health strategy into reverse. It was only in his second term that Blair realised his mistake in departing from Major\u2019s vision, and reintroduced Tory NHS and education proposals under different"}

By 2020, JTV expects to have ongoing investments in about 30 startups at a time. Most are Series A or seed-round investments in companies of between three and 20 people.\nToday, JTV is announcing its investment in Lumo, a Boston B2B company that\u2019s built technology aimed at predicting flight delays as much as three months in advance. Meant to help airlines plan their schedules months ahead as well as to give individual passengers a day or two of warning that their flight is going to be 30 minutes late, Lumo leverages its founders\u2019 years of work in airspace modeling. It hopes airlines, business travelers, app providers, and others will become customers.\nAccording to Lumo CEO Bala Chandran, the company uses machine learning to analyze a variety of signals, from historical weather patterns to what air-traffic controllers are saying, to known runway construction projects, and more\u2014all to estimate flight delays. The sooner the flight, the more accurate the prediction is, of course, but Lumo believes that even historical patterns that can be intuited a couple of months in advance are useful to airlines that, for example, are trying to plan crew shifts. Another use case is for helping insurance companies price travel policies.\nLumo\u2019s an example of a company that could integrate into JetBlue\u2019s operations\u2013or that of other airlines\u2013in the short term. Another is Gladly, which makes a platform that integrates many different customer communications channels\u2013email, texts, calls, etc.\u2013into one dashboard for easy consumption and action by customer service reps.

He came from an impoverished background. From a monetary standpoint, he earned enough to purchase a home, pay his bills and enjoy life. Family took center stage for Sam. Not long after meeting Sam did I realize a good man in my company. He and his wife of over 50 years raised several children. Each has played out his or her respective lives replete with joys and sorrows, successes and failures. Along the continuum, Sam was seen as an emotionally supportive father. When achievements were experienced, Sam was there to support and love. When troubles ensued, Sam, too, was there to love and support.\nYou might think that I\u2019m typecasting Sam as a perfect man. He\u2019ll be the first to recognize and voice his shortcomings. I might suggest that Sam is mightily tough on himself. When one of his off-spring experienced serious troubles, Sam supported him and in the same breath self-loathed for the troubles. He deemed himself as not being a good parent. His other children have expressed their respective satisfaction with Sam as a good parent throughout the years.\nSam is in the throes of deep sorrow. His wife passed away so suddenly and unexpectedly. They had been enjoying retirement and were making future plans. The measure of Sam\u2019s loss was beyond comprehension. His life has been severely impacted to include obsessive thoughts, restlessness, poor sleep, weight loss and constant crying. What can Sam be offered to aid him in his time of grief as he mourns the loss of the love of his life?\nFamily and friends have naturally come forward to offer kindness, words of condolences and love. While appreciative of the outpouring of love, the shock and the time following his wife\u2019s passing has left him a \u2018shell of a man\u2019 by his own admission. He walks or actually shuffles through daily life. In the course of his grief, he has exhausted his psyche by recalling the myriad events and experiences he shared with his wife. Along with some spoken joys, Sam has become laden with guilt. He has dissected experiences deemed sinful on his part. As one might imagine, Sam didn\u2019t share all of his reported transgressions with his wife. He berates himself and obsesses with his participation in bad judgement and decision-making. Again, how does Sam move through this heavy experience?\nIn this early stage of grief, I introduced the mind-body-spirit connection concept to Sam. While immersed in the depth of grief, Sam hears that his thoughts and feelings, his full experience is real, with entitlement. Yet I point out that we must assess for its impact on daily functioning.

{"idx": "13262", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Agreeing on a business valuation method for a buyout requires negotiation.\nStructuring a buyout of a partner in a general partnership is much easier if you prepare for the possibility of an ownership change at the start of your business endeavor. Reaching an agreement regarding what the business is worth can be contentious when you try to do it after the issue comes up, especially if the exiting partner has what the remaining partners feel is an inflated notion of the present value of the company.\nBuying out a partner is a negotiated process. A majority of the partners can't simply set any price they want for the withdrawing partner's interest. Likewise, the exiting partner can't just demand what he feels is his due. Partnerships are governed by the laws of the state where the partnership conducts business; by default, most states require general partnerships to buy out a withdrawing partner at a fair amount that represents what his share of the proceeds would be if the partnership business were to be liquidated or sold. Of course, figuring out the liquidation or sale value of the company is the problematic matter, because the only real way to know those amounts for sure is to actually liquidate or sell the company on the open market.\nSavvy business owners prepare for the eventual withdrawal of a partner by placing buy-sell provisions in the partnership agreement. These provisions specify what will happen if a partner wants to withdraw and under which circumstances the partnership can demand a partner sell her interest back to the company. Properly drafted buy-sell provisions will include a way to value the business. For example, the partnership agreement can require that a business valuation be conducted once a year, so when a valuation is needed for a buyout, there's a valuation history that ensures the buyout offer is fair. It can also require the partnership to hire an independent expert to value the company.\nEstablishing a value for a business is an inexact science. You can value the business by considering the value of its assets, taking into account what it would cost to replace everything that the partnership owns. You can consider the amount of cash the company brings in and project that amount into the future to establish value. Looking at the sales price of comparable businesses that were sold in the same geographic area recently is yet another valuation strategy. You're free to use one or a combination of these methods or to come up with your own buyout price based on other criteria.\nIf your partners can't agree on a business valuation to support a buyout package, you have options to break the stalemate. The buy-sell provisions of a partnership agreement can mandate arbitration to handle the buyout negotiations. Or the partners can take the issue to court, and the judge will decide the value of the business and a fair buyout amount.\nMasters, Terry. \"How to Value the Buyout of a Business Partner.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/value-buyout-business-partner-75023.html.

But your playlists also teach its algorithms what movies you'll watch -- and even how you'll vote \"I just found Polish reggae two days ago,\" boasts Glenn McDonald, lead engineer at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based music startup The Echo Nest, as we stare at a screen in a conference room.\nThe Echo Nest claims it reaches around 100 million listeners per month, by powering music discovery services such as Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody and VEVO, and delivering musical connections where none may have existed before. Even now, where every band is no more than a Google search away, you may never have heard of these two acts, or indeed the genre. But a few days before, as The Echo Nest's research algorithms were sifting through \"unassigned artists\", McDonald found a strange cluster. \"The computer said, 'These go together more strongly than with anything else,'\" says McDonald.\nAnd so another entry was added to Every Noise at Once, McDonald's massive project to map the world's corpus of musical genres. Staring at the sprawling projection up on the wall, which resembles Mark Lombardi's unsettlingly internecine drawings of political conspiracies, one finds Polish reggae wedged roughly between Romanian pop and K-hop (or Korean hip-hop), closer in musical space to Chicago soul than it is to Finnish hip-hop.\nThese genre clusters are created not by what the artists sound like, but how they are described in the world: on music blogs; in record-company catalogues; on your cousin's Facebook page -- anything The Echo Nest's semantic trawl pulls up. Although to human ears, there is a distinct sound to Polish reggae -- McDonald says there is a \"polka-folk melody to some of it\", not to mention the lyrics being in Polish -- the distinction is murkier to a computer.\nThere are reggae bands from Bulgaria to Omaha, Nebraska, that would sound, in terms of quantitative audio signal, fairly similar. \"But Polish reggae is clearly a thing,\" says McDonald, \"and bands from Bulgaria to Omaha aren't part of it, no matter what they sound like.\"\nEvery Noise at Once is more of an obsessive skunkworks-style exercise in computer learning than a revenue stream for The Echo Nest. The company grew out of research at MIT's Media Lab, and now essentially makes money as the behind-the-scenes engine powering any number of greater-known applications, from Rdio to Spotify to Yahoo! to MTV. \"In some ways,\" says Jim Lucchese, The Echo Nest's CEO, \"we're the nerds doing the cool kids' homework,\" adding over drinks in Tribeca in New York City that, before McDonald joined the company, his hobby was \"cleaning up music metadata\".\nBut Every Noise at Once speaks to the same animating impulse on which the company was founded, as described by The Echo Nest's cofounder and chief technical officer, 36-year-old Brian Whitman. \"We are trying to automatically understand everything about music,\" he says. \"What people are saying about it, what it sounds like.\"\nThat means teaching computers about human constructs such as genre, which provide handy \"bookmarks\", as McDonald describes it, to finding one's place in the musical universe; but which can also be imprecise or particular to a"}

Erdogan\u2019s increased power would grant him even more leverage over EU policies, by allowing him to threaten to open the refugee floodgate on the European continent.\nAs I said on Friday, the rest of the world is (at least for now) relegated to the role of basically sitting on the sidelines and watching. Having the trappings of a public referendum applied to Erdogan\u2019s power grab makes it seem all the more legitimate. And even though he has locked up his opponents by the tens of thousands, it\u2019s all being done under the umbrella of law enforcement and an effort to fight terrorism. Honestly, there\u2019s little to be done at this point and nobody is interested in full scale military intervention in a nation which is still ostensibly one of our allies.\nTurkey\u2019s once flourishing democracy is, at this point, pretty much a thing of the past. It\u2019s a sad day, but there will likely be far darker ones to come."}

On top of that, they often produce blurry or distorted images to the detriment of the user.\nThis latest device, meanwhile, used graphene and molybdenum disulphide as well as thin layers of gold, alumina and silicon nitrate to create a flexible, high-density and curved sensor array.\nResembling a flattened football, the device can conform itself to the shape of a natural retina without mechanically disturbing it.\n\u201cAlthough this research is still in its infancy, it is a very exciting starting point for the use of these materials to restore vision,\u201d said Nanshu Lu of the research team.\nLooking to the future, the team is aiming to integrate the technology into mechanically and optically imperceptible electronic tattoos that are laminated on the skin surface to gather real-time health information."}

And for a guy who has continually favored discourse over swift, decisive action, Barry's choice to usurp Jamal's position as president doesn\u2019t exactly present itself as a move from his playbook.\nIt's almost as though Tyrant is trying to tell us that Barry Al-Fayeed is not the mild-mannered Pediatrician from Pasadena, CA everyone thinks he is. He might, in fact, be a man who, as his wife proclaims after learning of his intentions for Abbudin, gets off on the idea of power.\nWhile that moment might have been better stated through Barry's actions or his changing demeanor (which right now primarily consists of Barry yelling at Molly for no reason whatsoever, and rubbing his temples in frustration), such a shift in character isn't something Tyrant would just sit idly by and let the audience come to on its own \u2013 the show has been holding the audience's hand for eight weeks now, and it's not about to let go as the season makes its turn into the final stretch.\nThe thing is, Barry's (admittedly unconvincing) transition and the potential intrigue surrounding his planned coup are both aspects of Tyrant the series desperately needed to have long before now. At this point in the season, the end is near, and yet matters of actual consequence still seem so far away.\nSure, Barry, Yussef, John Tucker and spooky agent-of-some-kind Lea Exley (Leslie Hope) are in the early stages of planning a coup, but planning a coup is not nearly as interesting as actually following through with a coup.\nOne of the primary problems with serialized television is that while it can be incredibly fulfilling to see a single story manifest and coalesce over the course of 10-13 episodes, certain shows \u2013 like Tyrant \u2013 postpone the real story until the very end.\nThink back to Breaking Bad and Walter White's bloody disposal of his enemies. The event wasn't a complete surprise, but the swiftness of it - and the swiftness with which the series dealt with the consequences of that action - were, delightfully so.\nWhat Breaking Bad understood that perhaps Tyrant doesn't is that, when it comes to compelling fiction, the audience doesn\u2019t always need to see how the sausage is made. Barry making the choice to stage a coup is necessary, and it is a great step forward in terms of what has so far been a rather dull narrative, but watching a character deal with consequences of his or her actions will always trump watching them plan said decisive action, regardless of the tension that arises.\nThe only thing that results from the inevitable tension of the moment between inaction and action are the tired tropes of those with limited knowledge of the action somehow preventing it from happening. In this case, Barry's two kids (Sammy, specifically) once again play convenient plot devices that could upstage their father's plans for a mostly bloodless and face-saving coup.\nMeanwhile, Jamal continues to believe he and his brother have a special ironclad relationship that people like Leila simply cannot understand. As such, Jamal busies himself with announcing the construction of a public football pitch, and harassing the daughter-in-law he assaulted, which results in"}

Bourrie spoke to CHRIS COBB about what he sees as a major threat to Canada\u2019s democracy.\nHow has information control evolved under Harper?\nIt\u2019s part corporate news management and part resentment among Conservatives of the old Reform Party of what they see as an elite press.\nWhat is corporate news management?\nIt\u2019s not doing face-to-face interviews and not being open with information, over-managing the flow of information from government to the people and clamping down on the number of people who have access to the media. Everything is massaged and planned and manipulated. In many cases, people who want to know what government\u2019s doing \u2014 media, MPs, NGOs, scientists, ordinary citizens \u2014 never really find out.\nSo your theory is Reform and the other pre-Conservative incarnations were upset about news coverage?\nThey thought it was unfair and patronizing in a lot of cases.\nSometimes, but they didn\u2019t understand how government worked. They brought a lot of prejudices to Ottawa and tried to make them fit. They saw the public service as an enemy and the Christian fundamentalists among them saw science as a left-wing enemy wanting to shut down the oil industry with bogus climate change science. They were going to open up government and restore democracy but Harper\u2019s Accountability Act turned into a bad joke.\nIt became easier for them. It was a lot simpler to shut down information coming from caucus and ministers and government experts. They also wanted to change the story of Canada from what they saw as a Central Canadian narrative to a more western, more militarist, less peacekeeping \u2014 a more heroic version of Canadian history and re-make the way Canadians think about their own country. And they have done a fairly good job.\nIf that\u2019s the case, what do they get out of it politically?\nThey replace an old Liberal establishment with a new Conservative establishment. They want to replace the old Liberal myths and replace them with Conservative myths. So the Liberal myth of Pierre Trudeau, the Constitution and Charter of Rights is replaced by Vimy Ridge and Canada punching above its weight, with the Conservatives as the political arm. It would be a Tory government of a new Tory Canada. It could keep them in power for a long time if they pull it off.\nIf the Liberals or NDP were running the government, would they be any less controlling?\nNot unless Canadians make it clear that it is part of their mandate. How much of their government do Canadians want done in secret? How weak do they want Parliament to be? It\u2019s about our democracy. The House of Commons barely functions now and it\u2019s the only national democratic institution we have. The system now works as an elected dictatorship, and I\u2019m not sure how easy it will be to change that back. What\u2019s needed is for politicians to trust people to decide things for themselves instead of manipulating them.\nWhat do you see as the most egregious aspect of the Harper government\u2019s control over information?\nAny message control that limits the ability of individual MPs to function \u2014 the unprecedented amount of party control over MPs, the weakening of (Commons) committees and the deliberate derailing of committee work.

The goal of the consortium, called Green Touch, will be to demonstrate dramatically more efficient wired and wireless network gear within five years.\nRecognizing that networks, like data centers, don't run on good intentions alone, the head of research at Alcatel's storied Bell Labs wants telecom's top scientists to start with a blank slate and reinvent telecommunications infrastructure to use less power. If Green Touch hits its targets, the new equipment will run for three years on the power that current systems use up in just one day, said Gee Rittenhouse, vice president of research at Bell Labs and the head of Green Touch.\n\"What we're trying to do is really think about it afresh,\" said Rittenhouse, a longtime researcher at the lab. Whereas vendors today design products for high performance while also considering power requirements, Green Touch is going to design them for efficiency first while also keeping performance in mind.\n\"Normally, the research done today is about taking today's network and refining it ... instead of erasing the board, starting from an open mind, and building up from there,\" Rittenhouse said. The power-saving technology available today, even if it were applied throughout all networks, would only keep power consumption flat over the coming years, he said.\n\"We've never said, 'Stop. If we were to design a network that was optimized for energy, what would it look like?'\"\nThe minimum power consumption for today's Internet and carrier networks around the world would be zero, which would be achieved by turning them all off, Rittenhouse said. Assuming no one wants to do that, the theoretical minimum power for actually running those networks would be lower than today's energy use by a factor of 10,000, he said.\nGreen Touch intends to achieve just one-tenth of that, but even for this effort the group wants to bring in experts from throughout the industry. In addition to Samsung, China Mobile and MIT, the consortium will include Freescale Semiconductor, SwissCom, Telefonica, Stanford University, the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control, and other entities. But many other key players, such as Ericsson, Cisco and any major U.S. carrier, were not listed as members.\nThe most efficient parts of the global infrastructure are fiber-optic networks, which transmit streams of data as wavelengths, or colors, of light. They are nearly 100 percent efficient, according to Rittenhouse. But at the ends of those fiber networks are usually older copper wires or wireless systems that don't work as efficiently. The most waste comes from cellular systems, because they have to send a signal out over a wide area just to reach the one subscriber it is meant for, Rittenhouse said.\nThough a clean-slate approach may deliver fresh ideas, it's likely to take a long time for the revolutionary products that come from Green Touch to start saving energy. Between standardization, product development and trials, it typically takes between five and 10 years after the first lab demonstrations for a totally new technology to be deployed, Rittenhouse said.\nThe Green Touch initiative is critical for the long-term future of communications, though it faces some challenges, according to analyst Kneko Burney of Compass Intelligence.\n\"There is no other objective more pressing than to ensure that the demand for energy does not exceed the limitations of our ability to generate it,\" Burney said in an e-mail interview."}

It has imposed an emergency ban on any new studios in the 100-year-old town on the Monterey peninsula.\nThe resort has a population of 4,081 and 120 art galleries - one for every 34 residents.\nWith the number of galleries doubling in the past five years, the council fears that the glut is deterring tourists seeking leisure less high-brow than oil paintings and sculptures.\nIt is also concerned that essential services for local residents are being squeezed out because of the high rents some galleries can afford, in some cases up to \u00a314,000 a month. An \"urgency ordinance\" was passed, temporarily barring new galleries from Carmel's business district until a law came into force this month.\nThe law now demands that new galleries either focus primarily on the work of one artist or have an \"artist in residence\" working on the premises.\nOfficials say the move is vital financially. The profusion of galleries has resulted in a major drop in sales tax, which is not charged on art shipped out of California. Partly due to this, the city dipped \u00a3400,000 into the red and had to lay off 20 staff.\nBut gallery owners say the move unfairly penalises them and ignores the significant revenue they bring in by attracting tourists.\nSue McCloud, a retired CIA agent now in her third term as mayor of Carmel, a post held by Clint Eastwood in the 1980s, said: \"We felt we had too many galleries for business diversity.\n\"You can't get your hair cut or your shoes repaired here. We're down to one drug store for a town where the average age is 55.\"\nSome two million tourists visit the city each year, she said.

They cherished them in boxes or taped them inside baby books that were kept in closets or the garage.\nToday, some parents are taking that sentimentality to a whole new level.\nLike turning their offspring's umbilical cord \u2013 you know, the crusty nugget that falls off a few days after baby comes home \u2013 into a piece of jewelry.\nKind of strange? OK. But more celebrities by the day are blending the sleep sac of their newborn into placenta smoothies. So keep that in mind.\nDoes the umbilical cord have to be new?\nActually, no. Artisans say the age of the umbilical stump doesn't matter. It can be from an infant born a month ago or decades earlier.\nSpeckled Milk jewelry maker Nianna Rodriguez created a piece of umbilical jewelry for a mother who had stowed the stump in a baby book for 17 years.\n\"It was just as beautiful,\" Rodriguez told All the Moms. \"It's amazing how you shave off the top layer and that's where you get this beautiful amber color that translates wonderfully into jewelry.\"\nCrafters like Rodriguez sell their wares online. Mothers interested in a wearable memory choose from one of the artist's designs and follow the packing instructions for the stump and send it off in the mail.\nJeweler Ruth Avra of Sarasota, Florida fell into making the organic jewelry by accident. A mom friend asked her to create something using her baby's umbilical cord stump. The jeweler since 2003 had no idea what to make. Then, she placed it beside her son's own stump on a table.\n\"It was sort of like a lightening bolt struck,\" said Avra, who owns A La Avra. \"Now I understand what I'm supposed to do.\"\nAvra created her first piece of cord jewelry in 2012.\nNow, demand is rising on the time-consuming pieces. At any one time, she can be working on as many as 10 orders, she said. Each one takes about 4-6 weeks to complete, from the time parents send off the stumps to when they get jewelry back.\nAvra uses a process called lost wax carving to create a singular piece using the shape of the stump to determine the jewelry's design. She also has begun taking requests for shapes, such as a heart.\nShe makes rings, bracelets and cufflinks, but her silver umbilical cord necklace, which sells for $195, is her best seller.\nNo client who calls her on the phone or sends her an email is typical, she said.\n\"They're actually from all over.

No Income, No Assets = NINA.\nAnd now, NINA loans are back, as 360 Mortgage Group announced this week that it is launching a no-income, no-asset mortgage pilot program.\nThe loan program, which the Austin, Texas-based mortgage banking firm calls the \u201cAgency NINA,\u201d does not require borrowers to prove their income or assets in order to be approved for the loan.\nThe loan is also available for borrowers with FICO scores as low as 620, which would firmly put the loan in the subprime range, as Experian considers subprime to be borrowers with FICO scores below 670.\nAccording to 360 Mortgage, the Agency NINA mortgage is available for loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%.\nIt\u2019s important to note that despite the loan carrying the \u201cAgency\u201d name, which would imply that one of the government-sponsored enterprises is backing the loan, neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac is backing these loans.\nAccording to 360 Mortgage, the loans will be backed by private capital with guidelines sourced from Fannie Mae\u2019s seller guide. The loans will then either be held in portfolio or placed into a private securitization.\nAnother caveat is that the Agency NINA loans will not be available for owner-occupied properties, at least in this initial phase.\nInitially, the loan will be available for non-owner-occupied investment properties only.\n360 Mortgage said that it plans to issue as much as $1 billion in these loans, at which point the company will evaluate the performance of the loans to determine if additional occupancy options will be added.\nIn the initial phase, investors can use the loans for purchases, refinances, and cash-out refinances.\n\u201cThe idea behind this product is to allow a more lenient option for investors to purchase, refinance or cash out of their properties,\u201d the company said in a release.\nGiven the nature of the loan, the Agency NINA is also well outside of the Qualified Mortgage box, but 360 Mortgage Group Chief Operating Officer Andrew WeissMalik said that the loan is not like the other non-QM options that are increasing in popularity.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that 360 Mortgage has been near the forefront of the expansion of the credit box.\nJust over four years ago, 360 Mortgage was one of the companies to offer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 97% LTV products.\nBut things have come a long way since then."}

Captain-coach Jake Maurirere said this as the Ratz prepare to tackle Wallamba in the final tomorrow at Nabiac. Winner will move to the decider against Forster-Tuncurry at Tuncurry on Saturday September 22. The Ratz also have a couple of injury concerns. Centre Toby De Stefano and fullback Reece Holden were both causalities in Manning\u2019s 55-13 demolition of an understrength Gloucester in the minor semi-final. De Stefano limped off with a hamstring strain while Holden corked his thigh. Holden is causing the most concern. \u201cReece is having scans this week and he\u2019s hoping to be right, but at this stage we\u2019re not sure,\u2019\u2019 Maurirere said. De Stefano won\u2019t train this week but Maurirere said he\u2019s confident he\u2019ll play. Josh Ross is waiting to come into the side as a replacement. If Holden is out Bruwyn Tisdell will drop from centre back to the custodian\u2019s role, with Ross deputising as centre. \u201cBruywn played really well back there last week after we lost Reece,\u2019\u2019 Maurirere said. The Ratz were never in any real danger of defeat against the Cockies. However, Maurirere was concerned at the number of penalties they conceded. He said the Bulls will punish them on Saturday for such ill-discipline. Maurirere said the Bulls like to throw the ball wide and bring fullback Tout and centre Handford into play as often as possible. \u201cThey\u2019re their go-to players,\u2019\u2019 he added. Second rower Brody Howard decimated the Gloucester defence last week and while the Bulls will be much more formidable, Maurirere backs him to produce a similar effort tomorrow. \u201cHe was supposed to go to Queensland for a chainsaw event, but he\u2019s staying here to play rugby,\u2019\u2019 Maurirere pointed out. \u201cHe was close to unstoppable last week and we can get momentum off him. Brody has ball skills as well and he\u2019s built up a good understanding with our prop, Chris Noonan.\u2019\u2019 Wallamba finished minor premiers and had the major semi-final seemingly secure at halftime last week when leading 21-6 before Forster produced a stunning second half comeback. Maurirere admits he thought he\u2019d be playing the Dolphins this week and not the Bulls. \u201cBut it just goes to show you can never discount Forster in finals,\u2019\u2019 he said. The Ratz haven\u2019t beaten Wallamba this season, although the last two games were closely fought affairs and Maurirere said his side will need to be at their best tomorrow if they are going to be defending one half of the field on grand final day.\nManning halfback Tim Rees fires the ball out during the win over Gloucester in the minor semi-final.

He is now the Executive Director of Discovering Deaf Worlds, which works with deaf community leaders around the globe.\nDavin Searls, Executive Director of Discovering Deaf Worlds, is based here in Rochester, but his work stretches well beyond the city.\nDiscovering Deaf Worlds provides capacity building training to deaf community leaders in developing countries. According to a 2009 study by the World Federation of the Deaf, around 90 percent of deaf people in developing countries receive no formal education. And far too often, decisions are made about those populations without their involvement. DDW works with leaders in those countries to identify what areas they need training in, and then brings in experts to provide said training.\nSearls joined DDW in 2008, and in the years since has conducted presentations on human rights, advocacy, and diversity within the global deaf community. He has also led development trainings with community leaders in the Philippines, India, and more recently, the Dominican Republic.\n\"In so many other countries we work in, deaf people are told what they can't do, but here in Rochester, deaf people are recognized for what they can do,\" Searls says during a phone interview coordinated with a sign language interpreter. \"With our world growing ever-more interconnected, we have a responsibility as global citizens to advance the rights of others. Rochester is well known for its accessibility and as one of the top cities for deaf people; it's a model for what other communities can do.\"\nRecently, DDW collaborated with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf for the Global Readiness Leadership Program, which focused on international deaf students attending the college. As part of their RIT/NTID education, students were given an opportunity to develop leadership skills, in hopes they'll return home to advocate for underrepresented communities. The 2016-17 pilot program included eight students \u2014 representing Myanmar, Nepal, India, the Philippines, Ghana, Zanzibar, South Korea, and Malaysia.\n\"All of them really grew and became better leaders on campus,\" Searls says. \"We just applied for a grant in Zanzibar thanks to one of the students we worked with \u2014 this grant will be focused on building the capacity of deaf women and girls there.\"\nSearls formerly chaired the International Experts Group sub-committee of the National Association of the Deaf, and is currently a member of the Human Rights Experts Group of the World Federation of the Deaf. Still, in 2013 he gave a compelling TEDxRochester presentation about deaf culture in the city.\n\"While most of my work is abroad, Rochester has given me a foundation to branch out,\" Searls says.\nSearls is deaf, and is part of a fourth-generation deaf family from Rochester. Before he joined DDW, Searls lived in China for a year, teaching at a college in Changchun. While there, he witnessed neglect and physical and verbal abuse of deaf children.\nThat ultimately pushed Searls to take on his current work. Rochester, he says, has deaf lawyers, deaf doctors, deaf dentists, and we see an abundance of individuals with long-term careers and success. Searls wants to bring that spirit to other countries.\n\"We're fortunate to have so many deaf professionals from Rochester, some of them provided training to our group in the Philippines,\" he says."}

But the real picture hit home powerfully when I learned the youngest referral to T\u0177 Hapus was a mother of 44, the same age as me.\nThe presenter of our two-part series \u2013 Fiona Phillips - knows only too well how this incurable, degenerative and terminal brain disease can strike younger people. Her mother developed it in her mid-50s \u2013 one of the 15,000 people in Britain who show symptoms before the age of 65. Fiona, whose family roots are in Haverfordwest, lost her father to Alzheimer\u2019s too.\nSo when she was asked to become patron of T\u0177 Hapus, Fiona felt an immediate connection with the people behind the project and was impressed and encouraged by their aims.\n\u201cWhen I got involved I met two remarkable Welsh women who are each making a major impact on how we should cope with and combat this cruel disease,\u201d Fiona explains.\nThe women Fiona describes are Justine Pickering and Professor Julie Williams. I shaped the series through their perspectives.\nJustine\u2019s mother Annie developed Alzheimer\u2019s at 55. As the disease changed this vibrant former civil servant into someone who required round the clock care, Justine was distraught to find how little provision there was for younger people with Alzheimer\u2019s. The only respite centre available catered for the elderly, leaving Justine\u2019s mother feeling unhappy and isolated.\nSo Justine decided to do something about it. She began fundraising \u2013 initially persuading a group of friends to embark on a sponsored cycle from Windsor Castle to Cardiff Castle. Her campaign took flight. What started as a modest plan to fund a single respite care worker for her mum grew into a major project to provide a pioneering day centre for younger people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\nJustine took a lease on an Edwardian building in the middle of Barry and, begging favours from interior designers and furniture stores, transformed it into an elegant home from home. Complete with cafe where family and friends can drop in, beauty treatment room, dining room and lounge, the ambience of T\u0177 Hapus is more boutique hotel than day centre.\nWith the help of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society an expert team of carers was put in place and T\u0177 Hapus welcomed its first guests at the start of 2012. Providing respite care and activities for up to five days a week, it is a ground-breaking concept.\nFunded entirely by charitable donations, T\u0177 Hapus has proved an absolute lifeline for families struggling to cope with the devastating impact of early-onset dementia. And sadly there is nothing else like it in Wales and the rest of the UK. There must be so many families desperate for similar facilities.\nJust a few miles away the quest to find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s continues. Professor Julie Williams and her team at Cardiff University are at the forefront of global Alzheimer\u2019s research. They collaborate with scientists across the world. And with a database of 100,000 dementia case studies to draw on they\u2019ve made some remarkable breakthroughs.\n\u201cThere are new ways of looking at the disease and new aven"}

In fact, it was enough to throw critics off guard completely, and it wasn't quite the critical success of their previous two albums.\nHowever, popular songs from the record like 'The Shape I'm In' and 'Stage Fright' would go on to be huge live hits and retrospective reviews several years on have been a lot more positive, praising it as a landmark album in the band's career.\nThe musicianship of the album was certainly never in question. The Band started out their career as the backing band for rockabilly artist Ronnie Hawkins before going on to work with Bob Dylan on the legendary 'Basement Tapes'.\nBy the following year, in 1968, they had released their debut album 'Music from Big Pink' and christianed themselves The Band, because that was what they were always referred to as by artists.

Wal-Mart, however, has not conceded defeat to its digital rival and has big plans for becoming more competitive. The company shared some of them at its 22nd Annual Meeting for the Investment Community on Oct. 14.\nWal-Mart, which already invests heavily into its digital efforts plans to ramp things up even further, but the company's CEO wanted to make it clear that it was starting from a position of strength.\n\"We have also been building an e-commerce business; we have been hiring top technology talent in Silicon Valley and around the world,\" CEO Doug McMillon said to in his speech kicking off the investors' event. \"Refreshing the customer experience and becoming a true Internet technology company.

A key part of that strategy, McMillon said, comes from leveraging its physical locations.\n\"First, win with stores,\" he said. \"We know customers love shopping in stores and they will want great stores tomorrow. And why wouldn't they? The chance to interact with products, to see something new, to look at an item, touch a fabric, smell something, see a color -- it is important to them.

The company has a level of success to build upon.\nThe biggest challenge for Wal-Mart is turning the customers who walk through its door into digital shoppers.

{"idx": "13318", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Reporting in the Journal of Endocrinology, researchers led by Ladan Eshkevari, assistant program director of the nurse anesthesia program at Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies, mimicked chronic stress in a rat model and documented how stimulating certain body points with acupuncture can alter stress hormones.\nThe body\u2019s stress response is triggered by two main pathways, one of which involves the HPA axis, or hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, in which these areas of the brain are activated to release peptides and proteins such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). They, in turn, launch the production of other hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine that rev up the anxiety meter. Once activated, the system causes the heart to beat faster and the senses to go on alert. It also diverts the body\u2019s energy away from background operations such as digestion to prime and fuel the muscles into a state of readiness.\nWhen Eshkevari, who is a nurse anesthetist, noticed that many of her patients who used acupuncture to treat pain reported sleeping better and feeling better able to cope with their pain, even if the needling did not relieve the pain itself, she wondered whether acupuncture might help to reduce stress.\nThere weren\u2019t many studies documenting how acupuncture could affect physiologic stress pathways, however, so she designed one using rats to investigate how the relationship might work. To create chronic stress in the animals, she exposed them to an ice bath for one hour a day over 10 days. One group of animals was just exposed to the ice bath, while another was treated beforehand with four days of electroacupuncture in a known active site in the stomach. And another group of rats was treated with a sham version of the acupuncture in a non-essential point 5 mm away. Eshkevari used an electric-based acupuncture in order deliver standard amounts of stimulation to the animals and avoid any confounding effects of inconsistent activation of the stomach site.\nTo monitor levels of the stress hormones and their precursors, she and her colleagues also collected blood from the animals on the first day and again on day seven and 14 of the study. These levels were compared to those of control animals that were not treated to the ice bath.\nAs expected, the animals that were only treated to the cold-stress showed higher levels of CRH and other stress hormones after their exposure. And the sham animals showed similar levels of activated stress hormones. But those that were pre-treated with acupuncture showed no such spike in these hormones. In fact, their CRH levels were similar to those of the controls who hadn\u2019t been exposed to the ice bath at all.\n\u201cThe acupuncture seemed to help recalibrate, or normalize the [stress] hormone levels, at least in this model using the rat,\u201d says Eshkevari.\nSo instead of keeping the animals in a constant state of anxiety, the acupuncture seemed to dial down the heightened stress response and return it toward normal levels.\nMORE: Is Acupuncture an Antidote for Allergies?\nWhether that also occurs in people isn\u2019t clear yet, but since the HPA axis works in similar ways among mammals, it\u2019s possible the results could improve understanding of how to manage stress in people as well.\nAs far as why the needling at the stomach-point in the rat seemed to be so effective in tapping into the"}

Software tracking for every click and move.\nEasyShift[+] button isn't so easy to use in game.\nThe Roccat Savu looks basic but offers an array of options that gamers will love, from programmable functions to click-by-click tracking.\nDon't let yourself be fooled by the basic design of the Roccat Savu gaming mouse ($59.99 list). It doesn't offer the tricked-out customization of the Mad Catz Cyborg M.M.O. 7 ($159 street, 3.5 stars), but it has significantly more function and personalization than the bare-bones SteelSeries Kinzu ($40 street, 3 stars), with an arsenal of programmable functions hidden up its sleeve and a light bar that can be set to any of 16.8 million colors.\nThe Savu looks much like other black-clad gaming mice. It measures 1.3 by 2.8 by 4.7 inches (HWD), and weighs 3.2 ounces. The sides and thumb rest are textured with a special \"No-Sweat\" coating, which has a strange feel that falls somewhere between skateboard grip tape and a cat's tongue. Though it takes a moment or two go get used to, you'll soon forget that it feels weird, and instead be grateful for the always grippy surface.\nThe top of the mouse is covered with a more traditional soft-touch surface, and all of the black is accented with a pulsating light at the back bottom edge of the mouse, cycling through different colors when the mouse is plugged in and powered on. In the included driver software, you can select your choice of colors\u0097up to 16.8 million, according to Roccat.\nThe Savu is equipped with traditional right and left-click, a clickable scroll wheel, and two thumb buttons. One of these is an EasyShift[+] button, which works in conjunction with the rest of the mouse buttons to add programmable macro functions, effectively doubling the number of button functions.\nThe Savu also has a comprehensive driver app, letting you set macro functions, adjust the light bar color, and customize your experience. But Roccat throws in a new feature for the trophy-obsessed, Roccat Achievement Display (or R.A.D.) which tracks everything from the number of button clicks to the total distance your mouse has travelled, and rewards gamers that hit certain (sometimes literal) milestones. If you're so inclined, you can even share your mousing accomplishments with others through Facebook.\nThe Savu is equipped with a Pro-Optic R3 sensor, which Roccat claims is the world's first 4000 DPI optical sensor\u0097though we did see a 6000 DPI laser sensor on the Editors' Choice Gigabyte M8000Xtreme Mouse ($59.99 list, 4.5 stars).

General Lothar von Trotha\u2019s brutal \u201cextermination order\u201d in 1904 was aimed at wiping out the Herero.\nA small number of survivors fled the genocide and settled in Bechuanaland (now Botswana). In 1999 the descendants of the genocide survivors who had fled to Botswana were repatriated to Namibia.\nKK\u2019s inclusion in Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba\u2019s Cabinet is widely seen as part of the political balancing act among Namibia\u2019s 40-odd tribes.

Over time, several trends have emerged: the slow-footed response by Michigan State\u2019s leadership to the reports, their sitting by as accusations against Nassar mounted, and their failure to take responsibility for Nassar\u2019s misconduct, which occurred over several decades from at least 1992 until 2014.\nIn a statement immediately following her resignation as president in January, Simon suggested that she knew that in thorny situations like the one at Michigan State amid the Nassar scandal, the school\u2019s leadership would be targeted. \u201cAs tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,\u201d Simon wrote. \u201cAs Nassar\u2019s legal journey to prison was drawing to a close, more and more negative attention was focused on Michigan State University, and on me.\u201d And that attention has now manifested as legal charges against the former president.\nSince the allegations against Nassar surfaced in 2016, after an investigation from The Indianapolis Star, the fallout has continued.

Mobile analytics and advertising company Flurry said in June, free-to-play games, which monetize through in-app purchases, now account for 65 percent of revenue among the top 100 games in the App Store, while paid downloads account for 35 percent of revenue.\nThat\u2019s a big reversal from January, when paid download revenue brought in 61 percent of revenue for the top 100 games. But it shows how developers have embraced the freemium model, and at least for the top publishers, they\u2019re finding it more lucrative than charging for downloads. As I wrote about last October, one-third of the top 100 grossing apps were freemium, and by the end of 2010, Distimo reported 49 percent of the revenue on iPhone apps came from in-app purchases in both free and paid apps.\nMobile games are following in the footsteps of social games, becoming games as a service that continues to be updated over time. The free-to-play model ensures a lot of users can try out a game for free, greatly expanding the number of potential users. But it comes down to extracting money from just a small fraction of them, selling them on virtual items, currency and goods that enhance the game play.\nFlurry said only 0.5 to 6 percent of gamers actually spend money in free games, depending on the quality of the game and its mechanics. That\u2019s a small percentage, but it works for game developers who can build engaging titles that keep people coming back.\nThat\u2019s been the secret to companies like Pocket Gems and Playforge, which I\u2019ve written about before. They focus on holding on to users for long periods of time through updates and features, which can pay off as they get users to eventually open up their wallets. As I noted earlier, the industry needs to value engagement more rather than pursue pure download numbers, because developers can\u2019t monetize users who abandon a game after a couple of weeks.\nThis isn\u2019t to say free-to-play is the only way to make money. Paid downloads are still an important revenue source and won\u2019t go away. I, for one, still like to pay for quality titles. And mobile advertising, while still just emerging, can also bring in dollars for big titles. But the money in the mobile gaming market is clearly tilting toward freemium. Gartner (s it) estimates mobile gaming will be the fastest-growing gaming segment, accounting for 20 percent of the expected $112 billion in overall gaming revenue by 2015, fueled in part by the shift to free-to-play games.\nDevelopers need to figure out if this makes sense for their apps and how they can implement it well, because it\u2019s not enough to just adopt this model. A lot of tinkering and tuning is necessary to make it really pay off. But when you get it right, it seems the dollars are increasingly there.\nReally useful post Ryan thanks.\nThis hits it right on\u2013\u201cthe industry needs to value engagement more rather than pursue pure download numbers\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been thinking for a while how the traditional traffic funnel has changed, getting both wider and deeper as engagement layers into other traditional traffic sources.\nWhile I agree, businesses, especially small to mid-sized ones are working to understand this change and use it to build businesses around.

They're our rivals, but I would root for them over anyone else. Not sure if that extends to situations of genocide ...\"\nDanijel: \"It's hate/love. But they're our brothers whether they like it or not.\"\nHe closed the discussion with a shrug emoji and a glib outlook: \"For the first time, I'm impressed by their fighting.\"\nI took that conversation as permission to cheer on Croatia. But I knew I'd be happy either way. After all, France had one of the youngest and most diverse teams to ever play in the World Cup. Most of the French players have parents who immigrated from various African countries. Seeing them win would mean so much to kids in poor, refugee and immigrant communities around the world.\nI was thankful I didn't have to choose between teams from corrupt nations, (looking at you, Mother Russia), and then I reflected once again on the absurd notion that sports shouldn't be political.\nIt's a tired argument that gets trotted out whenever an athlete engages in a controversial topic. \"Stick to sports,\" they're often told. In the World Cup, the athletes stuck to sports and it was still one of the most politically charged events.\nPersonally, I love the intersection of sports and politics, and I can't imagine how you would go about separating them. In an age when the political divide seems larger than it has ever been, sports can bring us back together. We have our differences, but we are all brothers, like it or not.\nWith that in mind, I happily sat down to watch a game I don't understand that was played in a politically hostile nation, and I rooted for a country from which my friend's family fled war. And I was equally delighted when the team with African roots was victorious. Maybe if we embraced the political nature of sports instead of trying so hard to separate them, it would be easier to find the common humanity."}

While many of those years were spent near the bottom of the AFC West, there were seasons when this team was special.\nThroughout the early years of the AFL, a brilliant coach named Sid Gillman put together a spectacular offense led by quarterback John Hadl, Hall of Fame wideout Lance Alworth and a pair of running backs in Keith Lincoln and Paul Lowe that had many of the elements of the West Coast offense that Bill Walsh would make famous nearly 20 years later.\nThe 1963 Chargers won the AFL title, and there were a few observers that believed that Gillman and the Chargers could have given the 1963 NFL champion Chicago Bears and coach George Halas a run for their money had there been a Super Bowl at that time.\nThe Chargers of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s were perhaps the most exciting team the game had seen up to that point. Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts had receivers John Jefferson, Wes Chandler, Charlie Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow, and they looked unstoppable at times. Their coach was an offensive guru named Don Coryell, and he learned his trade from Gillman.\nThe Chargers finally went to a Super Bowl following the 1994 season, when they were a more defensive-oriented team than their previous versions. Junior Seau led their attacking defense, and that helped them overcome an ordinary offense that had quarterback Stan Humphries at the helm. The Chargers were overwhelmed in the Super Bowl XXIX by the San Francisco 49ers, 49-26.\nThe Chargers never made it back to the big game, but their fans supported them every year. They built up a national following during the Fouts-Coryell years. But they were never able to secure a new stadium during their last 10 years in San Diego, so owner Dean Spanos decided to move them to Los Angeles.\nNearly all franchise shifts are painful for fans, and this is a bad one.

The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. While presidents have historically waited to issue high-profile pardons until their final years in office, Trump\u2014who is continually stalled in enacting his agenda by irritating roadblocks like Congressional approval\u2014has exercised no such restraint. Instead, eschewing such norms as the five-year waiting period customary for pardon requests to be submitted to the Department of Justice, the president has seized on this nearly-unlimited executive power to feed his die-hard base\u2014affirming, in their eyes, his godlike power to set the universe to rights.\nFor the insurgent right, the narrative of the Hammond family represented the perfect case of government overreach. Though the two men were charged and convicted of setting fire to federally owned land in Oregon, and served time in prison, a federal appeals court later decided that their initial months-long sentences were below the federal mandatory minimum. So father and son were ordered to serve more time\u2014both were ultimately slapped with five-year sentences, of which Dwight has served three years, and Steven four. But their second sentencing happened to coincide with an upswing in public displays of anti-government militant action: the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and his sons, who had made headlines for their own armed occupation of federal land in 2014, saw an opportunity to replay their own \u201crancher-versus-feds\u201d drama and decamped to Oregon to help occupy a national wildlife reserve. The siege ended after 41 days with one fellow militant dead and Bundy and his sons facing criminal charges, all of which were later dropped.\nPardoning the Hammonds is politically safer than going anywhere near the Bundys themselves, who espoused views so racist that even Ted Cruz was forced to recant his support for their cause. (Trump himself would have trouble defending a man who said that African-Americans may have been \u201cbetter off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things.\u201d) Instead, Trump gets to solidify support among conservative voters enamored with the frontier romanticism of the Bundy standoff without the taint of the Bundys, themselves. Perhaps most important, the Hammonds pardons signal once again that Trump will use the powers of the presidency as a cudgel in the culture wars. As with other right-wing figures he\u2019s pardoned\u2014pundit Dinesh D\u2019Souza for campaign finance fraud, Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio for criminal contempt, and ex-Navy sailor and Hillary Clinton e-mail truther Kristian Saucier for leaking classified military information\u2014the Hammonds pardons seems tailor-made to trigger the libs, in the parlance of the day.

So he leaves it out and lets buyers search for properties on portals and MLS sites instead (which they\u2019re going to do anyway).\nThis might not make sense for some agents, but it\u2019s something to think about: does property search make sense on your site, or is it just a distraction from your message?\nAccording to John Thornton, Google is seeing a surge in visitors who already know the websites they want to visit. So why are they searching?\nThey\u2019re using Google to find specific pages on those preferred sites.\nThis means that building a solid online reputation is more important than ever and so is making sure that effective SEO permeates your entire site (not just a handful of top-level pages). If you haven\u2019t made strides in those directions, it\u2019s time to start.\nNumerous speakers, panelists and moderators \u2014 including keynoter Gary Vaynerchuk and representatives from Google and Facebook \u2014 referred to the mobile shift as a fait accompli.\nAs Vaynerchuk put it, this means that designing a mobile-friendly version of your desktop site is no longer enough. You need to be mobile-first. Think you can\u2019t afford to make the switch? According to the data, you can\u2019t afford not to.\nMobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the online world.\nThe human brain is wired to process visuals much more quickly and efficiently than it processes text. No wonder there is a distinct and relentlessly growing trend toward video as the internet\u2019s most popular content format; to the point that YouTube has become the No. 2 online search engine.\nVideo simply isn\u2019t an option anymore.

It seemed as if every synod speech, media interview and commentary exalted over the presence of the young \u201cauditors\u201d, some three dozen 20- and 30-somethings invited to spend the three-plus weeks of the synod with the Holy Father and the bishops.\nThey were protagonists, not merely spectators, we were told. And the insertion of the young people into what remains, in large part, a bureaucratic exercise was supposed to inject a measure of energy and model of evangelisation.\nPerhaps, but I have my doubts. Admirable though they were in their own faith and leadership, I found their approach more bureaucratic than I had expected. Many of the auditors, when asked what they planned do upon returning from the synod, spoke of urging their bishops to do this or that, or working with the youth commission of their bishops\u2019 conference. Their own personal testimonies of faith were inspiring, but they often sounded like those employed by a commission rather than being seized with the urgency of missionary discipleship. I have worked for 15 years in campus evangelisation with many zealous missionaries, and have never heard any speak about collaborations with agencies of an episcopal conference.\nThe young auditors addressed a concluding message to the Holy Father. It sounded a lot less like the Acts of the Apostles than it did promotional material from the Dicastery of Integral Human Development.\nJesus just barely made it into the message, which meant the auditors were not listening very carefully to the bishops. The synod fathers themselves had decided to write a message to the youth of the world, and the first draft was soundly rejected for not clearly beginning with Jesus. So they fixed it.\nOr perhaps the young people were listening. The mammoth final document, though organised around the biblical encounter on the road to Emmaus, meandered through so much material that the simple urgency of the Gospel proclamation was lost.\nThe synod is a weighty institution, a place more inclined toward procedural intrigue than Spirit-filled proclamation. So there was a genuine freshness in the novel presence of the young auditors, though some Vatican officials gushed so profusely about it that it made me wonder if they had ever been around young people before. But I rather suspect that many of those chosen were rather more at home in Church institutions than at work in the vineyard itself. To use the language of Pope Francis, more in the sacristy than out in the street.\nMy entire priesthood has been spent with young adults, a true mission field. And even if the labourers may be few, there are very impressive missionaries out gathering in the harvest. Their contributions were missed at the synod.\nMuch was made of the young auditors\u2019 cheers and applause in the synod hall, a departure from the usual practice of keeping a respectful silence during the speeches, all the better not to disturb those who wish to sleep. But the bishops who were gathered, much less the Holy Father, do not need cheerleaders. They need the witness of those who have found that \u201cJesus that you seek\u201d, rather than those who are eager to \u201cimprove our cities and schools\u201d.\nThe synod is likely to do little harm.

Now, however, The Hollywood Reporter has a beat on yet another part the movie is looking to cast. Within an article about a number of major blockbusters currently in the casting stage, the trade has noted that Star Wars is now looking for \"a 40-something military man a la Matt Damon in Elysium.\"\nWe first got a hint about this particular character's casting last week. Jason Flemyng - who is 47 years old - revealed a page of the Star Wars script on his Instagram feed on Wednesday, suggesting that he was going out for a part in the movie. \"40-something military man\" seems like a good fit for him, no? Around that same time we also heard a rumor that the production was looking at Doctor Who's Matt Smith for a potential role, but considering he is only 31 he may be going out for something else.\nProviding more insight to what's going on behind the scenes of Star Wars: Episode VII is an interview that Total Film recently did with the movie's director. While more details from the conversation will be available in the magazine's next issue, they have teased some quotes from the filmmaker - first talking about getting the chance to work with Empire Strikes Back screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan on Episode VII's script. While Academy Award winner Michael Arndt was initially hired to write the script, it was announced last month that the director and Kasdan have started drafting their own version of the movie. Said Abrams about his new co-writer, \"Working with Larry has been one of the most surreal joys of my life. We've had a lot of fun working together. He's an incredible guy and an inspiring and spectacular writer.\"\n\"It's something that I've always intended to do,\" he says. \"But I'm torn because I have done everything I can to keep the production of my projects in Los Angeles.

When I started as a producer and correspondent, I brought to the show a persona that was a composite of people I had watched and with whom I had worked: a mainstream, network TV news correspondent\u2019s stupid mannerisms and hollow conventions, the pious journalistic authority and omniscience, the preconceived storytelling, the self-importance, and parasitic reporting.\nThe early Daily Show staff was an unlikely ensemble.

There is much that can be learned from Coleman's less-than-perfect estate plan. However, to understand where Coleman went wrong, some context is needed.\nColeman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After \"Diff'rent Strokes\" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund. Coleman prevailed against his parents, but his opportunities as an actor began to dry up and sent him into a downward spiral. Coleman admitted attempting suicide several times and had several run-ins with the law as a result of anger issues.\nIn August 2007, Coleman married aspiring young actress Shannon Price, and the couple divorced less than a year later. Coleman and Price even capitalized on their dissolution by appearing on the television show Divorce Court. Following the divorce, Coleman and Price began cohabitating. Price has alleged that even though they were divorced, they continued living as husband and wife.\nThen, on May 26, 2010, Price called 911 and reported that she found Coleman on the floor with blood everywhere. Following Coleman's admission to the hospital, he fell into a coma and was placed on life support. On May 28, 2010, Price, using an advanced medical directive that was honored by the hospital, removed life support and Coleman died. Coleman was 42 years old.\nThe lesson here is simple; if you\u2019re divorced and you do or do not want your ex-spouse prematurely pulling the plug, update your health care power of attorney and living will.\nSurprisingly, even though Coleman's advanced medical directive provided that it was his desire that his life be prolonged as long as possible within the limits of generally accepted health care standards, Price chose not to honor these desires and used the power entrusted to her to remove support.\nHere is where Coleman's estate planning efforts failed him. He signed his medical directive prior to divorcing Price. Under Utah law applicable at the time, Price did not have authority to make medical decisions unless specified in the decree of divorce or unless the advanced medical directive naming Price was later affirmed by Coleman. Neither was the case, and yet the hospital honored Price's directions anyway.\nBesides their appearance on Divorce Court and pictures and headlines in tabloids, how was the hospital to know that Price and Coleman were divorced? As a practical matter, the medical staff reviewing documents does not have a lawyer on call to review the validity of a named agent's authority.\nThe lesson here is simple; if you're divorced and you do or do not want your ex-spouse prematurely pulling the plug, update your health care power of attorney and living will. Unfortunately, we don't really know Coleman's desires.

But the original East Front has fallen into obscurity--taken apart and scattered around Washington, apparently destined to become an architectural footnote.\nThe East Front portico, built between 1815 and 1829, was dismantled when that side of the Capitol was restored from 1958 to 1962. It was catalogued for possible reassembly, but no decision has ever been made about what to do with it.\nAs a result, its pieces lie about the city, battered by the elements, and in some cases, being carved up into souvenirs.\nTwenty-four stone columns, 23 Corinthian capitals that once sat atop the columns (one capital is on display at the Capitol), at least one wrought-ironlamppost and countless dentils (small blocks that protrude like teeth from beneath a cornice) are planted in Poplar Point Nursery in the U.S. Botanic Gardens off Howard Road SE, on the banks of the Anacostia River.\nThey lie exposed to sun, wind and rain amid thriving weeds. The columns are encased in wood that is warped and has begun to rot.\nBehind Rock Creek Park's administrative headquarters on Glover Road NW, sandstone, granite and marble blocks that once formed a grandiose East Front wall now cover nearly 15,000 square feet of ground. The plywood fence built to enclose the storage area is nearly gone, and shapely balustrades are overgrown by poison ivy.\nJames Goode, curator for the Smithsonian castle and author of \"Capital Losses,\" a study of noteworthy Washington buildings slated for destruction, said the most valuable remains of the East Front were two pre-Civil War statues and the pediment (a gable above the doorway), that now belong to the Museum of American Art. He said they were \"falling to pieces\" when he stumbled on them in the Capitol power plant in 1972 while working on a book about Washington sculpture.\nOf the 24 columns, which date from 1815, Goode said that if they \"could be re-erected elsewhere, it would be very nice.\"\nAt least, said Goode, \"they knew enough not to throw the remains away. But what do you do with 200 tons of stone?\"\nSouvenirs are one use. For the past seven years, with the permission of the House Speaker's Office, the Capitol Historical Society of the U.S. has been converting the sandstone blocks at Rock Creek Park into paperweights and bookends, which are sold for $4 and $20 in their Capitol shop.\nFred Schwengel, the Capitol Historical Society president, said the society has netted about $20,000 from the sale of the mementos, with profits going toward the society's continuing art program, which commissions works of art for congressional buildings.\n\"Oh, jiminy!\" said Schwengel. \"We've had all sorts of ideas\" about what to do with the East Front remains, including selling cornerstones for private homes.\nThe House and Senate Office Building commissions, which determine how the Capitol itself is used, have jurisdiction over the remains. Congress has proposed several uses for the columns over the years. One of the more popular proposals has been to give them to the Department of Agriculture for a monument at the National Arboretum"}

This even though we can see evidence of considerable occupancy right from this introductory scene, both in the hotel register (a far cry from the mostly blank pages at the Bates Motel) and in the harmonious spatial arrangement of key/no-key in the cubbyhole mailboxes behind the desk. Later in the film, we\u2019ll see shoes placed outside every single door, awaiting a complimentary shine. And yet the only four human beings we ever see in the place (apart from visitors) are Barton, Chet!, the decrepit elevator operator, and Goodman as Barton\u2019s next-door neighbor. For me, this extreme overstatement conveys the loneliness of traveling far from home much more powerfully than would a more realistic depiction, or even (to vaguely allude to Serious Man) a lightly exaggerated but essentially believable approach in which, say, just one or two extras wander by. Either set the movie in the real world or don\u2019t; if you don\u2019t, though, why take half measures? It\u2019s when you don\u2019t fully commit that you wind up looking pretentious.\nConsider also the bell, a terrific aural joke. It\u2019s one thing to let its sound continue well past the point when any vibration would have ceased\u2014I can imagine any number of filmmakers (including the Coens working more around the middle of their game) coming up with that touch. What gets into my skull is the way the sound fades and fades until it\u2019s nearly subliminal, so that on first viewing, you may not even realize it\u2019s still ringing until Chet! shoots Barton a little \u201cAgain?\u201d look and stops it with one polish-blackened finger. At the time, I was reminded of the magnificent opening scene of Robert Altman\u2019s Vincent & Theo, made the year before: Altman begins with actual footage of an auction at which one of Van Gogh\u2019s paintings was sold for many millions, then allows the sound of the bids going up and up and up to play, just faintly audibly, over an impassioned dialogue scene depicting Vincent and his brother living in depressing squalor. But I can\u2019t recall encountering that technique again in the nearly two decades since. It\u2019s the kind of striking, inspired detail you never forget.\nOne of the many things I found disappointing about A Serious Man\u2014I\u2019ll try to keep on keepin\u2019 it vague, as I know most of you haven\u2019t yet seen it\u2014is that the film\u2019s supporting characters rarely, if ever, defy expectation. If you\u2019d expect someone to be threatening, he is, from start to finish. Not so in Barton Fink, which constantly finds inventive ways to keep you off-balance. Chet!, for example, in spite of his unexplained subterranean entrance (and the fact that he looks like Steve Buscemi), couldn\u2019t possibly be more friendly and helpful, and it\u2019s precisely his chipper solicitude\u2014the practiced spiel, the repeated mention of his name (with exclamation point!), even his pronunciation of \u201cLos Angle-es\u201d\u2014that starts to feel inexplicably creepy. Maybe it\u2019s simply his refusal to acknowledge in any way the weirdness of the situation, which even Norman Bates nervously does.

{"idx": "13371", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats.\nNew Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans.\nI\u2019m betting that the candidate with the poll lead, higher favorables, and more experienced campaign team will, indeed, win, but I\u2019m interested in how the race has become a test kitchen for attacks on liberals. Steve Lonegan, Booker\u2019s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.* He\u2019s been bolstered the whole time by conservative groups that want to play in every race\u2014the Susan B. Anthony List, the Tea Party Express\u2014and by the American Principles Project. The strategy from the candidate on down has been to portray Booker as a Hollywood phony who\u2019s also more extreme than he lets on. The goal: Make it tough for Booker to portray Lonegan, who\u2019s a down-the-line conservative, as the \u201cextremist.\u201d In this Oct. 4 debate clip juiced by SBA List, Lonegan demands that Booker answer for his NARAL-approved stances against the Hyde Amendment and late-term abortion bans.\nIt was around this time that Booker\u2019s campaign finally acknowledged Lonegan in a TV ad, using a clip where Lonegan called himself a \u201cright-wing extremist\u201d\u2014actually sort of a joke from Lonegan about how he was viewed. So in an ad from the American Principles Fund (another arm of the AP Project), Lonegan\u2019s claims got amplified.\nRoberts was actually wrong about this. The \u201csafe and legal\u201d (not rare) line was unchanged from the 2008 platform. Booker did not serve on the 2008 committee. As Jeff Jacoby reported last year, \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d was introduced by the Bill Clinton wing of the party in 1992 and used until 2004.\nBooker didn\u2019t mention any of this\u2014probably wise, because it\u2019s pointlessly confusing. The lesson Lonegan et al are trying to teach is that Republicans need to shoot out the knees of Democrats by making their most unpopular positions famous. \u201cBooker in disarray\u201d is the preferred media narrative of this race, but that doesn\u2019t account for how the guy is still winning, still miles ahead of Lonegan on favorability. The real story is that Lonegan, the first truly right-wing nominee the state party\u2019s nominated since 2001, ran away from none of his positions and mocked Booker in ways that startled the media. That\u2019s proved to be more effective than trying to squeeze out Booker from the center, and marginally weakened a candidate whom no moderate Republican ever wanted to challenge.\n*Lonegan, the mayor of the small borough of Bogota for more than a decade, ran for governor in 2005 and 2009. He ran a poor fourth in 2005, but in 2009, powered by Tea Party activists who worried that Chris Christie would be too liberal, he won 42 percent of the vote."}

{"idx": "13375", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: I know, most of you have already figured out why I oppose national health care. In a nutshell, I hate the poor and want them to die so that all my rich friends can use their bodies as mulch for their diamond ranches. But y'all keep asking, so here goes the longer explanation.\nBasically, for me, it all boils down to public choice theory. Once we've got a comprehensive national health care plan, what are the government's incentives? I think they're bad, for the same reason the TSA is bad. I'm afraid that instead of Security Theater, we'll get Health Care Theater, where the government goes to elaborate lengths to convince us that we're getting the best possible health care, without actually providing it.\nThat's not just verbal theatrics. Agencies like Britain's NICE are a case in point. As long as people don't know that there are cancer treatments they're not getting, they're happy. Once they find out, satisfaction plunges. But the reason that people in Britain know about things like herceptin for early stage breast cancer is a robust private market in the US that experiments with this sort of thing.\nSo in the absence of a robust private US market, my assumption is that the government will focus on the apparent at the expense of the hard-to-measure. Innovation benefits future constituents who aren't voting now. Producing it is very expensive. On the other hand, cutting costs pleases voters this instant. This is, fundamentally, what cries to \"use the government's negotiating power\" with drug companies is about. Advocates of such a policy spend a lot of time arguing about whether pharmaceutical companies do, or do not, spend too much on marketing. This is besides the point. The government is not going to price to some unknowable socially optimal amount of pharma market power. It is going to price to what the voters want, which is to spend as little as possible right now.\nIt's not that I think that private companies wouldn't like to cut innovation. But in the presence of even rudimentary competition, they can't. Monopolies are not innovative, whether they are public or private.\nAdvocates of this policy have a number of rejoinders to this, notably that NIH funding is responsible for a lot of innovation. This is true, but theoretical innovation is not the same thing as product innovation. We tend to think of innovation as a matter of a mad scientist somewhere making a Brilliant Discovery!!! but in fact, innovation is more often a matter of small steps towards perfection. Wal-Mart's revolution in supply chain management has been one of the most powerful factors influencing American productivity in recent decades. Yes, it was enabled by the computer revolution--but computers, by themselves, did not give Wal-Mart the idea of treating trucks like mobile warehouses, much less the expertise to do it.\nIn the case of pharma, what an NIH or academic researcher does is very, very different from what a pharma researcher does. They are no more interchangeable than theoretical physicists and civil engineers. An academic identifies targets. A pharma researcher finds out whether those targets can be activated with a molecule. Then he finds out whether that molecule can be made to reach the target. Is it small enough to be orally dosed? (Unless the disease you're after is fairly fatal, inability to orally dose is pretty much a drug-killer). Can it be made reliably? Can it be made cost-effectively? Can you scale production? It's not a viable drug if it"}

One Metro West would need the city to allow housing where there is now industry.\nRose Equities is aiming the project for the November 2020 ballot.\nCouncil members were largely supportive of the proposal, though they stressed the need to make sure traffic and parking issues were thoroughly studied and that concerns about light noise affecting residents across the 405 from the up-to-seven-story buildings be addressed.\nCouncilwoman Sandy Genis was concerned the council would be making a decision on losing industrial space in the city without having a good plan in place for overall economic development.\nCouncil members also encouraged the developer to plan a robust community outreach program.\nStoll said he\u2019s already been meeting with groups and even residents in their homes.\nThe need for housing throughout the state and the argument it is better to be closer to where people work and how that will help traffic in Costa Mesa south of Sunflower are all talking points, he said.\n\u201cI think that is going to be a pretty powerful story."}

The room had a kitchen, and subsequent FBI testing for explosives and residue in the suite found the presence of residue in the vent above the stove.\n\"In July and August, Zazi bought unusually large amounts of hydrogen peroxide and acetone -- a solvent commonly found in nail polish remover -- from beauty supply stores in the Denver metropolitan area ...\"\nIf true, and if the evidence of explosive ingredients or concentration of hydrogen peroxide is substantial, Zazi will be sent over -- probably for life. The various documents, focusing on the last .pdf which indicates a frantic search for hydrogen peroxide and acetone, on display at Cryptome, are particularly damning with regards to the accused man.\nIn the UK, there have been three bomb plots which employed peroxide.

That is definitely the Center's purpose: to find jobs for previously unemployed individuals. Opened one month ago, the center is part of the program known as \"the Wisconsin Plan\" or, a bit more cynically, \"warfare,\" instituted in Israel on August 1, 2005, just over one month ago. The plan, based on a program initiated in the state of Wisconsin over a decade ago which then spread throughout the United States and Europe, is officially known in Israel as \"Mehalev\", an acronym that means \"From the Heart\" and stands for \"From Welfare to Secure Employment.\" The basic idea is very simple, but given to different interpretations and implementations. Interpreted and implemented positively, Mehalev is a government-mandated effort to psychologically, socially and professionally prepare welfare recipients to get off welfare, get a job, stay employed and enhance their lives. Interpreted and implemented in a negative light, Mehalev is yet another attempt by the Finance Ministry to enforce neo-liberal and conservative economic policies by forcing people off welfare even if that means that they will suffer financially, socially, and psychologically. The program is costing the government some NIS 47 million this year and will run for two years as a pilot program. The Finance Ministry is betting that it's worth the money and that if enough people find jobs and get off the dole, the public will save money in the end. Throughout the country, some 14,500 individuals who are currently receiving welfare and income guarantee payments have been selected by the National Insurance Institute to participate in the program. According to laws and regulations specifically enacted to implement the program, individuals selected must report to the nearest center, for at least 30 hours a week, for a minimum period of four months. Any refusal to do so will result in the immediate loss of their welfare payments and all of the allied benefits (such as housing subsidies, discounts for children in kindergarten, and so forth.), Privatization is a crucial and controversial component of the program, which is implemented by private, for-profit companies which have replaced the public employment offices. The companies are responsible for placing the individuals in jobs and making sure they stay there. The entire process is directed and monitored by the Mehalev statutory authority. Tenders were awarded to four multi-national companies who registered as companies here in Israel and employ Israeli personnel in four locations. Maximus, a Dutch company, in cooperation with the Israeli company ORS, operates the center in Ashkelon; the US-based Calder Company operates the center in Nazareth, together with the Israeli company Marmant; while Agens, also a Dutch company, operates the center in the Hadera area, also together with an Israeli company. A4E, a British multi-national, together with the Israeli company, Amin, operates the center in Jerusalem. These private companies are out to make money. They have done so in other countries and they are banking that they can do so here. According to the Israeli plan, there are two ways to make money. Under the easy way, each company will receive a payment for every individual who is taken off the welfare rosters. Clients who refuse to attend sessions, who refuse to report to the center, who reject jobs that they have been offered will lose their benefits, and the company will gain a payment for their"}

The agency has not updated the totals because of the partial government shutdown, which has put restrictions on its communications offices.\nAccording to the latest data available, while the largest amounts of drugs overall were seized in between the ports of entry, the overwhelming majority of those seizures by Border Patrol agents is for marijuana, which is cheaper and less strong than other narcotics.\nHowever, customs officers staffing the ports seized far greater quantities of hard drugs, such as methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, which are not only more potent and deadly, but are also smuggled in smaller quantities.\nAs an example, agents seized more than 439,000 pounds of marijuana in the areas they patrol in between the ports last year. By contrast, customs officers seized more than 283,000 pounds at the legal border crossings during that same time.\n\"When there's places here in the U.S. that you can get it (marijuana), I think it sends the message to the organizations that are smuggling marijuana that there is just not a need for that commodity any more,\" Rodolfo Karisch, the chief agent for Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, told The Arizona Republic last year.\nHowever, customs agents also seized more than 67,000 pounds of methamphetamine smuggled through the ports of entry. Meanwhile, border agents seized nearly 10,300 pounds of meth last year.\nUSA Today Network reporter Dennis Wagner reports from a helicopter above what is the first sign of a fence several miles north of the mouth of the Rio Grande River in Texas along the U.S., Mexico border.\nCustoms officers at the ports also seized far greater numbers of cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWhile border agents seized 332 pounds of the deadly opioid, customs officers at the ports seized 1,357 pounds during that same time.\nHistorical data also shows that the amounts of drugs smuggled in between the ports of entry, where a wall might make a difference, is on the decrease.

Well, there's some good news for you: the team that made those modes as fun as they were are coming back to work on Uncharted 4's multiplayer.\nThe news spread wild and fast like a gazelle across an African prairie, as Robert Cogburn, a lead designer for Naughty Dog sent out a tweet via his Twitter account letting gamers know that the experts who helped craft and shape the multiplayer for The Last of Us will be back for Uncharted 4. Check out the tweet below.\nThis is great news because Naughty Dog exercises a high level of quality for their games and they seem to be elevating their craft with each outing. It definitely puts a lot of pressure on Neil Druckmann and crew to deliver big time with Uncharted 4.\nFor better or for worse (though likely for better) Uncharted 4 was delayed from its holiday 2015 release to an early 2016 release. With the confirmation that the PS4 exclusive will have a multiplayer component and a slightly more open-world feel to the single-player maps, it's not surprising that they would need more time to flesh the game out and construct something solid enough to require a few extra months of testing and quality assurance.\nUncharted 4 will continue the story of Nathan Drake and will feature a few more surprises, such as Drake's brother. The graphics have seen a massive upgrade over the third outing on the PlayStation 3, and we've already seen increased fidelity when it comes to the character animations and the gun-play. That's not to mention that the AI seems to have been improved to better navigate and react to instances happening within the game's world.\nOh yeah, and did I mention that stealth now plays a much larger role in getting around various groups of enemies than ever before? Well, it does.\nKnowing that Uncharted 4 will have a much larger single-player gameplay component than the last game on the PS3 and will also feature a robust multiplayer coming from the team that helped shape the highly respected and critically acclaimed multiplayer from The Last of Us, it definitely sends goosebumps down the arm from all the anticipation and excitement.\nThe only downside is that with Uncharted 4 delayed all the way into 2016 it means that Sony is definitely going to need something to flesh out the 2015 holiday season. Right now there doesn't appear to be any AAA exclusives that are on the horizon for Sony's system now that Uncharted 4 moved out of the slot, but I'm sure we'll get something concrete come E3.\nAt least with the delay of the game we know that the multiplayer should turn out fairly decent."}

Nearly 4,000 adults answered the survey, which excluded people on active military duty.\nThe survey asked about details of training, including whether it included information on safe handling, safe storage and preventing firearm accidents, theft and suicide. It also asked about types of firearms owners had, political views, veteran status, and the presence of children in the home.\nThe research team found that one in four people who completed the survey and three in five firearm owners said they had received formal firearm training.\nAbout 14 percent of non-owners living with a firearm owner and 13 percent of those not living with a firearm owner had received training.\nAmong gun owners, 66 percent of men and 49 percent of women had received training.\nThose who owned more than one firearm, owned both hand guns and long guns, had a concealed carry permit, or who said they had carried a loaded gun in the past month were more likely to have had training.\nThose who owned a firearm for protection only, versus for hunting or sport, were less likely to have formal training, according to the results in Injury Prevention.\nSafe handling was the most common topic covered in training, with 61 percent of gun owners saying it had been included in their training. In contrast, suicide prevention was the least common topic - just 14 percent of gun owners said it had been part of their training.\n\u201cThe low percentage of non-owners living in a gun-owning household who have received training is important due to the strong relationship between presence of guns in households and risk of firearm injury and death for all members of the household,\u201d Rowhani-Rahbar said.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two-thirds of firearm deaths in the U.S. are suicides, the study team notes.\nThe low percentage of owners who have received training in suicide prevention is notable because there is a strong association between gun access and suicide, said Dr. Emmy Betz, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.\nBetz, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, coordinates gun safety nights tailored to specific groups. At Ladies Night at Centennial Gun Club in Centennial, Colorado, for example, women meet twice a month to practice shooting and discuss suicide prevention.\nLadies Night focuses on safe storage and teen suicide, for example, but other programs run by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the NH Firearm Safety Coalition target inner-city violence or middle-aged workers who are depressed and at risk for suicide.\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2vJ8jry Injury Prevention, online July 11, 2017"}

We study, we gain more experience, and we learn from our mistakes.\"\nA Russian-speaker with close ties to Russia's ruling United Russia party, Mr Yanukovych is expected to prioritise a raft of policies that will mend Ukraine's fractious relations with Moscow. He is also likely to give the Kremlin more say in the management of the country's strategically vital gas pipeline network that carries gas to Europe and heats millions of European homes.\nHis victory will mean that Ukraine, a giant country on the EU's eastern flank with almost 50 million people and a huge standing army, will drop its ambitions to join Nato and put its EU membership bid on the backburner.\nRussia is savouring the moment. Anticipating his victory, it has already dispatched an ambassador to Ukraine after deliberately leaving the post vacant to show its displeasure with the country's outgoing pro-Western leadership.\nFor Mr Yanukovych, an orphan who grew up in crushing poverty and who did two stints in prison in his youth, it is a second chance he must have thought would never come.\nFive years ago, he looked like a broken man. Back then, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against his fraud- tainted election victory. Those protests, dubbed the Orange Revolution after the party colours of its figurehead, outgoing president Viktor Yushchenko, triggered a repeat election which he lost. It was a very public humiliation that saw him demonised as a bumbling Kremlin puppet and jailbird.\nIt was also a major embarrassment for Russia. Vladimir Putin, then the Russian president, had already publicly congratulated Mr Yanukovych on his victory and had made it clear that the Kremlin was delighted it had a new ally"}

Is it big enough to grow into once you leave behind one phase and enter the next?....Some say it can\u2019t be done: that there is no way our cities can accommodate our future selves. But how can we know for certain?\nOne way to know for certain is to look to Europe, where people often think of the phase when they have children at home as being only a relatively short phase of their lives, while their apartment in the Marais in Paris or in Rome is eternal. So they adapt, like this family in Turin did, with the help of Point Architecture.\nSince the family had increased in number after the first renovation of the house the challenge of the project has been to make the most of the available space. The project aims to bring up the family to a multifunctional use of the spaces, without conventional limits. That's why we decide to give the existing big living room space a multiple function, being at the same time the owner's bedroom, the living and dining space and the relax area and to to dedicate the only existing room to the newborns.\nInstead of the more common loft bed with space under, putting the bed in a drawer creates a zone above that is only a few steps up, instead of climbing a ladder to a loft. Unlike a Murphy bed that tilts up, you don't need to make the bed or strap in the mattress, you just roll it away. More at Point Architecture, found at Contemporist.\nThe thing about American children is that they have large indoor and garden spaces, but they are imprisoned in the suburb because they can't drive.

These free-range children can walk to their schools, playground or their friends' place by themselves since age 10. I just can't imagine my life in secondary school (grade 7-13) if I had to wait for a ride all the time!!! That's too cruel!\nI guess the argument here is because of the difference on how much time people spend in their rooms, and the enormous clutter problem that is uniquely American.\nNotwithstanding what American politicians say, we have much to learn about Europeans. For example, how they adapt and stay put."}

Unfortunately, because mere mortals make them, they aren't perfect and can sometimes be fooled.\nSometimes the deception is humanmade, as in a recent study conducted by Tencent's Keen Security Lab. In this study, researchers sought to confuse the Autopilot system in a Tesla by applying reflective stickers on the ground in the path of the car that would confuse Tesla's advanced lane-keeping system.\nIt worked, and the car began to veer off in the direction of the stickers, but this isn't a fault with Tesla, it's more of a problem with how secure infrastructure is when that is what cars depend on for their limited self-driving capabilities. But as long as a driver is paying proper attention to what their vehicle is doing, the situation can be negated.\n\"The [Keen Security Lab] findings are all based on scenarios in which the physical environment around the vehicle is artificially altered to make the Autopilot system behave differently, which is not a realistic concern given that a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do so,\" said Tesla representatives in a statement to Roadshow.\nSuper Cruise is one of the most effective ADAS suites on the market today, but its driver monitoring camera can be blinded by bright, direct sunlight.\nIt's not only Tesla's autopilot that can get confused. A recent report published Monday by Automotive News states that Cadillac's Super Cruise system -- which we've experienced and found to be one of the best ADAS suites available to consumers -- gets confused by intense blasts of sunlight.\nSuper Cruise's driver monitoring system relies on an infrared camera mounted on top of the steering column. In a majority of situations, this works great and allows for hands-free driving by ensuring the driver is watching the road.\nWhen hit with intense sunlight, the camera is effectively blinded, and that causes Super Cruise to disengage. It's been an issue since the system debuted in 2018. Cadillac is reportedly working on a solution to this issue, which will likely debut with its next-generation Super Cruise system.\nCadillac didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe main takeaway from this is that having a feature like Autopilot or Super Cruise isn't an excuse to tune out on your commute. Modern ADAS systems are incredibly advanced, but they still need to be monitored at all times by an alert and engaged human driver."}
{"idx": "13423", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: HomeArtsNicknames: What\u2019s In a Name?\nWhat mean you, Juliet? I have never been able to discern how I feel about this line. On one hand, a name is just a useful convention we use to describe what is around us. Montague and Capulet were just representative words of the people used to divide and categorize. The rose is a rose. On the other hand, names do hold a lot of power as symbols. Family names symbolize esteem and heritage throughout generations. When hearing our own names, we respond and look for those calling us out almost involuntarily.\nBut the loftier ideas are for another time. I want to know, what\u2019s in a nickname? It would seem that the prevalence of nicknames has been cut down severely. And when I talk about nicknames I am not talking about abridging an existing name (William to Will or John to Jack). I am talking about the nicknames that people just give you\u2014the involuntary kind of nicknames that were bestowed on you without your consent. Those nicknames of old were fun and solidified people within a group because it was the group that defined how they were to be regarded.\nThere was a certain art to it. When talking to my grandfather, his stories are rife with names that seem little more than a smattering of letters. In all cases, his stories had an additional sense of flair because it wasn\u2019t Jack and Jill running down to the market, but something like Licks and Howler swinging by the dollar store. The stories he tells are more unique to him and his life because they contain a lexicon no other group shares. It also demands that people are knowledgeable about one another, as opposed to a distanced superficial familiarity.\nWhat I find of value in nicknames is the fact that others give them to you. In many cases, my grandfather would tell me, it wasn\u2019t something positive, rather something that made you stand out, or made reference to a historic personal event. So when you jumped off the roof, broke both your legs, and walked around with splints for five months, you became Splints. These kinds of names did a lot for group solidarity. You were given a name. You gave others names. Each name was more than a calling card but a segway into a story or the reminder of a history.\nI wonder why the practice has fallen away, or why I don\u2019t remember anyone in my life or circles sporting anything other than what is on their birth certificate. Isn\u2019t that kind of boring?\nAs people, were are not defined by our name, but by our experiences. No two Davids are alike. Neither are two Marys or Katherines. Those nicknames pointed, in some ways, to something more unique to you than the name you share with others. It points to an event only you lived. That event is part of a larger amalgam of experiences that constitutes you.\nWhat\u2019s in a name? What kind of name? I think what Juliet meant was that proper names don\u2019t mean much. They don\u2019t give you the sensation of smelling a rose. The Montague name does not capture the essence of Romeo himself. Those names are bland and doesn\u2019t clue us into anything about the substance of a person or thing. Nicknames can do that better because they are intrinsically tied to the person.\nIn the future, I hope to see more nicknames because more nicknames means more stories. It\u2019s a way to differentiate all the humdrum names and delve deeper into the essence and experience of a person."}

Podolski, meanwhile, is on course to be available again by the end of December after being out since August 27 with a hamstring injury.\nWenger feels being boosted by some more attacking options - which also include unsettled Denmark international Nicklas Bendtner and Yaya Sanogo, who should be fit from his back problem in January - eases the urgency to bring in cover for lone frontman Olivier Giroud.\nAsked if having Walcott and Podolski fit made it less critical to go into the transfer market for a new striker, Wenger said: \"Yes, Podolski is not back as well (yet), but he shouldn't be too far now.\n\"Theo gives us an opportunity to be a mobile striker.

Again, other than that, it\u2019s a very fair deal,\u201d he said on January 24.\nOn Saturday, he used the Indian example of how other countries were imposing high taxes on American products and now it was time for the US to impose a reciprocal tax. \u201cSo, they charge a hundred.

{"idx": "13426", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Mesh Wi-Fi (also known as Whole Home Wi-Fi) systems are home networking solutions that opt for a more decentralised approach to the problem of local connectivity.\nRather than force every device in your home to wirelessly connect to the same router, which may not always be located or situated in an ideal location, Mesh Wi-Fi systems rely on multiple Wi-Fi nodes.\nOne node (designated the primary router) is directly wired into your gateway connection. The other nodes act as satellites. Together, these nodes behave like a single seamless network. If you\u2019re in the living room, you\u2019ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. If you\u2019re in the kitchen, you\u2019ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. If you\u2019re in the backyard, you\u2019ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. It's all the same network but your devices will connect in the way that makes the most sense and allows for the best performance.\nOverall, Mesh Wi-Fi can allow for faster speeds, smoother reliability and greater wireless coverage of your home. They\u2019re also easy to expand, allowing you to build the local network solution that makes the most sense for your home.\nWhat are the differences between Mesh and Traditional Wi-Fi routers?\nThe key difference between mesh systems and traditional routers is that the former is centralized while the latter is not.\nWith an old-school router, all wireless traffic is going to rely on that single point-of-access. With a Mesh Wi-Fi system, there are multiple points of access. This fundamental, structural difference can allow Mesh Wi-Fi to offer better speeds, coverage and reliability.\nWhat should you look for in a Mesh Wi-Fi router?\nDesign - Since you\u2019re going to be throwing several of these Mesh Wi-Fi nodes around your house, it doesn\u2019t hurt for them to look visually appealing or, at the very least, innocuous. Due to the smaller internal components required, many networking brands have opted for minimalism when it comes to aesthetics.\nSpeed - When it comes to any sort of wireless connectivity, it\u2019s always better to have more speed than the opposite. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are no different in this regard. Having greater speed allows for more bandwidth intensive things like 4K media streaming. It also helps to allow for more devices to do those things on the same network without infringing on the experience of one another. As a rule, higher speeds are better. It\u2019s also good form of future proofing.\nCoverage - While it\u2019s good to know that you can always get more mesh nodes to deal with any blind spots, it\u2019s equally good to get away with using less mesh nodes where you can. The better the coverage offered by each mesh node in your mesh Wi-Fi system, the less mesh nodes you\u2019ll need to cover your house overall.\nSoftware - A big part of the appeal of Mesh Wi-Fi is the ease of use and many mesh Wi-Fi systems come integrated with software apps that help this to be the case. You\u2019ll be locked into using the official app for your Mesh Wi-Fi system of choice, so it\u2019s best to make sure it includes the features you care about. For example, parental controls, high-traffic priority markers and built-in cybersecurity scanning.\nMesh Wi-Fi Vs Traditional Wi-Fi Routers: Which is better?\nIf you\u2019re living in a home with multiple occupants, there are clear advantages to going with Mesh Wi-Fi systems.\nHowever, if you\u2019re living on your own or care"}

Police said two women and one man entered the business, took multiple items off the shelves and left without paying. The business owners went outside to confront the suspects and they were threatened with an extendable baton.\nThe three suspects attempted to leave the business in a stolen vehicle, however the vehicle got stuck in the snow. RCMP officers arrived on scene and arrested the two females inside the vehicle but the male suspect had fled the scene on foot. Patrols were made in the area and officers located fresh footprints in the snow. Officers followed the footprints to a property approximately one mile from where the robbery occurred and located the male suspect.\nChristopher Murdock, 25, Shauna Owen, 29, and Amber Roberts, 33, all of Winnipeg, were arrested and charged with robbery, possession of stolen property, dangerous driving, assault, possession of a weapon and failure to comply with conditions or probation order.

It was the last undiscovered piece, and the proof needed to complete the picture. The sound of the waves created by two black holes had been already released. But now the discovery has an unofficial soundtrack.\nAs Emiko Jakuza at Motherboard reports, composer Arthur Jeffes took data from physicist Samaya Nissanke and encoded it into MIDI format. Pianos and strings were added around the \"chirps\" of the gravitational waves, the sort of underlying hum you hear in the song above.\nNissanke's data involved waveform models. These were the sort of oscillations LIGO observers captured from the collision of the two black holes. Though they come in the form of radio waves, there's not in particular much to \"hear,\" requiring the data to be processed into audio.\nJeffres' work involves trying to make the results of scientific experiments more accessible to lay people, and part of that is converting it into music. It's not the first of its kind. Astronomer Fiorella Terenzi has spent much of her career making compositions out of astronomical observations. There was also a recent piano duet with the oscillations of a binary star, a music box-like composition from a dying red giant, and audio renderings of radio signals from space. So this is the latest in the canon, and it's a quite pretty addition at that.\nWhat Exactly are Gravitational Waves?"}

Finally, now that she has graduated from Baltimore City Community College - at age 80 - the West Baltimore resident is closer to her goal. BCCC's oldest graduate this year plans to become a legal assistant.\nAccording to The Sun's Sumathi Reddy, Ms. Williams, who had a 3.5 grade-point average, did not attend the graduation ceremony last week because she is in summer school and has started course work at the University of Baltimore on the way to getting her bachelor's degree. By the time she finishes law school, the mother of four and grandmother of seven figures she'll be 85, but that hasn't dampened her enthusiasm for learning, and for realizing her dream.\nWhile students as old as Ms. Williams are rare - constituting well under 1 percent of community college and college graduates - older students in general are increasingly common, posing opportunities and challenges for higher-education institutions.\nRecent studies from the American Council on Education, a coordinating body for higher education, show that only one in six undergraduates is a \"typical\" 18-year-old who lives on campus and receives a bachelor's degree in four years. Students age25 and older account for 39 percent of undergraduates. Like Ms. Williams, 51 percent of older undergraduates attend community colleges, while 29 percent are enrolled in public and private four-year schools, 12 percent are in private for-profit schools and the rest are in other types of higher-ed institutions. Most attend part time.\nThe vast majority of the estimated 90 million post-high school adults who are in various classes are taking adult basic education, English as a second language, work-related training and personal development courses. Only about 6.5 million are taking courses for credit at colleges, universities and trade schools.\nMost of these older students - and particularly those who are considered low-income - need more help balancing work, family, studies and personal needs. While higher-education institutions have accommodated older students through special and accelerated academic programs, by establishing satellite campuses and by being accessible to public transportation, they need to train more specialized faculty members and offer more financial aid and child care.\nThe benefits of a college education, including increased earning potential, upward mobility and greater knowledge, don't fade with age. And Mary Williams is living proof that it's never too late."}
{"idx": "13435", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Comments by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. amounted to a vigorous defense of two of his colleagues on the Supreme Court, Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan.\nIn the face of a growing controversy over whether two Supreme Court justices should disqualify themselves from the challenge to the 2010 health care overhaul law, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Saturday defended the court\u2019s ethical standards.\nThe chief justice\u2019s comments came in his annual report on the state of the federal judiciary. In it, he made what amounted to a vigorous defense of Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan, who are facing calls to disqualify themselves from hearing the health care case, which will be argued over three days in late March. He did not, however, mention the justices by name.\nFederal law requires that judges disqualify themselves when they have a financial interest in a case, have given ad-vice or expressed an opinion \u201cconcerning the merits of the particular case\u201d or when their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d For lower court judges, such a decision can be reviewed by a higher court, but the Supreme Court has no such review.\nChief Justice Roberts said the Supreme Court\u2019s unique status made it impossible for the justices to follow the practices of lower-court judges in recusal matters. Lower-court judges can be replaced if they decide to disqualify themselves, he said, and their decisions about recusal can be reviewed by higher courts.\nSome critics, mostly on the left, say Justice Thomas should step aside because of the activities of his wife, Virginia, in working with groups opposed to the law. Others, mostly on the right, say Justice Kagan should not hear the case because she may have been involved in aspects of it when she was United States solicitor general. There is every indication that both justices intend to participate in the health care case.\nMuch but not all of the criticism of Justices Thomas and Kagan has come from partisans, and most experts in legal ethics say there is no evidence that either justice has crossed an ethical line requiring recusal. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, an authority on legal ethics at New York University.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the 2010 health care law, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, by the end of June, just as the 2012 presidential campaign enters its crucial final months.\nBeyond his apparent defense of Justices Thomas and Kagan, the chief justice used the report to fend off critics who say Supreme Court justices should be bound by the same code of judicial ethics that applies to other federal judges. He pointed out that the justices voluntarily follow the same rules, but said they should not be bound by them. Congress has also enacted laws concerning gifts and financial disclosure that are also applicable to Supreme Court justices.\nThe constitutionality of those laws remains an open question, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, adding that the justices nonetheless abided by them, including the \u201csometimes complex reporting requirements\u201d for financial disclosure.\nChief Justice Roberts said the justices also comply with the recusal law, though he added that \u201cthe unique circumstances of the Supreme Court\u201d must be taken into account.\nThat also means, he added, that recusal at the Supreme Court is particularly problematic."}

The Pike County Sheriff\u2019s Office received a 911 call about a possibly deceased male who appeared to have a gunshot wound, he added.

If that doesn't work, or if the relationship with the family member is already strained, the next question is whether there is a lease.\nIf the family member holds a standard tenancy agreement, the process is no different than for any other tenant, explains Dippenaar.\nThe first step is to cancel the lease. If there are no grounds for cancellation - for instance, if rent is paid on time and the property is well maintained, you must wait for the expiry of the lease and give the tenant notice to quit on the basis that you do not intend to renew the lease.\nThere are statutory notice periods you must adhere to.

These documents must be consulted before considering eviction.\nHowever, provided there are no provisions of this nature, the law gives the executor the power to dispose of the estate in accordance with the wishes of the deceased.\nIf there is a tenant, and the executor elects to sell the property, the tenant cannot be summarily removed from the property, but the executor has the right to cancel the lease and begin the eviction process if the tenant does not cooperate.\nIf you suffer abuse at the hands of a family member who is your tenant and you can prove that imminent harm will be caused to you, you may be able to secure an urgent eviction, according to Dippenaar."}

Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies held a workshop to examine the drivers behind digital protectionism in Asia and Europe, its implications on the U.S. economy and foreign policy, and policy responses to mitigate the problem. The workshop, hosted by then CFR Senior Fellow Jennifer M. Harris, was made possible by the support of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The views described here are those of workshop participants only and are not CFR or Carnegie Corporation positions. The Council on Foreign Relations takes no institutional positions on policy issues and has no affiliation with the U.S. government.\nDigital protectionism in Asia (especially China) and Europe increasingly threatens the only area of cross-border economic activity still growing nearly a decade after the global financial crisis. Web censorship, forced transfer of intellectual property, data localization, and onerous privacy rules have combined to hamstring the development of the data-based digital economy\u2014the commerce in virtual, not physical, goods. On July 20, 2017, CFR gathered more than two dozen current and former government officials, technology executives, economists, and trade lawyers at the half-day workshop \u201cThe Rise of Digital Protectionism: Implications for U.S. Interests and Possible Solutions,\u201d in San Francisco, to examine these issues and explore options available to U.S. policymakers to counter the protectionist measures.\nChina\u2019s embrace of digital protectionism is just a page from its standard playbook, many participants said, meant to undercut foreign competitors and boost Chinese companies. President Xi Jinping has \u201cstepped on the gas,\u201d one workshop participant argued, making state control of the digital economy a \u201chuge priority\u201d for the Communist Party of China as it seeks to meet ambitious growth targets.\nThe protectionism takes many forms: web censorship through the so-called great firewall, forced technology transfer through mandated joint ventures with foreign firms, and a new cyber security law that places onerous requirements on nearly every foreign company doing business in China. The requirements in the new law that data be physically housed in China, in particular, and limits to data flows out of China are akin, one participant said, to a \u201cRoach Motel\u201d: the data comes in but cannot get out.\nParticipants suggested that two forces have driven the tougher new digital regulations. First, as it did in the past several decades with traditional industries, China seeks global dominance in several high-tech sectors projected to be at the forefront of growth in coming decades\u2014artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, biotechnology, and autonomous vehicles, among others\u2014and uses digital protectionism to carve out a privileged space for Chinese firms. Second, the Communist Party sees the free flow of data and digital communications as a threat to regime stability and seeks greater state control of data flows.\nThe Communist Party sees the free flow of data and digital communications as a threat to regime stability.\nSuch protectionism is neither new nor unique to China. But participants stressed that the sheer size and global importance of the Chinese economy makes Beijing\u2019s \u201cbare-knuckle\u201d approach to digital protectionism problematic for U.S. policymakers. Some African countries are already replicating the mercantilist Chinese model, as evidenced by increasing government restrictions on the internet and data flows in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa. Meanwhile, Western countries and international firms have been loath to push back against Chinese restrictions for fear of losing access to the world\u2019s largest economy by purchasing power parity.\nIn recent years, the European Union (EU) has ramped up its digital protection"}

The main causes of death were \"hypothermia, pneumonia, dehydration or malnutrition complications,\" the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement.\nAs of March 3, 90 people have died, either en route; shortly after arriving at the camp; or after referral for treatment, the UN agency said. Between February 22 and March 1, about 15,000 people reached al-Hol camp from Baghuz, where the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been battling Islamic State militants.\nOCHA said that the al-Hol camp population stands at 56,002 individuals, of whom more than 90 per cent are women and children. Some children are arriving at the camp without their parents. The al-Hol camp has been receiving internally displaced persons fleeing the area around eastern Euphrates, where SDF have been waging battles to uproot the Islamic State group from its last remaining pockets in eastern Syria.\nMany of those displaced had walked for days or travelled in open trucks until they reached the areas controlled by the US-backed forces. According to activists in the area, refugees had to spend several nights in the open air before they are given a tent to stay in al-Hol camp. Fadwa Baroud, a UN spokesperson in Damascus, told dpa that the UN in Syria, non-governmental organization partner groups and relevant authorities are providing life-saving assistance and services to all new arrivals.\n\"This includes around the clock emergency health and protection assistance, with all new arrivals receiving food, water, shelter, and warm clothes and blankets,\" she said. \"The most pressing needs for those displaced remain shelter, water and sanitation hygiene, health and protection, with physical and psychological health, particularly vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children and elderly people,\" Baroud added.\nInternational agencies have called for additional financial resources to meet the extensive needs at al-Hol camp. The spokesperson of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) in Syria, Adnan Hezam, described the situation inside the camp as \"tragic.\" \"People are stressed and tired,\" he said, adding that new arrivals are in worse condition than the ones who arrived earlier. He added that the camp is housing more people than for which it has capacity, and more arrivals are expected. \"Our teams are giving all the care for all refugees arriving, women, elderly and children in the camp, but of course we have great concern for children who are arriving without their parents,\" he added.\nSyria's Kurdish-led forces resumed their operation to capture Baghuz on Friday, after a lull in fighting to evacuate civilians and family members of Islamic State from the area. Thousands of civilians and family members of Islamic State militants have been evacuated from the village."}

No serious typist wants to spend hours tapping on nonresponsive glass, so it\u2019s tempting to think that Apple\u2019s work-oriented tablet might integrate a keyboard in the manner of Microsoft\u2019s Surface.\nBut over the last few months, a pile of evidence has suggested otherwise. Where I was once certain that an iPad Pro would include a physical keyboard, I\u2019m starting to think the lack thereof will be its defining feature. Instead of making users tack on another piece of hardware, the iPad Pro could make touch-screen typing feel like less of a compromise.\nThe biggest issue with typing on a touch screen is that you can\u2019t rest your fingers on it like a real keyboard. But if recent rumors are accurate, Apple could solve this problem with Force Touch, the pressure-sensing technology that debuted in the Apple Watch, 12-inch Macbook, and 2015 MacBook Pro earlier this year.\nUnlike a standard touch surface, Force Touch can translate varying amounts of pressure into different actions. For instance, MacBook users can apply more trackpad pressure to accelerate a movie\u2019s fast forward or rewind speed, and Apple Watch users can clear their notifications with a firm press.\nThe same technology is reportedly coming to the iPad Pro, and while the applications are unclear, typing seems like a natural fit. In theory, you could rest your fingers on the screen and apply pressure when you want to type, and a bit of haptic feedback under each finger could tell you when you\u2019ve pressed hard enough. Even if it\u2019s not as satisfying as a proper mechanical keyboard, it could allow users to type naturally without looking at every key press.\nHardware is only part of the problem. The current iPad keyboard hides numbers and other important characters behind a separate screen, constantly forcing users to toggle away from the main keyboard.\nThe expanded keyboard includes a dedicated row of numbers on the main screen, with corresponding symbols such as exclamation mark and dollar sign when you hit the shift key. The main screen also includes keys for colon, tab, caps lock, pipe, brackets, and braces. In other words, the layout is identical to a real keyboard.\nEven with a pressure-sensitive surface and a familiar keyboard layout, typing on an iPad would still feel cramped without a large enough screen. Perhaps that\u2019s why most rumors have settled on a screen size of 12.93 inches for the iPad Pro.\nAdmittedly, I\u2019d feel a little better about this prediction if the iPad\u2019s keyboard size was identical to that of a MacBook, but that can\u2019t happen unless Apple pushes the screen size above 13 inches, or uses a wider aspect ratio such as 16:10. But even with a slightly smaller surface, along with pressure-sensitive keys and an expanded keyboard layout, Apple could argue that the iPad Pro is made for typing.\nWhy Not a Real Keyboard?\nOf course, nothing will stop third parties from making their own iPad Pro keyboards, and Apple could still offer its own Bluetooth keyboard accessory, as it has since the iPad\u2019s 2010 debut. I\u2019m just skeptical that Apple will directly integrate a"}

In childhood, toys become part of a playful process of becoming ones\u2019 self. Child psychologists have known for decades that through play, children learn empathy, \u201ctry on\u201d identities, and experiment with their place in the world. Essentially, in childhood we play our way through discovering who we are. Unfortunately for kids today, the designed world doesn\u2019t leave much room for them to explore. Most toys come with pre-defined identities and stories, which rob children of the joy of imagining these things. There is also a dearth of open-ended toys, or toys without instructions and right and wrong answers. This leaves few opportunities to figure out how to use a toy, experiment, fail, and invent the story of where it came from, and why it does what it does.\nImagining, understanding, and becoming who we are is a process informed by play, and both toy companies and designers are taking all the exploration out of it.\nLet kids imagine the story and design their own play.\nThe ideal toy for a child is not a toy at all but something that they\u2019ve appropriated for play. Enter: sticks and rocks! Imagination transforms a stick into a magic wand, a sword, or a tool to poke a dead thing. A rock becomes a car or a whale. Because these found objects have no assigned story (they are \u201cun-designed\u201d), they shift identities as needed.\nThe ideal toy for a child is not a toy at all but something that they\u2019ve appropriated for play.\nLater, the rock that was once a car becomes a tool to smash leaves when the play changes. This isn\u2019t likely to happen with a toy car that has four wheels and a plastic body. That car can only be a car. The stick that was previously imagined to be a sword and helped slay a dragon (a tree) will shift to become a superhero flying through the air with jet-shoes. This can\u2019t happen with a pre-defined action figure. Superheroes have specific physical characteristics which, along with the movie, comic book or TV show plot, provides the story of how that toy will behave. In play these are the equivalent of instructions, limiting the potential for the child to invent the narrative.\nI\u2019ve spent time with Penny Wilson, an influential playworker in adventure playgrounds in the U.K., observing children playing. She taught me the important difference between asking kids \u201cWhat are you building?\u201d and saying to them, \u201cTell me about what you\u2019re doing.\u201d When we ask, \u2018What are you building?\u2019 it implies that: a) You should have a goal and be working toward a finished thing, i.e., play is linear; b) you are supposed to be building something (children\u2019s understanding of the built world is often limited to houses, so they are confronted with either having done it wrong, or they change their vision to fit their perception of your expectation); c) you should be doing something that you can explain to me.\nWe want to avoid all of these rules. So by saying \u201ctell me about this\u201d we leave the door open to stories about what children are imagining, and they can share challenges, discoveries about putting things together, or any number of things about their experience with their peers and school.\nGiving children less leaves room for them to contribute more.\nThis simple semantic shift has influenced how I design for play.

But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta\u2019s arm movement as he touches the intern\u2019s arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP\u2019s request.\nThe tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter. It\u2019s also unlikely the differences could be explained by technical glitches or by video compression \u2014 a reduction in a video\u2019s size to enable it to play more smoothly on some sites \u2014 because the slowing of the video and the acceleration that followed are \u201ctoo precise to be an accident,\u201d said Shapiro, who trains instructors to use video editing software.\nCNN has labeled Sanders\u2019 characterization of Acosta\u2019s exchange with the intern as a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee. Rather, he said he saw him holding on to the microphone as she reached for it.\n\u201cThe irony of this White House video involving Jim Acosta is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing \u2014 engaging in fake information,\u201d said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics at Washington & Lee University.\nSeveral journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Online News Association \u2014 demanded Acosta\u2019s press pass be reinstated.\nStill, it\u2019s rare for the White House to pull the so-called hard passes from journalists.\nDuring Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials. During the George W. Bush presidency, Trude Feldman, who worked for various news outlets, was suspended for 90 days after security cameras recorded her looking through a press aide\u2019s desk late one night.

Because of Chinese pressure, Taiwan is only officially recognized by a handful of nations and has no U.N. seat. Many in Taiwan fear that the last decade of rapprochement between these longtime foes is merely a prelude to Beijing\u2019s soft annexation of the island.\nConcerns over the economy consistently ranked highest with voters throughout campaigning. Growth was just 1% last year, barely more the year before, with youth unemployment high, wages stagnant and the cost of living soaring (sprawling Taipei is now comparatively one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities to live).\nAttention to detail has become the hallmark of the former university professor Tsai. Born into an affluent Taipei family, the 59-year-old studied law in Taiwan before earning her masters at Cornell and a doctorate at the London School of Economics. Beneath a decidedly wonkish demeanor, confidants say Tsai has a droll manner, and party officials have worked hard to cultivate a softer image, posting photos to social media of the now most powerful woman in the Chinese-speaking world with her two cats, Think Think and Ah Tsai.\nThis upbeat branding stood in stark contrast with the KMT\u2019s foreboding message that a DPP victory would mean a return to open hostility across the strait. Outgoing President Ma Ying-jeou, of the KMT, was ineligible to stand for re-election having already served the maximum two terms, and his party\u2019s candidate, Eric Chu, was always trailing in the polls. \u201cWe have been too successful [historically] in educating our own people that China are the bad guys,\u201d KMT vice chairman Jason Hu tells TIME.\nThe DPP has promised a raft of stimulus measures, including five industrial and innovation hubs across the island, a shake-up of the education system, and efforts to boost tourism.

The unique geography of the area has exacerbated the impact on the river.\nOn satellite imagery the massively-widened river can easily be seen in the north of the state.\nAlso visible is the brown cloudy swirls of stained water emptying into the usually pristine waters of the gulf. The flow is choked with debris, soil and dead cattle.\nA major flood warning remains in place for the system.\nSky News Weather channel meteorologist Rob Sharpe told news.com.au the sheer size of the swollen river was why up to half a million cattle had perished \u2014 there was simply no dry land for them to get to in time.\n\"The amount of rainfall has been staggering. Above 500mm of rain spread across a vast region 300km across and 200km north. A year's worth of rain fell in one week and that's a record flood event for the Flinders River.\n\"The Flinders River system is now a flood plain. This is a mega river making its way up to the gulf.\"\nIf you were to pick up the area affected and dump it on populated New South Wales, it would stretch from Sydney, west as far as Bathurst and south to Yass, near Canberra, Mr Sharpe said.\nBut unlike in NSW, where the water would likely run to multiple rivers lessening the overall impact, the geography of northern Queensland means the vast majority of the water is being funnelled in one direction through the Flinders system.\nAt 1000km long, the Flinders is the longest river in Queensland and drains a vast area of some 108,000sq km. On its way it passes by towns including Richmond, Hughenden and Julia Creek, many of which have been affected by the floodwater.\nOnly the final 70km of the river, as it nears the Gulf of Carpentaria close to the small town of Karumba, holds water all year round.\nThe river crosses a large flat clay pan, and much of its surrounds are ideal for raising cattle.

Now, we get a much better look at how that's all going to go down in this new Infinity War trailer.\nAvengers: Infinity War isn't like any MCU movie that's come before and Marvel is treating it as such. They made fans wait months after the first footage for the movie debuted at D23 and San Diego Comic-Con before finally releasing the teaser trailer online last November. At that point, all was forgiven, as the footage blew fans away and is now the most-watched trailer ever in YouTube history. Safe to say, this new Avengers: Infinity War trailer could take over the top spot, as the hype is really starting to build just a couple of months out. But this could be some of the last new footage we get before the movie arrives on May 4. Kevin Feige and Co. seem to want the surprises to remain surprises.\nThis movie serves as the culmination of an unprecedented cinematic experiment ten years in the making. From the first time we saw Thanos during the post-credits scene in The Avengers, everything has been building to what is being billed as the \"ultimate, deadliest showdown of all time.\" There's a lot of pressure on Avengers 3 to deliver the goods at this point. Can directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo really pull this off and meet everyone's very wild expectations? Marvel fans all over the world are certainly hoping so.\nIron Man, Thor, Doctor Strange, the Hulk and the rest of Earth's mightiest heroes, with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy, unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet, the Mad Titan himself, Thanos. He's also bringing his Black Order along with him, so The Avengers are going to have that to contend with as well. Thanos is on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones so that he can \"balance the universe.\" Which, by the looks of things, means killing a whole lot of people all across the stars. The fate of the planet rests in the hands of the heroes we've come to know and love over the years.\nThis movie is also largely going to be setting us up for what's to come in Avengers 4, which arrives next year on May 3 and will be the final Phase 3 MCU movie. The pressure was always on for Avengers: Infinity War, but given the success that Marvel has enjoyed with Black Panther, there's going to be even more of an expectation to deliver the goods. Luckily, T'Challa and Wakanda look to play a huge part in this movie, which bodes quite well for those around the world who enjoyed Black Panther."}

{"idx": "13499", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What's So Bad About Trump Calling Erdogan?\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of the U.S. subordinating human-rights concerns to other interests. But there was something remarkable about the president\u2019s move.\nJust after Donald Trump grew disenchanted with Vladimir Putin, the U.S. president appeared to strike up a new fling with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nPresident Donald J. Trump spoke today with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to congratulate him on his recent referendum victory and to discuss the United States\u2019 action in response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons on April 4th. President Trump thanked President Erdogan for supporting this action by the United States, and the leaders agreed on the importance of holding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accountable. President Trump and President Erdogan also discussed the counter-ISIS campaign and the need to cooperate against all groups that use terrorism to achieve their ends.\nThough cloaked in the drab language of official communications, Trump\u2019s statement is remarkable for its apparent endorsement of a referendum that makes Turkey manifestly less liberal; the speed with which it was offered; the way it differs from the stated views of key American allies and even the State Department; and the lack of any expression of concern about the process.\nFirst, there is the substance of the referendum, which pushes Turkey down the path from being a flawed but genuine democracy toward authoritarianism. \u201cSunday\u2019s vote was a triumph for an illiberal form of democracy in which charismatic leaders, through democratic procedures like elections and referendums, are empowered to carry out the will of the majority of their people, largely free of democratic restraints,\u201d my colleague Uri Friedman wrote.\nSo Trump\u2019s phone call, and the statement that followed it, were unusual. But how unusual? The release of the readout was met with gasps from some observers, followed by eyerolling from other quarters. The fact is that the U.S. has long made accommodation with autocrats and repressive leaders, and American presidents have for years congratulated counterparts who won election through dubious electoral processes.\nThere are cases where this doesn\u2019t happen, such as when Obama didn\u2019t congratulate Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for winning a 2009 election widely viewed as rigged, but they are conspicuous by their absence and snubs are not unnoticed.\nMoreover, there\u2019s an obvious reason for the U.S. to be cozying up to Erdogan now, because Turkey is central to American strategy in fighting ISIS and, potentially, would be a key player in any expanded fight against the Syrian government. When the Trump administration began exploring strikes against Bashar al-Assad, Erdogan quickly said he would approve the use of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as a departure point.\n\u201cPrioritizing near-term security cooperation over the democratic and human rights of one partner is commonplace in American foreign policy, and Trump\u2019s action here is an exaggerated example that proves the rule,\u201d she said.\nPresident Obama called Egyptian President Abdelfattah al-Sisi today to congratulate him on his inauguration and to convey his commitment to working together to advance the shared interests of both countries. The President reiterated the United States\u2019 continuing support for the political, economic, and social aspirations of the Egyptian people, and respect for their universal rights.

{"idx": "13500", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: What's Inside Darpa's $21 Million 'Liquid' Laser?\nThings are really beginning to heat up in the field of laser weapons. The giant Airborne Laser is finally gearing up for real-life, missile-zapping tests. New solid-state lasers like Raytheon's Phalanx can already shoot down mortar rounds. Now, Darpa is weighing in with an yet another technology: HELLADS or \"High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System.\" Weaponeer Textron will get $21 million in Darpa bucks \"to design, fabricate and test a Unit Cell Module for a 150 kilowatt (kW) Laser Weapon System,\" according to a company press release.\nAs you'd expect from Darpa, the new laser is aiming for quantum leap, with a power-to-weight ratio ten times better than existing laser systems. The end product will be the size of a large refrigerator and weight of 1650 pounds. And a hundred and fifty kilowatts is real weapons-grade, compared to existing solid state lasers which still zap in the tens of kilowatts.\nThe agency's website says that \"HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems.\" The 150 kW laser is meant to be integrated with an existing fire-control system and will demonstrate the ability to shoot down tactical targets including surface-to-air missiles and rockets. That would be quite something: a fighter jet which can shoot down any missiles fired at it. Suddenly stealth doesn\u2019t seem quite so important, when the air defenses can see you but can't touch you. Cannon fire from other aircraft might still be a threat, but what are the chances of anyone getting close enough before you laser them?\nDespite Washington chatter of programmatic stumbles, HELLADS seems to be growing rapidly, from with a 1 kilowatt version in 2004 to a 15 kW version in 2006. Now, they are confident enough to start on the full-size model. However, the $21 million deal will not cover building the whole thing, just one module, plus the design for the entire system; the finished product will cost something extra. Still, it's small change compared to the $7+ billion spent on the Airborne laser.\nLasers all work in pretty much the same way: Excite certain kinds of atoms, and light particles \u2014 photons \u2014 radiate out. Reflect that light back into the excited atoms, and more photons appear. But performance varies wildly, depending on the kind of \"gain medium\" \u2014 the type of atoms \u2014 you use to generate the beam. The Airborne Lasers uses vats of chemicals. Raytheon's Phalanx uses solid-state materials. But those kind of lasers can rapidly overheat and suffer damage (a laser with a 50% efficiency generates the same amount of waste heat as the energy in the beam). Liquid lasers (like HELLADS, presumably) are less vulnerable to this, since the liquid can be cooled by circulation.\nBut is HELLADS still a liquid laser, really? However, Textron say that their HELLADS design is based on \"proprietary ThinZag Ceramic solid-state laser technology\"; earlier Textron HELLADS workalso refers to ThinZag solid state technology and does not mention the liquid aspect. ThinZag itself appears to"}

It's not actually 0.6 inch thick all the way through, though, as there's a very prominent bump around the camera lens. The PureView 808 is closer to half an inch thick otherwise, which is still more than most in this era of super-thin smartphones. But there's a 41-megapixel camera in there, so we'll give it a break.\nAs always, Nokia has a fine touch with hardware design. The 808 PureView feels very well made, with quality plastics, a Corning Gorilla Glass front panel, and button housings that seem laser-cut in their precision.

Hundreds of protesters, or water protectors, as they prefer to be called, have been arrested since the protests began, many charged with criminal trespassing. But the protesters say they aren\u2019t trespassing; in fact, they say they are the victims, citing the broken treaties their ancestors made with the U.S. government.\nThe proposed route passes through land that was once set aside for the Sioux in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. That historic agreement ensured the Sioux could retain portions of five states, but ceded all of their land east of the Missouri River to the U.S. government in exchange for money, agricultural aid and strict rules about any access to Sioux territory by outsiders. However, the agreement was short-lived.\n\u201cBefore the ink was dry, westerners were coming in,\u201d Archambault said.\nThe U.S. government did little to stop white settlers from infringing, according to the State Historical Society of North Dakota.\nThings only got worse for the Sioux after gold was discovered at the headwaters of the Missouri River in 1861, prompting a flood of settlers. The tribes repeatedly objected to the intrusions and demanded government recognition of the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, but their complaints fell on deaf ears.\nBy 1868, the U.S. government and representatives of various Sioux tribes convened once again at Fort Laramie. The resulting treaty established a much smaller territory known as the Great Sioux Reservation, but under Article 12 no further land loss could occur unless approved by three-fourths of adult Sioux males.\nNevertheless, after gold was discovered in the sacred Black Hills of South Dakota deep in Sioux territory, Congress passed the Act of 1877 which ceded the Black Hills to the United States without tribal approval in one of the most controversial land grabs in U.S. history.\nMore than a century later in 1980, the Sioux took the Black Hills case to the Supreme Court and won a decision that rewarded the tribe with more than $100 million. To this day, the Sioux have refused to accept the funds, hoping instead to get back the sacred land itself.\nAfter seizing the Black Hills, Congress moved to further reduce the Great Sioux Reservation in acts passed in 1887 and 1889, dividing it into fragments of its original 1868 version.\nSince then, the Standing Rock Reservation\u2019s borders have essentially remained the same, though the tribe claims it lost thousands of acres of its best lands to flooding after the government erected several dams"}

And it makes noise: The pneumatic clamp on the miller makes a loud blast when it opens to receive the small metal piece and again when it closes on it, and motors in the miller let out organ-like chords as the machine carves.\nOther teachers in her school have expressed interest in linking the TAM to their disciplines.\nTeacher and student excitement are exactly what the TAM's creators hoped for. Raymond Puffer, associate director of the Center for Advanced Technology in Automation and Robotics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Douglas Baldrey, the associate dean and chairman of the department of mechanical and industrial technology at Hudson Valley Community College, realized back in the summer of 1989 that few young people were becoming interested in manufacturing and engineering careers. They decided they needed something that would give students some hands-on experience and get them enthused. So, they designed the TAM.\nPhil Shoemaker built the first one, which was pilot-tested at the eight Albany-area schools during the 1989-90 school year. Because it was such a hit with students and teachers, two more are being built for use in other area schools this fall, and six to 10 additional modules are expected to be ready by the end of the academic year.\nPuffer hopes to expand the TAM program even further by attracting support from industry. He would like businesses to foot the cost of each module--$30,000 for construction and $10,000 a year for a local community college to manage the system, train teachers, and transport the module between schools. So far, he says, such big names as Eastman Kodak, IBM, Xerox, and Corning have expressed interest. Sponsorship by these companies would expand the TAM network to school districts throughout New York State and eventually, Puffer hopes, the entire country. He already has spoken with General Motors and Ford about sponsoring a TAM in Detroit's schools.\n\"Right now, if I look at a list of potential locations for TAMs, I could see building as many as 15 or 20 this year,'' says Puffer.\nBuilding additional TAMs will not only make them available to more teachers and students, but will also allow the teachers who get a module to keep it longer. The biggest complaint from teachers who used the TAM last year was that the time they had with it was too short. Each teacher had access to the device for less than a month because it was shared among the eight schools and showcased at various educational conferences.\nHowever the TAM is used in the future, its most enduring appeal is likely to be that it gets students excited about modern technology by making it real."}

{"idx": "13511", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It\u2019s taken six years for Rita Ora to release her second album. Six years that included a very messy, very public breakup with previous label Roc Nation, high-profile quarrels with A-list exes, ventures into acting (a recurring role in the \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019 series) and reality television judging (on The X Factor and The Voice). And now, finally, she singer has risen like a phoenix (see what she did with the album name), to release this long-awaited record.\nThe album\u2019s largely excellent singles have been dropping for over a year, starting with the Ed Sheeran-penned smash \u2018Your Song\u2019 which dominated radio play in summer of last year. Then there was the critically adored, double chorus boasting chunk of electro-pop \u2018Anywhere\u2019 (which remains the best thing Ora has ever done). Next came the Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX collaboration \u2018Girls\u2019, which made the cut on \u2018Phoenix\u2019, despite the backlash received when it was first released.\nAlong the way, there have been team-ups with Liam Payne (on the soundtrack for \u201950 Shades Freed\u2019), and Avicii (which was included on the album as a tribute to the late DJ).In fact, by the time \u2018Phoenix\u2019 dropped, we had already heard half the album.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing: through these stellar cuts, Ora has been able to spend the past 18 months re-establishing herself as a musical tour de force, something the rest of \u2018Phoenix\u2019 confirms. The crunching electronics of tropical bop \u2018New Love\u2019 are brilliantly good fun, and \u2018Only Want You\u2019 is a curiously affecting electro-ballad. Of course there are a few filler tracks that don\u2019t meet the match: a duet with industry darling Julia Michaels fails to reach the highs both women are capable of, and Rudimental collaboration \u2018Summer Love\u2019 is a messy mix of Ora\u2019s distinctive vocals and drum and bass drops.\nLargely, though, Rita Ora\u2019s album is everything you\u2019d want it to be: endlessly fun, stuffed full of brilliantly left-field production and ear-worm choruses. It may have taken six long years to arrive, but \u2018Phoenix\u2019 is Ora\u2019s proof that good things come to those who wait."}

{"idx": "13513", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Advocates say they are thrilled at the breadth and depth of the bipartisan commitments.\nIn the anguished days following the mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, President Barack Obama called for a renewed national focus on mental health.\nHis plea went nowhere in Congress. But states from South Carolina to Oregon have taken up the challenge.\nAt least 37 states have increased spending on mental health in the year since Adam Lanza shot dead 20 children, six school employees and his mother in Newtown, Conn. It\u2019s not just about money, either. States are experimenting with new \u2014 and sometimes controversial \u2014 ways to raise awareness about psychological distress, to make treatment more accessible for children and adults and to keep firearms away from those struggling with mental illness.\nNevada, for instance, is launching a pilot program to screen children in secondary schools for mental health concerns. Texas not only boosted mental health funding by a record $300 million over two years, but required public school teachers and students to be trained in recognizing mental illness. Utah will require school districts to offer parents an annual seminar on mental health, including depression and suicide. Colorado established a 24-hour crisis hotline.\nThe new initiatives don\u2019t make up for the more than $4 billion cut from state mental health budgets during the lean years of the recent recession. And they weren\u2019t universal: A half-dozen states cut funding on mental health this year, including Louisiana, Maine and North Carolina.\nBut overall, advocates say they are thrilled at the breadth and depth of the commitments from lawmakers of both parties.\n\u201cSandy Hook, horrible as it was, provided the impetus for state legislatures to take mental health seriously,\u201d said Sita Diehl, director of state policy and advocacy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which recently released a comprehensive report on state actions.\nThe most contentious measures are laws passed in more than a dozen states that require some reporting of mental health status as part of background checks for firearms purchases.\nAnd New York now requires mental health professionals to report to authorities any patient they believe is likely to cause serious harm to himself or others. Law enforcement can then seize any firearms the patient owns, suspend any gun license he holds and block him from obtaining a license in the future.\nSuch measures have raised concerns among psychiatrists and psychologists who worry that patients will shy away from treatment or be reluctant to trust therapists.\nThere\u2019s another concern as well: \u201cTo put this into legislation now really creates a misperception, a nonfactual link, that people with mental health conditions are more likely to commit violent crimes,\u201d said Daniela Giordano, public policy director for NAMI Connecticut.\nLanza, who was 20 when he shot his way into Sandy Hook, had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome as a teenager. A report released last Monday by Connecticut State\u2019s attorney Stephen Sedensky III noted that he had \u201csignificant social impairments and extreme anxiety,\u201d and that \u201che lacked empathy and had very rigid thought processes.\u201d Clinicians recommended medication and behavioral therapy, but Lanza refused both.\nThe report makes clear though, that none of the mental health professionals who saw Lanza ever thought he could commit such violence. Neither, apparently, did his mother, who worried about his increasingly eccentric behavior and self-imposed isolation \u2014 but wrote him a check shortly before his rampage so he could buy himself a pistol for Christmas, the report said.\nGiven the difficulty in identifying which patients may turn violent \u2014 and the vast number of patients who never pose a threat \u2014 NAMI urges states to focus on expanding access to"}

In the Smartcards & Issuance segment, the Payment business posted a solid performance driven by the first EMV renewal campaigns in the US and strong payment card deployments across other regions. The recent Apple announcement introducing eSIM technology in its new generation of iPhones was an important milestone. It should trigger an acceleration in the rate of activations that will benefit Gemalto\u2019s eSIM solutions with Mobile Network Operators.\nGemalto posted revenue of \u20ac727 million, lower by (3%) both at constant exchange rates and historical exchange rates from the same period of last year. The contributions to the Company\u2019s total revenue were respectively 47% for the Identity, IoT & Cybersecurity segment and 53% for the Smartcards & Issuance segment.\nThe Identity, IoT & Cybersecurity segment\u2019s revenue came in at \u20ac345 million, down (1%) compared to the previous year as large programs in both the Governments and Cybersecurity businesses are being delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018. The segment year-to-date revenue reached \u20ac989 million, increasing +12% compared with the same period of last year.\nThe Governments business revenue declined in the third quarter compared with the same period of last year with significant e-documents programs rolling out in the US and Latin America in the fourth quarter of 2018, together with the first deliveries of the UK passport. In the third quarter, Gemalto was selected by the state of Georgia in the US for the supply of driver\u2019s license solution. The solution comprises an advanced enrollment system that includes photo and signature capture. The driving license will use premium polycarbonate including Multiple Laser Images (MLIs) to reduce document forgery and protect against identity fraud. This program win is another example of the depth and completeness of Gemalto offers for Governments to protect their citizens\u2019 identities.\nThe Cybersecurity business revenue was slightly down this quarter as several encryption program deployments notably in Europe and the US are also taking place in the fourth quarter of 2018. The software monetization and authentication sub-business lines posted a solid performance. As part of its cloud offer, Gemalto announced this quarter the launch of its next-generation key management solution, SafeNet Virtual KeySecure. This innovative solution integrated with leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM cloud and VMware provides companies with a single key management solution spanning multiple private or public cloud environments. As a result, companies can extend their data protection policies to private and public clouds and centralize encryption and key management operations across multiple cloud environments. Companies can also improve key security and audit process by retaining ownership and control of encryption keys.\nThe IoT business posted another very strong performance in this quarter. The increase was driven by strong deliveries in Europe and Asia to large customers in Automotive, Health, Payment and Metering sectors.

Turkish officials believe the three migrants froze to death, Anadolu said, but their bodies have been sent to Istanbul for further examination.\nAuthorities caught an Afghan man, named as Jamaluddin Malangi by Anadolu, who told reporters in Edirne that Greek police sent him back to Turkey on a boat via River Evros between Greece and Turkey.\nThe area is a major crossing point for refugees and migrants trying to enter the European Union. Malangi, who claimed he knew one of the migrants found dead, said that they sought help after crossing into Greece by knocking on doors.\n\"We wanted help and during this someone must have called the police and the Greek police officers came and caught us. First they took us to the police station then they took us near to the river where there were two boats,\" Malangi said, quoted by Anadolu.\n\"We were sent back after being put on them (the boats)\" to Turkey, he added. It was not clear whether the migrants found dead were all part of the same group who entered Greece with Malangi or had separately tried to enter the EU member state.\nAccording to Greek authorities, over 14,000 irregular entries have been recorded across the Turkish border so far this year, compared to some 5,500 in 2017. But the number of migrants coming to Europe has fallen since the 2015 peak when over a million people landed in Greece from Turkey, the majority via boats.\nThe decline followed a deal agreed between the EU and Turkey in 2016 to stop the flow of migrants with Ankara agreeing to take migrants landing on Greek islands in exchange for incentives, including billions of euros to support refugees in Turkey."}
{"idx": "13530", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood.\nNew research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies. It also showed that countries around the world must do a better job of employing women because, when they do, we see more women and girls onscreen.\nIn their previous research, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, & Dr. Katherine Pieper at the USC Annenberg School of Communications, looked at G, PG and PG-13 rated movies that were released in the US. For this study, done by the same researchers, they looked to see if the gender disparity that we see in the US is also the same around the world. (The data set includes a content analysis of gender roles in popular films across the ten most profitable territories internationally: Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. They also analyzed US/UK co-productions and used US films as a point of reference for comparison.) Films had to be theatrically released between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2013.\nGirls and women are missing. There are 2.24 male characters for every female character. Only 30.9% of the speaking characters are female. China, Germany, Korea, and the UK have the highest depictions of female characters. Korea has the highest percentage of female leads or co-leads. UK films that are not co-productions with the US have a much better rate of gender parity. As the study notes, \"as U.S. studio money comes in, females are pushed out.\"\nAction adventure had the fewest females.\nThere is a crisis in women directors across the globe. Out of 1,452 filmmakers, 20.5% were women, but just 7% were directors. 19.5% of the writers were women, as were 22.7% of the producers. France, Japan, Russia, the US, and Korea had zero women directors working on these films. The best employers were the UK, with 27.3% women directors and 58.8% women writers.\nWhen there are women working as director and/or writer, the number of women on screen increases. Women-directed films had 6.8% more females on screen than male-directed films, while women-written films had 7.5% more female presence than male-written films.\nFemale characters are sexualized all across the globe. Women wear more revealing clothing, are thinner, and are more likely to be partially or fully naked. Comments about characters' appearance were five times as likely to be directed at female characters than at male characters.\nYou are just as likely to be sexualized in a film if you are 13 or if you are 39.\nAll across the globe, women are underrepresented as part of the work force, while male characters are seen more often in positions of power. For example: Women are seen as just 10% of the politicians, 5% of judges, 0% of partners in law firms, and 13.9% of business executives. The only female politician that was powerful in the whole data set was Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. And forget seeing women in STEM jobs. When characters held those positions, 88.4% were men and 11.6% were women. This calculates into a gender ratio of 7.6 STEM"}

The Mission report recommends that the Security Council require Israel and the authorities in Gaza to report to it, within six months, on investigations and prosecutions it should carry out with regard to the violations identified by the Mission.\nThe Mission recommends that the Security Council set up a body of independent experts to report to it on the progress of the Israeli and Palestinian investigations and prosecutions. If the experts\u2019 reports do not indicate within six months that good faith, independent proceedings are taking place, the Security Council should refer the situation in Gaza to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor.\nThe Fact Finding Mission, headed by Justice Richard Goldstone, who is a former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, also comprises Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and a member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (2004); Professor Christine Chinkin, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun (2008); and Colonel Desmond Travers, a former Officer in Ireland\u2019s Defence Forces and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Criminal Investigations.\nThe Mission found that the repeated acts of firing rockets and mortars into Southern Israel by Palestinian armed groups from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip constituted war crimes that may amount to crimes against humanity.\nIn the lead up to the Israeli military assault on Gaza, the Mission said it found that Israel had imposed a blockade amounting to collective punishment and carried out a systematic policy of progressive isolation and deprivation of the Gaza Strip. During the Israeli military operation, code-named \u201cOperation Cast Lead,\u201d more than 1,400 people were killed, including women and more than 340 children, and houses, factories, wells, schools, hospitals, police stations and other public buildings were destroyed.\nThe report concludes that the Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole, in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population, and in a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population. The Report states that Israeli acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza Strip of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom"}

The new indictment could lead to the investigation and prosecution of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director Robert Mueller (now a special prosecutor), and former President Barack Obama \u2014 all of whom were involved in a deal that transferred 20 percent (or more) of U.S. uranium production to Russia.\nUnlike the empty conspiracy theory in the \u201cRussia collusion\u201d fishing expedition led by Mueller against President Trump, the Uranium One case involves real conspiracy fact and is of utmost concern to our national security.\nThe DOJ statement notes that Lambert is the \u201cformer co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad.\u201d Among important facts not mentioned in the DOJ statement are Lambert-Mikerin-Putin connections to Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, Robert Mueller, Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and other top Obama administration officials involved in facilitating or covering up the Uranium One treason scandal.\nThe Uranium One affair involves the transfer of uranium stocks and mines to Rosatom, Russia\u2019s Putin-controlled nuclear energy conglomerate. The transfer was effected by Uranium One, a Canadian company owned by Frank Giustra, a wheeler-dealer tycoon, big donor to the Clinton Foundation, and close business associate of Bill Clinton.\nThe deal with Russia was completed in 2013, thanks to approval by the Obama administration, which had received a crucial \u201cthumbs up\u201d from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS.) The CFIUS is an interagency committee that must approve transactions where a foreign entity might acquire control of a U.S. business or assets impacting national security.

If you want to become a veterinarian, you will need to complete a number of educational requirements and gain some hands-on experience to familiarize yourself with the medical care of animals.\nHigh school education should consist of mathematics courses in addition to science courses such as biology and chemistry. Completing as many math and science courses as possible at the high school level will strengthen your education in preparation for veterinary-related college courses. While in high school, enhance your veterinary education with an after-school or summer job at an animal hospital, farm, pet store, research lab, stable, veterinary clinic or zoo. Volunteering at local animal rescues, animal shelters, humane societies or veterinary clinics also would give you further education and first-hand experience in animal care.\nIf you plan to attend college, you do not need to major in a veterinary-related field or obtain a bachelor's degree to gain admittance into a veterinary school, but you must complete a certain number of undergraduate credits before attending a school with accreditation from the American Veterinary Medical Association. Exact requirements can vary. Contact an accredited veterinary college to find out the coursework you need to complete for admission into that college. While a veterinary college may not require a 4.0 GPA for admission, high grades may boost your chances.\nMost veterinary colleges require applicants to take the Graduate Record Examination, called GRE, with some also mandating the Biology GRE. Rather than the GRE, some schools use the Medical College Admission Test or Veterinary College Admission Test. Contact your veterinary school of choice to find out the exam you must take.\nVeterinary colleges require students to take three years of classroom, clinical and laboratory work. Classroom studies include subjects such as normal animal anatomy and physiology, immunology, parasitology, and pharmacology. You also will learn about preventing disease, diagnosing medical conditions, and treating animals. Aside from science courses, you also may learn business-management and career-development aspects of running a successful veterinary practice. Your fourth and final year in a veterinary medicine program will include clinical rotations in a veterinary hospital or medical center. Upon successfully completing the program, you will earn your DVM degree.\nOnce you have your DVM degree and have performed a sufficient number of clinical hours, you will work toward obtaining your license to practice veterinary medicine. After applying for and passing the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination, find out any additional licensing requirements of the state in which you intend to work as a veterinarian. Once you have your license, you may want more professional experience via internships or residency programs before starting your own practice.\nDegreeDirectory: What Are The Educational Requirements To Be A Veterinarian?\nRadenhausen, Jim. \"What Educational Preparation Is Needed to Be a Veterinarian?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/educational-preparation-needed-veterinarian-3439.html.

The bear\u2019s powerful sense of smell allows it to find food that humans consider out of reach. By removing these attractants, bear and humans are less likely to have unpleasant encounters.\nWhen people are irresponsible with their food and garbage, bears can wind up in trouble. The Nevada Department of Wildlife reports that nearly 95 percent of all human-bear conflicts are associated with trash.\nBears naturally fear humans, but if they have access to human food sources they may become addicted, lose their natural fear of humans, and even become aggressive.\n\u201cAs always the main issue is people living in bear habitat and allowing bear\u2019s access to their trash,\u201d said Lackey. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven that by stopping access to human sources of food the wildlife conflicts almost totally disappear.\u201d NDOW believes that by following a few simple steps, you can help avoid human-bear conflicts.\nVisit ndow.org/Nevada_Wildlife/Bear_Logic to learn more."}

Nidal Hasan has grown the beard in violation of Army policy and says he wants to keep it for religious reasons. If he's not forced to shave and is subsequently convicted in the 2009 attack on the Texas Army post, the issue could also become grounds for an appeal.\nMilitary trials are very formal and the juries expect all regulations to be followed, down to the smallest detail, some legal experts said.\n\"I've seen a judge send a soldier out of the courtroom because his uniform wasn't right -- his medals weren't in order or his tie wasn't tied right,\" said Ret. Army Maj. Gen. John Altenburg, a former deputy judge advocate general who now is an attorney in private practice. \"Jurors get a first impression of that defendant, and at worst it's neutral and at best it's positive.\"\nHasan faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted in the November 2009 attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others at Fort Hood, about 125 miles southwest of Fort Worth.\nHasan first showed up with a beard at a pretrial hearing in June, saying it's an expression of his Muslim faith. The judge said he would order Hasan to shave before trial if he didn't shave himself.\nHasan went to the military appeals court after top Army officials in June denied his request for a waiver to the no-beard rule based on religious grounds. On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that Hasan's appeal was premature, saying the judge, Col. Gregory Gross, hasn't issued a definitive order for Hasan to be forcibly shaved.\nExperts say Gross is likely to order Hasan to be forcibly shaved and that Hasan will appeal again.\nHasan's court-martial had been scheduled to start Aug. 20, but all court proceedings were put on hold while Hasan's appeal was being considered. A new trial date has not been set since the military appeals court lifted that delay.\nHasan would not be the first military defendant forcibly shaved.\nThe Army has done it to five inmates since 2005, including one person who was forcibly shaved twice, according to the Army's Office of the Chief of Staff. The most recent was in June 2011 for a soldier stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Wash. It's not clear if any of those inmates asked for waivers on religious grounds. The Army declined to release details, including the soldiers' names, saying it would invade their privacy and the shavings are not public events.\nHasan's attorneys say he believes not having a beard is a sin and doesn't want to die without one since his premonition that his death is imminent.\nGross has banned Hasan from the courtroom since the June pretrial hearing, calling the beard a disruption, and sent him to a nearby room to watch the proceedings on a closed-circuit television.

The group targeted the Bitcoin wallet platform blockchain.info by using phishing links, fraudulent domains, and brand spoofing.\n\"This campaign was unique in that adversaries leveraged Google Adwords to poison user search results in order to steal users' wallets,\" Cisco Talos says. \"Since Cisco observed this technique, it has become increasingly common in the wild with attackers targeting many different crypto wallets and exchanges via malicious ads.\"\nThe fraudsters established \"gateway\" phishing links that appeared in search results when potential victims searched Google for cryptocurrency-related keywords, such as \"blockchain\" or \"bitcoin wallet.\"\nThese links, bolstered by the purchase of Google AdWords, would then send victims to malicious domains, which would serve phishing content depending on the IP address and likely language of the visitor.\nAccording to the team, the hackers are focusing on countries where access to traditional banking may be difficult, such as Estonia, Nigeria, Ghana, and a number of other African countries.\nWhen access to banking is difficult, cryptocurrency, as decentralized assets recorded on the Blockchain, may empower users financially. However, it seems that the cybercriminals behind the campaign also know there may be more interest from residents of these countries, and so, this idea has decided the focus of phishing campaigns.\nCisco observed spikes in DNS queries upwards of 200,000 per hour when the fraudulent ads were on display. The campaign appears to be the largest phishing scheme targeting blockchain.info to date.\nThe security firm believes that the gang has been in operation since at least 2015 and has managed to steal tens of millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency.\nBetween September 2017 to December 2017 alone, the group stole approximately $10 million in cryptocurrency, and in one particular 3.5 week period, the hackers were able to steal $2 million.\nIt is estimated that the unknown threat actors may have netted over $50 million over the past three years and likely profited when the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed last year.\n\"While criminals were able to profit from this, it also adds a new level of complexity for criminals to convert their cryptocurrency funds to a fiat currency like US dollars,\" the researchers note. \"The historic price of Bitcoin during the height of this campaign would have made it very difficult to move these ill-gotten finances easily.\"\nIt appears the threat actors are not resting on their laurels despite the huge amount of fraudulent revenue they have established.

We have efficiency goals for energy and cars \u2013 and now we have them for water,\u201d said Governor Brown.\n-Establishing an indoor, per person water use goal of 55 gallons per day until 2025, 52.5 gallons from 2025 to 2030 and 50 gallons beginning in 2030.\n\u2013 Creating incentives for water suppliers to recycle water.\n\u2013 Requiring both urban and agricultural water suppliers to set annual water budgets and prepare for drought.\n\u201cThis is another important step in the Legislature\u2019s focused effort to reengineer water policy away from crisis management and toward a 21st century approach. I want to thank the Governor and his staff for their creative vision, and my colleagues in both houses for their hard work to bring this across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Hertzberg.\n\u201cGovernor Brown challenged every Californian to embrace water efficiency during the drought, and with his signature on AB 1668, we\u2019ll have the state working collaboratively with local governments and urban water suppliers to put in place water efficiency standards that will help every community focus on sustainability. It\u2019s a balanced approach that puts efficiency first and gives water agencies the flexibility to embrace innovation and tailor their policies to meet the unique needs of their community,\u201d said Assemblymember Friedman.\nToday\u2019s legislative action builds on Governor Brown\u2019s ongoing efforts to make water conservation a way of life in California. The state responded to the most recent drought with emergency actions and investments and the advancement of the California Water Action Plan, the Administration\u2019s five-year blueprint for more reliable, resilient water systems to prepare for climate change and population growth.\nFor full text of the bills signed today, visit http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov."}

The budget suggests $19.1 billion for NASA in 2018, only $561 million less than what the agency received in fiscal year 2017, but human spaceflight and exploration of the solar system are set to take precedence over Earth sciences and educational outreach programs.\nThe budget proposal still needs approval from Congress, so some program funding might still be altered. For the most part, however, the budget proposal gives us a pretty good look at what NASA will use your $35 a year for. Here are the programs that will blast off into the future, and the ones that will get grounded.\nThe Europa orbiter mission will get a boost of $150 million. The the highly-anticipated spacecraft to visit Jupiter's moon and search for signs of life was funded to the tune of $275 million in 2017, while the new budget proposal would boost it to $425 million for 2018. It's no surprise\u2014the Europa mission is a pet project of Republican congressman John Culberson, whose district includes NASA facilities in Texas. The budget does not include any funds for a Europa lander, however.\nMissions to Mars will continue for the most part. The budget puts the 2018 InSight lander back on track and keeps the Mars 2020 rover about the same, but it doesn't add a follow-up spacecraft to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, currently the communications hub for all of NASA's Mars missions. The MRO has been in orbit since 2005 and won't last forever, so eventually a new orbiter will be needed to support future missions to Mars.\nThe Lucy and Psyche missions are officially on the budget now as well. The Lucy probe will study asteroids that share an orbit with Jupiter called Trojans, while the Psyche spacecraft will visit the smashed core of a protoplanet in the asteroid belt also called Psyche. The budget proposes a $117.1 million increase over expected funding for NASA's Discovery Program overall. That program includes both Lucy and Psyche, the InSight lander, and the Dawn probe currently in orbit around Ceres.\nNew Frontiers missions like Juno and New Horizons are set to stay on target, meaning New Horizons is funded for a 2019 flyby of the Kuiper belt object 2014 MU69, and Juno is fit to continue studying Jupiter. The OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission, launched in September 2016, will continue as planned as well.\nThe Space Launch System, NASA's much-delayed heavy-lift rocket, and the Orion spacecraft to launch on top will receive a slight decrease in funding, but only a small fraction of the overall budget, leaving the programs to continue more or less as planned. The enormous rocket will not launch until 2019 at the earliest.\nEarth sciences will sustain a $166.9 million cut, from the originally planned $1.92 billion to $1.75 billion. Earth science analysis takes a $70 million gash, and specific missions will see $137 million in cuts. The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, for example, will have funding cut for its Earth-monitoring camera EPIC, though the sat will continue to study the sun and the effects of solar weather"}

There is also meager evidence that the drug works for patients with moderate Alzheimer's , the researchers say.\nMemantine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with moderate and severe Alzheimer's. However, physicians often prescribe it off-label to those with mild forms of the disease. About 19 percent of U.S. patients with mild Alzheimer's disease take the drug, the researchers say. The drug is intended to improve cognitive functions and make it easier for patients to perform daily activities.\nThough there is no proof that the drug thwarts disease progress , some physicians may prescribe it, and some patients may take it, \"under the hopes that it's better to treat with this drug now rather than it is to wait until somebody becomes severe and then treat them,\" said study researcher Dr. Lon Schneider, of the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.\nDoctors should take into account these new findings when they consider treating mild and moderate Alzheimer's patients with memantine, Schneider said. Additional studies should be conducted looking at the effects of memantine on patients with mild disease, Schneider said.\nExperts agree it's too early to say whether physicians should stop prescribing this drug for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. \"Physicians should become as educated as possible about the drugs and use them with their best judgment,\" said William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer at the Alzheimer's Association, who was not involved in the study. \"The success or lack of success is such a close call, and the effects are so small, I think a blanket recommendation is very hard to give at this point,\" Thies said.\nThe study is published online today (April 11) in the journal Archives of Neurology.\nIt is estimated that as many as 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients are categorized as having mild, moderate or severe forms of the disease depending on how well they score on a test designed to assess mental abilities. Patients with lower scores have a higher degree of mental impairment . Studies investigating the effects of memantine on Alzheimer's disease have generally grouped mild and moderate patients together, and so the effects on just those with mild form of the disease were unclear.\nSchneider and his colleagues analyzed three studies that had randomly assigned patients to receive either memantine or a placebo. These studies included 431 patients with mild Alzheimer's and 697 patients with moderate Alzheimer's. The researchers were able to extract the information on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and examine it separately.\nMild Alzheimer's patients on the drug fared no better than patients on the placebo in terms of improvement of symptoms and their ability to carry out daily activities.\nThe drug had a small effect on those with moderate Alzheimer's disease when the researchers combined information from the three trials.\nThies notes patients can vary widely in their response to the drug. It's possible that some patients with mild Alzheimer's disease do improve significantly, but these positive effects are hidden because many other patients in the trial do not improve.\n\"We don't have a good way of picking out who will respond ahead of time,\" Thies said.\nFurther studies may provide a better idea of which patients benefit most from the drug, but this information would"}

Around 300 people were moved from their homes to temporary shelters, with complaints ranging from nausea to chest pains.\nThe leak affected nearly 80 businesses, some of which were forced to close down. Total damages were estimated at 17.7 billion won ($15.9 million), Yonhap news agency said. The spill also damaged more than 200 hectares (500 acres) of farmland and affected 3,200 livestock animals.\nVillagers accused the government of failing to provide a timely warning about the chemical spill, prompting the government to send an inspection team to Gumi. On Monday, the government announced its decision to designate the area a special disaster zone after the Prime Minister\u2019s office held a meeting with the relevant vice ministers.\nThe prime minister\u2019s statement confirmed that the leak had caused \"considerable\" damage, but said that exact figures would only be provided after the completion of the ongoing assessment by government officials and experts.\nUnder current South Korean law, a government-designated special disaster area is entitled to extra financial aid from the central government to cover rehabilitation costs. Residents of such an area are given tax cuts and can delay payment on their taxes and public insurance and national pension bills."}

In the United States\u2019 southern and northern neighbors, confidence has fluctuated over the past three presidencies but declined most sharply this year. Just 22% of Canadians and 5% of Mexicans have at least some confidence in the U.S. president, down from more than eight-in-ten Canadians (83%) in 2016 and half of Mexicans (49%) in 2015. While Canadians generally have indicated greater confidence in U.S. presidents than Mexicans have, current Trump confidence levels are lower than both countries\u2019 Bush-era lows.\nThese countries have generally maintained fairly steady levels of U.S. favorability over the past 15 years, yet they both show a sharp drop in U.S. favorability since Trump took office. Three-in-ten Mexicans have a very or somewhat favorable view of the U.S., down from two-thirds (66%) in 2015. About four-in-ten Canadians have favorable views of the U.S. (43%), down from 68% in 2015.\nCurrent Trump confidence ratings in these countries are similar to their respective lows during the George W. Bush years. For example, only 13% of French respondents had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008, and now 14% in France say the same for Trump. Likewise, 14% of Germans had at least some confidence in Bush in 2008, while 11% are confident in Trump now.\nIn Europe, Poland is a bit of an outlier, since its confidence in the U.S. president changed less dramatically across the three administrations. Polish respondents had a Bush-era high of 47% confidence and an Obama-era high of 64%, yet just 23% of Poles have confidence in Trump in 2017.\nWhen it comes to U.S. favorability, Poland has remained relatively positive and stable since 2002. France and Germany, on the other hand, show greater fluctuation across administrations, with higher overall U.S. favorability during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n3Russia and Israel have gained confidence in the U.S. president. Since Obama\u2019s final term, confidence has gone up among Russians and Israelis. This year, 53% of Russians have at least some confidence in the U.S. president, up from an Obama-era low of 11% in 2015. Russian confidence in Obama rose and fell over the president\u2019s eight years in office, which saw tensions with Russia over Ukraine and other issues.\nIn Israel, 56% are confident in President Trump, up from 49% confidence for Obama in 2015.

Ruehlman in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. The Ohio Supreme Court further stayed all proceedings in the Hamilton County action while it considers the merits of OHSAA\u2019s Supreme Court complaint. The TRO was regarding a component of the OHSAA\u2019s Competitive Balance process as it applies specifically to Roger Bacon High School and the other seven members of the Greater Catholic League Coed Division.\nLast Thursday, the OHSAA filed a complaint for a writ of prohibition with the Ohio Supreme Court, contending that Judge Ruehlman does not have jurisdiction to decide the underlying claims against OHSAA, as the OHSAA is a private association and its member schools are volunteer members who vote on their own Bylaws and Constitution.\nThe hearing scheduled for Tuesday, August 28, in Hamilton County is now canceled and the Ohio Supreme Court has set a briefing schedule to consider the merits of OHSAA\u2019s Supreme Court complaint. A date has not been set for when the Ohio Supreme Court will make a decision.\nThe OHSAA\u2019s complaint to the Ohio Supreme Court contends that Judge Ruehlman does not have the jurisdiction or authority to issue a TRO prohibiting the OHSAA from implementing the adopted bylaws of the voluntary members of this unincorporated private association. Judge Ruehlman\u2019s TRO had prevented the OHSAA from implementing a component of the Competitive Balance formula as it applies specifically to the GCL Coed Division, but the ruling impacted schools throughout Ohio.\nIn addition to Roger Bacon, members of the GCL Coed Division include Kettering Archbishop Alter, Dayton Carroll, Middletown Bishop Fenwick, Cincinnati Purcell Marian, Hamilton Badin, Dayton Chaminade Julienne and Cincinnati Archbishop McNicholas.\nThe Competitive Balance process determines how schools are assigned to postseason tournament divisions in football, soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball and baseball.\nThe lawsuit has no effect on regular season schedules, which are now underway. However, if the OHSAA is not ultimately successful in its appeal, it could require the divisional assignments to be recalculated mid-season for those sports that are affected by Competitive Balance."}

Racist groups often targeted the poor family of Shawnee Native American ancestry as the Wrays endured segregation in the American South just like African-Americans.\nWray eventually took all that rage of his early years and crafted a 1958 instrumental hit Rumble using a distinct, distorted electric guitar sound that would influence generations of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll musicians from Iggy Pop, Neil Young, Pete Townshend of The Who and Slash of Guns N\u2019 Roses. Though the song had no lyrics, it was banned in the 1950s for allegedly encouraging teen violence.\nWray is one of many Native American musicians whose stories are featured in a new PBS Independent Lens documentary showing how Native Americans helped lay the foundations to rock, blues and jazz and shaped generations of musicians. The Montreal-made Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World is set to air on PBS stations Monday.\nThe hobby searching for Native American rock musicians eventually launched an exhibit at Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian, then a film, made by Montrealers Catherine Bainbridge and Alfonso Maiorana.\nBut rock musicians aren\u2019t the only popular musicians Rumble seeks to highlight. The documentary touches upon blues pioneer Charley Patton, an early 20th Century Mississippi Delta guitarist of Choctaw and African American ancestry. The film shows how some of Patton\u2019s music preserved on rough vinyl recordings is similar to traditional American Indian songs. Those traditions were fused black music.\nThe film also introduces viewers to the largely forgotten jazz vocalist Mildred Bailey. A member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe in the Pacific Northwest, Bailey began signing ragtime in the 1920s and developed a swing style that fused traditional Native American vocals with jazz. She became known as the \u201cThe Queen of Swing\u201d who performed at speakeasies and had a style so unique that young Italian-American aspiring singers Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra began copying her form.\nThe documentary dives into the career of Davis, lead guitarist for Taj Mahal, who died in 1988 of a heroin overdose. And it goes into the momentous career of Randy Castillo, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-born Isleta Pueblo drummer for Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, whose life was cut short by cancer in 2002.\nRumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World airs Monday on PBS\u2019s Independent Lens at 10 p.m."}

Now that we can see it all in black and white \u2014 mostly black, as they are heavily redacted \u2014 it is crystal clear that the Steele dossier, an unverified Clinton-campaign product, was the driving force behind the Trump\u2013Russia investigation.\nBased on the dossier, the FBI told the FISA court it believed that Carter Page, who had been identified by the Trump campaign as an adviser, was coordinating with the Russian government in an espionage conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\nThe FBI has reviewed this verified application for accuracy in accordance with its April 5, 2001 procedures, which include sending a copy of the draft to the appropriate field office(s).\nIn reality, the applications were never verified for accuracy.\nConsider this: The representation that the FBI\u2019s verification procedures include sending the application to \u201cappropriate field offices\u201d is standard in FISA warrant applications. It is done because the FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG) mandates that the bureau \u201censure that information appearing in a FISA application that is presented to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court] has been thoroughly vetted and confirmed.\u201d (See House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes March 1, 2018, letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, embedded here.) The point is to assure the court that the FBI has corroborated the allegations in the warrant application in the usual way.\nA hypothetical shows how this works. Let\u2019s say that X, an informant, tells the FBI in Washington that Y, a person in St. Louis, told him that Z, the suspect, is plotting to rob the bank.\nX\u2019s story is unverified; he doesn\u2019t know anything firsthand about Z \u2014 he only knows what Y has told him. Obviously, then, the FBI does not instantly run to court and seek a warrant against Z. Instead, the bureau sends an investigative \u201clead\u201d from headquarters in Washington to the FBI field office in St. Louis. FBI agents in St. Louis then go find and interview Y. Based on that interview, the FBI gathers supporting information (perhaps physical surveillance of Z, scrutiny of available documents and records about Z, etc.). Only then, after debriefing the witness with competent knowledge, do the Justice Department and FBI seek a warrant against Z from the court. In the application, they explain to the judge that they have verified X\u2019s information by interviewing Y and then corroborating Y\u2019s version of events. In fact, if they get solid enough information about Z from Y, there may be no reason even to mention X, whose tip to the FBI was sheer hearsay.\nBut that is not what happened with the Carter Page FISA warrants.\nWere the allegations thoroughly vetted and confirmed by proof independent of Steele before being presented to the FISA court? No, they were not.\nThe FBI presented the court with allegations posited by Steele. He is in the position of X in our hypothetical. He is not the source of any of the relevant information on which the court was asked to rely for its probable-cause finding that Page was a clandestine agent of Russia. In this context, source means a reliable witness who saw or heard some occurrence"}

But a Chinese designer who goes by the name of ZJ-DDG unveiled a new concept design for a dive mask that has the potential to be a real game-changer, bringing a host of interesting technologies that could alter the way underwater exploration and adventure takes place.\nThe first major change that the the D-Mask brings to the table is that it does away with traditional scuba mask design in favor of something much larger. Rather than just covering the eyes and nose, this model actually envelopes the entire face, securing itself above the forehead and below the mouth. This results in a 180-degree field of view, which is much broader than what divers get from a traditional mask. It also reportedly provides a more comfortable fit due to the increased number of points of contact with the wearer\u2019s face. In theory, it should also make it easier to breathe as well since a snorkel or regulator isn\u2019t in the diver\u2019s mouth, but is instead attached to a port on the side of the mask itself.\nThe large glass lens does a lot more than just provide an expanded view, it can also serve as a projection point for a built-in head-up display. Divers could have information like current depth, location, remaining oxygen levels, water temperature, and other data displayed right on the inside of the mask, making it easier to keep track of those variables.\nOther intriguing features include bone-conducting audio for listening to music and two-way communications with other divers or the dive boat on the surface. The D-Mask also comes with built-in LED lighting to help illuminate the deep, as well as a digital camera for capturing all of the underwater action. A companion mobile app for a smartphone would allow for the creation of playlists and sharing photos and videos to social media outlets.\nSince this is still just a concept, there is no telling when or if it would actually be made into a real product. ZJ-DDG has admitted that there are a few hurdles to overcome, including how to keep the interior of the face shield from fogging up. Still, if this could go into production it would surely create a lot of interest in the diving community."}

New roads also pave the way to further exploitation by humans, such as poaching or mining, and new infrastructure.\nAn international team of researchers analysed open-access maps of 36m km of road and found that over half of the 600,000 fragments of land in between roads are very small \u2013 less than 1km2.\nA mere 7% are bigger than 100km2, equivalent to a square area just 10km by 10km. Furthermore, only a third of the roadless areas were truly wild, with the rest affected by farming or people.\nThe last remaining large roadless areas are rainforests in the Amazon and Indonesia and the tundra and forests in the north of Russia and Canada. Virtually all of western Europe, the eastern US and Japan have no areas at all that are unaffected by roads. The scientists considered that land up to a kilometre on each side of a road was affected, which they believe is a conservative estimate.\nThe length of the world\u2019s roads is projected to increase by more than 60% by 2050, say the researchers, but only about 5% of the roadless areas currently have any legal protection, according to the new work published in the journal Science.\nThe natural world is in the midst of a mass extinction as wild places are destroyed by conversion to farmland, mining and pollution, and animals are hunted in huge numbers. In October, a major analysis found the number of wild creatures was on track to fall by two-thirds by 2020, compared to 1970.\nRoads are the catalyst for much of the destruction by, for example, giving illegal loggers access into the Amazon or poachers access to wild animals. But Ibisch said the road maps the team used, though the best available, were certain to be incomplete and that the true situation was even worse, for example in Borneo where many oil palm plantation roads have yet to be mapped.\nIbisch also said international attempts to protect the environment often ignored the importance of the last remaining roadless areas. \u201cIt is astonishing to see they have not taken into account roadless areas,\u201d he said."}

Now researchers say they have found evidence to back this up and discovered further benefits to boot.\n\u201cRocking in people that do not have any sleep problems can still improve sleep quality, and the beneficial effects of sleep on \u2013 for instance \u2013 memory also seem to be enhanced,\u201d said Dr Paul Franken, a co-author of the research, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.\nWriting in the journal Current Biology, he and colleagues in Lausanne and Geneva reveal that 18 young participants without sleep problems spent three nights in a laboratory: one night getting used to the environment, one night being monitored while sleeping in a stationary bed and one night being monitored with the bed gently rocking from side to side.\nParticipants were asked to learn pairs of unrelated French words and were then tested on their ability to recall these pairs both before and after each of the test nights. Brain waves of the participants were monitored as they slept using EEG, and other metrics such as heart rate were also recorded.\nThe brain wave data revealed that a gentle rocking did not affect the overall time participants spent asleep but did shorten their transition to \u201creal\u201d sleep.\nParticipants spent longer in \u201cdeep sleep\u201d\u2013 known technically as stage three non\u2013rapid eye movement sleep \u2013 and experienced fewer disruptions to this sleep when rocked. The team say this might be linked to the finding that rocking changed the number and timing of particular patterns of brainwaves that occurred during this phase of sleep. These patterns are also related to consolidating memories, they add.\nIndeed, when the team looked at how well participants fared on the memory test, they found that those who had been rocked as they slept made fewer mistakes and got more pairings correct than those who had slept on a stationary bed.\nFurther experiments carried out in mice and published in a separate study shed light on how rocking might help with sleep. The team found that the mice fell asleep faster and crammed more periods of sleep into their hours of rest when they were rocked.

The authors say this supports the theory that this system is part of the mechanism by which rocking affects sleep.

{"idx": "13591", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Having a high debt-to-income ratio doesn't have to keep you from saving dollars by refinancing.\nPeople with a high debt-to-income ratio are more likely to run into trouble making their monthly payments and might have difficulty getting approved for a loan. Fortunately, it's possible to tame your ratio by paying down and restructuring your debts, and some refinance programs are more forgiving than others for applicants carrying higher debt loads.\nLenders look at two types of debt-to-income ratios when you apply for a loan. The front-end ratio measures what percentage of your monthly income would go toward the monthly mortgage payment, mortgage insurance, property taxes and other housing expenses such as homeowners association fees. The back-end ratio weighs your monthly income against all your monthly debt obligations. This includes car loans, student loans and credit cards as well as your housing costs. Suppose you earn a monthly income of $8,000. Your housing expenses are $2,000 per month, and your other debts come to $1,000. In this example, your front-end DTI is 25 percent and your back-end DTI is 37.5 percent, commonly expressed as 25/37.5.\nGenerally, the more lenient back-end ratios are available to homeowners with strong compensating factors such as high credit scores and a significant amount of equity in their homes. With an FHA mortgage, for example, you'll need a credit score above 580 and savings equal to at least three monthly mortgage payments to qualify with a 50 percent DTI.\nThe quickest way to reduce your DTI is to pay down your monthly debt, such as credit card balances. It's also possible to reduce your ratios by extending or restructuring your longer-term debt. For example, extending a student loan over a longer term will reduce your monthly payments, and transferring a high credit card balance to a new card with a lower introductory rate can lower your payments for just long enough for you to qualify for a home loan.\nIf you already have an FHA mortgage and your account is in good standing, you could refinance to a lower rate using the FHA's streamline program. Since you already qualified when you first took out your FHA loan, the FHA doesn't require you to qualify again. This means there's no income verification and no paperwork to show your debt-to-income ratio, so it doesn't matter if your ratio has risen since you closed your current loan. For military homeowners, the VA offers a similar streamline program known as the Interest Rate Reduction Loan.\nA nonconforming loan is simply a loan that does not conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines, usually because the borrower has an imperfect credit history, a lack of job stability, self-employment status or a high debt-to-income ratio. While riskier than conforming loans, nonconforming loans allow homeowners who might not otherwise qualify to refinance their homes. A nonconforming loan usually comes with a higher interest rate and higher fees, so if you're considering this option, it's worth shopping around for the best rates.\nZillow: What Is Debt to Income Ratio?\nThompson, Jayne. \"How to Refinance a Home With a High Debt-to-Income Ratio.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/refinance-home-high-debt-to-income-ratio-2106.html."}

The challenge was figuring out how to go about it.\nTrent Security Systems Ltd., which Mr. Wormald founded and owned, had 23 employees, many of whom had been with the company for years. While it had, and continues to enjoy, a strong reputation in the Peterborough area, Mr. Wormald simply figured it was time to do something else.\n\"I had seen too many people die early and not enjoy the fruits of their labours,\" says Mr. Wormald, now 65, who sold the company two years ago. \"I decided it was time.\"\nHe also decided that he would need help in preparing, marketing and selling his company.\n\"The electronic security industry is unique. We monitor alarms, have 24-hour staff and collect revenues on a recurring basis. It takes someone in the industry to understand or get the value of a security company, so I was sure I needed to sell to someone who was in the business already,\" Mr. Wormald says.\nEnter Victor Harding. Since 2009 his Toronto-based company, Harding Security Services Inc., has specialized in brokering the sales of security firms. He markets his services mostly through home-security-industry conferences and trade publications.\nThe security alarm businesses that Mr. Harding works with are usually worth between $500,000 and $5-million. He ended up brokering the sale of Mr. Wormald's firm to API Alarm Inc., which does business in Canada and the United States.\nAPI met Mr. Wormald's conditions \u2013 that, after the sale, the Trent Security name would remain in Peterborough and that most, if not all, of his employees would remain with the company.\n\"They took the staff on at their existing salaries.

Peterborough is a small town and you run into your [former] customers and neighbours all the time.\"\nA sale of a specialized company to another firm in the same sector might sound straightforward, but that's not necessarily so, Mr. Harding says.\n\"Being a business broker or intermediary is not for the weak-minded.

They might not know how to go about it, however.\nThe challenges he addresses as a broker include the fact that sellers \"are often too close to the business to negotiate properly,\" he says. \"Most owners don't know what their business is really worth.\"\nThey also don't understand the sales process. \"They don't know how to present their business to potential buyers.

But what if you are nearing or in retirement and no longer have those concerns? The one big final expense in your future is the cost of your burial. Have you set aside the funds for your family to cover the actual cost of your death?\nA new InsuranceQuotes.com report breaks down the basics of funeral insurance, offering crucial information and advice for consumers. Laura Adams, senior insurance analyst at InsuranceQuotes.com discussed with FOX Business what you need to know if you are looking for insurance to cover your final expense: your death.\nBoomer: What is funeral insurance and what are the different options?\nAdams: Funeral insurance is also known as burial insurance, pre-funded burial, and final expense insurance. It pays the cost of your final arrangements after death, such as a burial or cremation. It\u2019s a type of life insurance that covers various funeral expenses so you don\u2019t leave that financial obligation to your family or friends. It helps make a difficult time a little easier for those responsible for your funeral.\nYou name a beneficiary, such as a loved one or funeral home, who will receive your policy payout after your death. Another option is to enter into a preneed agreement with a funeral service provider, which allows you to pay a set amount over time in advance of your final arrangements.\nChris Pratt-Anna Faris split: Prenups not just for rich and famous?\nBoomer: Who makes a good candidate for a funeral policy and who doesn\u2019t?\nAdams: Funeral insurance is designed for anyone who doesn\u2019t have money set aside to pay for their final expenses. Most people don\u2019t realize how expensive funeral arrangements can be.\nThe average cost of a typical funeral in 2017 is between $7,000 and $10,000. That doesn\u2019t even include a burial plot or headstone. Cremation is less expensive, but still costs more than $6,000 on average, according to the National Funeral Directors Association.\nWhile term or permanent life insurance policies are often used to pay funeral expenses, you may not qualify based on your health status or age. Unlike life insurance, with a funeral policy you can be approved without a medical exam or having to answer health questions. Also, you can buy funeral insurance in smaller amounts than with a typical life policy, such as $5,000 or $10,000.\nBoomer: What are the average costs of a funeral policy and what does it cover?\nAdams: The cost of funeral insurance varies depending on the amount of coverage you choose and your age. It covers every expense related to your final arrangements, up to the policy limit. In general, a funeral policy is more expensive than a term life insurance policy. So, it\u2019s a good idea to shop both types of policies and compare quotes before making a decision."}

{"idx": "13616", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In the 1980s, a nationwide reform movement sprang up in opposition to \u201ctracking,\u201d the controversial practice of schools grouping students by ability and organizing curriculum by level of difficulty. Officials in two states, Massachusetts and California, adopted policies urging middle schools to reduce or abandon tracking. In this book, Tom Loveless describes how schools reacted to these recommendations and discusses why some schools went along with detracking while others bitterly resisted the reform. Loveless explains that the state policies were adopted without strict mandates, financial incentives, legal threats, or new bureaucratic structures. They were also adopted without convincing evidence that detracking brings lasting benefits to students. But advocates framed tracking reform as a policy supporting greater educational equity. In response, urban schools, low-achieving schools, and schools serving disadvantaged children have reacted sympathetically to the reform. Suburban schools, high-achieving schools, and schools serving wealthier families have been less willing to detrack. Drawing on extensive survey and case study data, Loveless concludes that this reform\u2019s fate is in the hands of local decisionmakers. Schools formulate tracking policy based on their own institutional, organizational, political, and technical considerations. All school reform entails risks. One troubling implication of this study is that the risks of detracking are being assumed by schools with some of society\u2019s most vulnerable youngsters."}

By moving the ramp where traffic connects with U.S. 59, officials hope to eliminate some of the conflicts closer to the interchange. The move, however, will mean drivers who enter at Scott will not have access to U.S. 59. Cullen Boulevard will get a new ramp to U.S. 59.\nImprovements to a major downtown Houston freeway interchange are back on track following delays, though the planned rebuild of the northbound Interstate 45 connection with Interstate 69 will take years.\nOfficials on Wednesday opened bids on the project at I-45 and I-69, also U.S. 59 in the Houston area, that will move the ramps from northbound I-45 onto Spur 5, which now funnels traffic from the freeway into downtown. Construction is expected to start by mid-year but likely won't be finished until 2020.\nThe change eliminates a major choke point officials have complained about for years because the freeway connections cause an immense amount of weaving by drivers. The connections to I-69 are close to the crossing of the freeways, and drivers often enter northbound I-45 near Scott Street and aggressively merge left to make it to the ramps.\nBy moving the connection back, traffic will flow more smoothly through the interchange, though it eliminates the option of getting to I-69 from Scott, near the University of Houston campus. In November, during an event noting upcoming freeway improvements around the state, Quincy Allen, director of the Houston office of the Texas Department of Transportation, said the interchange of I-45 and I-69 is among the most effective types of improvements officials can make in heavily developed parts of the region.\nThe project, however, has faced obstacles, first awaiting funding after it was first proposed in 2009 and then languishing as the company picked to do the job, Tradeco, defaulted on all its state road projects in mid-2015. Months of back-and-forth delayed rebidding the project, and in December a technical glitch with TxDOT\u2019s bid process pushed opening the estimates to Wednesday.\nWilliams Brothers Construction, one of the region\u2019s largest road builders and the company building most of the ongoing U.S. 290 highway project, was the apparent low bidder, offering $30.5 million.

The move, some critics say, could open the door for other troubled pension plans to follow suit.\nThe financially strapped Iron Workers Local 17 Pension fund proposed a plan for extending its lifespan by reducing benefits for workers and retirees. Now that the plan has received final approval, roughly half of the 2,000 participants will see their pension benefits shrink on Feb. 1. Benefits will be cut by 20 percent on average, but some retirees are expecting their monthly payments to be slashed by as much as 60 percent.\nThe unprecedented move comes after a 2014 law made it possible for troubled pension plans to reduce benefits to retirees if it would improve the financial health of the fund. The legislation dealt a major blow to federal protections that for nearly 40 years guarded the financial promises made to retirees.\nThe announcement stunned some former ironworkers, many of whom said they sacrificed time with family and other opportunities so that they could earn a secure income stream in retirement. Joe Finley, 63, said he regularly worked 12 hours a day and took weekend shifts so that he could earn more credits for his pension. Now, his monthly check is set to be reduced to $1,900, from the roughly $3,500 he was previously receiving. The lost income is about equal to his monthly mortgage payment, causing Finley to worry that he may have to put his three-bedroom home on the market.\nThe fund\u2019s proposal was first green-lighted by the Treasury Department late last year before being put up for a vote by members this month.\nThe impact will vary based on the individual\u2019s work status and age. About half of the participants are not going to see any cuts at all because of their age or a disability. Others will see minor reductions. But more than 300 participants will see their checks cut by between 30 and 60 percent. Some people who took advantage of an early retirement option are among those facing the steepest cuts.\nSome critics say the divide in outcomes may have ultimately pinned workers, who could have felt they were choosing between a smaller pension and no pension at all, against retirees who feel they have few options for making up the lost pay.\nMore than half of the 1,938 people eligible to vote did not cast a vote. About 16 percent, or 300, voted against the cuts. Another 600 members voted in favor of the changes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sort of sitting here staring off in the distance,\u201d said Larry Burruel, 68, who is expecting his pension check to be cut in half. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make a lot of cuts,\u201d said Burruel, who is worried he and his wife will struggle to afford their medical bills with the smaller paycheck.\nThe leaders of the ironworkers fund said making cuts now could prevent the need for more dramatic reductions in the future. Without changes, the ironworkers fund was on pace to run out of cash by 2024. At that point, the plan would have had to rely on the federal insurance program meant to protect multiemployer plans. But that program is also facing steep shortfalls and is on track to run out of money by 2025.\n\u201cThe suspension plan, while reducing their pensions now, is a better alternative than letting the pension fund become insolvent,\u201d the trustees of the fund said in a statement.\nThe ironworkers make up only a small"}

It will not be open over the weekend due to budget shortfalls.\nNearly 100 women packed into the Chez Doris drop-in centre on Friday morning for a Thanksgiving feast, laughing and chatting as they filled their bellies with turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie.\nFor some, it may be the last bite of food they see for days.\nThe day centre, which opened in 1977 and caters exclusively to disadvantaged women, was forced to start closing down on weekends this summer because of an overall budget shortfall of around $150,000 per year. With Monday being a holiday, Chez Doris\u2019s door will only be unlocked again on Tuesday morning, so between now and then, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where some of the clients will go.\nAnd the weather is only getting colder.\nThe women who have their own apartments will undoubtedly be lonely over the next few days as families across Montreal gather to break bread and give thanks, but Boulos-Winton said she is most concerned for the clients who have no roof over their heads.\nThere are other meal programs in the city over the weekends, Boulos-Winton explained, but they are mainly located in the east end and the women have a hard time accessing them. There are also no weekend drop-in centres where people can spend the long hours between breakfast, lunch and dinner. Shelters that cater to both sexes are not always the best option for women, she noted, because some aren\u2019t comfortable eating or socializing among men.\nAlejandra Robert, 41, has been coming to Chez Doris since 2008. Once a successful real estate broker and busy mother of three, she suffered serious injuries in a car accident in the mid-2000s \u2014 and her life quickly began to unravel.

She still comes to the centre on a daily basis for additional support, and her story is far from unique.\nThe drop-in program welcomes up to 100 women each day that it operates. They are never questioned, and they are never turned away.\nChez Doris is carrying around $50,000 in debt as it struggles to maintain its existing services, which include hot showers, beds for daytime naps, medical care, counselling, clothing, cooking classes and computer training. The city of Montreal helps to keep the facility up and running to the tune of $30,000 per year, but according to Boulos-Winton, that amount has remained unchanged for over a decade while demand has only increased. At the moment, she said, what Chez Doris needs most is a major financial boost and some new volunteers willing to lend a hand as the temperature drops."}

Sound like a horror movie? Well, at one point several years ago, government doctors were getting up to 20 calls a day from people saying they had such symptoms.\nMany of these people were in California and one of that state's U.S. senators, Dianne Feinstein, asked for a scientific study. In 2008, federal health officials began to study people saying they were affected by this freakish condition called Morgellons.\nThe study cost nearly $600,000. Its long-awaited results, released Wednesday, conclude that Morgellons exists only in the patients' minds.\n\"We found no infectious cause,\" said Mark Eberhard, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who was part of the 15-member study team.\nThe study appears in PLoS One, one of the Public Library of Science journals.\nSufferers of Morgellons (mor-GELL-uns) describe a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, erupting sores, crawling sensations on their skin and \u2014 perhaps worst of all \u2014 mysterious red, blue or black fibers that sprout from their skin. Some say they've suffered for decades, but the syndrome wasn't named until 2002, when \"Morgellons\" was chosen from a 1674 medical paper describing similar symptoms.\nAfflicted patients have documented their suffering on websites and many have vainly searched for a doctor who believed them. Some doctors believe the condition is a form of delusional parasitosis, a psychosis in which people believe they are infected with parasites.\nLast May, Mayo Clinic researchers published a study of 108 Morgellons patients and found none of them suffered from any unusual physical ailment. The study concluded that the sores on many of them were caused by their own scratching and picking at their skin.\nThe CDC study was meant to be broader, starting with a large population and then went looking for cases within the group. The intent was to give scientists a better idea of how common Morgellons actually is.\nThey focused on more than 3 million people who lived in 13 counties in Northern California, a location chosen in part because all had health insurance through Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, which had a research arm that could assist in the project. Also, many of the anecdotal reports of Morgellons came from the area.\nCulling through Kaiser patient records from July 2006 through June 2008, the team found \u2014 and was able to reach \u2014 115 who had what sounded like Morgellons. Most were middle-aged white women. They were not clustered in any one spot.\nThat led to the finding that Morgellons occurred in roughly 4 out of every 100,000 Kaiser enrollees. \"So it's rare,\" Eberhard said.\nRoughly 100 agreed to at least answer survey questions, and about 40 consented to a battery of physical and psychological tests that stretched over several days.\nBlood and urine"}

Then, compare it to carrier insurance and alternatives like Squaretrade. If you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cIs Samsung Premium Care worth it?\u201d or \u201cshould I get smartphone insurance?\u201d the answer is yes.\nIf you\u2019re looking for damage or accident insurance for your Galaxy phone we\u2019ve done the hard work for you. Below we\u2019ll briefly explain the benefits of Premium Care then compare it to the competition.\nEvery new Galaxy phone comes with one month of Premium Care for free. However, once that ends it automatically cancels unless you agree to pay $11.99 a month for protection. It\u2019s like insurance but has a whole lot more to offer. Originally, your phone has a standard limited 1-year warranty. Samsung Premium Care extends that to 2-years and gives you tons of additional benefits.\nPremium Care comes with same-day screen repairs, hand-delivered replacements in some cases, not to mention a low deductible and at home tech support visits. Basically covering any and all situations. In my opinion, Premium Care is totally worth it.\nWhen it comes to buying smartphone insurance or an extended warranty there are multiple things you\u2019ll want to consider. Some of those include how many replacement devices can you get per year, does the plan cover loss or theft, and remember to pay close attention to the deductible.\nAs you can see above Samsung\u2019s Premium Care is one of the most affordable. While almost every insurance plan costs nearly the same each month, the deductible can vary substantially. That\u2019s how much you have to spend (out of pocket) to actually get a replacement.\nIf you shatter the screen on your Galaxy Note 9 and have Premium Care you\u2019ll spend $12 that month to have insurance, and then only $99 to get your phone replaced in less than one day. That\u2019s $111 to get your phone back up and running in just a few hours.\nKeep in mind that not every city has same-day repairs. And if they don\u2019t, Samsung will overnight deliver your replacement. So you only have to deal with a cracked screen or no phone for about a day, at the most.\nHowever, that same screen replacement has a $275 deductible at carriers like T-Mobile and around $200 with AT&T or Sprint. Plus, with carriers, you mail your phone away and wait for a replacement, which no one wants to do. Our phones are an invaluable tool we don\u2019t want to go without for 3-4 days, if not longer.\nThat said, carriers offer replacements for loss or theft. So if you break your phone Samsung\u2019s Premium Care is affordable, but if you lose it, insurance is a better option.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that SquareTrade is a pretty good option too. It\u2019s cheap, has an affordable $99 out of pocket price, although they only allow one replacement per year. If you have a lot of accidents, we recommend Samsung Premium Care.\nI recently shattered my Galaxy S9+ on a Monday morning while running at the park. It fell out of my pocket at full speed, somehow, and was toast. Sadness. Luckily, I have Samsung Premium Care, and the company quickly took care of the problem and I got a new phone delivered by Tuesday afternoon. Seriously,"}

Find out why.\nStocks overall suffered from another case of the Monday blues this week, and major market benchmarks fell between 1% and 2% after recovering from what had been much steeper losses earlier in the day. The usual suspects of unstable energy prices and concerns about the global economy caused international stock markets to fall before Wall Street opened Monday morning, and further downward pressure after the open pushed many stocks down hard. Yet a few bright spots still shined through, and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Goldcorp (NYSE:GG), and Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR) managed to climb significantly on Monday.\nGoPro rose more than 10% in the wake of an announcement late Friday of a licensing deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The arrangement has to do with file storage intellectual property, and Microsoft said that its agreement with GoPro \"shows the incredible breadth of technology sharing enabled through patent transactions.\"\nNeither company released specific terms of the deal, but GoPro clearly has an interest in making sure that its wearable technology offerings have state-of-the-art capabilities, and Microsoft hopes to \"partner with companies from all industries to optimize solutions for their customers around the globe.\" Given how far GoPro shares have fallen, the agreement at least represents a vote of confidence from Microsoft that the camera maker is worth taking on as a partner.\nGoldcorp jumped 7% on a good day for gold miners, generally. Gold prices jumped more than $16 per ounce, briefly climbing over the $1,200 mark for the first time since the middle of 2015. Uncertainty in the financial markets has pushed investors back toward precious metals as a safe haven, and weakness in the U.S. dollar against key currencies such as the euro and the Japanese yen has finally reversed the prevailing trends in the foreign exchange markets for the first time in more than a year. If the dollar keeps weakening, then gold could continue its climb, and that would be good news not just for Goldcorp, but also for the mining industry, generally.\nFinally, Outerwall gained 11%, climbing back partially from its 17% plunge on Friday. The company behind Redbox video kiosks and Coinstar coin-exchange machines reported fourth-quarter results late last week that disappointed investors. But reports this morning indicated that Outerwall was the target of activist investor activity from Glenn Welling's Engaged Capital, which wants the Redbox and Coinstar operator to make its business more attractive to potential private equity investors.\nPossible measures could include boosting its dividend, cutting various costs, and making efforts to expand existing initiatives to grow more extensively. Outerwall has had activist investors take interest in the company before, but shareholders might be ready to be more cooperative after the losses that Outerwall shares have suffered during the past six months."}

The source accused the Foreign Ministry of trying to \"spin\" Israeli journalists into writing incorrectly that Annan ruled out the return of Palestinian refugees to the final borders of Israel in the speech. In the sentence in question, according to the official UN press office, Annan called for \"a solution that respects the rights of Palestinian refugees and is consistent with the two-state solution and with the character of the states in the region.\" Israel's largest circulation newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, ran a story on the speech with the headline \"The refugees will only return to a Palestinian state.\" Ha'aretz ran the story but also inserted the word 'only' in the quote. \"The two-state solution - Israel and Palestine - must respect the rights of the Palestinian refugees, but only within the context of preserving the character of states in the region,\" Annan said, according to Ha'aretz. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's spokesperson Ido Aharoni responded to the UN source's protest by saying that \"the words speak for themselves\" The Foreign Ministry interpreted Annan's quote as an endorsement of US President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004 letter to former prime minister Ariel Sharon in which Bush wrote that \"a solution to the Palestinian refugee issue as part of any final status agreement will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state, and the settling of Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel.\" Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Livni have both emphasized in meetings with foreign leaders that the so-called right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel must be abandoned to preserve the Jewish character of Israel. Foreign Ministry officials were also pleased with a line in Annan's speech in which he appeared to criticize supporters of the Palestinians for misusing the UN to attack Israel. \"Some may feel satisfaction at repeatedly passing General Assembly resolutions or holding conferences that condemn Israel's behavior,\" Annan said. \"But one should also ask whether such steps bring any tangible relief or benefit to the Palestinians. There have been decades of resolutions. There has been a proliferation of special committees, sessions and Secretariat divisions and units. Has any of this had an effect on Israel's policies, other than to strengthen the belief in Israel, and among many of its supporters, that this great organization is too one-sided to be allowed a significant role in the Middle East peace process?\""}

He says:But if there is plenty of innovation at the edges, the core still seems fairly static.\nBut if there is plenty of innovation at the edges, the core still seems fairly static. The lightbulb still has not gone on that if on-demand functionality can be delivered for sub-$100 a user a month, is little justification for on-premise price points to be 10, 15, 20x that. That if Apple and Google and amazon can build mobile ecosystems of hundreds of thousands of applications and games with a cottage industry of entrepreneurs, SAP cannot continue to magically expect its current SI and outsourcing partners to match that speed or those price points. If small teams can build fairly ambitious HANA applications part-time in a matter of days, SAP\u2019s and its partner\u2019s project time scales need to be similarly compressed. if on-demand benchmarks are showing frequent upgrades and importantly instant propagation throughout the customer base, SAP cannot afford to have old-school and grudging multi-year customer base migrations at the core.\nVinnie's views have already been anticipated by SAP. He could not schedule time to meet Hasso Plattner, co-founder SAP or Vishal Sikka, board member in charge of innovation. They confirmed my earlier assertion that SAP needs to bring new business models to their understanding of the cloud.\nDuring the Wednesday morning keynote, Dr Sikka affirmed what some of us thought might be announced only in a slightly different fashion. It announced that SAP is moving HANA into the cloud in a partnership with Dell-Intel. HANA is the foundation upon which SAP plans to deliver all applications in the future. Including large parts of the core. This is not a trivial matter.\nSAP has already demonstrated All-in-One running in the cloud so there is clear precedent for an OLTP system operating in this manner. When we met with Dr. Plattner, I reminded him that a year or so ago he said that he wasn't sure (at best) whether the Business Suite could be moved to the cloud. Today he is certain but with the caveat that the timing is unclear and benefits today might be elusive. \"The Business Suite was not written for massive parallelization but with HANA it may be possible to shrink the suite. - possibly up to 90%.\" Even then there has to be a re-write: \"I don't want 20 years of ABAP carried forward into new technology. It's just not feasible to...deliver breakthrough performance and cost savings,\" said Dr. Plattner. In that one statement, Dr Plattner is reiterating what he has said in different ways over the last few years - do not customize at the core ERP level.\nDr Sikka said that highly customised systems will not see huge value - at least in the mid term. Dr Plattner said that the notion of upgrades has to be squashed. \"I get this question a lot and I say the same - you have to think differently. The old ways of doing things are gone.\"\nThis leads to the question of data center ownership. SAP sold its hosting business a couple of years ago. At the time, we were highly critical of such a move. It has become abundantly clear that if you are going to play at enterprise scale, you have to own your own infrastructure. SAP plans to join that small and exclusive club. \"Two years ago we spent about \u20ac1 million, last year it was \u20ac7 million,\" said Dr Sikka."}

But those respondents also said the budget should be balanced at the expense of the Pentagon, and not cuts to social safety net programs.\nIn the poll, 49 percent of the public said they would support military-spending cuts, compared to just 23 percent who said the same about Social Security and Medicare.

Nationwide, the American Society of Dowsers, Inc. boasts dozens of local chapters, which meet annually at a conference.\n\"It's kind of bizarre.

But a New York Times piece Friday concluded that the exotic loan finally inked in the spring of 2008 to fully fund the pension quickly \u201cwent awry\u201d in the global economic meltdown later that year.\nWith the primary election just days away, the negative attention focused on DPS, and Bennet, couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for the Colorado senator. His opponents\u2019 supporters quickly made hay of the Times piece, waving banners on downtown streets encouraging motorists to read it.\nThe Times\u2019 Gretchen Morgenson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning business journalist who has been working for months on this subject, says DPS already has paid $25 million more in interest and fees than it had expected when it closed the loan package in 2008, and could be stuck with costlier-than-expected payments for years if markets don\u2019t improve.\nMorgenson makes a compelling case that Bennet and current superintendent Tom Boasberg may have made a mistake when they signed off on the risky loan, but we\u2019re not ready to concede that yet. For months now, DPS officials have argued that the loan package worked, and that the district is in fact saving millions that it would have lost if the district had kept to the status quo.\nBoasberg claims that savings the district has realized already have been used to hire more teachers at a time when some districts are cutting faculty.\nWe also think, contrary to the view held by his political opponents, that Bennet approached the transaction with the best of intentions and in good faith.\nBennet\u2019s campaign \u2014 and, separately, DPS officials \u2014 scrambled yesterday to challenge Morgenson\u2019s reporting. Boasberg, who served as chief financial officer under Bennet while structuring the debt, sent a list of errors to The Times that he believes invalidate its story.\nIt is easy to second-guess deals that were made prior to the meltdown as being shortsighted or overly risky. Some Romanoff supporters are using the report to argue that Bennet structured the loan the way that he did to curry favor with Wall Street executives who now contribute to his political campaign.\nThe claim is a baseless smear.\nIn the end, the debt deal may not prove to be effective, but there\u2019s no shred of evidence that Bennet, way back in 2007, was offered any quid pro quo from financiers while assembling the loans."}

Any reading below 50 shows that activity is contracting. The December figure was the lowest since February 2016 and the first drop since July 2016.\nIn the quarter that ended in September, China's economic growth sank to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent compared with a year earlier. The slowdown occurred despite government efforts to stem the downturn by ordering banks to lend more and by boosting spending on public works construction.\nForecasters expect annual growth of about 6.5 percent, down slightly from 2017's 6.7 percent. But some industry segments, including auto and real estate sales, have suffered more serious declines.\n\"Downward pressure on the economy is still large,\" economist Zhang Liqun said in a statement issued with the PMI.\nOverall orders and exports both contracted, indicating that Chinese factories are suffering from weak demand at home and abroad. Exports to the United States kept growing at double-digit monthly rates through late 2018 despite President Donald Trump's punitive tariffs. But growth in exports to the rest of the world fell sharply in November and forecasters expect American demand to weaken in early 2019.\nThat adds to complications for Chinese leaders who are trying to reverse a broad economic slowdown and avert politically dangerous job losses.\nChinese and U.S. envoys are due to meet in early January for negotiations that are intended to resolve their economically threatening trade war. Over the weekend, Trump sounded an optimistic note, tweeting that he had spoken with President Xi Jinping by phone.\n\"Deal is moving along very well,\" Trump tweeted. \"If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute.

Hawk-woods new 48V-RP is one of the first power solutions which enables users to run high voltage LEDs at 100% light output via a DC input.\n\u201cThe new 48V-RP power station is an incredible breakthrough that provides ultimate flexibility to content creators. This is one of the first portable power solution that can run high voltage LEDs at 100%. Standard manufacturers 22-36V DC inputs simply cannot do what the new 48V-RP can,\u201d explains Jason Stewart from Hawk-woods.\nThe 4-way 48V-RP power station uses Hawk-woods Reel Power batteries, 26V batteries designed to power high power draw cameras and regularly used by ARRI Rentals for modern ARRI film cameras.\nWhy 26V batteries? The choice to use 26V Reel Power batteries over 14.4V batteries was made to increase reliability and prolong the batteries life cycle. 14.4V batteries use a higher current than a 26V battery at twice the voltage (half the current a 14.4V produces). This means that electronics run cooler at 48V, and batteries are under less stress, therefore, prolonging the life cycle of the batteries cells.\nWhile the Reel Power batteries range in capacity from 100wh \u2013 350wh, Hawk-woods recommends the new 48V-RP be used with the RP-200H, RP-250N or the largest RP-350N to provide a maximum of 1400wh to the LED! For example, using the new 48V-RP combined with four Hawk-woods RP-350N\u2019s, a user could power the ARRI SKYPANEL S120-C at 100% light output (430wh) for up to 3 Hours 15 minutes of continuous runtime. Runtime would increase should the user run the light at 50% output.\nThe 48V-RP is exceptionally versatile and can also power 24v lighting.\nFor more information on the 48V-RP and Hawk-woods new products, please visit Hawk-Woods at the Manios Digital booth at NAB 2019 (Booth C9020, Central Hall)."}

Why can\u2019t they end their preoccupation with dodging U.S. missiles in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Gaza long enough to reflect on how we are only trying to save them from terrorists while simultaneously demonstrating our commitment to \u201cjustice and progress\u201d?\nDoes a smart fellow like Obama expect us to believe that all we need to do is \u201ccommunicate clearly to Muslims\u201d that it is al-Qaeda, not the U.S. and its allies, that brings \u201cmisery and death\u201d? Does any informed person not know that the unprovoked U.S.-led invasion of Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and displaced 4.5 million from their homes? How is that for \u201cmisery and death\u201d?\nRather than a failure to communicate, U.S. officials are trying to rewrite recent history, which seems to be much easier to accomplish with the Washington press corps and large segments of the American population than with the Muslim world.

That explains the Florida Council on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, which I sponsored in 2006 as a legislator, and my strong support for public education as a linchpin for a child's overall success.\nThe education facts are painfully clear. In Pinellas County last year, only 28 percent of black students read at grade level, and only 26 percent performed math at grade level. The latest Schott Foundation report is numbing, placing the graduation rate for black males in the county at 28 percent.\nThis is the kind of social crisis that should bring us all together, cause us to roll up our sleeves and pitch in to help. So it is good news that a circuit judge in Tallahassee recently tossed out a constitutional challenge to an education option that is helping 70,000 of Florida's most underprivileged students \u2014 a disproportionate percentage of whom are black.\nThe Florida Tax Credit Scholarship, which is helping 2,621 poor children mostly of color to attend 74 private schools in Pinellas this year, is not a substitute for the kind of great public schools that I have spent my life supporting. But it deserves a seat at the public education table, and let's hope the legal challengers to this program will listen to what the judge has had to say.\nFrom where I sit, this is not a competition, and this scholarship is not an attack on traditional public schools. The truth is that different students learn in different ways, and there is no reason we can't offer them a range of learning options that includes magnet and fundamental schools, online courses, dual enrollment, charter schools \u2014 and even scholarships to private schools for those who can't afford tuition.\nSome of the children I know as a pastor in St. Petersburg suffer from a form of educational despair, and these scholarships also open the door to faith-based schools that help them read and write in part by lifting their spirit. These are community-based schools that know the lives of their children and families, and, together, have built a bond that can translate into academic achievement. Where there is trust and hope, there can be learning.\nThe numbers so far tell that story. This state scholarship program is entering its 14th year this fall, and the students live, on average, in households that are only 5 percent above poverty. Two-thirds are black or Hispanic, more than half live with a single parent, and test scores show they were the lowest performers in the schools they left behind. For six straight years, though, these same students have been achieving the same standardized test score gains in reading and math as students of all incomes across the nation.\nThis is not to suggest the scholarship is some type of educational panacea. It's merely one tool that can help some children who can't otherwise afford it. Modern public education is being strengthened by the choices we empower parents to make, and we should embrace learning wherever it may occur.\nThe judge who dismissed the lawsuit made an important point in doing so. He said no one had proved the scholarship is harmful to public schools. He's right. The scholarship is a partner with public education, and it is just one more commitment we can make to children who desperately need our collective help.\nFrank Peterman Jr. is pastor of the Rock of Jesus Missionary Baptist Church in St. Petersburg and a government relations director.

Mr. Gans, head of the Washington, D.C.-based Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, blames apathy, frustration, and lack of enthusiasm for either of the major presidential candidates for this likely low turnout.\nOthers say that blacks and those of other minorities - who are traditionally underrepresented in the voter ranks - will stay away in droves because they don't believe the presidential aspirants sufficiently represent their views or interests.\nInterestingly, voter turnout in other democratic countries - including Belgium, Australia, Austria, Sweden, and Italy - has topped 90 percent in national elections in the 1980s. It should be pointed out, however, that most of these nations have more or less automatic registration systems.\nRegistration is not the only problem. A recent survey by the Gallop organization shows that voter turnout in the United States in 1980 and 1984 was between 52 and 53 percent; almost 80 percent of those polled had earlier indicated their intention to cast ballots in these elections.\nOne might conclude that somehow the long election campaign dampened the enthusiasm of many who expected to vote. Regardless, there are persuasive reasons why citizens should vote.\nCivic duty. Americans, on the whole, take great pride in the upkeep and welfare of their communities. They maintain neighborhood watches to deter crime; they often join together in housing rehabilitation projects.\nPublic officials have a duty to respond to the needs of those they serve. And their constituents must keep them alert to this mandate.\nVoting is an important way to show awareness of civic problems. Those who cast ballots are more likely to be informed on issues than those who do not.\nPresidential choice. Despite the blur of the campaign, there is a distinct difference between the candidates and the political parties.\nEach approaches the economy, foreign policy, crime, and the environment in a special way.\nCertain issues will tend to push the on-the-fence voter to one side or the other.\nAsk yourself the broader question of how each candidate, if elected, will promote international understanding and domestic stability.\nWeigh experience, defense commitment, devotion to social justice, and fiscal responsibility. Then have confidence in your evaluation - and make a choice at the ballot box.\nLocal and regional concerns. It is important to look beyond the top of the ticket. All US House seats and one-third of those in the Senate face voter confirmation. Candidates for local and state office as well as judicial choices are on most ballots. Initiatives and referendums encompass issues as far ranging as abortion rights, smoking limitations, and tax overrides.\nThese things affect all of us. Voter information booklets explain many of them.\nIt is not too late for the registered voter to become informed - and indicate preferences on election day.\nSupport for the nation. Americans embrace symbols - parades, flags, pledges. These represent patriotic pride in the nation's purpose.\nVoting is also an important indication of national pride. It endorses"}

Those who predicted the imminent demise of Malaysian Airlines in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 last March, and the shooting down of MH17 a little more than three months later, have been proved wrong.\nOne year on, the airline\u2019s immediate financial crisis is drawing to a close, and the company has developed a turnaround plan. In fact, the controlling shareholder now talks of a return to profit by 2017.\nAviation experts say the key now is to follow through on reforms.\nKhazanah Nasional, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, in November unveiled a five-year, $1.8 billion restructure. Key reforms included cutting unprofitable routes, putting in new senior management and slashing what is commonly described as a \u201cbloated workforce\u201d. Six thousand employees are earmarked to go from a workforce of about 19,000.\n\u201cAlthough the tragedies have been devastating for MAS, they are also a catalyst for change,\u201d said Geoff Thomas of Flightratings.com.\nBut saying is one thing; doing is another. According to Maybank aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz, there are few signs yet that Kazanah is following through on the hard decisions. And there may be one simple reason for that: the plunging price of oil.\n\u201cOil prices have just about halved and right now just about every route is making money. The momentum on the need to reform in a great hurry is definitely not there anymore,\u201d said Aziz.\nFinancial losses are also nothing new at the airline. It hasn\u2019t turned a profit since 2008. In the five years to 2013, cumulative losses are close to $1.5 billion, despite earlier attempts at restructuring and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of financial lifelines from the government.\nWhat may be different this time around is that Khazanah has recruited a new CEO with a history of dramatic turnarounds.\nChristoph Mueller comes from the Irish carrier Aer Lingus. He joined the carrier in 2009 when it was struggling in the face of tough competition and leaves it with a strong business model and consistent profits.\n\u201cWill he be able to ram through the sort of changes needed at MAS, or will there have to be a compromise,\u201d Thomas asked.\nFor Aziz, though, any meaningful reform has to include fewer routes.\nGulf carriers including Emirates have taken a big bite out or profitability in many of Malaysia\u2019s long-haul routes to Europe, while low-cost airlines like AirAsia have undermined the airline\u2019s regional strength.\nOne element the airline clearly has in its favor is a wellspring of loyalty at home.\nThe question is, can the airline marry that loyalty with hard-headed business decisions?"}

So, as with the last country and with our black and indigenous brothers who were treated as slaves, and their rights were not recognized, now, today, too, our Mother Earth, she is treated as if she were a thing without life, as if she didn\u2019t have rights.\nThe second climate debt is the use of atmospheric space by the developed countries. It\u2019s not possible that atmospheric space be the exclusive property of just a few countries for their development, that the countries that are irrationally industrialized have taken over, with their greenhouse gases, the atmospheric space. To pay this debt, they should reduce their emissions and absorb their greenhouse gases in a way that there exists a fair distribution of atmospheric space between all of the countries, taking into consideration their population, because the countries that are on the path of development need atmospheric space for their development.\nThe third component of climate debt is the paying of reparations, reparations for damages that have been created by the irrationally industrialized countries. For humanity together, it\u2019s shameful that the Western countries have only offered $10 billion for climate change. I was looking at some figures. The United States \u2014 how much does the United States spend to export terrorism to Afghanistan, to export terrorism to Iraq, and to export military bases to South America? They don\u2019t only spend millions, but billions and trillions. I hope our figures are not wrong. For example, Obama, he asked his Congress for $40 billion more than what has already been spent. The budget of the United States is $687 billion for defense. And for climate change, to save life, to save humanity, they only put up $10 billion. This is shameful. The budget for the Iraq war, according to the figures we have, is $2.6 trillion for the Iraq war, to go kill in Iraq. Trillions of dollars. But directed towards paying the climate debt, $10 billion. This is completely unfair. These are our deep observations of what\u2019s going on.

During a manic episode, symptoms of bipolar might be confused with narcissistic traits, such as a heightened sense of importance or lack of empathy.\nNarcissism is not a symptom of bipolar, and most people with bipolar are not narcissistic. However, some people with bipolar may display narcissistic traits as a result of their other symptoms.\nIn this article, we take a look at the relationship between bipolar disorder and narcissism, including symptoms and treatment.\nWhat are bipolar and narcissism?\nNarcissism is characterized by feelings of grandiosity and self-importance.\nBipolar disorders are mood disorders that cause a person to cycle between extremely high moods, called mania, and in some cases, depression. A person may have bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder.\nA related condition, called cyclothymic disorder, involves cycling between less intense manic and depressive episodes.\nNarcissism is a personality trait that involves feelings of self-importance, grandiosity, and a need for validation. Narcissism can be a behavior that occurs in otherwise psychologically healthy people.\nA person whose personality is characterized by narcissistic tendencies may have narcissistic personality disorder (NPD).\nNPD is part of a group of personality disorders called cluster B disorders. These conditions are characterized by dramatic, emotional, or unpredictable thinking and behavior.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) does not list narcissism as a symptom of bipolar disorder. However, when a person with bipolar experiences an episode of mania, they may display some narcissistic behaviors, such as high levels of confidence, feelings of self-importance, elevated energy levels, and grandiose self-perceptions.\nBecause bipolar and NPD have some similar symptoms, the two conditions can be confused. This can result in people with bipolar being diagnosed with NPD and vice versa.\nDuring periods of depression, a person with a bipolar disorder might also display narcissistic characteristics. For example, a person might neglect caring duties, avoid social contact, or appear insensitive to the needs of others.\nThis might seem to be narcissistic, but it is more likely that the person is so overwhelmed by their own negative emotions that they may not notice others people's feelings.\nTo diagnose someone with a personality disorder such as NPD, a doctor must be sure that another condition cannot better explain their symptoms. So, when narcissistic behavior is due to depression or mania, the DSM-5 argues that it is not appropriate to make a diagnosis of NPD.\nBipolar disorders are mood disorders characterized by extreme high and low moods. Learn more about these conditions here.\nPeople with bipolar disorders experience intense mood swings that last for a period of time. Mania must last at least 7 days or less if the symptoms are so severe that hospitalization is required. To receive a diagnosis for the major depressive episode, a person must exhibit the symptoms of depression for at least 2 weeks.\nA person with bipolar I disorder may only have manic symptoms.\nThese mood swings that people with bipolar experience occur independently of other life circumstances that can cause high and low moods.

He recruited students and told them they\u2019d be participating in a language-learning experiment, but this was just a cover for his true intentions. Instead, Zajonc began by showing them fake \u201cChinese\u201d characters that he claimed signified various adjectives, then continued to display each character to his subjects over and over again, at various frequencies\u2013some as many as 25 times, others just once or not at all. Finally, Zajonc asked each student volunteer to guess how positive or negative the definition of each adjective was (that is, did it represent a \u201cgood\u201d trait or a \u201cbad\u201d trait) and how much they \u201cliked\u201d it.\nZajonc discovered that there was a strong linear relationship between familiarity and not just how positively his subjects interpreted his utterly meaningless characters, but with how much they liked it, too. The more a student saw a given character, the more they preferred it.\nZajonc\u2019s research later became the foundation of the well-documented \u201cmere exposure effect,\u201d whereby the more we\u2019re exposed to something, the better we like it. Which begs an obvious question: Does this apply to people, too? And if so, can mere exposure help our brains unlearn unconscious biases and assumptions\u2013including racist ones?\nResearchers Leslie Zebrowitz and Yi Zhang at Brandeis University set out to answer those questions in a study, and they published those findings in 2012. Their question was simple: What would happen\u2013at the cognitive level\u2013if they showed people faces of individuals of different ethnicities over and over?\nZebrowitz and Zhang decided to focus on the orbitofrontal cortex, which is tied to the reward system of our brains. It drives two different reflexes that help our brains assess a situation before we take action. Specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex\u2019s role is to tell us whether we\u2019re better off approaching or avoiding a person, place, or thing. But it\u2019s made up of a few component parts.\nZhang and Zebrowitz wanted to learn whether repeated exposure would either increase the approach reflex or decrease the avoidance reflex. Or as Zhang put it, \u201cIs it because we start to feel better about those stimuli or is it that we start to feel less bad about them?\u201d The researchers conducted an fMRI study of 16 white men and 16 white women. Each participant was exposed to pictures drawn from a collection of black faces, Korean faces, written Chinese characters (real ones), and random shapes. These pictures were shown different numbers of times to the study participants, with some pictures never shown and others shown many times. Next, the researchers put each participant into the fMRI machine and exposed them to 40 images they\u2019d never seen before and 20 they had. The idea was to see how and where the brain would react.\nWhat the scientists found was that the unfamiliar ones images activated subjects\u2019 avoidance reflex; simply put, people were afraid of the unknown. More than just for faces, this same effect occurred when respondents were exposed to unfamiliar shapes and Chinese characters. This made sense: humans have evolved to fear the unknown because it signals potential harm. However, the study subjects\u2019 avoidance reflex was significantly reduced when they were exposed to the same faces, shapes, and characters they\u2019d seen before going into the fMRI machine.\nZhang observed another surprising effect, though."}

This widened level of choice may increase the attractiveness of DC schemes.\nWhat are the pension trends?\nResearch from Royal London among more than 800 financial advisers found a big increase in transfers out of final salary pensions.\nThere are big sums involved too. Royal London found growth of more than 50 per cent in the volume of transfers out of final salary pensions taking place in the past year, with the most common transfer value lying in the \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3500,000 range.\nOne in four advisers reported most of the transfers they deal with are worth 30 to 40 times the annual pension foregone.\n\uf075 They have very large debts and the money could help pay them off.\n\uf075 They have several DB pensions and could transfer some and still have a guaranteed income.\n\uf075 They are in poor health and fear dying young.\n\uf075 They are comfortable with managing money or finding someone to do that for them.\n\uf075 They want a fund to help pay for care if needed.\n\uf075 They are worried the decision is irreversible and they might regret it.\n\uf075 The scheme is their only pension.\n\uf075 They value the peace of mind of a guaranteed income.\n\uf075 They are concerned about inflation and have an inflation-linked DB pension.\nWhat else should savers consider?\nSavers should beware of pensions and investments scams.

{"idx": "13691", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Over 25 percent of the 500 companies surveyed by IDC are testing augmented reality (AR) prototypes. Much of this interest, however, is stuck in the prototype stage because most hardware platforms are prototypes and many of the tools needed to build the killer app to move into production are still under development.\nVuforia adds an important piece to the AR toolchain puzzle, though, with its announcement today of Smart Terrain for Google\u2019s Tango tablet.\nSmart Terrain, announced in conjunction with Google and Unity3D during the opening keynote at the Vision VR/ AR Summit, builds on two mature components of AR: Vuforia\u2019s early experience solving a very specific AR development problem and Google Tango, which looks like the first AR platform ready to emerge from prototype status and become a mainstream platform.\nVuforia started working on solving the problem of how to create content that interacts with the AR device\u2019s sensors to augment the reality in the user's field of view with dynamic content. One of the AR apps most familiar to consumers is Wayfair\u2019s interior design app that lets users overlay rooms in reality with virtual designs, dropping virtual objects such as furniture into the field of view to see an accurate and realistic rendering of the object in the room. Vuforia builds on this concept, with one significant difference, the objects can be dynamic. The best way to explain the capability is with this short 1-minute, 33-second video by Vuforia.\nThough the demo leaves the impression that Smart Terrain is a game development tool, it could be used for enterprise applications such as step-by-step technician instructions.\nDynamic content, effects and animated objects can be developed and added to the field of view that accurately interacts with the objects and planes in reality. The Star Wars Holochess game created by animating digitally rendered physical models for the movies a New Hope and the Force Awakens (seen in the 32-second video below) can now be built with Vuforia\u2019s software developer kit (SDK).\nA Holochess-like game was built by Star Wars animator Phil Tippett using Vuforia\u2019s old SDK. The difference is today, the characters' animation will not be limited to the table, but can move throughout the 3D space of the room and interact with planes, walls and other physical objects.\nThe problem of overlaying dynamic objects into reality is not new to Vuforia. The engineering team started working on the problem as a Qualcomm business unit a couple years ago. They were building conceptually the same features into Smart Terrain based on the PrimeSense\u2019s depth sensing and acquisition chip. But Apple acquired PrimeSense, locking up the depth-sensing technology and posing an obstacle to the Vuforia\u2019s project.\nAfter PTC acquired Vuforia, the Qualcomm strategy pivoted from building software and components that run on every mobile device to building enabling software for other companies\u2019 platforms. The Tango platform represented by the Asus Zenfone AR and the Lenovo Phab 2 is the right entry point because the hardware is in its third design iteration.\nTango\u2019s sensors provide a high-fidelity point cloud, relative x, y and z coordinates of the physical space in the field of view. Vuforia\u2019s Smart Terrain SDK computes a scene graph from the point cloud in real time. The scene graph is a hierarchy of real and virtual objects. In the video above, the tabletop is the parent node, the playing card is a child node, and the animated characters, effects and physical interactions with other objects are another child node.\nContent such as the"}

This ban will continue indefinitely.\n\"This music encourages wild behavior that could have a detrimental effect on society,\" Noosh-Abbadi said in a statement. \"We don\u2019t want to have it and we will prevent any unwanted incidents normally associated with such concerts and other events.\"\nFor hip-hop artists of Iranian descent, like Azad Right, this is a devastating blow. Azad grew up in Los Angeles, after his parents fled from Iran in the 1980s -- first landing in Turkey, then France and eventually Venice Beach -- but he still has dreams of being able to perform in his native country one day.\n\"When I heard the news, it made me angry because it's already difficult getting embraced in the U.S. being an Iranian-American rapper,\" Azad told MTV News. \"And now they won't even mess with me where I'm from? Having a concert in Iran is definitely one of my dreams and I hope that it'll be possible one day.\"\n\"I was always into music as a kid, I grew up playing piano and violin and that eventually led into hip-hop,\" he said, adding that this ban won't likely stop rappers in Iran from pursuing their passion.\n\"I know for a fact that hip-hop is huge in Iran -- that rebellious, revolutionary mentality is something a lot of the youth resonate with. Even though I have a small fan base of less than 20,000 people, I still see a large number of Iranians reaching out and being very supportive.\"\nFor now, returning to Iran is out of the question for Azad, but he's not losing hope.\n\"I've been told that it's not safe for me to go to Iran-- I've never been, the closest is Turkey, because of some of my family's political ties,\" he explained. \"With that said, my mom has been going back for quite a while now and I'm looking forward to eventually meeting that entire side of the family, as only four of my relatives live in the States.\"\nAzad Right released a full album called For The Hopeful in 2014 and he's opened for artists including Kendrick Lamar, The Game, Slaughterhouse, Mos Def and Mob Deep.\nListen to the project above and find him on Twitter @AzadRight."}

Instead, CEO John Chidsey spoke extensively about expanding store counts, especially internationally, and discussed improvements already made and in progress.\nHas the King been overthrown?\nBurger King's restaurants are 90% franchise-owned. Since this structure requires a lower capital commitment on the company's part, Burger King can open new restaurants at a faster clip. But while royalty income adds some stability to results, and lowers some risks, such as higher food and labor costs, it also means the company must share its gains. In addition, Burger King surrenders some control, and franchisees may be able to leave if times turn bad.\nAccording to Chidsey, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) operate almost three times as many restaurants overall, and five times as many overseas. But so far, Burger King has been adding only about 50 new locations per year. The real test will come in subsequent years, as the company seeks to ramp up the pace to 200-250 units in 2009 and 2010. Internationally, Burger King had been closing more restaurants than it has been opening, but it seeks to open 300-400 (net of closures) in the next three years.\nShould the company expand, just because it has fewer units than its rivals? Maybe so, since its former owner, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), raised the royalty rate charged to franchises by 1% in the U.S. to 4.5%. This is a great benefit, one that continues to pay off as franchise renewals come up, but it had nothing to do with improving operations. In fact, if profits decrease, the higher royalty rate could anger the franchisees Burger King so badly needs.\nChidsey praised the company's improved advertising and marketing, including bringing back the goofy King character. Chidsey himself admits that the chain's eponymous, silent monarch is \"creepy and weird.\" I agree; personally, my younger kids don't want to go there, because of the \"scary guy.\"\nChidsey also mentioned improving operations, including a new performance measurement system to see how franchises are faring and hold them accountable. The company instituted a Guest Trac system, in which customers fill out a grade for the restaurant. However, management only gets credit if a restaurant achieves the highest grade. Given the subjective nature of these ratings, I worry that this system could anger restaurants and their employees. After all, how many of us call the number on the receipt or fill out a comment card? I know I'm not one of them.\nWhile marketing and improving weak operations are important, they can only take you so far, especially for a company so far behind the competition. Burger King's average restaurant sales (ARS) have increased to $1.17 million, from $960,000 back in December 2002. But according to the presentation, McDonald's ARS is $2.1 million. Burger King seeks to get its average sales up to $1.5 million, a figure its new restaurants are currently accomplishing. To spread that performance throughout the chain, the company must now make significant improvements,"}

That's a hefty exaggeration from a president who has yet to see an extra mile of barrier completed since he took office.\nWith another possible government shutdown looming, and illegal immigration still at the heart of the budget dispute, Trump is pulling out the stops to portray his proposed wall as essential to public safety, including stemming crime. As he's done repeatedly, Trump also defied the record in claiming that the wall that Congress has refused to pay for is rapidly coming together anyway.\nTRUMP, on the effect of a border wall on crime: \"When that wall went up, it's a whole different ball game. ... I don't care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat. They're full of crap when they say it hasn't made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, 'Oh crime, it actually stayed the same.' It didn't stay the same. It went way down. ... Thanks to a powerful border wall in El Paso, Texas, it's one of America's safest cities now.\"\nTRUMP, on his proposed wall: \"We've built a lot of it.\" \u2014 rally remarks.\nTRUMP: \"We've actually started a big, big portion of the wall today at a very important location, and it's going to go up pretty quickly over the next nine months. That whole area will be finished. It's fully funded ... and we're going to have a lot of wall being built over the next period of time.\" \u2014 White House remarks.\nTHE FACTS: There's less going on here than his words convey. Construction is getting started on merely 14 miles (23 kilometers) of extended barrier, approved by Congress about a year ago in an appropriation that also authorized money to renovate and strengthen some existing fencing. The extension will be in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. That's not a \"big, big portion\" of the grand project he promised in his campaign and countless times since \u2014 a wall that, combined with existing fencing and natural barriers, would seal the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border with Mexico.\nThe fight with Democrats in Congress now is over his demand for a $5.7 billion down payment on the wall. That money would pay for a little over 200 miles (320 kilometers) of new barrier. Democrats have refused to approve anything close to that for extended barrier construction.\nTRUMP, on preparations for his rally: \"We have a line that is very long already. I mean, you see what's going on. And I understand our competitor's got a line, too, but it's a tiny little line.\" \u2014 at the White House.\nTRUMP: \"We're going to El Paso. ...

Stanford plans to enroll at least 36 patients into the study, which will utilize BioBridge as an adjunctive interventional device for vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) surgery. VLNT is an increasingly practiced micro-surgical procedure for patients with lymphedema, in which an auxiliary lymph node is autologously transplanted as a tissue flap to the treatment area.\nBioBridge is a sterile implantable biocompatible and biodegradable surgical mesh that has 510(k) clearance from the FDA for use in surgery to reinforce and repair soft tissue where weakness and deficiencies exist. The device is not cleared for the treatment of lymphedema. This novel medical device is made of highly purified collagen and is created with Fibralign\u2019s patented Nanoweave\u2122 technology. In a recently published preclinical study performed at Stanford University, BioBridge was shown to support and promote the formation of new lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) by encouraging endothelial cell attachment, alignment and migration, which are prerequisites for new lymphatic vessel formation.\n\u201cBased on results from our published successful large animal study, the research suggests that BioBridge has the potential to facilitate a truly successful surgical intervention that may restore lymphatic function, reduce swelling, and dramatically improve the patient\u2019s quality of life,\u201d said Stanley G. Rockson, MD, the study\u2019s lead investigator. Dr. Rockson is Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Center for Lymphatic and Venous Disorders.\nMore information about this study and enrollment can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT02734979: \u201cProspective Evaluation of the BioBridge Scaffold as an Adjunct to Lymph Node Transfer for Upper Extremity Lymphedema\u201d).\nLater this week Fibralign will report preliminary results in a separate and ongoing pilot clinical study evaluating a new surgical procedure using BioBridge for treating patients with breast cancer related lymphedema. This study was initiated in October, 2015 and is being conducted in cooperation with Instituto Oncol\u00f3gico Dr. Heriberto Pieter (IOHP), the largest cancer hospital in the Dominican Republic. Preliminary findings from this study are being presented at the National Lymphedema Network (NLN) International Conference being held in Dallas, Texas on September 1-3, 2016.\nAcquired [secondary] lymphedema is a serious, global, progressive disease that can develop as a result of cancer treatments. Such interventions, while life-saving, sometimes destroy enough lymphatic function that the cancer survivor is left with a condition in the affected limb that includes painful swelling, frequent infections that can be life-threatening and, ultimately, irreversible structural changes in the tissues, which can result in severe deformity, and serious reduction in function and quality-of-life"}

That painting depicts the events of June 28, 1776, when Thomas Jefferson and John Adams presented their draft of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Congress. A mere six days later on July 4, John Hancock was the first to sign the Declaration of Independence.\nThat signature was a true act of political courage. The signers of the Declaration knew that, by signing such a document, they were committing treason against the British crown. Acts of civic courage like these have allowed our democracy to survive for 235 years.\nIn this day and age, it feels like too many people in politics lack that civic courage to stand up for their beliefs. We must look no further than the current discussion about a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in Minnesota. Groups such as the National Organization for Marriage and the Minnesota Family Council oppose an effort to require all corporations that contribute to a ballot question to disclose their donors. This disclosure is essential to ensure a fair and open public debate on this issue; otherwise, such groups would be able to hide who is funding political advertisements on the amendment.\nMinnesota has a long history of supporting disclosure because of our desire for open and transparent elections. More important, voters have a right to know who is trying to influence their vote. Without knowledge about who is funding political speech, the public cannot adequately evaluate the information and misinformation spread throughout the campaign.\nUnfortunately, these groups would prefer to hide behind anonymity to avoid criticism or debate over their actions. Such acts of political cowardice should be of serious concern to voters. If individuals are allowed to contribute to these efforts anonymously, voters will most certainly be the victims of one of the nastiest and most divisive political campaigns this state has ever seen.\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said it best: \u201cRequiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.\u201d Therefore, we are guaranteed the right to freedom of speech in this country, not anonymous speech, or speech that is shielded from criticism. The National Organization for Marriage and the Minnesota Family Council would do well to remember this.\nIf the board fails to act, millions of dollars of undisclosed contributions will flow to both sides of the marriage debate. Does anyone believe that anonymous political attack ads are constructive for political discourse? It is time for more people to show the same act of civic courage that our forefathers took in securing the birth of our nation."}

But leave that solitary path, and safe bike routes get spotty at best.\nWhile some streets have marked bike lanes, they don't always connect to others, leaving bikers to either wind their way through back streets or to risk getting smacked by a car along busy roads.\nIt's an issue the Ada County Highway District is keenly aware of after years of complaints. While the city has repeatedly been named a bike-friendly city by the League of American Bicyclists, Don Kostelec, planning and program manager at ACHD, knows it's a bronze award\u00ad\u2014the lowest given by the organization.\n\"We're going in the right direction,\" Kostelec said. \"But we're also at the bronze level. There's a couple of levels higher to go.\"\nTo step up to that next level, ACHD began the first part of a new bike planning effort in April. This public phase began by going straight to those who use Boise's pathways and roads for bikes, to find out where and how often people ride their bikes. The online survey was a first step in identifying where limited funds could be spent to get the best result.\nAs part of the study, ACHD teams counted daily bike trips at 33 different locations at peak hours. \"We wanted to know how the system is being used out there today,\" he said. \"Then we can look out at two, five, 10 years after improvements are made and look at how the usage has changed.\"\nDuring the survey period, 1,200 bikers were counted across the county. While Kostelec said he expected areas like the intersection of the Greenbelt and Eighth Street to be busy, it was popularity of other areas that caught him off guard. Among those was the intersection of Veterans Memorial Parkway and Chinden Boulevard.\nIn just a two-hour period, 63 bikers came through the busy intersection. \"We picked some pretty gritty locations,\" Kostelec said of the intersection, where all five lanes are packed with traffic throughout the day.\nSo what does this mean? \"There's a lot of interest from cyclists even when it's not the most conducive,\" he said.\nBoise bikers seemed more than ready to share their opinions on the issue.

The average distance of a trip was 5 miles or less.\n\"This tells us we're not going to see long-distance commutes,\" Kostelec said. \"The average household has 10 vehicle trips per day of the same distance.

Kaplan, Princeton Review's main rival, is running radio ads in the New York City area and reports record enrollment growth this summer.\n\"The way that they're grading writing and the way they test grammar are very formulaic,\" said Andy Lutz, program director at Princeton Review, which claims success boosting scores on the SAT II writing exam -- a test not so different from next year's essay. \"We're not going to review the entire English language in a class, but we can review those parts that are tested on the SAT.\"\nSuch comments are distressing to anti-testing advocates, some of whom agree -- regretfully -- that the new test is indeed more coachable, disadvantaging students who can't afford a prep class.\nThe test-prep companies \"are rubbing their hands in glee\" said Robert Schaeffer, public education director of the group FairTest, because \"the increasing anxiety of students [is] increasing their profits.\" He complains that the new essay section rewards students for a good first draft, but bears little relevance to the kind of thoroughly researched and revised writing they'll do in college.\nBesides the essay, the new SAT is making other changes to emphasize grammar over vocabulary and advanced math over quantitative comparisons. The 25-minute essay will have comparatively little effect on students' scores; the expanded grammar section will count twice as much. Kaplan and Princeton Review plan to spend, essentially, just one session on essays in their summer and fall prep courses.\n\"The biggest fear is the essay, but when we look at their practice tests, we see they're struggling the most with the grammar section,\" said John Zeitlin, general manager of SAT and ACT programs at Kaplan.\nEach of the test prep companies offers similar advice for the essay.

The game started out goal for goal but by the end of the first quarter Carey Park started pulling away, to lead 16-8 .The experience of a team that's played together for awhile was evident in the Panthers' play as they dominated in the second quarter and piled on another 16 goals and went to the half-time break leading 32-12. The Magpies made changes at the main break and started to gel as a team. The Magpies' shooters fought hard in the circle against some tight defence, while up the other end of the court the Magpies' defenders turned the ball over with some great intercepts and rebounds. The mid court opted for shorter passes and good strong leads to regain control of the game. The second half was much closer with a 20-25 score line but the gap was too much for the Magpies on their first outing going down 32-57. They will be training hard ahead of their next game, scheduled for May 17. The 16's and 18s Busselton Magpies ventured to Bridgetown to face the Blackwood Ravens. Coach Beth Stokes put the players through a spirited warm up and then addressed them prior to start of the game. The 18's got off to a fast paced start, which did not change throughout the entire game. The Ravens scored the first goal which was met with a quick reply from the Magpies. Both teams traded goals for most of the first quarter and there were numerous intercepts and turnovers by both teams. Both teams displayed great defensive pressure on their respective opponents. Late in the first quarter the teams were evenly placed at 10 goals each, prior to Ravens edging ahead to enter the first break with a slim lead of 12 goals to 11. The second quarter started where the first quarter finished off, with all players working hard for effective passing opportunities throughout the court. The Ravens made the most of a few opportunities that resulted in them outscoring the Magpies by three goals. This provided the Ravens with a handy lead going into the main break 23 to 19. The Ravens further extended their lead in the third quarter with a few quick unanswered goals, which resulted in the score being 34 to 26. The Magpies were now in unfamiliar territory having convincingly won their first two games. They fought hard to close the gap to six goals during the final quarter before the Ravens surged again. At the final whistle the Ravens were victorious 47 to 35. In the 16s the Ravens hit the court running with strong and physical defence combined with accurate shooting. The Magpies attack was under pressure which resulted in some early unforced errors. Jenna Begley was strong through the centre court, and with some accurate shooting from Jordan Sapsford, the scoreline saw the young Magpies down by a mere goal with the score, 9 - 10 at the end of the first period. The Magpies were more prepared at the start of the second quarter, with Kalani Bate-Henry and Dakota Nelmes rebounding strongly in defence. Felicity Watson also took to the court and worked hard through the centre, with Tasmin Falconer pushing hard against tight defence. The period included tough contests and several intercepted Magpies passes, resulting in a half-time score of 1"}

Governments in many countries, including India and the UK, are contemplating strict new regulations for social media companies.\nThis week's vote in India, where Facebook has more users than in any other country, is shaping up as a major test.\nOn April 1, the company said it had removed more than 500 accounts and 138 pages linked to India's opposition Congress party for \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\" - Facebook's term for the use of fake accounts and other deceptive methods to promote a message.\nIt also took down a page with two million followers which, according to Facebook's review partner Atlantic Council think-tank, was \"pro-BJP\" (India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party) and a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nHarbath said the company can now quickly detect viral, politically sensitive stories and refer them for fact-checking by outside organisations.\nThe officials also touted heavy investment in technology for detecting doctored videos and text inside pictures, but acknowledged that they have been unable to stop some duplicates of videos that have been identified as spurious.\nFacebook has partnered with seven fact-checkers in India. If a post is found to be untrue, the company says it reduces the circulation of such fake posts by more than 80 percent, but slightly modified versions of the same images, video or text can escape detection and spread further.\nEarlier this month, the Reuters news agency found instances of edited posts circulating on Facebook which the company's own fact-checkers had said were false.\nDeceptive political advertising has become another hot-button problem for the company. Facebook has toughened the rules in India and political ads now include \"published by\" and \"paid by\" disclaimers. Users can also access a library that allows them to search and find out more about political advertisements.\nHarbath said political ad purchases in India now require either a certificate from the Election Commission or a physical address in India, as well as a phone number and group name of the entity purchasing the ad.\nWhile Facebook will check that the address and phone number are legitimate, the company agreed that the same person could make up multiple entities at the same address, without any available record of the original source of money.\n\"This is a great example, we think, of where there needs to be more regulation,\" Harbath said.\nIs Facebook ruining the world?"}

I compliment him on being part of the Project Citizen Group. What I disagree with is that as a student he should have researched the subject of his letter and found that the content of fracturing fluids is generally known. Wikipedia states \u201cThe fluid injected into the rock is typically slurry of water, proppants and chemical additives. Additionally, gels, foams and compressed gases, including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and air can be injected. Typically, of the fracturing fluid 90 percent is water and 9.5 percent is sand (a proppant) with the chemical additives accounting to about 0.5 percent.\u201d Many companies have also released the content of the fluids they use.\nThe specific chemicals listed in Wikipedia are \u201cAcids \u2013 hydrochloric acid or acetic acid, sodium chloride (salt), polyacrylamide and other friction reducers, ethylene glycol, borate salts, sodium and potassium carbonates, glutaraldehyde \u2013 used as disinfectant of the water, guar gum and other water-soluble gelling agents, citric acid and isopropanol.\u201d Some adaptations of the above are used by individual companies to achieve the desired result of stimulating oil and gas production.\nCertainly no one is going to drink this material, nor would we drink any of the chemicals we find underneath our kitchen sink, even if diluted by 99.5 percent water. The point is not just what is in it, but how it is handled and protected from release into the human environment. If mistakes are made, which happens, contamination can occur. Statistics show that these instances are rare, but when it happens to you it is obviously very important.\nWe only need to be worried if proper safeguards are not employed in the storage of fracturing fluids, and in the safe execution of the hydraulic fracturing process. Companies are responsible for both, and are held accountable by regulatory agencies if mistakes are made. Modern society uses a multitude of chemicals that benefit our daily lives. Most we take for granted.\nSo in that case, I would assume you would be uncomfortable with the numerous executive orders that President Obama has put in place during his terms?

He called podcasts \"intimate\" as opposed to video (which, he noted, SLATE also produces), engendering listener loyalty (offering as an example that STEPHEN COLBERT once called to complain when an episode of \"POLITICAL GABFEST\" was late in posting). \"People get very connected to these in a way I don't think they do with video,\" BOWERS said. He added that while some predict a collapse in podcast advertising business, he does not see that happening, crediting a \"smallish but incredibly loyal\" audience and effective advertising.\nAsked by HIVIO co-founder MARK RAMSEY what is holding podcasting back from growing brand advertising, BOWERS noted that his network is actually getting more brand advertising, using advertising, live events, and custom podcasts (including the eight-part science fiction series \"THE MESSAGE\" for GENERAL ELECTRIC and new work for PURINA), the latter being produced by a separate unit to maintain SLATE's editorial firewall between pure editorial and sponsored content. He also addressed podcasting's measurement situation, noting that the metrics available are not what other media can offer but asserting that download figures \"are not nothing.\" And he assigned the slow adoption of podcasting by the mainstream to technological considerations, saying that the technology to download shows \"has not improved quickly enough.\" He predicted that in the near future, \"most people will listen to spoken-word (content) on demand,\" and advised broadcasters to make all of their content available on demand but to recognize that the podcasting medium requires different kinds of programming.\nBOWERS also announced the addition of a new 10-part podcast, \"REVISIONIST HISTORY,\" hosted by author MALCOLM GLADWELL and reexamining events of recent history; the show will debut JUNE 16th.\nTalent manager and producer HOWARD LAPIDES asked the HIVIO audience, \"What the f-ck happened to radio?,\" and answering that question by blaming consolidation for the industry's woes but adding that good content will continue on different platforms like podcasting.

In simple English, it all means that when, and if ever, the United Kingdom really does depart the European Union, then they may eventually get to the European parliament. Welcome to another sidebar consequence of the rolling Brexit fiasco. But let's quickly explain.\nWhen UK voters opted in June 2016 to leave, the EU authorities had to look again at how European parliament seat allocations reflected the population proportions. We could be here for a while battering through the complex details of that work.\nBut let's keep things simple. It was decided that 46 of the UK's 73 Euro seats would be put on the back burner, pending more new member states joining in fullness of time. The remaining 27 seats were re-\u00adallocated, with Ireland gaining two and going from 11 to 13.\nBut Ireland was not the only state to gain seats. The full extra seat allocation looks like this: France (+5), Spain (+5), Italy (+3), Netherlands (+3), Ireland (+2), Sweden (+1), Austria (+1), Denmark (+1), Finland (+1), Slovakia (+1), Croatia (+1), Estonia (+1), Poland (+1) and Romania (+1).\nBut now it's clear the UK will not leave before the Euro elections in the last weekend of May. EU law says if the UK is still a member state it must hold these elections, generating a sizeable Brexit row within a row. And it's another one London has lost - there will very probably be UK European parliament elections on Thursday, May 23, illogical as that may seem.\nBut the big upshot for Ireland's European parliament elections - due on Friday, June 24 - is that those two would-be extra seats are seriously in doubt. And the complications do not stop there. The two extra ones were allocated one apiece to the Dublin constituency, bringing it to four seats, and South (an amalgam of Munster and south Leinster), bringing it to five seats.\nIdeally, you would advise Euro hopefuls to avoid being last elected. But those already in the race know that only too well.\nIt seems in practice that the final winners in Dublin and South will be in a strange place. They must await the final departure of the UK, which could take quite some time, and depend on the charitable view of their new almost Euro MEP colleagues, to decide if they are to be paid, get any right of audience, and/or other resources like staff and constituency expenses.\nPolitical veterans know they cannot expect too much public sympathy if they find themselves in that Euro limbo. But the reality is that these elections are very expensive and many serious candidates pony up very large sums, sometimes in the region of \u20ac100,000, to win.\nMore attentive readers will by now be ahead of me: there will very likely be law arising from this. The kind of litigation which could go all the way to the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg. And there may be more cases than Irish ones.\nSeasoned politicians are already identifying Irish anomalies: the constituency boundaries were specifically drawn based on 13 Irish seats. Also, under proportional representation, the quota calculation is in large part based on the number of seats in the constituency.\nOn that basis,"}

The memo titled \"A Year of Readiness\" explores whether students attending college should spend their first year focusing on being \u2014 well, students \u2014 rather than focusing on athletics.\nA novel concept, but let's not kid ourselves, this idea has less to do with GPA and more to do with NBA.\nThat's right. It's about finding a way to deal with concerns over the one-and-done trend in college basketball. The NBA and its players' association requires an athlete to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school play before being eligible for the league draft.\nMost top high school players land at a program with a short-term stay on their minds. During the past three seasons, 27 players with only one year of college eligibility under their belts were picked in the NBA Draft.\nSo if the Big Ten thinks proposing a rule like making freshman ineligible will help, then the league needs to go back to school. As any parent can attest, telling children they can't do something only makes them want to do it more.\nSEC power Kentucky already has established itself as the top option for one-and-done players, with freshman guard Devin Booker leading the Wildcats in scoring and expect to leave school soon after this season ends.\nTalk about a recruiting advantage.\nTo be clear, the Big Ten isn't the only Power 5 conference that's considering the move.\nCommissioners for both the Big 12 and Pac-12 told CBSSports.com earlier this month that both leagues were also pondering the move. But a decision to move forward with such a move would be left to either the individual conferences or must be voted on by all Division I schools.\nPerhaps the biggest reason this thinking won't fly is the almighty dollar.\nCollege football is the fastest growing sports in America with fan interest at an all-time high. It's the reason a network like ESPN would spend $7 billion for the right to air the College Football Playoff. Or why, according to a recent report in the Sports Business Journal, advertisers feel they get more bang for their buck with college sports over NFL and Major League Baseball.\nThere are other ways college administrators can work toward preparing young men for the future, including expanding eligibility from four years to five.

I think there won't be a serious effort on the Republican side.\"\nBewkes wasn't specific, though Trump's Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton promised many times during her campaign to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed the conservative group to promote its anti-Hillary movie.\nBewkes also said Trump wasn't the only Republican candidate to complain of unfair coverage, as Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush and others also weren't happy with CNN and the press. \"That's more about the nature of change in that party right now,\" he said. \"I think we're going to see it on the Democratic side, too.\"\nBewkes also said he isn't worried that Trump has said he'd like to prevent AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, suggesting that maybe politicians who initially spoke against the merger confused Time Warner with Time Warner Cable, which would have been a tougher sale to regulators, given AT&T already owns pay-TV giant DirecTV.\n\"We were still before the election and we know some of the strains of populism in that election on both sides,\" he said. \"I'm not saying whether everybody thought it was the cable company merging with a phone company \u2014 they're different competitive issues \u2014 but it isn't that, and I think when it becomes clear what we're doing it will become clear to everyone that it will be pro-competitive, pro-consumer and improve competition in advertising.\"\nAfter the Business Insider event, Bewkes headed to the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference for further discussion about CNN.\n\"CNN had a killer year,\" he said. \"We could say this has been an unusual year in world events, but it's actually not true.

The following paper is a response to Wittes and Byman\u2019s piece from Stephen Grand. Rebecca Winthrop and Kevin Watkins also prepared a response arguing that the United States must put poverty, including strategies for positive youth development, at the center of the nation\u2019s wider national security agenda.\nDaniel Byman and Benjamin Wittes analyze in detail military and law enforcement actions to counter terrorism. The next presidential administration will also have to make complementary efforts to dry up support for terrorists within the local populations where they operate.\nThe impetus behind the administration\u2019s efforts was clear. Al Qaeda feeds upon a narrative popular in the Arab and broader Muslim worlds that asserts that the all-powerful United States, rather than using its immense resources to uplift the condition of Muslims, has become yet another imperial power intent on occupying Muslim lands and on killing innocent Muslims. While only a small fraction of the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Muslims agree with al Qaeda\u2019s violent methods\u2014which have made Muslims their primary victims\u2014many more are sympathetic to its arguments. The administration sought nothing less than to shatter the al Qaeda narrative by presenting an America that no longer played to type.\nThe centerpiece of Obama\u2019s outreach to the Muslim world was his Cairo speech of June 2009. Calling for \u201ca new beginning\u201d between the United States and Muslims around the globe, he outlined ways they might work together to combat violent extremism, reduce the threat from nuclear weapons, advance democracy, enhance the role of women, and promote economic development in Muslim-majority countries. From the perspective of Muslim audiences, however, the most striking aspect of the speech was his discussion of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Seeking to signal that he would be different from past U.S. presidents, Obama called for a halt to the construction of Israeli settlements. That line garnered thunderous applause, but unfortunately became the litmus test by which many Muslim audiences have judged U.S. policy since. The president was unable to get the Israeli government to agree to a complete settlement freeze, and direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians eventually ground to a halt. On the issue that means the most to many Muslims when it comes to the United States\u2014Palestine\u2014Obama failed to deliver.\nThe Cairo speech spawned a flurry of activity within the administration to make good on Obama\u2019s promises of partnership, which were intended as a complement to its other counterterrorism efforts. For a young administration that did not have all its foreign policy team yet in place and was grappling simultaneously with an economic crisis, it proved a difficult undertaking. The effort had to be coordinated across a number of federal agencies and initially lacked funding. Some valuable initiatives were launched: world-class scientists were sent to the region as science envoys, an entrepreneurship summit was convened by the White House, and regional centers of excellence in science and technology were established. But as compelling as the idea was, true partnerships in development between citizens in Muslim-majority countries and the United States proved difficult to organize and sustain, particularly by a government bureaucracy. Few of the Cairo initiatives have yet had the kind of impact or visibility to make a difference at the level of politics.\nThe excitement generated in some quarters by the Cairo speech soon turned to disappointment that Obama\u2019s soaring rhetoric was not matched by concrete actions. Available public opinion data suggest that many Muslim-majority societies had slightly more favorable views of the United States following"}

{"idx": "13782", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There are infinite paintings, but also a more finite sense of what is a great painting versus not. Similarly there are infinite games, but also a sense of what works and what doesn\u2019t. The boundless space of video games is bounded and their limitless possibilities have limits. There are, it seems, rules to game design.\n\u201cCreative constant\u201d is a term that I use to describe those rules. They are the foundational, shape-describing pragmatic realities that we designers run into. I call them constants rather than limits because limits sound like arbitrary rules meant to be broken. Don\u2019t get me wrong: there certainly are many arbitrary rules around video games waiting to be smashed into atoms, especially the conventions of genre. However constants are different.\nA constant is an always-present factor, a boundary in some respects but also a pillar. The maximum speed of light (c) is a constant, for example, whose affects are felt throughout the universe. c seems to imply that travel to other stars is going to be more difficult than simply building a faster spaceship, but it also plays a role in the translation of mass into energy, relativistic interactions and whatnot. Our knowledge of c has helped in the development of most modern technology.\nConstants exist outside our ability to directly affect them, so it\u2019s up to us makers to figure out how to use them. In the gaming sphere it may seem that the first and most obvious constant is \u201cplatform\u201d. Platform constraints are often overriding considerations in the development of any game (from the control paradigm through to the supported business models and demographics of users) but they are also mutable. What holds us back today does not do so tomorrow (and vice versa) and so platforms are always moving targets. Therefore they\u2019re not constant.\nSimilarly it\u2019s tempting to identify \u201cthe player\u201d as a constant, because of course games are always played and therefore we must always think of the player. This is true, but not specific. Most game design constants are to do with the psychology of play, how players think and see, but they need to be separated out to be discussed meaningfully. Ditto ideas to do with \u201cthe audience\u201d, \u201cthe market\u201d or \u201crules\u201d. These are all part of the landscape of making games, but fall into being too mutable or general.\nHaving mulled on it a while, I think there are seven constants of game design that can\u2019t be escaped, but can be toyed with to create powerful play.\nIn an older version of this idea I used to say that \u201cfun\u201d was the first constant, but fun is a fuzzy word for many people to parse, and for new wave game designers it\u2019s a dumb limit. To play a game like dys4ia is not to have fun as such, but it still has a certain something. I later realized that what I really meant was \u201cfascination\u201d.\nThe gamers have a point. The lack of interesting logic, gears and levers, numbers, operations and mechanics gives games a short half life. They might be interesting to play around with for an hour or two, but they don\u2019t sustain. Within the critical community that might not necessarily be a deal-breaker (it\u2019s often looking at games as part of an arts conversation) but outside that group it quickly runs into difficulty.\nA game needs to be fascinating. It needs active and economic mechanics that bounce off one another to create the illusion of a dynamic problem. Whether that means a massively complex simulation as you would find in Sim City 5, the elegant rules of a sport or the rudimentary lock-key puzzle solving of adventure games, fascinating systems are one of the key vectors that pulls players in and keep them engaged"}

Garg has been arrested while his accomplice is still absconding.\nThe fraud has come to light when Tejinder Pal Singh, owner of Punjab Tools Ltd, complained that some trader had used his VAT number due to which his number was locked at all barriers in the country, bringing his business to a stand still.\nThe victim then traced truck drivers, who in turn identified the factory from which the consignment was loaded.\nHe then brought the matter to the notice of the police.

All in all, that translates to more than $3.5 million in referral bonuses up for grabs.\nOn sign up, users, a.k.a the social recruiters, connect to Facebook or LinkedIn to view a feed of job listings, suggested friends that might be suitable for each available position and the amount of the award. The social recruiters can then get the ball rolling by recommending contacts for jobs.\nTuesday, Top Prospect is introducing a few new features to improve the referral process. The \"People You Know\" update, for instance, lifts the veil a bit more to show users which of their social network friends are connected to the employers who are hiring. The idea here is to give members a better sense of the types of people who work at a particular company; it's information that could help them make more informed recommendations and improve their chance of earning referral rewards.\nThe startup is also introducing a matching game that offers users a fun way to quickly indicate whether a contact is a good fit for a company. The module sits on the right-hand side of the user's dashboard and serves up would-be employee-employer matches. The user can vote \"yes\" or \"no\" to indicate a match or mismatch, or choose to skip to the next match.\n\"The feedback you\u2019re giving us will make our algorithms a lot better at matching you or your friends with jobs,\" says CEO Rotem Perelmuter. \"Also, for the matches you think are good, we make it really easy to recommend them for a job by listing them under the game.\"\nFirst launched in January 2011, Top Prospect is not without its kinks and glitches, but the site certainly offers a fresh social media and social graph-infused solution to the talent and recruiting challenges that face many growing companies.\nTop Prospect has more than 2 million profiles in its system, and is a backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital and notable angel investors including Dustin Moskovitz and Ron Conway."}

Sure, there\u2019s an app for that \u2013 financial institutions and third-party vendors are all too eager to have you share your buying, spending and personal data with them by using their online app for free.\nThese web and app-based personal finance management tools have grown in popularity because they simply download or \u201caggregate\u201d your banking transactions and divide the lot into their prepackaged categories. Some offer light customization, graphs and even positive messaging reminding you to stay on budget, track your spending and pay your bills.\nWhat could go wrong?

{"idx": "13805", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: With a deadly avalanche, it appears climate change may now be affecting a once stable region of the Tibetan Plateau.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of an international team of researchers who have published an analysis of the July 2016 disaster in the Dec. 9 issue of the Journal of Glaciology.\nOn July 17, more than 70 million tons of ice broke off from the Aru glacier in the mountains of western Tibet and tumbled into a valley below, taking the lives of nine nomadic yak herders living there.\nTo perform a kind of forensic analysis of the avalanche, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences joined with two glaciologists from The Ohio State University: Lonnie Thompson, Distinguished University Professor in the School of Earth Sciences and research scientist at the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center (BPCRC), and Ellen Mosley-Thompson, Distinguished University Professor in Geography and director of BPCRC.\nThe most important fact about the avalanche, said Thompson, is that it lasted only four or five minutes (according to witnesses), yet it managed to bury 3.7 square miles of the valley floor in that time. He said something\u2013likely meltwater at the base of the glacier\u2013must have lubricated the ice to speed its flow down the mountain.\nResearchers could not have predicted, for example, that a neighboring glacier in the same mountain range would give way just two months later, but it did in September 2016. That avalanche appears not to have resulted in any deaths, and the cause is still under investigation.\nThe researchers used satellite data and GPS to get precise measurements of how much ice fell in the first avalanche and the area it covered. They\u2019ve since pieced together more answers by working with computer modelers who were able to replicate the avalanche virtually. In those simulations, the only condition that led to an avalanche was the presence of meltwater.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly where the meltwater came from, but given that the average temperature at the nearest weather station has risen by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over the last 50 years, it makes sense that snow and ice are melting and the resulting water is seeping down beneath the glacier,\u201d Thompson said.\nGlacial collapse is unprecedented in western Tibet, which for decades has resisted the effects of climate change while glaciers in southern and eastern Tibet have melted at an accelerating rate. Increased snowfall has even led to the expansion of some glaciers in western Tibet\u2013and the extra snowfall likely played some role in the avalanche by creating additional meltwater, said Lide Tian, a glaciologist at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and lead author of the paper."}

Both jihadists attended al Qaeda training camps in pre-9/11 Afghanistan before relocating to Yemen, where they eventually assumed leadership positions. They are openly loyal to al Qaeda\u2019s overall emir, Ayman al Zawahiri.\nQasim al-Raymi (or al-Rimi) was named AQAP\u2019s emir in June 2015 after his predecessor, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, was killed in an American drone strike. Raymi quickly reaffirmed his allegiance to the \u201cbeloved father,\u201d Zawahiri, after assuming AQAP\u2019s top spot.\nState offers a short biography for Raymi, noting that he \u201ctrained terrorists at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the 1990\u2019s.\u201d He did so at a young age, as he was born on June 5, 1978, making him forty years old today. This means he was only in his twenties when al Qaeda first promoted him to the role of trainer.\nAfter returning to Yemen, Raymi became active in al Qaeda\u2019s terrorist plotting. He \u201cwas sentenced to five years in prison in 2005\u201d for \u201cplotting to assassinate the US Ambassador to Yemen.\u201d However, Raymi and other al Qaeda veterans escaped prison in 2006. They then relaunched AQAP in early 2009. Raymi previously served as AQAP\u2019s \u201cmilitary commander\u201d and ran a training camp in Abyan.\nFoggy Bottom implicates Raymi in al Qaeda\u2019s anti-American terrorist plots, saying he was \u201clinked\u201d to both the Sept. 2008 attack on the US Embassy in Sana\u2019a and AQAP\u2019s Dec. 2009 plot to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner. The latter plot was carried out by Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, a recruit who had lived in the UK. AQAP\u2019s explosives experts strapped an \u201cunderwear bomb\u201d to Abdulmutallab that failed to detonate. Although the US connects Raymi to these operations, State doesn\u2019t explain his precise role.\nAQAP\u2019s emir was first designated as a terrorist by the US government in May 2010 and a reward offer of $5 million was issued in Oct. 2014. That reward has now been increased to $10 million.\nThe second AQAP leader targeted by the Rewards for Justice program today is Khalid Saeed al-Batarfi. Like Raymi, Batarfi is a veteran of Al Farouq, where he was trained after traveling to Afghanistan in 1999. Batarfi \u201cfought alongside the Taliban against US forces and the Northern Alliance\u201d in 2001, State notes.\nBatarfi has continued to serve as a Taliban booster in the years since \u2014 a role that the Taliban has appreciated.\nState describes Batarfi as a \u201cformer member of AQAP\u2019s shura council.\u201d It is not clear why Batarfi isn\u2019t currently a member of AQAP\u2019s shura, or elite advisory council, but he remains a key figure within the group\u2019s hierarchy.\nThe UN has warned that Batarfi is involved in planning \u201cexternal attacks,\u201d"}

Considering the immensity of the scale the world's power grids, nobody can't fault these two for lack of vision. But it is realistic, or just something nice to dream about, but without much chances of actually happening?\nthe overall construction cost for a WWS system might be on the order of $100 trillion worldwide, over 20 years, not including transmission.\nThat last past, \"not including transmission\", is crucial. Renewables are not as concentrated as fossil fuels, and the best sources are often located in scarcely populated areas. This means that transmission costs are going to be substantial, in some cases probably as high as the costs of the actual wind farms/solar farms/etc.\nWe must also take into consideration the planning fallacy, which can lead to delays and cost overruns.\nBut on the bright side, the authors remind us of massive changes that happened quickly in the past: \"During World War II, the U.S. retooled automobile factories to produce 300,000 aircraft, and other countries produced 486,000 more. In 1956 the U.S. began building the Interstate Highway System, which after 35 years extended for 47,000 miles, changing commerce and society.\"\nBut still, I have big doubts that this will happen in the next 20 years. How much has happened in the past 20? A lot to be sure (new technologies developed, costs brought down, capital invested, etc), but not enough to make a big difference to the power grid of most countries. I certainly hope that things will keep accelerating and that we'll see an exponential growth in clean energy production, but it will probably take more than 20 years.\nBut in the meantime, the important thing is to get our priorities straight. Even if we don't get to 100% renewables any time soon, we should start by getting rid of the most carbon-intensive sources of power (coal, I'm looking in your direction) and grab the low-hanging fruits, like expansion of hydro power using already existing dams and efficiency improvements (better insulation of buildings, more efficient HVACs, etc)."}
{"idx": "13818", "prompt": "Continue the following text: When it comes to the market for luxury goods, \u201cChina is the rising star,\u201d according to Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a Milan-based partner with Bain & Co., the consultancy. Luxury sales in China currently represent 10% of the global market. CLSA, a leading Asian investment bank, estimates that by 2020, China will be the largest domestic market for luxury goods in the world and will account for 44% of global demand. Consumption by Chinese consumers abroad has helped fuel this growth in more mature markets in Europe. CLSA and other firms estimate that currently more than half of Chinese luxury spending occurs overseas. Some Chinese tour groups travel to France and Italy for the sole purpose of luxury shopping.\n\u201cAfter decades of deprivation and conformism, Chinese consumers regard expensive consumer goods as trophies of success,\u201d reported The Economist magazine. \u201cIn public, they show off. In private, they pinch pennies.\u201d The demand for luxury goods has increased for a number of reasons, including rapidly increasing disposable income, the increasing sophistication of Chinese consumers, and rapid urbanization and growing wealth in second- and third-tier cities.\nStill, the typical Chinese luxury consumer differs greatly from his or her counterparts in more mature luxury markets. Luxury items in China are generally purchased as status symbols and not necessarily because of taste, sophistication or service. CLSA estimated that in 2010, 16% to 17% of Chinese consumers bought luxury goods as gifts, with handbags, clothing, watches and jewelry being the most popular. Within the accessories segment, 37% of purchases were made for the purpose of gifting, a far greater proportion than in other markets, with only the newest and most expensive products being acceptable.\nAccording to a recent article in the Hurun Report (a Chinese publication similar to Forbes), the average Chinese millionaires are 15 years younger than their counterparts in other parts of the world, and their number has been rapidly increasing \u2014 by 6.1%, to nearly one million in 2010. Finally, China\u2019s luxury goods market was previously dominated by men, due to the importance of the gift-giving culture in business. As more women have entered the workforce, the proportion of luxury goods they purchase has risen to more than half the market total.\nDespite the increase in Chinese luxury goods consumption, luxury brand boutiques in China attract much less traffic than managers would like. Compared to the crowded Apple store next door, Louis Vuitton\u2019s (LV) flagship in Shanghai is empty. More and more, Chinese luxury consumers are choosing to do their luxury shopping abroad. In recent studies, Bain found that more than 50% of luxury goods purchases by Chinese consumers in 2010 were made overseas. A study by PATA/Nielsen found the average Chinese tourist in Europe purchases US$1,359 of goods per trip \u2014 more than any other nationality.\nThis is especially striking considering that most economists believe the renminbi is significantly undervalued. According to Xiao Qianhui, general manager of the Shanghai-based Spring International Travel Agency, most Chinese tourists consider shopping for luxury goods the main purpose of a trip to France. \u201cSometimes one Chinese tourist will even buy up to 20 Louis Vuitton bags at one shop,\u201d he said. A recent survey commissioned by travel service company Global Blue found that many Chinese tourists complained about not being able to spend everything they had planned to when they were abroad.\nThe main reasons Chinese consumers cite for shopping abroad are lower prices due to China\u2019s high luxury taxes, better selection and greater \u201cshow-off\u201d value.

Mollaghan, a 34-year-old animal-behavior researcher and graduate student in the University of Texas\u2019s psychology department, was waiting in the trailer\u2019s main room beside a tan-and-brown mutt that had recently been left in the shelter\u2019s night drop-off box with no ID tags or background-information form. Estimated by the shelter\u2019s staff members to be a \u201cManchester terrier mix,\u201d it looked like a pointy-faced Chihuahua on stilts, a creature of indeterminate origin and yet-to-be-determined disposition. That, literally, was where I was to come in.\nAll afternoon, in that continuous din of kennel-dog barking \u2014 high-pitched, autocatalytic, corrosive \u2014 I had been helping Mollaghan conduct various trait-assessment tests on some of the shelter\u2019s recent arrivals, trying to get a fix on each animal\u2019s temperament, measuring characteristics like sociability, playfulness, aggressiveness and fearfulness. The house trailer \u2014 situated midway between Town Lake\u2019s western row of kennels, which hold already approved, adoptable dogs, and the compound\u2019s eastern end, where the veterinary clinic and euthanasia rooms are \u2014 was serving as a kind of purgatorial courtroom. The dogs we gave high marks to would advance westward with a certificate of adoptability; those we didn\u2019t rate so well would be dispatched the other way, eastward to the euthanasia room.\nAs fair trials go, these were anything but, given the inherently stressful venue and the somewhat offbeat nature of the tests themselves. Indeed, many a so-called well-homed dog I\u2019ve met might have taken my head off for some of the antics our defendants were being subjected to that afternoon. There was the \u201capproach by angry normal person, stare, raise voice, raise hand as if to strike\u201d test; or test No. 12, the \u201cfriendly approach by toddler doll\u201d \u2014 a three-foot-high, raggedy-haired creature in a paw-smeared yellow taffeta dress, a figure that is still showing up in my nightmares. And there was test No. 13, the little number that I was just then donning an outsize yellow raincoat with hood and walking stick to perform for our Manchester terrier mix: the \u201cfriendly \u2018strange\u2019 person with cane, approach and pet\u201d test.\nAnd yet by the unremittingly bleak standards of animal-shelter justice, such trait-assessment sessions are a much fairer shake than most shelter dogs will ever get. These sessions are part of a new trend among animal shelters across the United States to take a more proactive role in both controlling and counteracting the rampant discarding of dogs in this country. Mollaghan\u2019s study, a joint project between Town Lake and the University of Texas\u2019s Animal Personality Institute, makes use both of questionnaires filled out by dog relinquishers and of personality assessment forms designed for adopters in an attempt to better understand the mind-set not only of the abandoned animals but of their past and potential owners as well.

Since 1980, 33 film and TV workers \u2014 nearly one a year \u2014 have been killed in helicopter accidents around the world, 14 in the U.S. and 15 more for American companies shooting abroad.\nIn 1980, cameraman Robert Van Der Kar was killed while filming an episode of Magnum P.I. when the low-flying helicopter he was riding in crashed into the Pacific Ocean off of Hawaii. The pilot, Robert Sanders, was injured and his license was suspended for 90 days by the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThat same year, legendary Indian action star Jayan was killed on a movie set while attempting to transfer from a speeding motorcycle to the skids of a low-flying helicopter that crashed on top of him.

Pilots David Perrin and Nigel Thorton and mechanic Jaron Anderson were killed when their helicopter crashed en route to a location shoot in Yugoslavia for Warner Bros\u2019 High Road To China, starring Tom Selleck as a 1920s-era barnstorming pilot. That same year, producer Alastair Simon, cinematographer Garry Hansen and cameraman John Jasiwkowicz were killed when their helicopter crashed while making a TV commercial in Australia.\nThe year 1985 was another bad one for helicopter crashes; four more film workers were killed that year in three separate accidents. In January, 22-year-old stuntman Reid Rondell was burned to death, and his pilot was seriously injured, in a fiery helicopter crash in Valencia \u2013 just a few miles from the tragic site of the Twilight Zone crash \u2013 during production of CBS\u2019 Airwolf. The Los Angeles County Coroner later determined Rondell had snorted cocaine shortly before the fatal crash.

{"idx": "13834", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This Week at War: Is There an Afghanistan Caucus?\nThe midterms were a signal that time may be running out for the Obama team's war plans.\nIn sharp contrast to 2006 and 2008, when weariness over the Iraq war boosted the fortunes of Democrats, national security issues played virtually no role in the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. This year, with economic and financial problems paramount, the long war in Afghanistan received nary a mention during the campaign. Adding to the silence over the war is the perception that there exist few substantial differences on Afghan policy; Republican leaders generally endorse President Barack Obama\u2019s \"surge\" strategy and will watch from the sidelines as Obama ponders his withdrawal options next year.\nThe conventional wisdom is that even if a more left-wing Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill grumbles at Obama\u2019s Afghan policy, Republicans will provide the administration with the support it needs. This view also holds that the Pentagon will largely get what it wants. Although some new libertarian-leaning Republicans might be mild Pentagon skeptics, the arrival of the new, mostly pro-defense Republican delegation in Washington, combined with the generally bipartisan workings of the House and Senate Armed Services committees, should mean that the Pentagon\u2019s programs and Obama\u2019s strategy for Afghanistan are safe.\nAre there any reasons to question this conventional wisdom? Might defense spending come under the knife in spite of the Republican wave? And might Obama be left alone to deal with Afghanistan, without political cover on either flank?\nNew Republican members will soon receive a test on how serious they are about actually cutting spending. Their election platform pledges to cut $100 billion in domestic discretionary spending during their first year in office. The new majority in the House of Representatives can, in theory, approve such cuts. But getting the Democrat-controlled Senate to agree is another question. If Republicans are actually serious about negotiating a compromise on spending, Senate Democrats are likely to ask for some meaningful contribution from the Pentagon in exchange for deep cuts to domestic programs.\nWhere in the Pentagon\u2019s budget could appropriators find immediate and meaningful cuts? Defense Secretary Robert Gates has already attempted to get ahead of this process by proposing cuts to his department\u2019s overhead. But he wants any such savings reinvested in weapons purchases, meaning no net reduction of the Pentagon\u2019s budget.\nUnder this scenario, congressional policymakers may for the first time have to reckon with the financial costs of the Afghan campaign. Just as the newly-elected congressmen and senators were celebrating their victories, Chinese warships, aircraft, and marines were conducting a large live-fire exercise in the increasingly disputed South China Sea. This exercise occurred while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured the region, just prior to the president\u2019s own arrival in Asia.\nVery few policymakers from either party will be willing to cut U.S. air and naval spending in the face of China\u2019s military buildup, particularly with policymakers already struggling with perceptions among Asian allies that U.S. military power in East Asia is waning. But due to the ongoing commitment in Afghanistan, Congress can\u2019t cut ground forces either. To the extent that Congress is serious about making a deal on spending cuts and that a political deal will require cuts in both domestic and Pentagon programs, the tradeoff between Afghan war costs and security and alliance relationships in places like East Asia will become increasingly apparent.\nIn the near-term, the conventional wisdom will be correct: Political gridlock will reinforce the status quo.

Players reported heading the ball more than 400 times a year on average. Those in the top 25% of heading frequency had an average 1,320 headers in a year, and these players were most likely to show injury in regions of the brain that play a role in cognitive functions, including attention, memory, planning, organizing, physical mobility and high-level visual functions.\n\u201cThese are changes in the brain that are similar to those we see with a concussion or TBI,\u201d said Lipton.

For its part, the American Academy of Pediatrics says there isn\u2019t sufficient data to recommend that young players abstain from heading, but does suggest that players minimize contact between head and ball.\nThe new study is small and not peer-reviewed, so it must be considered preliminary. But the author said it was a compelling reason to pursue further study; other experts agreed that more study was necessary to determine what the implications might be for soccer players, especially younger ones who may be more vulnerable to brain injury and for those who practice daily, doing frequent heading drills.\nMore than 250 million people play soccer regularly, according to FIFA, the sport\u2019s international governing body.

Four others -- including two members of NFL security, Joe Hummel and Jeff Miller -- also were requested to attend and testify.\nMost, if not all, of those requested by the NFLPA already have spoken with Goodell during the investigation that charges the Saints with running a \"bounty\" program from 2009 to 2011 in which players pledged money to others to injure opponents. League security tried to arrange interviews with players before discipline was handed down, but all refused.\nSaints linebacker Jonathan Vilma (2012 season), defensive end Will Smith (four games), and former Saints linebacker Scott Fujita (three games) and defensive end Anthony Hargrove (eight games) have all been suspended. They will appeal their cases to Goodell. They have lost two grievance hearings challenging Goodell's jurisdiction to rule on the bounty program. One of those rulings has been appealed.\nA source involved with the players' side said that even after Monday's appeal, the legal maneuvering probably isn't over, meaning more suits could be filed in courts.\nIt's not yet clear if the NFL can compel or will even try to have those requested witnesses at Monday's appeal. The NFL is bound to provide players Friday with the plan it intends to employ at the appeals hearing.\nThe league isn't required to turn over all of its evidence, which the NFLPA asked for in its letter to the NFL on Thursday. Part of that evidence the NFLPA requested was a written declaration from Duke Naiphon, whom the NFLPA said spoke to the NFL during the investigation and provided evidence from several team and defensive meetings during the 2010 season. Multiple league sources have acknowledged the existence of financial documentation of pledges into a \"bounty\" program.\nPlayers have denied being involved in a \"bounty\" program and have argued that the league has provided no evidence linking them to a pay-for-performance program in which they intentionally tried to injure opposing players. The NFL said it has significant evidence linking the players to the program and initially said 22 to 27 players were involved but narrowed those being punished to Vilma, Smith, Hargrove and Fujita because of their supposed leadership roles in the program."}

All opinion polls show that a victory for the candidate of Morena (Movement for National Renewal), Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) is quite likely. However, nothing is certain in Mexico. The ruling class has already used election fraud to cheat AMLO out of winning the elections twice and will certainly try a third time. In this article, the comrades from the Mexican section of the IMT \u2013 La Izquierda Socialista \u2013 explain why they advocate a critical vote for Lopez Obrador, address the limitations of his programme and assert the need to organise to struggle against capitalism (read the original, Spanish-language article here).\nOn Sunday 1 July, one of the most important elections in recent national history will be held. After 30 years of brutal policies against the workers, youth, women, and poor of Mexico, the situation is at boiling point. In order to maintain their regime of exploitation, the bourgeoisie have militarized the country and drowned it in blood. In a distorted form, the candidates express the underlying class struggle: a battle to perpetuate barbarism, or end it.\nIn addition, the purchasing power of wages dropped by 71.5 percent. It is practically impossible to live on the minimum wage as it is not enough to buy basic necessities. Due to tax reform, big businesses are either exempt from taxes or receive rebates; on the other hand, the growing mass of middle-class citizens and white-collar workers pay increased rates.\nAs a result of all this we saw a high concentration of wealth in the handful of companies and families that truly rule the country.\n\u201cIn 1982, per capita GDP in Mexico was higher, for example, than that of South Korea, as well as wages: while those of the Asian country were around 3,925 dollars per year, the Mexican average was 7,762 dollars.\nAccording to the IMF, in 1982 Mexico\u2019s economy was larger than China\u2019s. Adjusted for purchasing power parity, the Mexican economy stood at 488bn dollars, to China\u2019s 390bn. They ranked respectively as the ninth and 10th worldwide. Now that has abruptly changed.\nThis is the result of a policy implemented to deprive the masses of their wealth and resources. Concretely, neoliberalism amounts to cutbacks in social services, the privatization of state enterprises, slashed subsidiaries to the rural areas, and the reduction of state intervention in the economy to a bare minimum. The conclusion of all of this has been an entrenchment of the power of the rich, the creation of a new breed of millionaires who fill their pockets by looting the state, and an open door to the imperialists, particularly the Americans, to flood the market with their surplus products.\nIn order to ensure this regime of super-exploitation, the ruling class had to send the army, the navy, and other repressive bodies to the streets to intimidate the mass movements, militarize whole regions of the country, and murder activists and disobedient journalists. The outpouring of blood engulfed everything, especially the youth. All this was waged in the name of a fictional war against the cartels. The conflict between the cartels and the government spread its rot through the entire political, economic and social structure of the country. The state apparatus cracked in important parts of Mexico, giving way to a situation where the strongest rule. All the while, this situation is a breeding ground for domestic"}

Most do not involve penetrating head wounds but damage hidden inside the skull caused by an explosion's pressure wave. It can range from a mild concussion to severe injury.

The military has said most TBI-injured troops recover with treatment.\n\"There's clearly a whole bunch of people who have mild TBI who have no negative outcomes,\" Rutherford agreed.\n\u25a0 Moderate-to-severe TBI is linked with later-in-life risks including Alzheimer's-like dementia, Parkinson's-like symptoms, seizures, problems with social functioning and unemployment.\n\u25a0 TBI in general is linked to depression, aggressive behavior and post-concussion symptoms such as dizziness and amnesia.\n\u25a0 If mild TBI caused loss of consciousness, a risk of later memory, movement and seizure problems cannot be ruled out.\nThe report recommends that every soldier exposed to a blast, even a low-intensity one, be screened for TBI \u2014 and that everyone get a pre- and post-deployment brain-function test. The military has begun those steps.\nIt also urges the Defense Department to conduct rigorous studies and a VA-run registry of TBI patients to identify long-term risks and factors that improve or worsen outcomes, in comparison to deployed troops with non-brain injuries.\nThe VA said it would consider the recommendations, and it has 60 days to decide whether those long-term disorders will be presumed linked to brain-injured veterans' military service."}

They don\u2019t understand what they should really be looking for in SPF protection and they\u2019re choosing more \u201cnatural\u201d brands because they eschew chemicals \u2014 but they are seriously compromising their protection by doing so.\nAll of that while the incidence of melanoma has dramatically risen to a lifetime risk of one in 50 from one in 75 20 years ago \u2014 a significant 50-per-cent increase.\nSo now that warmer, sunnier days are upon us as we enter full-blown terrasse season, and as national Sun Awareness Week was launched earlier this week, Wang wants Quebecers to know what they need to be thinking about as they venture out on hiking trails, golf courses, bike paths and lakes.\nDan O\u2019Neill is a three-time melanoma survivor and he finds it frustrating to constantly witness people\u2019s lack of vigilance when it comes to protecting themselves in the sun.\n\u201cMelanoma changes your life for sure,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, whose first melanoma diagnosis came 10 years ago when he was 49.

Last but not least is that people don\u2019t apply nearly enough. Based on the quantities most people use, if you\u2019re using 60 SPF you\u2019re probably getting 30 SPF protection.

As Ashley Westerman reports from Washington, D.C., the case does not seek to end the practice of force-feeding at Guantanamo Bay, but rather change the way the procedure is performed.\nThe petitioner in this case, Syrian Abu Wa\u2019el Dhiab, is seeking a preliminary injunction over the way guards force-feed him. A 12-year detainee at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba cleared of charges in 2009, Dhiab has been on a hunger strike for the last seven years in protest of his indefinite imprisonment.\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler heard the two sides\u2019 opening statements and then testimony from two doctors, both of whom had examined Dhiab. On the second day, she heard from testimony from a third doctor and then the government argued its side.\nIn their opening statement, Dhiab\u2019s lawyers argued there is a more humane way to force-feed their client. They would like a medical doctor to be present, for Dhiab to be able to use a wheelchair to get to and from feedings, for a one-point restraint to be used rather than a five-point restraint and, finally, for the feeding tube to be left in for three days at-a-time to reduce what they are say are painful insertions into Dhiab\u2019s nose and throat.\nLawyers representing the Justice Department, however, argued the policies to manage a hunger strike and provide quality medical care are already in place at Guantanamo. They also said that Dhiab has a history of outbursts and kicking prison staffers, making the five-point restraint necessary, and that leaving in a feeding tube for days at a time could cause infection. They also argued Dhiab has been allowed to use a wheelchair since September, and that he would be able to continue do so.\nHawthorne says cases like these, regardless of whether or not they go anywhere, do spark change \u2014 both good and bad. \u201cYou know they made their force-feeding protocols secret last year, as certainly in part as the result of publicity for the inhumane treatment, but also obviously there isn\u2019t as much actual acts of torture or something occurring either, and so that\u2019s change for the better.\u201d The anti-torture campaigner notes one change resulting from this specific case is the court\u2019s willingness to be more open.\nLast week, Judge Kessler denied the U.S. Government\u2019s petition to not only close the hearing entirely to the public, but also ordered the release of video tapes of Guantanamo detainees \u2013 including Dhiab \u2013 being force-fed. The Obama Administration argued both could pose a risk to national security.\nAt a rally on the steps of the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Washington, D.C., before the start of the hearing Monday members from the human rights groups Witness Against Torture and Code Pink sang and held up signs that read, \u201cCLOSE GUANTANAMO PRISON\u201d and \u201cNO SECRET COURTS\u201d.\nPast cases involving Guantanamo detainees have moved slowly through the courts. There is no set date for the judge to issue a ruling in this case."}

Assembly lawmakers already approved it.\nIf Schwarzenegger signs the bill into law, the Riverside County Transportation Commission would be allowed to use a new way to complete major expansion on state Route 91.\nThe project to convert the car pool lanes into express toll lanes and a general use lane in each direction from the Orange County line to Interstate 15 was approved for a process called \u201cdesign-build\u201d by the California Transportation Commission in the spring. Numerous on- and off-ramps will also be expanded.\nThe design-build process allows contractors to submit plans to design and construct each project. Typically, one firm designs a highway and another builds it, with the two tasks bid separately.\nAdding the construction project to a list of 15 other design-build projects around the state allows the state to avoid a legal fight over whether the process can be used for the roadwork.\nWith a price tag of $1.2 billion, the project is slated to be open to traffic in 2016.

Using approximately 100 hours of footage shot on the set of Man on the Moon documenting Carrey's transformation into Kaufman for four months. The VICE Documentary Films production premiered at the 2017 Venice Film Festival and is produced by Academy Award winner Spike Jonze, and VICE Films' Danny Gabai and Brendan Fitzgerald.\nIn 1999 Milos Forman cast Jim Carrey to play cult comedian Andy Kaufman in his biopic Man on the Moon. What followed was an intensely bizarre and emotional film production. Surrounded by Kaufman's friends and family on set, Carrey thoroughly \"became\" Andy and, alternately, Tony Clifton, Kaufman's obnoxious lounge singer alter ego. Much like Kaufman's comedy, Carrey's acting took on a performance art quality during the film. He never broke character on set, the cast and the crew referred to him as either 'Andy' or 'Tony' depending on who he was embodying (he had created complete and separate identities for each). Here's what Lisa Nishimura, VP of Original Documentaries for Netflix, had to say in a statement.\n\"For almost two decades this brilliant performance from Jim Carrey has resonated with audiences and fans of Kaufman's, but the story behind the film, a true piece of entertainment history has remained largely unknown. Chris Smith and Spike Jonze have masterfully unearthed and explored Jim's complex and artful creative process, hurling audiences right into the mind of a genius.\"\nJim Carrey earned critical acclaim and a Golden Globe for the performance, but many of the production's most Kaufmanesque moments played out behind the scenes, thankfully captured on video by Andy's former girlfriend, Lynne Margulies and former writing partner, Bob Zmuda. In Jim & Andy, Carrey looks back at the resulting footage 18 years later, reflecting on how he and Andy came up in oddly parallel universes, his experience channelling Andy and Tony and more broadly the spiritual journey of his career. Here's what Danny Gabai, Executive Creative Director, VICE, had to say in his statement.\n\"VICE is always focused on telling stories you can't see anywhere else, and Chris' film is an incredibly humanistic deep-dive into the mind of a brilliant artist. Chris, Spike and Jim have made a film that makes us question what we really want in the world, and we couldn't be more excited that Netflix is bringing it to the world.\"\nJim & Andy: The Great Beyond - Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton is produced by VICE Documentary Films, the feature-length documentary division from VICE Media. The film is produced by Spike Jonze, Danny Gabai, Brendan Fitzgerald. Executive Producers are Eddy Moretti, Shane Smith, Tony Clifton, Michael Kronish, Jim Czarnecki, and Nicole Montez.

This process is complicated further if you currently have a house that is on the market but are unable to sell it. While most buyers can wait for their current residences to sell, some buyers must relocate and purchase a new house. A bridge loan can provide a short-term solution.\nA bridge loan is a type of short-term loan offered by lenders that allows you to \"bridge\" the gap between the sale of your old residence and the long term financing of your new residence. A bridge loan may give you the funds necessary to purchase and close on your new house. However, it's only a temporary solution. You'll need to obtain conventional mortgage financing once your old residence is sold.\nBridge loans are also used by real estate investors for cash to bid at a foreclosure sale. A bridge loan gives an investor the short-term cash flow she needs to pay for property bought at a judicial foreclosure sale. Once the property is bought, the investor obtains traditional mortgage financing and pay off the bridge loan. In this way, a bridge loan makes it possible for people with limited cash on hand to get into real estate investing.\nBridge loans differ from traditional real estate financing. The loan term is usually six months, but can be up to 12. Interest rates are higher than a fixed-rate mortgage loan, and closing costs can be as high as mortgage loans. Some bridge loans will pay off all liens on your old property, and any money left over is used as a down payment on the new home. Other bridge loans won't pay off liens, and the loan will be a junior mortgage on your old home.\nBridge loans involve some significant risks. Sometimes the old property won't sell, which leaves you with two large loan obligations. Bridge loans may also impose prepayment penalties if you pay the loan off early. If a bridge loan is too risky for you, consider placing a contingency that your house must be sold on any offer you make on new property. If this contingency is unacceptable to the buyer, look for other assets you own that may be liquidated for a down payment or used as collateral for a loan.\nRealtor.com: What Are Bridge Loans?\nM., Shawn. \"How Do I Use a Bridge Loan to Buy a House?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/use-bridge-loan-buy-house-86971.html.

These types of information, such as subscriber location, service preferences and billing relationships, will help developers create \"mashups\" that combine different types of data and capabilities, said Johnson Agogbua, vice president of Global Application Enablement solutions at Alcatel.\nMobile developers often have to adapt their software to each carrier as well as negotiate separate relationships with all the operators they want to carry the application. Alcatel will provide a common mechanism for making applications call upon more than one carrier's information sources. The idea is that the more carriers use Alcatel's platform, the fewer carriers a developer will have to work with individually to get an application out to the market. At the heart of the offering is a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) that developers can use to bring these types of information into their applications.\nAlcatel is offering AES as a turnkey solution for a mobile operator to deploy in its own infrastructure. It is also offering a cloud-based service, called the Open API Service, that provides essentially the same capabilities as AES. The Open API Service saves the carriers the effort of directly supporting developers, according to the company. Along with AES and Open API Service, Alcatel is offering a set of \"transformation services\" to help carriers get the most out of offering mobile applications. They include consulting services focused on business models, application lifecycle management and other areas, Agogbua said.\nAES lets carriers expose certain types of data via a secure \"exposure layer.\" Meanwhile, it gives the service providers tools to monitor application performance, optimize the subscriber's experience and protect user privacy, according to Alcatel.\nAES is network-independent, so it can work with current 3G (third-generation) mobile networks as well as 4G WiMax and LTE (Long-Term Evolution), Agogbua said. It can even extend to wired networks. IP (Internet Protocol) is the necessary common thread, he said. Carriers don't have to have Alcatel hardware in their networks to deploy AES, he added.\nSprint Nextel is already using the Open API Service, and about 21 applications have already been developed through the service. Alcatel is working with several other mobile operators on using AES, he said.\nGamma Engineers, which builds and maintains custom mobile applications for enterprises, plans to use the Open API Service to add features to the applications it builds.\nFor example, the service allows Gamma's applications to tap into location information from mobile operators and use Alcatel's software for geofencing, which triggers events when a user's mobile phone enters a given area. Airlines are testing applications from Gamma that use geofencing to tell them when a passenger is at the airport so an airline representative can meet them, according to Alex George, founder and CEO of the Tampa, Florida, company. Gamma also has other applications in testing in other industries and expects them all to be commercially available next year.\nWithout the Open API Service, Gamma would have to work with each carrier individually to bring location data into an application, George said.\nMany mobile operators want to tap into innovation by outside application developers but find it hard to do so because they are large, complex organizations, said IDC analyst Elisabeth Rainge.

These objects range from the size of a softball to the size of a school bus and are everything from bolts and pieces of exploded satellites to large rockets. Unfortunately, these are only the ones we can track. The number of objects that are thought to exist is closer to 500,000, with sizes that go down to a millimeter. Think of a speck of paint. However, even something this small can produce significant damage if it collides with something else at a very high speed.\nIn this photo released on Jan. 31, 1958 by the United States Department of Defense, Clifford J. Finnie of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology checks instruments inside the U.S. Army's Explorer I satellite.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration regulates things that go up and come down, but not what stays in orbit. So, there are few (if any) rules in space. No real estate deeds as it were. Any domain that has experienced significant geographical sparsity and is mostly unregulated has been subject to lawlessness. This means countries can behave in almost any way in space without consequences, which is not a recipe for a long-term sustainable and safe space environment.\nCouple that with a space renaissance, given the large amount of wealth to be made from space services, capabilities and activities. For example, great entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin and Amazon) and Elon Musk (SpaceX and Tesla) are only a few leading the way in making access to space much cheaper than before. India also is contributing. Last February, India broke the record for launching the largest number of satellites at once: 104. All of this will continue.\nWithout something like environmental protection in space and some global governance for developing norms of good stewardship of space activities, we risk seeing whole regions of space become hard, if not impossible, to use freely and cheaply. We should take a page from our early mining days and how that activity, unregulated, was to the detriment of the environment, including the loss of human lives.\nFurther, the space community does not openly share information on where all objects are located for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the organization providing everyone with a free service of collision warnings is the U.S. Strategic Command. Gen. John Hyten, the agency's commander, has underscored the desire to see the Department of Defense leave the business of space traffic cop to some other entity (for example, the FAA).\nIn this April 25, 1990 photograph provided by NASA, most of the giant Hubble Space Telescope can be seen as it is suspended in space by Discovery's Remote Manipulator System (RMS) following the deployment of part of its solar panels and antennae. This was among the first photos NASA released on April 30 from the five-day STS-31 mission.\nTo deal with this space trash issue, we should create a public-private partnership"}

{"idx": "13896", "prompt": "Continue the following text: These are rich times for scholarship on ubuntu, the Nguni word for humanness often used as a catchphrase for how indigenous southern Africans lived, or for an ethic or grander philosophy that grew out of traditional sub-Saharan lifestyles. There are a variety of different academic approaches to ubuntu in 21st century South Africa.\nThere are some who are traditionalist, expounding the way that ubuntu was understood in the past and recommending its application to the present without much change.\nOther scholars are much more revisionist, holding that several aspects of ubuntu as traditionally understood are neither metaphysically nor morally attractive, but that other facets remain so and should be our exclusive focus. Still others reject ubuntu as an ethic or way of life, maintaining that it is essentially inappropriate for an urban, industrialised, multicultural society.\nThere are, in addition, some academics who in the first instance critically explore what talk about ubuntu currently means for South African society. What does the word \u201cubuntu\u201d connote to different groups? How did they come to speak about it in the way they do? What functions or interests does invoking the term serve (perhaps nefariously) in a particular social context? How does ubuntu compare to other value systems?\nAlthough these divisions among types of ubuntu scholarship are neither exhaustive nor exclusive, two recent works produced by Leonhard Praeg and others part of the Thinking Africa Project at Rhodes University largely fall into the last category. They primarily address how various groups in South Africa have recently spoken, written and thought about ubuntu, although naturally informed by historical understandings of pre-colonial Africa and with an interest in developing a viable ubuntu-based public morality for contemporary South Africa. I first discuss the volume that Praeg edited with Siphokazi Magadla, and then take up his sole-authored book.\nThe sub-title of the collection is Curating the Archive, signifying that it is a record of exchanges among scholars at workshops held in 2012 that is part of a broader attempt to expand discussions of African humanism in the post-independence era. The 10 contributions to the volume address a wide array of topics. I will focus on just two salient themes.\nOne recurrent issue is the relationship between ubuntu and South Africa\u2019s Constitution. Ilze Keevy and Mogobe Ramose agree that the two value systems are incompatible, but for different reasons and with different implications. Keevy prefers the Constitution\u2019s liberal Bill of Rights to the patriarchy, homophobia and parochial spirituality that she deems inherent to ubuntu. In polar opposition, Ramose rejects the Constitution for being anti-African. He especially bemoans the fact that ubuntu was mentioned only in the interim Constitution (of 1993), questions the idea that any body of law should remain above change, and decries what he sees as the fact that South Africa\u2019s particular Constitution has prevented the black majority from obtaining compensatory justice.\nIn contrast to both Keevy and Ramose, Drucilla Cornell and Katherine Furman contend that an ubuntu constitutionalism is a coherent project. According to them, there is no deep tension between, say, the individual rights in the Constitution and the communitarian nature of ubuntu. In fact, according to Cornell, the conception of dignity that she sees at the heart of ubuntu grounds the essentials of South Africa\u2019s Constitution, or at least the way they should be understood.\nThis reader sides with Furman\u2019s"}
{"idx": "13897", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The World Bank's commitment to change its lending practices to the private sector has been called into question by campaigners over a proposed multimillion-dollar loan to a Honduran commercial bank. It comes months after a damning internal investigation into the bank's dealings with a palm oil company in the country.\nIn January, the bank's internal auditor said its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), failed to comply with its own policies and ethical standards when it loaned millions of dollars to Dinant, a Honduran palm oil company with alleged links to assassinations and forced evictions.\nThe bank's compliance adviser/ombudsman (CAO) said staff had been, in effect, encouraged \"to overlook, fail to articulate, or even conceal potential environmental, social and conflict risk\".\nAfter a relatively unapologetic initial response, the IFC, which lends to companies in developing countries, acknowledged there had been \"shortcomings\" in how it had implemented its policies. It said it would not disburse further funding to Dinant until the company strengthened its environmental and social standards and reviewed its security practices. It also accepted that it must look in greater detail at the wider context of its investments.\nCampaigners say a proposed $15m (\u00a39m) loan to commercial bank Davivienda in Honduras suggests the IFC has not learned its lessons from the Dinant affair. Twenty-eight international and Honduran NGOs and civil society groups have written to the World Bank's board expressing concerns over the proposed investment, which has been classified by the lender as \"medium risk\", despite admissions that potential impacts could include child labour and land disputes.\n\"Given the highly sensitive context in the wake of IFC's Dinant investment, the risk of human rights violations and the history of land conflicts in Honduras, we find it disturbing that this project is not classified as high risk,\" says the letter, whose signatories include Oxfam, ActionAid, Madre Tierra and Eurodad (European Network on Debt and Development). \"This loan proposal provides a test case for the IFC to demonstrate that it is learning lessons from the Dinant experience.\"\nThe organisations point to IFC project documents that list, as potential risks associated with the investment, pollution, child labour, land disputes, and impacts on indigenous and other vulnerable communities.\nThey say the lender should fully investigate and disclose whether there are any links between Davivienda and Dinant, noting that the CAO is investigating another Honduran bank and its relationship with the agribusiness giant.\nDinant is the largest landowner in the Bajo Agu\u00e1n valley, where it has been accused of links to assassinations and forced evictions. The CAO cites allegations that 102 members of peasant associations in the Bajo Agu\u00e1n have been murdered in the past five years.

On big tech campuses, like Facebook and Google, there were protests, rallies, and boycotts. Of the hundred-some companies that signed an amicus brief protesting the decision, most were tech companies. This sudden political awakening, some argued, was confirmation of tech\u2019s liberal slant. Of course the young employees who populate the Valley bleed blue.\nHere\u2019s the other interpretation of what inspired the top rungs of tech companies to stick their necks out in protest: America\u2019s tech industry is wholly reliant on immigrants. Big name founders, from eBay\u2019s Pierre Omidyar to Elon Musk, are immigrants. If you count the first-generation offspring of immigrants, the number grows. (Let\u2019s all remember that Steve Jobs is the child of a Syrian refugee.) Last year, the National Foundation for American Policy released a study of the startups that were worth over a billion dollars. More than half had at least one founder who was an immigrant. When the authors expanded the search to senior, non-founding roles, that number rose to 71 percent.\nInnovation is bred when diverse viewpoints intersect, and that only happens if you can get all of those diverse ideas in the room. As Silicon Valley has emerged as a beacon for the most groundbreaking companies, its ability retain its ordination is reliant on attracting a steady supply of the best ideas\u2014regardless of their country of origin.\nThanksgiving, like the tech industry, would not exist without immigration. So, in celebration of the upcoming holiday, Backchannel is running a series of portraits of what the immigrant experience looks like in America\u2014as seen through the lens of tech. Miranda Katz looks at how the promise of the gig economy left one immigrant lukewarm, while Scott Rosenberg looks at a new founder who hopes her outsider\u2019s viewpoint will fuel a meteoric rise. Steven Levy looks at the guy with the hardest job in tech: Uber\u2019s newly minted CEO, who fled from Iran with his parents. And I write about an IT worker who found notoriety in an unexpected place: maneuvering the H-1B visa process. Individually, they show meaning in a single life, but together they illuminate the varied roles that people from outside the US play in creating the most American things.\nPoliticians make a lot of wild claims about undocumented immigrants in the United States.

{"idx": "13904", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: People with a common form of hearing loss not helped by hearing aids achieved significant and sometimes profound improvements in their hearing and understanding of speech with hybrid cochlear implant devices, according to a new multicenter study led by specialists at NYU Langone Medical Center.\nIn the study, described online ahead of print in the journal The Laryngoscope July 7, researchers at 10 medical centers and private clinics in the United States implanted hybrid cochlear implants into one ear of 50 men and women. All study volunteers had badly damaged high-frequency, inner-ear hair cells, which prevented them from understanding speech, especially in the presence of background noise. All still had sufficient low-frequency hearing, which allowed them to tell apart some sounds and forestalled any use of a regular cochlear implant.\nA year after receiving the device, 45 study participants showed overall improvement in their hearing and speech recognition, and no one's hearing and speech recognition got worse.\n\"Our study offers early evidence that potentially millions more people with high-frequency hearing loss, who cannot benefit from a hearing aid, could instead possibly benefit from a hybrid cochlear implant,\" says lead study investigator J. Thomas Roland, MD, the Mendik Foundation Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at NYU Langone. Roland, who also serves as co-director of NYU Langone's cochlear implant program, has nearly 30 years of experience in research and caring for people with the devices, which were first approved for use in the United States in 1984, and he has installed many hybrid implants, which were approved for adults by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014.\nThe hybrid implant differs from the traditional device in that it has a shorter electrode (less than 2 centimeters long) that does not have to be inserted as deeply into the spiral-shaped sensory structure (the cochlea) in the inner ear. When placed correctly, the technique preserves more residual, natural, low-frequency hearing and augments high-frequency hearing with electrical stimulation.\nThe National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that some 26 million American adults between the ages of 20 and 69 suffer from some loss of high-frequency hearing, which makes speech recognition especially difficult.\nAccording to Roland, the loss of high-frequency hearing had left all study participants \"in a difficult spot.\" Many were failing at work and in social environments because of their inability to hear and understand speech.\nRoland says hearing aids were not an option for them because the sound-amplifying tools cannot sufficiently raise high-frequency sounds to improve understanding of speech, especially when there is any kind of background noise.\nAmong the study participants, 15 with total loss of high-frequency hearing and moderate loss of low-frequency hearing saw improvements in standard tests of their ability to understand set phrases and sentences read back to them. Their scores for correctly identifying spoken words and phrases rose from a baseline average of 21 percent before implantation to 67 percent a year after implantation and activation of their device.\nFor 14 other study participants with severe or total loss of their residual low-frequency hearing, test scores for correctly identifying certain spoken words and phrases improved from 12 percent to 54 percent, and from 14 percent to 35 percent, respectively.

She fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel to avoid deportation and grabbed global attention by mounting a social media campaign for asylum.\nHer case highlighted the cause of women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia, where several women fleeing abuse by their families have been caught trying to seek asylum abroad in recent years and returned home. Human rights activists say many similar cases go unreported.\nAlqunun is flying to Toronto via Seoul, South Korea, according to Thai immigration Police Chief Surachate Hakparn. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed his country had granted her asylum.\n\u201cThat is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights and to stand up for woman\u2019s rights around the world and I can confirm that we have accepted the U.N.\u2019s request,\u201d Trudeau said.\nSeveral other countries, including Australia, had been in talks with the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency to accept Alqunun, Surachate said earlier in the day.\nCanada\u2019s ambassador had seen her off at the airport, Surachate said, adding that she looked happy and healthy.\nShe thanked everyone for helping her, he said, and added that the first thing she would do upon arrival in Canada would be to start learning the language. She already speaks more than passable English, in addition to Arabic.\nShe barricaded herself in an airport hotel room and took her plight onto social media. It got enough public and diplomatic support that Thai officials admitted her temporarily under the protection of U.N. officials, who granted her refugee status Wednesday.\nAlqunun\u2019s father arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday, but his daughter refused to meet with him. Surachate said the father \u2014 whose name has not been released \u2014 denied physically abusing Alqunun or trying to force her into an arranged marriage, which were among the reasons she gave for her flight. He said Alqunun\u2019s father wanted his daughter back but respected her decision.\nNo country, including the U.S., spoke out publicly in support of Canada in that spat with the Saudis.\nOn Friday, Trudeau avoided answering a question about what the case would mean for relations with the kingdom, but he said Canada will always unequivocally stand up for human rights and women\u2019s rights around the world.\nCanadian officials were reluctant to comment further until she landed safely in Canada.\nAlqunun had previously said on Twitter that she wanted to seek refuge in Australia.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne met Thursday with senior Thai officials in Bangkok.

The parents from Utah are currently being tried in court for the purportedly brutal way they treated their own kid.\nBased on court documents, the police were called to the home of the Costellos located in Ogden, Utah. When they arrived, the authorities were horrified to see the child\u2019s lifeless body on the floor of an empty room. Brenda Emile and Miller could face the death penalty if proven guilty of aggravated murder, the Daily News reported.\nAngelina was wrapped in a blanket, and when one of the officers approached her gaunt body, she was so shocked that she suddenly found herself backing up against a wall.\nAccording to The Salt Lake Tribune, Sitka Hrabal, an Ogden police officer, testified on Feb. 9 that she could not believe that the girl was 3-years-old. In court, she described Angelina Costello\u2019s body when she first saw it.\nThe little girl\u2019s small frame was full of bruises and cuts, and there were even fresh burn marks when she was found. Hrabal added that the toddler\u2019s facial features were sunken in and devoid of any fat or muscle, likely because of severe malnutrition.\nIt was believed that the parents also attempted to conceal the 3-year-old\u2019s injuries by applying makeup on her body.\n\u201cOfficers on scene immediately recognized the child victim had bruising, contusions, lacerations, burns, open sores and abrasions all over her face, hands, legs, head and neck,\u201d the court papers read.\nThe severity of Angelina\u2019s injuries was further revealed when Richard Childress, the detective who supervised the autopsy, testified that seeing the toddler\u2019s emaciated body, while being examined, made him think of the children in concentration camps and poverty-stricken Third World countries.\nChildress said that the girl\u2019s condition cannot even really be described as severe malnutrition. Looking at it, he thinks \u201cstarvation\u201d is the better word for it.\nAt the time of her death, Angelina only weighed 13.67 pounds which is equivalent to the normal weight of a 3-month-old infant. As for the extent of her injuries, the detective narrated that the girl suffered from massive hemorrhage to the back of her head and had internal injuries.\nIn her death certificate, blunt force trauma and starvation were listed as causes of her demise.\nDuring the court hearing on Friday, Feb. 9, Christopher Shaw, Deputy Weber County Attorney told a judge that the girl lived a life of torture. To back his claims, he showed video clips as evidence.\nThe videos were obtained from mobile phone devices of the suspects, Emile and Miller Costello. The clips revealed Angelina\u2019s deteriorating condition as time passes by.\nIn one clip, the girl was shown being punished by her parents. The suspects gave her food but snatched it away before she could eat it. Another video showed the 23-year-old mother eating and holding out a piece of food in front of her daughter\u2019s mouth.\nPolice believe that the girl endured the abuse for 18 months until her body could no longer bear it and died.

They can listen to a customer\u2019s needs and help filter through a long list of choices, prompting the user for relevant information as required. They can use a customer\u2019s stated goal to perform more accurate search. They can inject whimsy into a process. And they can gather targeted feedback during an interaction.\nConsider a hybrid approach. If an existing shopping experience is working, you might include a helpful bot to answer questions off to the side and let the user navigate your inventory as they currently do.\nA chatbot needs to know about your business, and it needs to communicate what it learns to the appropriate employees. The worst way to accomplish that is to expect everyone to come to the bot. Don\u2019t give your chatbot an explicit product list that\u2019s certain to continually fall out of date. Connect it to your existing product database. Don\u2019t tell the sales team to log into a chatbot administration console to see what leads have come in. Export those directly to the existing sales management tools in use at your business. A well designed chatbot should fit naturally into your business setting like a new employee.\nHumans will invariably ask questions you didn\u2019t predict during design. Even the fanciest machine learning models powering your bot will make mistakes. Build expectations of failure into your bot. A user should always have an easy method to restart a conversation or back up to a previous stage. If the bot gets confused, it should fail gracefully. Politely ask the user to state what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. Sometimes a clearer explanation can get the bot back on track. If not, log the user\u2019s goal and add new branches to the chatbot later to deal with this case. If you can reliably catch the tasks that a user failed to accomplish, you\u2019ll have the data to make the most impactful updates next time you upgrade the bot.\nYour chatbot is a face of your organization and an opportunity to delight or enrage existing and prospective customers. Just like an employee will tailor their language to a customer\u2019s tone, a chatbot needs to be aware of the reactions it is eliciting. Simply conveying concern and understanding towards a frustrating situation can go a long way towards allevi"}

My child was not with me at the time of the accident. Do I need to replace the car seat?\nAnswer: First of all I\u2019m sorry to hear about your accident, and hope that everyone was OK. You\u2019ve got a great question because many people do not think about the fact that they may need to replace their car seat after an accident, especially if the child is not with you. If your child is not in the car seat at the time of the accident, the car seat still goes through forces of the crash and is affected.\nThere are several things that I go through with parents after an accident. First is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s position on child restraint re-use after crashes. If you answer yes to any of the following questions, you should replace your car seat.\n1. Was the vehicle towed from the scene of the accident?\n2. Was the impact of the accident at the door nearest the car seat?\n3. Was anyone in the vehicle transported to the hospital?\n4. Were any of the vehicle air bags deployed?\n5. Is there any visible damage to the car seat?\nIf you answer no to all of those questions, you still need to check with your car seat manufacturer to see what their policy is on replacing car seats after an accident. Some manufacturers say you need to replace after even a minor crash. Work with the auto insurance company on the car seat replacement process. Each company requires different steps to replace your car seat after an accident.\nMichelle Armstrong is coordinator of Safe Kids Wausau Area through Aspirus Wausau Hospital.

Naseer and his accomplices entered the country on student visas and then quickly dropped out of the university where they had been enrolled.\nAfter returning briefly to Peshawar, Pakistan in 2008, about the same time that Zazi was getting explosives and weapons training there, Naseer went back to the United Kingdom to finish planning for the shopping mall attack in Manchester.\nIn early April 2009, according to prosecutors, Naseer told his al-Qaeda handler that he was planning a large \"wedding'' for the upcoming Easter holiday, coded language for an attack.\nThe terror threat is once again dominating U.S. and world events, just more than a week after Islamic State operatives launched coordinated attacks in Paris, killing at least 130 people.\nAnd last Friday, 20 people were killed in a terror attack on a western hotel in Mali.\nThe attacks prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a world-wide travel warning, while local law enforcement authorities across the U.S. were urged to review their plans to guard against mass shooting attacks."}

Missiles struck a scientific research facility, alleged to have been used in the production of chemical and biological weapons, in the capital, Damascus, along with two other sites near the city of Homs.\nThe political backlash is predictable and perfectly understandable. Labour \u2013 along with the SNP \u2013 had demanded that parliament be given a vote on whether the United Kingdom should get involved in military action.\nMay was perfectly entitled to make the commitment she did without consulting MPs, though, given the House of Commons had a say on previous occasions when the matter of intervention in Syria arose, members may be forgiven for feeling the same courtesy should have been extended on this occasion.

More and more professionals agree that a better strategy is to explore and fine tune your assumptions before declaring a specific plan with financial projections based only on your dream and passion.\nIn the process, you may save yourself considerable re-work and money, or even decide that your dream needs more time to mature, before you commit your limited resources, or sign up with investors to a painful and unsatisfying plan.\nA new venture is a means, not an end. A new enterprise should be pursued primarily to help you achieve your goals, like providing a better life for others, satisfying a passion of yours, or enjoying the benefits of a technology you have invented. In that context, it could be a social enterprise, or even a hobby, and a business plan may not be beneficial.\nDon't start by committing more than you can afford to lose. New ventures are usually exploratory and risky in nature, so don't let any business plan process convince you to commit more than you can risk as a person, if your exploration fails. Start with an effectual approach, which evaluates risk tolerance, and suggests more affordable means to an end.\nPick a domain where you have some experience and expertise. Don't handicap yourself by starting something for which you have to build or acquire knowledge, skills, and connections from scratch. No business plan will save you if you are just picking ideas at random, or copying others, just because the story sounds attractive.\nCarry out reality checks and make appropriate plans. Before a business plan has any validity, some work is required to validate that your technology works, a real market exists, and your assumptions for cost and price are reasonable. Don't be totally driven by your own passions, the emotional enthusiasm of friends, or even third-party research.\nThe only reliable test is a real one. Market research techniques for trying to predict the market's response to a new venture can be costly and are often unreliable. Testing for real is the assumption behind approaches such as Lean Startup. It is also what explorers do - they go and look, instead of trying to predict from a distance what they will find.\nGet started and get some momentum. Too much hesitation will kill any new venture, as markets move quickly and difficulties mount. Getting started helps to generate momentum and the sense of having done something, which provides encouragement, more incentive to keep going, and can carry your startup over obstacles. Early perseverance pays off.\nAccept uncertainty as the norm. You will never remove all uncertainties, so accept them, and plan your activities in an incremental fashion. Too often, a business plan is seen as a mechanism for eliminating uncertainty, lulling the Founder into complacency. Eliminate major uncertainties before the plan, and update any plan as you learn.\nLook for new and best opportunities. Many useful opportunities are either created by what you do early, or are only revealed once you have started and can see out there. So keep your eyes open and respond to new customers, new markets, and new partnerships. You will also find that looking hard also eliminates opportunities that are not acceptable.\nBuild and use social capital. Social capital is people and connections. No entrepreneur can survive as an island. Social capital is as important as financial capital for all ventures. As with all capital, you can use only as much as you have acquired to date. If you have no social capital, no business plan will likely get you the financial capital you need.\nAcquire the relevant skills. Three basic skill sets are"}

But he was not the 5-foot-7-inch Smoot who was rolled end-over-end to measure the length of the Massachusetts Avenue bridge.\nThat distinction belongs to Oliver R. Smoot Jr., a 1962 MIT graduate, whom George Smoot describes as a distant relative on his website. In October 1958, the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity used Oliver Smoot, the shortest pledge that fall, to measure the distance across the bridge, the route from the fraternity house in Boston to the main campus in Cambridge. The result: 364.4 smoots -- markings that the fraternity repaints annually.\nGeorge Smoot didn't arrive at MIT until a few years later.

The company received a $43 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy last August.\n\"This latest failure is a sharp reminder that DOE has fallen well short of delivering the stimulus jobs that were promised,\" Florida Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns said in a statement Sunday night. \"Now taxpayers find themselves millions of more dollars in the hole.\"\nStearns is leading an investigation into the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received a $535 million government loan guarantee last year. The Beacon bankruptcy will likely add fuel to the probe.\nBut the DOE was careful to draw distinctions between Beacon Power and Solyndra.\nDOE spokesman Damien LaVere noted Monday that, unlike Solyndra, which closed up shop on the day they declared bankruptcy, Beacon has an operational facility in Stephentown, N.Y., which has long term contracts that it can use to generate money.\nIn addition, the company has cash reserves, and the government is first in line to get paid back.\n\"Protecting taxpayer dollars remains the top priority for Secretary (Stephen) Chu and the Department, which is why we were careful to include many protections for the taxpayer in the loan guarantee for the Stephentown project,\" LaVere said in a statement.\nBeacon did not return calls and an e-mail seeking comment.\nThe company makes an advanced flywheel that is used to store electricity until it is needed by the grid.\nThe device works by suspending a large carbon cylinder between two magnets in a vacuum-sealed tube. When the grid has excess power, the devices are spun. They require some electricity to get them spinning and, thanks to the magnets and vacuum, remain in motion with relatively little energy loss.\nWhen the grid needs extra power, the spinning cylinders are used to generate it.\nThe devices are used by utilities to prevent blackouts. Instead of having to build new power plants that are only used when power usage is greatest, such as during hot summer days when air conditioners draw large amounts of energy, they can build a plant using these devices.\nBeacon's facility in New York is one such plant. It can store 20 megawatts of power, about one-50th the output of a nuclear reactor.\nDeveloping a good energy storage system is also essential if power sources such as wind or solar, which do not work when there is no breeze or at night, are to be more widely adopted.\nBut Beacon's finances came under pressure thanks to low rates government regulators forced it to charge utilities.\nAs a regulated industry, utilities were only allowed to pay a fixed rate set by government regulators for Beacon's services, the DOE said. The rate was not high enough for the company to survive.\nThe low price of natural gas, which could be used to generate additional power and therefore competes with energy storage, was also a factor.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently increased the rates companies such as Beacon can charge, but the hike has yet to take effect, the DOE said.\nEven if the government doesn'"}

It can even salvage \u201ctrees of green,\u201d \u201cskies of blue\u201d and \u201cclouds of white\u201d from the junk heap of pop inanity.\nMr. Bennett, who turns 80 tomorrow, has steadfastly remained the embodiment of heart in popular music. He pours it into every note he sings and every phrase he swings with a sophistication that deepens his unguarded emotional directness. In the polluted sea of irony, bad faith and grotesque attitudinizing that pop music has become, he is a rock of integrity.\nThat integrity has carried him through the ups, downs and ups of a musical career that now spans more than half a century. After the death of Frank Sinatra in 1998, Mr. Bennett immediately became the leading caretaker of the literate American song tradition that runs from Kern to Ellington to Rodgers. You couldn\u2019t ask for a more reverent keeper of the flame.\nCareers that last as long and have been as distinguished as Mr. Bennett\u2019s have something to tell us about collective cultural experience over decades. It has been said that Sinatra\u2019s journey from skinny, starry-eyed \u201cFrankie,\u201d strewing hearts and flowers, to the imperious, volatile Chairman of the Board roughly parallels an American loss of innocence. As Sinatra entered his noir period in the mid-1950\u2019s, his romantic faith gave way to a soul-searching existentialism that yielded the most psychologically complex popular music ever recorded. Following a similar arc, the country grew from a nation of hungry dreamers fleeing the Depression and fighting \u201cthe good war\u201d into an arrogant empire drunk on power and angry at the failure of the American dream to bring utopia.\nMr. Bennett is something else altogether. A native New Yorker and man of the people, he never strayed far from his working-class roots in Astoria, Queens, where he was born Anthony Benedetto. Although he came out of the same tradition of Mediterranean balladry as Sinatra, he retained the innocence and joie de vivre of his youth. Disappointment is not in his vocabulary. We don\u2019t go to him for psychological complexity, but for refreshment and reassurance that life is good.\nBelieving in the power of art to ennoble ordinary lives, he sings what he feels with a rare mixture of humility and pride: humility in the face of the daunting popular-song tradition he treasures and pride that he is recognized as its custodian. Gratitude and joy, gruffness and beauty balance each other perfectly in singing that has grown more rhythmically acute with each passing year.\nTo attend a Tony Bennett concert is to find yourself in the presence of a performer who exudes a rough-hewn natural elegance, devoid of airs. Singing a song like \u201cMood Indigo,\u201d he transmutes its sadness into the exuberance of a man who acknowledges having the blues but embraces resilience. He can still end a song like \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d or \u201cHow Do You Keep the Music Playing?\u201d with an old-fashioned, quasi-operatic crescendo, but he makes these corny triumphal endings stick in your heart.\nLate next month, Columbia Records will release \u201cTony Bennett: Duets/"}
{"idx": "13959", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: How Much More Expensive are Electric Cars?\nElectric cars are enjoying a surge in popularity right now and becoming an increasingly common sight on the roads. This is largely due to the Government\u2019s clean air plans and the planned 2040 ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars, but also the wide range of excellent electric vehicles available and the various incentives for making the switch.\nWhile more and more motorists are starting to make the switch and join the electric car revolution, there are also those that remain hesitant. One of the main reasons for this is the perceived cost of buying electric and how much more expensive they are than regular cars.\nMuch like regular cars, the cost will vary drastically depending on the manufacturer, model etc. The cheapest can be found for around \u00a314,000, whilst a top of the range Tesla will cost over \u00a3100,000. The best selling electric car, the Nissan Leaf, starts at around \u00a321,000.\nThe best way to gauge how much more expensive these cars are is to compare electric and non-electric models from one manufacturer. As an example, BMW\u2019s highly rated i3 is a subcompact available from \u00a333,340. The subcompact 1 Series is the obvious comparison, with this car available from \u00a321,460 when you buy new. Other BMW models that are cheaper than the i3 include the 2 Series (sports car), X1 (SUV) and 3 Series (mid-size) amongst a few other popular models of various sizes. These are all to buy new and will be cheaper to buy used, but you will also need an extended warranty from a specialist like ALA.\nIt is clear then that it is much cheaper to buy a regular car and even when purchased new. However, this can be misleading because they can actually be much more cost efficient in the long run. You are exempt from road tax when you purchase an all-electric, you can avoid charges like the Congestion Charge (which are becoming more common in major cities) and the running costs are significantly lower \u2013 you will pay about a quarter of the cost per mile as charging is so cheap compared to fuel. In addition to this, you can also receive a Government grant of up to \u00a34,500 to buy electric.\nWhile it is true that it can cost a lot more to buy an electric car than a regular car (particularly when it is in a similar class), the savings that you can make in the long run make them the smarter financial investment and especially when you consider the upcoming 2040 ban and increasing number of charges on polluting vehicles."}

High profile musicians including Glasgow violinist Nicola Benedetti have joined the campaign.\nParents and young musicians have campaigned against local authority cuts for the past year. Some councils have raised existing tuition fees for instruments - some to as high as \u00a3524 a year - while others have introduced them for the first time or started charging for the hire of local authority instruments. Others, like Midlothian, unveiled plans to axe instrument tuition entirely for those not taking a Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) exam in the subject - but made a u-turn following strong opposition.\nMr Riddiough said: \"Fees in state schools are wrong. They are divisive. They exclude some children. Children who have access to the specialist tuition in small groups will arrive in 4th year at secondary school with a huge advantage over children who have been priced out. SQA music exams assess competence in two musical instruments. This tuition needs to start in primary school. We have known this in Scotland for decades.\"\nIt emerged in November that 1,200 fewer children were learning an instrument in Scotland than a year earlier. According to figures from the Improvement Service, the national organisation tasked with driving up standards in local authorities, there were 60,326 pupils learning an instrument in Scotland in 2017/18, down from 61,615 the previous year.\nMr Riddiough added that Section 3 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 states that local authorities shall not charge fees for the provision of education. In January, an investigation by Holyrood\u2019s education committee stated that music tuition in Scotland\u2019s schools should be provided free of charge. It recommended children should not have to pay fees to learn a musical instrument \u201cin principle\u201d, but admitted it could not force local authorities to change their policies.\nHe said: \"Teaching children to play musical instruments is education, and this was confirmed by the report of the Scottish Parliament's Education and Skills Committee issued in January 2019, which also recommended that these lessons be provided without levying fees. It is not right that an important education service is allowed to fall through the cracks of our public finances.

Some feared that decade of growth would be lost.\nToday, the region as a whole has bounced back from the 1997-98 crisis and is better equipped to deal with financial emergencies. Banking is more transparent, corporations are better managed, poverty rates have dropped and the region's collective economic growth has doubled.\nStill, the recovery has been uneven. The three countries hit hardest by the crisis that began July 2, 1997 - Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea - have charted sharply divergent paths over the last 10 years, reflecting their differing responses to the crisis and policies since then.\nSouth Korea, which received a humiliating $58 billion bailout arranged by the International Monetary Fund, quickly cleaned up its banking system and started reforming its heavily indebted family-owned conglomerates. The economy shrank and the jobless rate soared, but by 1999 it was robustly growing again.\nThe crisis, while painful, forced South Korea to make changes that paved the way for more stable long-term growth. Today, it is one of Asia's powerhouses, led by Samsung Electronics Co. - the world's biggest memory chip maker - and Hyundai Motor Co.\nIndonesia, however, has struggled. The crisis helped bring about the downfall of former dictator Suharto and greater political freedom, but the economy remains beset by rampant corruption, a weak legal system and limited foreign investment. Economic growth has been ticking along at about 5.5 percent the last two years, but unemployment is rising.\nThailand hovers somewhere in between. Bangkok, where hundreds of skyscrapers froze in mid-construction when the crisis erupted, now has an elevated Skytrain, a subway, a brand new airport and dozens of glitzy malls. Japanese investment has made Thailand a major auto and electronics exporting hub.\nBut a rise in the baht and political uncertainty caused by a tainted election in 2006 and military coup last September has dragged on growth.\nIn the wake of the crisis, Thai authorities shut down dozens of insolvent financial firms, vastly improved banking supervision and updated archaic bankruptcy laws. However, it can still take years for creditors to pursue claims, and further reforms of laws governing bankruptcy and repossession of assets from recalcitrant debtors haven't gone beyond the drafting stage.\nInvestors got a flashback to the 1997 crisis in December when the Thai central bank imposed capital controls in an attempt to weaken the currency, sending stocks plummeting 15 percent in one day and rattling regional markets.\nAuthorities quickly exempted stocks and foreign direct investment from the rules, helping the market bounce back. Investors were also reassured to know that Thailand had $65 billion in foreign currency reserves, far more than in 1997.\nStill, Thailand's bungled effort to impose capital controls underscore the lingering challenges that Asia's emerging economies face in handling international money flows in search of higher returns.\nIt was the dramatic outflow of funds from Thailand that forced the central bank on July 2, 1997, to finally cut the baht's peg to the dollar, causing the Thai currency to plummet, trigger"}

Neither decision appears to be very good law, but it's the former decision that takes the prize for bad logic and dangerous results.\nJustice Paul Stevens wrote the decision in the 6-3 ruling in the case of Atkins v. Virginia, arguing that because in the last few years several states have outlawed the execution of mentally retarded convicts, therefore \"it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.\"\nBut in the first place, it's not clear that any such \"national consensus\" exists. Of the 38 states that allow capital punishment, 18 have laws that bar the execution of retardates. That means that 20 states do not have such laws. In other words, the majority of states that practice capital punishment have little or no problem with executing the mentally retarded. Those that do don't always agree as to who's retarded, how to tell, or who should decide. Hence, there is no \"national consensus.\"\nIn the second place, it's by no means clear what a \"national consensus\" has to do with whether a practice is constitutional. If there were a \"national consensus\" that only certain ethnic minority members should be executed, would the Court uphold that? Fifty years ago, when the Warren Court played mumblety-peg with the Constitution, it routinely overrode the existing \"national consensus\" on a whole series of issues. Many of its decisions were legal garbage, but the whole point of having a Supreme Court composed of unelected judges who hold their seats for life is so they can defy \"national consensus\" when it violates the Constitution.\nBut Justice Stevens appealed to the Constitution as well, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of \"excessive\" bail and fines and \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" But this principle applies to the retarded only if you assume that their culpability in capital crimes is less than that of mentally normal criminals. Justice Stevens merely asserts that such is the case: \"Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment and control of their impulses, however, they [the retarded] do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.\"\nIn most cases involving retarded defendants, that's probably not true. It may be true in cases in which the defendant is so retarded he probably wasn't able to commit the crime at all, but in the case before the Court, of Daryl Renard Atkins, with an IQ of 59, it clearly was not true. Atkins with an accomplice kidnapped a man, robbed him at an ATM machine, and then, as Justice Stevens described the crime, \"took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.\" Atkins, in other words, was bright enough to know to try to hide his crime. How is he less culpable than any other murderer?\nOf course, if the retarded are \"less culpable\" than normal people, why are they allowed to be free at all? They're still capable of murdering people, robbing them and causing all sorts of damage and injury. If they're just too dim to avoid doing so, they belong in institutions, not on the streets. Moreover, if mental retardates shouldn't be executed for the capital crimes they commit, why should"}

Bin Laden has been portrayed as a spoiled rich kid discombobulated by the sudden oil wealth of his native Saudi Arabia; as a religiously motivated visionary who sought to fracture the space-time continuum and return to the seventh century, when Islam was born; as a former ally of the United States in the fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan, outraged by the presence of American troops on Arabian soil; as the media-savvy creator of a global terror brand; and as a superannuated jihadist who spent his days solving quarrels among his three wives. But while all of these stories are dramatically compelling, and most of them are true, none of them explain why Bin Laden was any different from tens of thousands of other jihadists\u2014or how he was able to topple America from its position of primacy in the Middle East.\nWhat made Bin Laden so influential among his fellow jihadists before Sept. 11 was his unique strategy for turning the world\u2019s only superpower\u2014the \u201cfar enemy\u201d\u2014into a tool that could be used to reshape the Middle East in a way that would undermine the Arab regimes\u2014\u201cthe"}

Manchester kept selling the powerful synthetic narcotic anyway.\nManchester, 27, went to prison for selling drugs that proved lethal \u2014 a \"death-resulting\" charge that prosecutors are using more frequently as they battle the opioid epidemic.\n\"He had no pause from what he had done, knowing full well he had killed that girl,\" said Jon DeLena, the assistant special agent in charge in New Hampshire for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. \"It didn't slow him down at all.\"\nThe DEA points to the Manchester case as a victory, but it also highlights the challenges for law enforcement agencies as they seek to curb the spread of fentanyl. Manchester, a small-time dealer who was using his own product, was part of a wave of addiction that has worsened as the drugs have evolved, with fentanyl posing special problems because it is extremely potent, easily transported and highly desired.\nAs President Trump prepares to declare the opioid epidemic a national crisis, the law enforcement community is racing to contain the spread of fentanyl, which has largely replaced heroin on the streets here in opioid-ravaged New England and is increasingly the cause of fatal overdoses nationwide.\nThe drug crisis is both a law enforcement issue and a public health emergency, a decentralized disaster that authorities under\u00adstand they cannot solve with handcuffs and prison bars alone. Because the drug abusers often are themselves the dealers, the localized drug networks turn police work into a game of whack-a-mole.\nMuch of the fentanyl that winds up in New England is manufactured in Mexico using precursor materials obtained from China, the DEA says. It is then smuggled into the United States.\nSome of the illicit fentanyl arrives via the mail. Last week the Justice Department announced charges against two Chinese nationals who sold fentanyl to Americans via the Internet.\nThe opioid crisis here didn't pop up overnight. Residents of the region have always been heavy users of prescription opioid painkillers, DeLena said. The drug cartels realized that this was a ripe market for heroin.\n\"It was garbage heroin: It was 17, 18 percent purity,\" DeLena said, noting that about two years ago drug dealers began mixing fentanyl into the heroin supply to boost its purity and potency. \"They started telling people they had a new, cleaner version of heroin. China White, they were calling it.\"\nLegally manufactured for medical use, fentanyl can be a godsend for patients in extreme pain, including people at the end of life.

{"idx": "13982", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: As law enforcement and security experts from across the world start investigating who was behind the massive outbreak of the WannaCry ransomware, one clue has got them salivating. It points to North Korea.\nThe clue lies in the code. Google security researcher Neel Mehta posted a mysterious tweet linking to two samples of malware: one was WannaCry, the other a creation of a gang of hackers called the Lazarus Group, which has been linked to the catastrophic 2014 hack of Sony and a record $81 million cyber theft from a Bangladeshi bank. Lazarus was also said to be North Korean, according to previous analyses by numerous security firms.\nAfter Mehta's post, Kaspersky Lab probed the code, as did Proofpoint security researcher Darien Huss and founder of Comae Technologies Matthieu Suiche. All have been actively investigating and defending the web against WannaCry and were intrigued at the possible link to North Korea.\nAll believe that Mehta's find could provide a clue as to the possible creators of WannaCry, which borrowed from an NSA hacking tool to infect as many as 200,000 systems, causing serious delays and downtime at hospitals in the U.K. and taking out Nissan and Renault car factories, amongst other issues. But, they all note, it could be a false flag purposefully lodged in the code to lead everyone down the wrong path.\nMehta and the researchers who pounced on her find said that a chunk of WannaCry was 100 per cent the same as a slice of Contopee, the malware used by the Lazarus Group. WannaCry was from February 2017, Contopee from the same month in 2015. The apparently copied code was used in both malware samples for a random code generation feature; it would generate a random number between 0 and 75. That would be used to encode data, putting some obfuscation around the malware's operation to help it avoid detection by security tools.\nBased solely on the copied code, Kaspesky Lab said it was \"the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry.\" Director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab, Costin Raiu, told Forbes the malware Mehta was investigating appeared to be the same as that found by BAE Systems, linking the Bangladesh bank heist group with Lazarus. \"Of course, more research is required at this time, but Neel might have found the WannaCry Rosetta Stone,\" Raiu added.\nSuiche agreed: \"It would also subscribe to the Lazarus Group narrative... They are known for targeting financial institutions like banks. The fact they did ransomware to steal money over cryptocurrency would subscribe to the same modus operandi.\"\nWhat makes the clue especially intriguing is that the code might be unique, linked only to Lazarus and no one else. One researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were very few matches when comparing the code to malware in a vast virus repository he had access to. It appeared likely the WannaCry hackers borrowed from a very limited set of tools used by the Lazarus Group alone and no other malicious actors, he said, making it a little more likely the two were associated.\nSecurity giant Symantec, which has tracked the Lazarus Group over recent years, said it had found some interesting links too.

Dressed in her holiday finest down to her shiny patent leather shoes, blond hair slightly askew, Anna looked every bit as wide-eyed as the orphan Annie had in the unforgettable scene from the 1980s movie Annie. When billionaire Warbucks took the night off and rented out the theater so that he could take Annie to see the stars, it was a night to remember. But it wasn't just any theater we were going to; it was the national theater, a symbol of Czech patriotism and national pride.\nI'd taken the night off, or more literally, enlisted Radek to help with the boys, so that Anna Lee and I could finally enjoy a long-promised evening together. I was just as excited as Anna for my first glimpse at the interior of the country's most impressive stage, not to mention eager to see the ballet we'd selected together. Although I'd been to see dramas and had even taken Anna Lee to the ballet at the Stavovsk\u00e9 divadlo in the past, neither of us had ever been to N\u00e1rodn\u00ed divadlo. The theater's playlist is comprised of a rotating repertoire of operas, dramas and ballets, and more than once I'd found a show that I wanted to attend, only to check the tickets and find them sold-out or showing only on a day when we had a scheduling conflict. I had also purposefully waited until Anna was old enough to appreciate the 7 o'clock start time for the evening performances and likely to keep quiet for the full two-and-half-hours.\nThis fall, though, I declared the time was right and had purchased tickets in early autumn for Anna's two top ballet choices, Lousk\u00e1\u010dek (The Nutcracker) and Labut\u00ed jezero (Swan Lake), which were playing during the holiday season. At seven Anna, is already a well-versed theatergoer, having attended children's productions and ballets in the US and the Czech Republic from an early age. Still, the national theater was the fanciest theater setting either of us had been in. As we crossed the river from Mal\u00e1 Strana and headed along it on the other side, I pointed out the theater's distinctive gilded-gold dome top, \"the golden chapel,\" as it was lit up against the night sky. With views from the theater of the river, the Prague Castle, Old Town and the Pet\u0159in hill, it was a perfect location. I had counted on Anna being taken aback by the theater's plush interior, balconies, ornate decorative ceiling and the fancy chandeliers. But she quickly pointed out, perhaps the most important detail I'd overlooked, the carved lettering above the stage, \"N\u00c1ROD SOB\u011a,\" and asked me what it meant. It sounded like the beginning of a national anthem I thought, but I told her we'd better wait and find out for sure from her father (or the Internet) at home.\nOnce the ballet began, Anna was memorized by the talented dancers and the detailed props and scenery. I had naively expected her to be speechless, but instead, her avid interest in following the storyline (which differed from the version she was familiar with) provoked her to repeatedly whisper urgent questions or declarations in my ear. She kept her voice low though"}

Officials of the San Bruno Park Elementary School District are faced with that difficult reality.\nThe district\u2019s Board of Trustees has decided to shutter two of its seven schools \u2013 El Crystal and Rollingwood \u2013 in order to save money and, perhaps, attain some modest economies of scale in the bargain.\nFew are happy about the move. But the numbers don\u2019t lie. The district, which has been struggling with serious budgetary issues for years, has been unable to see much, if any, significant enrollment growth over the last two decades, and all six of its elementary schools suffer from enrollments below 400.\nOnly Parkside Intermediate School is above that figure, with about 800 students.\nIn all, the district\u2019s pupil total is roughly 2,700. It was 2,800 in 1996. So there has been very little movement over those intervening years.\nIn 1970, enrollment stood at just over 4,800. Then the bottom dropped out, as it did throughout San Mateo County. The post-World War II baby boom turned into a baby bust. San Bruno Park has never really recovered from that.\nCompounding the situation is what appears to be a strong desire by trustees and others for a tax increase, either a construction bond measure or a parcel tax. Shutting down two campuses, it is feared, would not be helpful in securing passage of any citizen-approved levy. But that\u2019s a calculated risk that authorities seem willing to take.\nFurthermore, the San Bruno community is well-known for its skepticism, not to say disdain, when it comes to tax increases, especially for public education.\nThe school district\u2019s constituents have been through this before. San Bruno Park has closed several schools in the past. The city lost one of its two comprehensive high schools, Crestmoor, due to low enrollment in 1980.\nThis history of academic loss tends to color anything that\u2019s on the table now in that North County community.\nLast week\u2019s publication of the latest business plan developed for the construction of the state\u2019s high-speed rail system contained more than its share of important fresh information, not the least of which involved a potential price tag exceeding $77 billion.\nThat number is a far cry from the original $34-$40 billion full-completion price tag promulgated by the proposal\u2019s backers ten years ago when the fast train plan was placed on the statewide ballot (and approved by the blissfully unaware voters) as Proposition 1A.\nBut there is one aspect of this project that continues to receive little or no scrutiny on any sort of regular basis: What the actual operating costs of such a setup would eventually be and whether subsidies from the state (taxpayers) would be required to make up for a possible shortfall.\nIt\u2019s one thing to examine one-time construction expenditures; it\u2019s quite another to analyze annual operating outlays and any potential deficits.\nSome seats are still available for the 28th Peninsula Sports Hall of Fame induction dinner at the Westin SFO Hotel in Millbrae on March 29.\nTickets are $95 each ($20 for children) and can be purchased through the San Mateo County/Silicon Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau.

The Great Depression discredited the idea that economies were basically self-correcting, and the following decades saw the development of Keynesian theory and the use of fiscal stimulus. The stagflation of the 1970s led to the development of real business cycle models, which saw recessions as the efficient working of the economy, and central bank meddling as likely only to cause inflation. The painful recessions of the early 1980s saw a shift to so-called New Keynesian models, in which monetary policy is the central stabilizing force in the economy.\nThe housing bubble that peaked in 2006, the financial crisis of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed constitute another crisis. So far, however, it has produced mostly evolution, rather than revolution, in economists\u2019 conception of the business cycle. The bubble and the following crisis convinced macroeconomists that recessions often emanate from the financial sector\u2014an idea that had often been resisted or overlooked before. There was immediately a flurry of activity, as economists hastened to shoehorn finance into their standard models. Some now believe that the addition of finance will allow New Keynesian models to forecast crises before they happen; others are, understandably, sceptical.\nAnother important insight from the Great Recession was that traditional monetary policy isn\u2019t always enough to stabilize the economy\u2014when interest rates hit zero, other measures are needed. These could include quantitative easing, forward guidance or fiscal stimulus. As New Keynesian pioneer Jordi Gali noted in a recent summary (goo.gl/zp7qEY), there has been much work figuring out how New Keynesian models can deal with zero interest rates. There has also been much work on making the models more realistic by taking into account the big differences among consumers and companies. These are important innovations, and they address glaring deficiencies in the pre-2008 models. But they don\u2019t feel like a big break with the status quo. Most importantly, the basic notion of recessions as driven by rational actors\u2019 responses to unpredictable, sudden events remains in place.\nThat would come as a jarring surprise to many outside academia. To lots of people, it seems obvious that the 2008 crisis was long in the making\u2014the product of years of financial and regulatory folly. In general, the notion that economic booms cause busts, instead of being random unrelated events\u2014an idea advanced by Hyman Minsky\u2014seems to have much more currency beyond the ivory tower than within it. But at least a few economists are working on something more revolutionary\u2014a new interpretation of recessions, booms and financial markets that more closely matches the popular idea that business cycles are both predictable and driven by irrationality.\nThe basics of this new idea are laid out in a presentation by Nicola Gennaioli and Andrei Shleifer\u2014two behavioural finance specialists venturing into the realm of macroeconomics. Gennaioli and Shleifer take their cue from a number of recent papers hinting that recessions are actually possible to predict years in advance, if one simply pays attention to the right variables. One of these is a 2013 paper by Robin Greenwood and Samuel Hanson, showing that when junk bond issuance increases and credit spreads narrow, a credit bust often tends to follow two or three years later.

Because I think one of the best things about the (World Baseball Classic) was just the raw emotion and the energy that the teams were playing with.
