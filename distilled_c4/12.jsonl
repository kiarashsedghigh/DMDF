But it is this reality \u2013 the fact that anyone anywhere can commit a violent act using the al-Qaeda brand \u2013 which has proved most damaging for the organisation.\nAfter 9/11 and the destruction of al-Qaeda's headquarters in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda fractured into a moving target, a global cadre of autonomous cells which enabled it to continue to both elude and fight its enemies. However, with the globalisation of his jihad, bin Laden's authority was at once far-reaching and fragmented. Ceding command-and-control to self-defined \"al-Qaeda\" franchises brought enormous setbacks.\nBin Laden portrayed al-Qaeda as a vanguard group with a clear and simple mandate: to defend Muslims. Every one of his statements made clear that his was a defensive jihad to protect the innocent blood of Muslims from a Crusader onslaught. All of his legal, moral and political arguments rested on this premise. Yet the credibility of bin Laden's claim to be acting in defence of Muslims exploded alongside the scores of suicide bombers dispatched to civilian centres with the direct intention of massacring swathes of (Muslim) civilians.\nOn the run in Pakistan, bin Laden and his colleagues at \"al-Qaeda central\" seemed unwilling, but more likely unable, to control their over-zealous offspring. For example, two letters were sent to the emir of al-Qaeda in Iraq, berating him for his fanaticism, reminding him that scenes of mass slaughter did not help al-Qaeda's cause \u2013 and counselling him that to alienate the population would contravene all of the fundamentals of politics and leadership. But Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi's savagery did not stop.\nCiting Clausewitz, Mao and Giap, al-Qaeda's strategic thinkers had always emphasised the importance of attracting the support of the Muslim masses to the global jihad. The people were the sea in which al-Qaeda's militants were supposed to swim and, without whom, the mujahidin would be \"crushed in the shadows\". And so, in a remarkably candid audiotape aired on Al Jazeera in October 2007, bin Laden advised the \"brothers in al-Qaeda everywhere\" not to succumb to extremism. Allegiance to the umma \u2013 the global community of Muslims \u2013 had to be placed above that of tribe and sect.\nBin Laden's aim was to lead a popular and mainstream resistance movement, yet al-Qaeda's reckless affiliates and their fanatical footmen consigned the group to the more radical margins of the umma. Their means (massacring Muslims) contradicted bin Laden's stated end (protecting the umma).\nBut it was bin Laden himself who had helped make this possible, by contributing spectacularly to the democratisation of Islamic authority. Extending the arguments which had been made decades before by radical ideologues like Sayed Qutb, bin Laden claimed that the region's rulers and the traditional clergy were too weak and corrupt to protect Muslim blood. Individual Muslims had not only a right but a duty to take matters into their own hands. Re-in"}

Women put occupation and economic ability in the second spot, followed by appearance.\nThe time-consuming process and limited pool of potential partners have been chronic challenges for those looking for a date. But these days, the endeavor may have gotten a little bit easier, or at least quicker, with the help of various mobile dating applications.\n\u201cPreviously, people had to go visit a matchmaker\u2019s office to turn in their information, and pay a large sum in membership fees,\u201d Lee Dong-ki, a manager at BNK Lab, told The Korea Herald. BNK Lab has since 2013 launched six dating apps to the Korean market, including Dangyeonsi, which has over 1.6 million registered members.\n\u201cBut on mobile apps, people can simply check each other\u2019s profile at anytime, anywhere, which generally makes them feel less resistant toward looking for their partner. The younger generation seems to prefer this method much more,\u201d Lee said.\nAccording to a 2017 report from Hongik University, South Korea\u2019s online dating service industry is valued at 70 billion won ($66 million), with over 200 dating apps on the market.\nThe popularity of such dating apps was apparent in market share. Last year, BNK Lab ranked fifth in the nongame app market here in terms of sales. Its rival Nextmatch, which operates Amanda, and Mozzet that runs Noon Date placed third and sixth, respectively. The top slot was taken by Kakao, operator of the nation\u2019s most ubiquitous messenger service KakaoTalk.\nWhen using the Dangyeonsi app as a member, the registration process begins by typing in personal information including name, age, occupation, neighborhood and body type. One can also leave a note on his or her ideal type.\n\u201cWe have this function similar to a tournament game, with which a user can pick their most ideal type among 16 candidates through a list of matches,\u201d said Hwang Byung-oh, another manager at BNK Lab.\nFinding the ideal type and expressing favor by pressing the heart on another user\u2019s profile are free, but if one wants to chat with, he or she needs to buy tickets on the app.\nDespite dating apps\u2019 popularity, they have also been at the center of scrutiny for encouraging lookism, as well as their discriminatory nature and safety concerns.\nSky People, for instance, only accepts male users who have attended certain prestigious universities, work for major conglomerates or are lawyers or doctors. But the same criteria does not apply to women, for whom the only qualification is they be aged between 20 and 43.\nAmanda imposes a somewhat dubious condition as well, requiring new applicants\u2019 photos be rated by current users before they are accepted.\n\u201cI feel it is strange to seek for relationships when you are not even sure what they (the other users) have posted is true or not,\u201d said Kim Ju-yeong, who is in her 20s.\nArguing that such perceptions demonstrate prejudices against their services, Hwang and Lee said their key tasks are to break such molds, particularly for a market like Korea, which is seen as more guarded.\n\u201cSafety, credibility and quality of"}

And that\u2019s putting it nicely.\nBrady appeared to be in self-preservation mode from the second half of the Patriots\u2019 Week 14 loss to the Miami Dolphins, to their Week 15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England\u2019s Week 16 win over the Buffalo Bills. Brady was in territory recently unfamiliar as he had something to prove Week 17 against the New York Jets.\nConfidence in Brady seemed to be waning as the postseason approached. Was he hurt? Finally staring down that cliff?\nWhatever it was, Brady fixed it Sunday, when he went 24-of-33 for 250 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions in the Patriots\u2019 38-3 win over the Jets. There was no falling away with pressure bearing down. There were no business decisions. There were a couple of uncharacteristically inaccurate passes, but there were also dimes.\nBrady seemed hesitant to throw downfield in recent weeks. In Week 16, he attempted just three passes of 10 yards or longer, and he went 0-for-3. He didn\u2019t attempt a single pass that traveled 20-plus yards in that loss to the Bills.\nBrady went 5-of-6 on intermediate passes and 2-of-6 on deep balls Sunday. He was 3-of-6 with pressure bearing down.\nLet\u2019s take a look at Brady\u2019s four touchdown passes to serve as evidence the quarterback was in vintage form Sunday.\n\u2014 Pressure wasn\u2019t quite bearing down on Brady, but it was creeping up from the interior. He didn\u2019t shy away, instead going through his reads and hitting running back James White on a short in pattern. White did the rest of the work.\n\u2014 Brady immediately saw a matchup he liked when running back Rex Burkhead lined up across from linebacker Avery Williamson. Brady chucked the ball 30 yards in the air, hitting Burkhead in stride. This throw was longer than any of Brady\u2019s attempts from Week 16.\nA play worthy of six points.\n\u2014 Brady escapes from pressure, he doesn\u2019t fall away from it.

Brady delivered a perfect pass away from the defender on the run where only Dorsett could snag it out of the air.\nCalifornia connection heats up on a cold New England day.\n\u2014 The Patriots\u2019 offensive line did a nice job protecting Brady before he found a wide open Julian Edelman in the end zone.\nFull disclosure: The Jets were without their top three cornerbacks and playing for a head coach who would be fired as soon as the team got off their plane from New England. They had nothing to play for.\nBut, still. Brady was pressured, and he wasn\u2019t in self-preservation mode. If Brady was previously injured, he appeared to be feeling better Sunday. These are all good signs for the Patriots\u2019 playoff run.\n\u2014 The Patriots brought an impressive amount of pressure.

That murder is portrayed in the upcoming FX series American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, which is based on Orth\u2019s book Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History. At the time of the murder, Orth had spent two months reporting for Vanity Fair on Cunanan and the events that might have led to him to kill four other people before finally targeting Versace. Even before law enforcement announced that Cunanan was a suspect, Orth and the fact checkers at Vanity Fair had a hunch they knew exactly who had pulled the trigger at Ocean Drive.\nThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, which premieres on FX January 17, was written by Tom Rob Smith\u2014author of Child 44, who previously combined crime and romance in the compulsively watchable 2015 miniseries London Spy. And while the title name-checks Versace, the show itself\u2014following Orth\u2019s lead\u2014is more focused on the mentality of his assassin: serial killer Andrew Cunanan, played by Glee alum Darren Criss.

Kennan, a leading authority on the Soviet Union who in the midst of the Cold War became a passionate crusader for the control and abolition of nuclear arms, has died. He was 101.\nThe historian and diplomat, who was best known as the architect of \"containment,\" which became the cornerstone of U.S. policy in dealing with the Soviet Union for more than 40 years, died at home in Princeton, N.J.\nKennan was an elegant writer, the author of 26 books and numerous articles. He won the Pulitzer Prize for history and the National Book Award in 1956 for \"Russia Leaves the War\" and a second Pulitzer in 1967 for \"Memoirs: 1925-1950.\"\nKennan was also a distinguished scholar and a professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. He had been associated with the institute since 1950, much of the time with the title of permanent professor in the School of Historic Studies. Even late in life, Kennan looked the part of the diplomat: tall, slender, erect, balding and with a discreet mustache. He had a slightly ascetic appearance, and that, combined with an element of shyness, frequently caused him to appear aloof and a bit imperious.\nThough Kennan was widely admired for his containment theory, it was to his immense annoyance and regret that it was his legacy.\nKennan's thoughts on the Soviet Union first drew attention in an 8,000-word telegram to the State Department that he prepared while serving as a member of the U.S. Embassy staff in Moscow. Written in February 1946, it became known in diplomatic lore as the Long Telegram.\nThe cable was broken into five sections, \"all neatly divided, like an 18th century Protestant sermon,\" Kennan noted in his memoirs. The sections dealt with the basic features of the Soviet postwar outlook, the background of that outlook and its resulting impact on Soviet policy, both official and unofficial. It concluded with the implications of all this on American policy.\nKennan argued that the Soviets dismissed and held in contempt the idea that international agreements must be respected or given the stature of law. Josef Stalin and his negotiators, he believed, would invariably seek to turn all negotiations and treaties to their advantage and were unlikely to honor past agreements if they felt such treaties were not in their best interests.\nIn Kennan's view, this approach to foreign affairs had little to do with communism but reflected Russia's historical role in European politics.\nThe Long Telegram also warned of the Kremlin's expansionist ambitions under Stalin and noted that Soviet power \"was impervious to the logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to the logic of force.\" Equally as important, the telegram noted that the Kremlin was very likely to stand down \"when strong resistance is encountered at any point.\"\nU.S. diplomacy, Kennan concluded, must assume an active position in international politics and take on the role of \"Great Power,\" both diplomatically and militarily, to counter Soviet expansionism.\nExplaining himself in later writings, Kennan said he had been troubled since his wartime days in Moscow by the attitude of some Americans with \"fatuous dreams of a happy and chummy collaboration with Moscow.\" He said his aim in the telegram and in earlier and later writings was to dispel \"naive optimism\" among certain quarters in Washington that the"}

Impressive growth in all of its major businesses -- including gaming, data center, and automotive -- in addition to optimistic growth expectations led investors to pile into the stock throughout 2016.\nShares of NVIDIA bottomed out in February, followed by a steady rise over the next eight months. NVIDIA handily beat revenue and earnings estimates when it reported earnings in February, May, and August, with its gaming business in particular proving resilient despite a weak PC market. The launch of NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, which currently includes the high-end GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, and the more mainstream GTX 1060, GTX 1050 Ti, and GTX 1050, was by all indications a major success.\nNVIDIA's third-quarter report in November was a blowout. The company beat analyst estimates for revenue by $310 million, growing sales by nearly 54% year over year. The gaming business accelerated, producing $1.244 billion of revenue, up from just $761 million during the prior-year period. Automotive sales came in at $127 million, up 60% year over year.\nThe star of the show was the data center business. The data center segment generated $240 million of revenue, nearly tripling compared to the third quarter of the previous year. NVIDIA's focus on pushing its graphics cards for deep learning and artificial intelligence acceleration paid off in a big way, and the stock exploded higher as a result.\nWith NVIDIA now trading around 9.4 times trailing-12-month sales and 47 times earnings, investors are betting that NVIDIA can keep up its rapid growth rate. The big opportunity for NVIDIA is artificial intelligence (AI), which will require processing power that NVIDIA's graphics cards are well suited to provide. An analyst estimated in November that AI represents a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies, noting that NVIDIA is in prime position to benefit.\nWhether NVIDIA can continue to grow so quickly, particularly its gaming business, which will face new competition from AMD's Vega graphics cards next year, is an open question. The growth opportunities in automotive and AI acceleration could be huge, but the stock may already be pricing them in. NVIDIA will need to deliver incredible growth in order to keep investors happy.

First spotted (and trashed) by Liz Gannes at GigaOm, AGLOCO looks to be very similar to a service called AllAdvantage that was a high flyer back in the day, just before crashing badly in the stock market burst of 2000. AllAdvantage paid users to surf the web by showing them advertising related to what they were viewing online. AllAdvantage also paid referral fees for new members that a user recommended to join. The company raised $200 million in capital and reportedly paid out $100 million to members.\nAGLOCO is a reincarnation of AllAdvantage, although the founders are trying to spin a different story. Like the previous company, AGLOCO asks users to disclose personal information and install a toolbar that rests at the bottom of the browser screen. The key difference is that AGLOCO is also reimbursing a portion of affiliate fees earned from ecommerce sites when users make purchases, and they have a multi-level payout scheme where users can get part of the fees generated by referred members, plus new members that those people referred, down to five levels (this is why it is being called a pyramid scheme). It looks like AGLOCO is also offering stock in the company to users.\nMatt Marshall has a long post that he wrote after interviewing some of the fifteen founders. They argue that the model will work this time because advertising targeting technologies are better, and the affiliate model will add additional revenue.\nThey may be right, and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying. If they can get enough people actively using the software, and the advertising market doesn\u2019t implode, my guess is they will have a success on their hands. AGLOCO isn\u2019t going to make the world a better place, but it may be a profitable business.\nWhat doesn\u2019t impress me about the company is that they are still telling stories about the last time around. In particular, co-founder Jim Jorgensen talks about a blowout party the company held in 2000, where the Grateful Dead played and the guest list included President Bill Clinton, John Doerr, Frank Quattrone and others.

Sewing your own pillow using fabric and polyester fiberfill allows you to fully customize the size and design, and to use any fabric of your choice. The basic method can also be adapted to add embellishments such as ruffles, lace or cording.\nDetermine the diameter that you want for the two round ends of your finished bolster pillow. Draw a circle on paper using a pencil and compass with that diameter plus 1 inch. Cut the circle out.\nDetermine the length and width of the rectangular fabric piece that will form the body of the bolster pillow. Calculate the perimeter of the round fabric pieces for the ends of the pillow by multiplying the diameter of the circles you drew by pi, or 3.14. Add 1 inch to the perimeter to get the cut length of the rectangular fabric piece. The width of the rectangular fabric piece is your desired finished width for the pillow, plus 1 inch.\nPlace the paper circle down onto your fabric -- which should be prewashed, dried and ironed -- and trace around it with a fabric marker or chalk. Repeat this to draw a second circle. Draw a rectangle on the fabric matching the dimensions you determined for the body of the pillow. Cut out the three fabric pieces.\nFold the rectangular fabric piece in half lengthwise with the right sides facing and the raw edges aligned. Pin and sew a seam along the lower edge of the folded fabric piece, leaving a 1/2-inch seam allowance. Press the seam open. You should now have a fabric tube.\nPin one of the circular fabric pieces into one open end of the fabric tube with the right sides together, matching the raw edges. Sew this seam using thread of a weight appropriate to your fabric, leaving a 1/2-inch seam allowance and taking care to keep the rest of the fabric out of the way of the needle. Repeat this with the second fabric circle and the other open end of the fabric tube, but this time stop sewing about 3 inches before you reach the end of the full circle.\nSnip with scissors into the seam allowance at approximately 1-inch intervals, close to but not into the stitching. This allows the excess fabric to ease into the seams and lie smoothly.\nTurn the pillow case right side out through the 3-inch gap you left in the second side seam. Stuff the pillow with polyester fiberfill through the gap. The handle of a wooden spoon or the blunt end of a thick knitting needle can be helpful for this task. Stop when the bolster pillow is as densely packed with stuffing as you desire.\nFold the raw fabric edges of the 3-inch gap in the side seam to the inside and pin. Neatly slipstitch the gap closed by hand with a needle and thread.\nConsider using different, contrasting fabrics for the body and the round ends of a bolster pillow for a different look.\nIf you intend to use the bolster pillow for sleeping or resting, rather than just for decoration, make sure the fabric you choose is soft to the touch.\nThomas, Joanne. \"How to Make a Bolster Pillow With Round Ends.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/make-bolster-pillow-round-ends-60080.html.

Nucleic acid-based aptamers offer many advantages in this domain, because they are chemically synthesized, stable, and economical. Despite these compelling features, aptamers are currently not widely used in comparison to antibodies. This is primarily because conventional aptamer-discovery techniques such as SELEX are time-consuming and labor-intensive and often fail to produce aptamers with comparable binding performance to antibodies. This Account describes a body of work from our laboratory in developing advanced methods for consistently producing high-performance aptamers with higher efficiency, fewer resources, and, most importantly, a greater probability of success. We describe our efforts in systematically transforming each major step of the aptamer discovery process: selection, analysis, and characterization. To improve selection, we have developed microfluidic devices (M-SELEX) that enable discovery of high-affinity aptamers after a minimal number of selection rounds by precisely controlling the target concentration and washing stringency. In terms of improving aptamer pool analysis, our group was the first to use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for the discovery of new aptamers. We showed that tracking the enrichment trajectory of individual aptamer sequences enables the identification of high-performing aptamers without requiring full convergence of the selected aptamer pool. HTS is now widely used for aptamer discovery, and open-source software has become available to facilitate analysis. To improve binding characterization, we used HTS data to design custom aptamer arrays to measure the affinity and specificity of up to \u223c10(4) DNA aptamers in parallel as a means to rapidly discover high-quality aptamers. Most recently, our efforts have culminated in the invention of the \"particle display\" (PD) screening system, which transforms solution-phase aptamers into \"aptamer particles\" that can be individually screened at high-throughput via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using PD, we have shown the feasibility of rapidly generating aptamers with exceptional affinities, even for proteins that have previously proven intractable to aptamer discovery. We are confident that these advanced aptamer-discovery methods will accelerate the discovery of aptamer reagents with excellent affinities and specificities, perhaps even exceeding those of the best monoclonal antibodies. Since aptamers are reproducible, renewable, stable, and can be distributed as sequence information, we anticipate that these affinity reagents will become even more valuable tools for both research and clinical applications."}

Then, almost miraculously in the early 1980s, bears reappeared amid the madrone and pine of Emory Peak. Astonished wildlife biologists surmised that the bears had migrated from the Sierra del Carmen in Coahuila, swimming the Rio Grande and crossing forty miles of furnace-hot desert to reach the Chisos, a promised land of docile deer and abundant garbage.\nLike the jaguars that have re-established themselves in the border mountains of Arizona in recent years or, for that matter, the blood-sucking chupacabra of norte\u00f1o folklore who has reputedly been seen in the suburbs of Los Angeles, the black bears are part of an epic migration of wildlife as well as people al otro lado.

I saw a lot of people posting really simplistic reactions, like the college is racist or the professor equates Islam with Christianity, so clearly people didn't understand the complexities.\nI asked our higher education reporter if I should disclose that I went (to Wheaton College). She said no, unless I'm on some alumni association or something. We have UVA grads report on UVA, etc. It's pretty easy to find through Facebook or Linked In or pretty much anywhere that I went there, but we didn't feel like it was necessary to stamp on the story itself.\nSo what are the real issues in this doctrinal skirmish?\nThe underlying theological debate taking place among evangelicals is complex, and accusations of Islamophobic bigotry or a betrayal of the Christian gospel are not uncommon. The debate has centered on how the Christian belief in a Trinitarian God -- God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit -- differs from the God of Islam and Judaism.\nTheologians have debated whether Christians and Muslims understand God in the same way, and if so, whether they worship the same \u201cone God.\u201d Do they define the word \u201cworship\u201d in the same way?\nSo here is a question that I have been waiting for someone to ask. What are the relevant passages in the Wheaton College doctrinal statement? Might someone at least offer readers a description -- with a relevant URL -- of what is in there?\nTo state the obvious: I have not taught at Wheaton College. However, I have taught at two other Christian liberal arts colleges and it's pretty easy to see that this story is unfolding on multiple levels.\nLike what?

Thus, she has gone silent. Trenches are being dug.\nIt doesn't help that questions have been raised about where Hawkins stands on other hot-button moral and doctrinal issues. As Bailey's story makes clear, these are tense times at Wheaton when it comes to culture wars of all kinds.\nMy hunch is that -- looming in the background -- is the fact that Wheaton Provost Stanton L. Jones had already announced that he would step down from that post at the end of this academic year.

That Category-2 storm struck the Florida Panhandle \u2014 near Mexico Beach, of all places \u2014 a week before Thanksgiving.\nHurricane Michael intensified fast before it hit near Mexico Beach, Florida, last week. But Hurricanes Irma, Matthew, Harvey, Sandy, Wilma and others also had big jumps in wind speed.\nConditions won\u2019t favor any more worrisome tropical activity off the coast of Africa at this time of year, but Feltgen said forecasters will monitor the Gulf Coast and the northwest part of the Caribbean Sea for development.\nWe\u2019re already experiencing an above-average hurricane season. The typical year brings 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes to the Atlantic. For 2018, Hurricane Oscar is our 15th named storm and our eighth hurricane, and we\u2019ve had two major hurricanes (Florence and Michael).\nAs National Hurricane Center meteorologists prepare for their end-of-season report next month, Hurricane Michael\u2019s formation into a destructive force out of the Gulf of Mexico will be one topic drawing continued discussion.\n\u201cThe rapid intensification was a little surprising,\u201d Feltgen said of the storm that reached Category-4 status before crashing through the panhandle."}

{"idx": "12035", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Recession forced across-the-board spending in many states, hitting education and hiring.\nThe effects of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression are forcing changes on state governments and the U.S. economy that could linger for decades.\nBy one Federal Reserve estimate, the country lost almost an entire year's worth of economic activity \u2013 nearly $14 trillion \u2013 during the recession from 2007 to 2009.\nThe deep and persistent losses of the recession forced states to make broad cuts in spending and public workforces. For businesses, the recession led to changes in expansion plans and worker compensation. And for individual Americans, it has meant a future postponed, as fewer buy houses and start families.\nFive years after the financial crash, the country is still struggling to recover.\n\"In the aftermath of [previous] recessions there were strong recoveries. That is not true this time around,\" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"This is more like the pace getting out of the Great Depression.\"\nFor years, housing served as the backbone of economic growth and as an investment opportunity that propelled generations of Americans into the middle class. But the financial crisis burst the housing bubble and devastated the real estate market, leaving millions facing foreclosure, millions more underwater, and generally stripping Americans of years' worth of accumulated wealth.\nAnthony B. Sanders, a professor of real estate finance at George Mason University, said even the nascent housing recovery can't escape the effects of the recession.\nHome values may have rebounded, he said, but the factors driving that recovery are very different than those that drove the growth in the market in the 1990s and 2000s. Sanders said more than half of recent home purchases have been made in cash, which signals investors and hedge funds are taking advantage of cheap properties. That could freeze out average buyers and also means little real economic growth underpins those sales.\nThose effects are clear in homeownership rates, which continue to decline. In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. homeownership rate was 65.1%, according to Census Bureau data, the lowest since 1995. In the mid-2000s, it topped 69%, capping a steady pace of growth that began after the early 1990s recession.\nReversing that will be a challenge, in part because credit has tightened and lending rules have been toughened in an effort to avoid the mistakes that inflated the housing bubble in the first place.\n\"Credit expanded, and now contracted, and it's going to be tight like this as far as the eye can see,\" Sanders said. \"We so destroyed so many households when the bubble burst, there's just not the groundswell to fill the demand again.\"\nSome are skeptical that the tight credit market and new efforts to regulate the financial markets, like the Dodd-Frank law, will prove lasting. Americans have often responded with calls for regulation after financial sector-driven crises and accusations of mismanagement, according to Brookings' Burtless.\n\"But eventually, those fires cool down,\" he said. \"It's not as though this memory of what can go wrong sticks with us very long.\"\nThat can be seen in the intense efforts to water down Dodd-Frank's regulations, Burtless said. Federal regulators have already made moves to relax requirements for some potential homeowners who were victims of the recent housing crisis.\nEven those steps and an unlikely return to easy credit might not"}

However, they are increasingly showing more interest in carrying a firearm for self-defense.\nWhat is motivating women to arm themselves, the official told the Diario, is the need to feel more secure and protected, because many of the women own businesses and have been the victims of crime.\nMany of the female gun owners have received training on how to fire their weapons and others have been shown how to do so by their husbands or sons, Mej\u00eda said.\nActivist Rosario Escobedo, of the women\u2019s organization Sector de Mujeres, said she feels that violence will not be done away with by arming oneself and it is the duty of the authorities to provide security for the public.\nBut women have been strongly affected in recent years by the climate of insecurity.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, the murders of women increased in Guatemala by 179 percent, according to a report prepared by the national Ombudsman\u2019s Office.\nDuring 2009, 720 women were murdered in Guatemala and another 899 were injured in acts of violence, according to the same report.\nMeanwhile, last month 40 women were killed in violent acts.\nGuatemalan authorities blame gangs and other organized-crime elements for much of the violence in this Central American country of roughly 13 million people, which recorded 6,475 homicides last year, an average of 18 murders per day.\nBy comparison, 7,724 people were slain last year in neighboring Mexico, a nation of more than 100 million where rival drug cartels are waging war with each other and the security forces.\nAll but 4 percent of Guatemalan murders go unpunished, according to the U.N.-sponsored International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala."}

{"idx": "12055", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Though far from flawless, Disney's Fantasia has earned the status of \"classic\" over the past 60 years, a quality left intact over time maybe because the franchise was never fully exploited. Fantasia was originally intended to be a constant work in progress, meant to return to the screens every few years with new sequences incorporated, but subsequent installments never materialized. Fantasia 2000 is the belated \"sequel,\" and though the concept remains the same, Disney has changed. The company is less a paragon of family entertainment and more a paragon of international corporate marketing, its annual animated releases well-timed advertisements for companion soundtracks and toys. The pattern at least temporarily improved in 1999, however, first with the surprisingly strong (and virtually song-free) Tarzan, then with the refreshingly adult Toy Story 2, and now with Fantasia 2000, a largely faithful return to the simple pleasures of sound and vision expressed by its predecessor. Shot for IMAX (with a conventional theatrical run planned), Fantasia 2000 combines seven new animated sequences with seven new classical pieces, with the beloved \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" the sole remnant of the old Fantasia. Yet the animators seem to have taken great care to recall Disney's classic style of animation: Though Fantasia 2000 is loaded with computer imagery, the flashy stuff is nicely integrated into more conventional scenery. Gracefully rendered whales soar across the night sky to the strains of Ottorino Respighi's \"Pines Of Rome,\" while a one-legged tin soldier defends a ballerina from a truly ghoulish Jack In The Box in a sequence set to Shostakovich and based on a Hans Christian Anderson story. Donald Duck stars as Noah's assistant, asked to gather animals to the ark while Edward Elgar's \"Pomp And Circumstance\" plays on, the sole bit of comic relief other than some yo-yoing flamingos goofing to Saint-Saens. Stravinsky (whose prehistoric \"Rite Of Spring\" sequence was an old Fantasia highlight) supplies \"The Firebird,\" which is matched to a mesmerizing, mythic tale of nature and rebirth. The weak link is an oddly realized bit inspired by cartoonist Al Hirshfield and set to Gershwin's \"Rhapsody In Blue\"; the squiggly representation of New York doesn't fill the screen well, and the human protagonists lack the charm and wonder of their more abstract co-stars. (Angular, colorful shapes interacting to Beethoven have more character.) The same can be said for the celebrity cameos that introduce each segment: The movie stands on its own pretty well, making the commentary extraneous if not fully distracting. At 75 minutes, however, Fantasia 2000 is short enough to captivate the kids and mature enough to draw in adults, making it one of Disney's more successful recent stabs at universal entertainment."}

{"idx": "12057", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Channel partners can make a lot of decisions for themselves when it comes to which vendors to ally with, what products to sell and what services to provide, but all of those decisions can be completely undermined with the stroke of a pen. Longstanding relationships and years of investment can be thrown in the rubbish bin overnight if a vendor decides to change strategy and cull partner numbers, pull out of a specific market, sell a technology business to a rival or buy a rival vendor.\nAll of these things can (and do) happen. For example, I haven\u2019t looked at this particular example in great detail but after IBM sold its x86 server business to Lenovo, there may have been some work involved trying to rationalise the two distribution channels. IBM\u2019s distributors would find themselves suddenly operating with a different vendor while Lenovo\u2019s existing distributors would be very keen to get access to the IBM server products.\nIn the best of all worlds, there would be an almost complete overlap between the two vendors\u2019 distribution channels and the disruption would be minimal. In the real world, that doesn\u2019t happen very often. In most cases like this, there would have to be a period of transition where some distributors were axed and others brought into the fold. Whatever the specifics of the IBM/Lenovo situation itself, you usually have distributors from one vendor being assimilated into the other\u2019s channel model and probably given the option of adding more products to their portfolio.\nOpportunities arise, obviously, on both sides. Distributors of the vendor that has acquired the technology can get access to more products, different resellers and more customers. Distributors coming over with the acquired technology might have the chance to sell other products into their customer base.\nBut however well these situations are managed, there are always casualties. And it\u2019s also an opportunity for rivals to exploit any period of uncertainty by trying to unsettle partners and customers further.\nThe same thing can happen when one distributor takes over another. Suddenly, the longstanding relationship between a reseller and a distributor is rudely disrupted by the arrival of another distributor. The reseller may not want to do business with that distributor, it may have consciously chosen not to have a relationship with that distributor in the past for legitimate concerns over an issue like service or support but now finds itself confronted with a stark choice: stay or go.\nWith events outside their control capable of presenting such difficulties to their business and day-to-day activities, I suspect most channel companies would be overjoyed if someone told them all they had to do was \u201cmind your own business\u201d."}

Iran has been under US sanctions since 1979.\nAl Jazeera's Adam Raney reporting from Caracas said Venezuelans were divided about the Iranian state visit but many felt that as head of state, Chavez should be free to engage with leaders from all countries.\nAhmadinejad was met at Venezuela's Maiquetia International Airport by an honour guard, a red carpet, and a reception committee of about 100 people led by Elias Jaua, the vice president.\nIt remains to be seen how far Chavez would go in backing Iran's warning to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil shipping lane, or how much he could undermine US machinations by providing fuel or cash to Tehran.\nIran made the threat on the back of increased US sanctions.

Soon after 7:00, the houselights dim, the crowd hushes, and six actors file in silently and take their places in the chairs on stage. A woman in a striped dress stands in front of the seventh chair, which is slightly set off from others, takes up the microphone and introduces herself as Gina M. Jackson, founder of Cultural Noire Performing Arts Company and artist-in-residence at the Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation.\nJackson explains that tonight\u2019s staged reading of Flyin\u2019 West, by Pearl Cleage, is part of the One Play One Day event, an annual series started by New York non-profit Project1Voice in 2009. On the third Monday in June, theaters across the country and the globe present staged readings of the same play by a black playwright. This is the fourth year that Jackson\u2019s company has participated in the event.\nAfter the introduction, a short film about Nicodemus, Kansas begins to play on an overhead screen. The actors on stage turn around in their seats to watch it. When it ends, three of the actors stand, place their scripts on their music stands, and take turns reading from the play\u2019s introduction, which gives an overview of the Homestead Act and the Great Exodus of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era wherein thousands of \u201cexodusters\u201d migrated from the South to Kansas.\nFor the two hours or so following the introduction, the actors read through the script. The play centers around the relationships of four black frontier women and the all-black Kansas town where they own land.\nBeside me, my friend Camille takes notes in a pink notebook. Camille is particularly fond of the World Beat Center. She was here yesterday for an African dance class that turned out to be free (it didn\u2019t used to be), but she says she hadn\u2019t known about tonight\u2019s reading until I invited her to come with me.\nResidents Free Tuesday in Balboa Park is an obvious choice when it comes to seeking out no-cost art. It turns out that on this third Tuesday in the month of June, the San Diego Art Museum is among the five museums offering free entrance to residents. I opt instead to check out an exhibit at the Japanese Friendship Garden. The exhibit is titled 50Artists50Fish, and it\u2019s in the Inamori Pavilion, which is deep in the garden and accessible to the general public only by taking the path down the hill, so I give myself plenty of time to enjoy both the garden and the art.\nToday, the entrance to the Japanese Friendship Garden is divided into two lines, one for residents and one for non-residents. I show my I.D. to a man in a red shirt and pass the line of paying visitors.

His problem: There\u2019s no clear path to picking a date, and every possible date seems to bring with it both risks and potential rewards.\nShould Harper let events take their course \u2014 through next year\u2019s budget cycle, Canada\u2019s military mission against Islamic State, Mike Duffy\u2019s fraud trial, a slide in the price of oil and who knows what else \u2014 for the next eleven months? Or should he pull the plug early, before any of these issues makes a deeper dent in his party\u2019s popularity?\nThere are no easy answers to these questions, but as with any major decision, the best way to assess it is to chalk up the pros and cons. So get out the whiteboard and the Sharpies \u2014 here are the three potential windows in which Harper could call an election.\nPros: The Liberals have been on a downward trend for the past few weeks. They have no new policies in sight. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau continues to say silly things, such as his inappropriate crack about \u201cwhipping out\u201d our CF-18s. In contrast, both the Tories and the NDP have solid policy positions on key issues \u2014 such as the family and security \u2014 which neatly polarize the electorate. Harper has both solidified his presence as a statesman and shown his softer side, hugging the opposition leaders in a rare moment of post-terror Parliamentary solidarity. Oil prices are tanking, jeopardizing economic growth. Harper has just delivered a big basket of goodies to Canadian families in the form of the Family Tax Cut and increased child care benefits and deductions \u2014 and he\u2019ll need money to pay for them.\nA year is a looooong time to wait. Canada may still have soldiers in Iraq, unemployment numbers could be anywhere, Duffy might release hidden video of what happens in the Senate after dark \u2026 who knows?\nCons: The Liberals may be sliding, but they\u2019re still leading in the polls. We\u2019ve got less than two months left in the calendar before Christmas, though elections have been held over the break. The family measures haven\u2019t taken effect yet. And breaking the fixed election date promise to capitalize on the surge in support over Canada\u2019s military involvement in Iraq and the events in Ottawa and St-Jean-sur-Richelieu would smack of political opportunism \u2014 and possibly backfire.\nPros: As Canadians start to file their income tax returns, millions of them will anticipate refunds, large and small, from splitting their income under the new Family Tax Cut rules. At the same time, the Tories will have brought in another budget, announcing that the books are balanced and promising billions more in spending on infrastructure, transit, and whatever else looks like it needs attention and will get votes.\nThe six-month deadline for Canada\u2019s mission in Iraq comes up in April, raising the question of whether we should renew our commitment. On April 7, the Duffy trial commences, raising the question of whether Harper will be called as witness. Both of those prospects are awkward for Conservatives, although calling an election to avoid them would be pretty transparent and would lead to a lot of catcalls directed at the PM."}

Have you ever considered being a friend to someone who can\u2019t give you anything in return or the person whose mere presence gives you a headache?\nNow consider how amazing it is when the Bible records that a perfect God considers some people to be his friends. I asked my friends who they thought was God\u2019s best friend.\n\u201cGod\u2019s friend is Moses because he was a sweet man,\u201d says Katherine, 7. Sweet? The man who God used to part the Red Sea? Try \u201cmeek,\u201d which is even more remarkable. The Bible describes Moses as \u201cthe meekest man on the earth\u201d (Numbers 12:3).\nThen there\u2019s Noah because he \u201ctold the truth,\u201d \u201cbuilt a boat\u201d and \u201cobeyed God,\u201d say three 7-year-olds, Carson, Halle and Josh.\n\u201cI think he likes everyone the same, but me a smidgen more,\u201d says Perry, 11.\n\u201cGod has everyone as his best friends,\u201d says Julianne, 12.\nYes, in this sense, everyone is God\u2019s friend. Jesus was even the friend of the man who betrayed him. When Judas came with soldiers to arrest him, Jesus greeted the traitor with \u201cFriend, why have you come?\nMutual friends reveal things to each other. The deeper the level of friendship, the more they can reveal. This kind of friendship is based on mutual trust.\n\u201cAbraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness,\u201d writes the Apostle James. It\u2019s no coincidence that immediately following this statement, James writes, \u201cAnd he was called the friend of God\u201d (James 2:23).\nThink about this: As the friend of sinners, Jesus laid down his life so that we might become friends of God. Memorize this truth: \u201cGreater love has no one than this, than to lay down one\u2019s life for his friends\u201d (John 15:13). Ask this question: Are you God\u2019s friend?"}
{"idx": "12089", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: With the growing democratization of information, corporate responsibility may no longer be optional.\nIs the evolution of the Internet having an effect on way companies view consumers? There's been a lot of talk about it lately. Consumers are gaining unprecedented power. They're less and less passive, given the prevalence of user-generated content like blogs, wikis, amateur video, and ratings and recommendation engines. Many companies -- media companies are a good example -- have already been forced to change the way they view their traditional businesses and innovate like crazy as consumers take more control.\nIndividual creativity and dialogue are building. And I can't help wondering whether consumers' newfound power may have repercussions in business and investing that aren't even fully understood yet.\nFor example, maybe companies that don't act responsibly on certain key issues will become increasingly vulnerable to disruption, too.\nI've long believed that more and more consumers are voting with their wallets and shopping with their values in mind. However, it's difficult to quantify a trend like that, other than observing that companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFMI) have been good examples of extremely successful companies that try to act with a great deal of responsibility and seek to exceed expectations for shareholders, customers, employees, and communities alike.\nHowever, I recently ran across a survey conducted by Fleishman-Hillard (a public-relations agency owned by Omnicom (NYSE:OMC)) and the National Consumers League. It queried 800 random respondents on issues having to do with corporate social responsibility, and some of the results were rather surprising.\nIt's tempting to think that most consumers don't take all that much into consideration when they make their purchasing decisions. Conventional wisdom might imply that low price or luxury brands would be the most compelling elements that drive average Americans to support certain companies. However, 52% of the respondents in the survey said that they actively seek out information about a company's track record in social responsibility \"all of the time\" or \"sometimes.\"\nFurthermore, when participants were asked what elements drive them to buy products, two of the usual suspects were well represented -- 20% cited lower price and 20% cited easily available products. But then again, 35% of the respondents said that whether a company made socially responsible products also gave them reason to buy.\nMeanwhile, the respondents also gave the impression that corporate social responsibility would make a difference in the companies they invest in. An impressive 63% said a company's track record would be \"extremely\" or \"very\" influential in whether they would invest in a company.\nAnother interesting element of the survey was how respondents defined corporate social responsibility. That's one of the sticking points of socially responsible investing, after all -- it's a subjective term that may mean different things to different people. It seems most people related corporate social responsibility to the way corporations treated their workers, which seems like a pretty simple issue to wrap one's head around. After all, nobody likes to hear of a company that pays its CEO millions of dollars yet lays off a large number of workers.\nOn the other hand, even though consumers seemed to view corporations' treatment of workers as a very important element of being socially responsible, a whopping 82% said a company's environmental impact was \"extremely\" or \"very\" influential when it came to products they bought.\nThe survey implied that consumers are coming up with ideas on their own, as opposed to relying on experts"}

(AP) - It\u2019s football playoff day at New Underwood.\nHigh schoolers are wearing purple and white football jerseys and cheerleader outfits in a computer lab, but down the hallway in Stacy Finkbeiner\u2019s sixth-grade physical education classroom, it\u2019s all business as a student in back sets down his blaze orange cap and takes out a pencil as the hunting exam is passed back to him.\nHe fist pumps in the air. Eagerness to join moms and dads, older siblings and grandparents in the pheasant fields of South Dakota is common for students here.\nLess common is a school-sponsored hunting program, but this fall in New Underwood, a quiet, farming and ranch town on the grassy rangeland east of Rapid City, sixth- through eighth-graders in the physical education classroom have all taken - and passed - the new hunting curriculum, sponsored by the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks.\nChildren between the ages of 12 and 16 who wish to hunt need to pass the HuntSAFE program, which includes instruction on properly walking rows, crossing fences and handling a rifle, the Rapid City Journal reported. The New Underwood School District, responding in part to the decline of hunting nationally, decided to pass on to students the heritage of hunting. The recent written exam culminated a two-week curriculum.\n\u201cEveryone took it pretty seriously, too,\u201d Crowser said.\nAround Finkbeiner\u2019s classroom - he also serves as the middle school math teacher and coach for both track and the high school girls\u2019 basketball team at this school district with 237 students K-12 - children diligently took the test. Questions ask about the danger of a .22 bullet at various distances and when should loading of the firearm happen prior to hunting (one seemingly obvious diversion answer is \u201cwhen you get into your car\u201d).\nIn the field settings, the students don\u2019t use live guns but non-firing guns specially made by the manufacturer. They feel like rifles, open and close like them, but have no bullets. On one day, the students even used Nerf guns in a field.\nOne sixth-grader, Jessica Caspers, wears a jacket won from a barrel-racing competition in Rapid City. She said her dad has taken her hunting, but she felt more prepared after the two-week course.\nHunting in South Dakota is big business. South Dakota GF&P; estimates $680 million is generated annually from hunting alone. But national trends, said Tussing, suggest as baby boomers age fewer hunters are stepping in to fill their shoes. A 2017 study from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service showed a decline of 2 million hunters between 2011 and 2016.\nNew Underwood School District is the third school in the state along with districts in Lyman County and Winner to embed hunter safety into the curriculum. Just recently, sixth-graders at Douglas School District in Box Elder began taking hunter-safety classes.\nPreviously, when Tussing held HuntSAFE trainings in New Underwood - a town of 660 - approximately six or seven students signed up. But this year between the sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders, there are 52 new young people in town with safety permits.\nAs the students handed in their exams and waited quietly while others finished, a student in a Captain America T-shirt - Gage Garrett, 11 - grabbed a copy"}

Babilas symbolizes fertility because he is like the drone bee that mates and cares for the queen.\nThe second deity is the goddess Austeja. Austeja is the patron of the flowers, the protector of bees and women, especially pregnant ones. She is also a fertility goddess. Her name is connected to the Lithuanian word \"austyti\" which means to continually go back and forth like in weaving (or flying back and forth from the hive).\nLike the bee, both these deities are not earth bound. The Lithuanian beekeepers of old believed that by placing their constructed hives high in the trees, they were helping the bees to be closer to their gods. To honor the gods, people made sacrifices of honey.\nIn Lithuanian folklore, beekeepers were thought to be of strong morals because it was believed that the bee only allows those of good morals near her. It was also believed that the bee would only sting dishonest people so those that worked closely with her were thought to be good and trustworthy. Beekeepers of the wild hives developed a brotherhood among themselves because in order for them to survive, they could not steal from each other or do harm to other's hives. Therefore, they were considered by others to be very honest and honorable men.\nLithuanians incorporated honey in the wedding ceremony where it was smeared on the lips of the couple. They kissed, symbolizing the sweetness of the union and the beginning of their life together.\nWhile living in Lithuania, I saw the many ways in which people held on to their pagan roots.\nLithuanians were the last people to convert to Christianity, and sometimes I wondered whether they ever really did. My friend Vita would tell me the stories about the different Lithuanian deities and what they represented. In many village weddings, the wedding party carries out many old pagan traditions to ensure a happy and fruitful union.\nThe most obvious link to their pagan roost was through the use of natural remedies.

{"idx": "12112", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Condo mortgage rates rise with bad credit.\n4 What Is a Good Credit Score for Renting an Apartment?\nYour credit is of upmost concern to mortgage lenders. It's a strong indicator of your debt repayment and money-management abilities. Unless you can pay cash for a condominium or you have a substantial down payment, your options for buying a condo are limited. Mortgage lenders and some condo association boards check your credit before deciding whether you're an acceptable buyer. If you do qualify for condo financing, you can expect tougher repayment terms.\nUnless you are paying cash for a condominium, getting a loan when your credit is bad is difficult. Expect high interest rates and demands for increased down payment funds.\nDue to the lack of willing lenders and the poor loan terms you face when financing a condo with bad credit, you might wish to wait out your credit slump. In the interim, you can improve your credit score and prospects for a traditional mortgage, a process which typically takes one to two years, plus substantial effort. A traditional loan offers the best interest rates and repayment terms, which in turn, makes the condo payments more affordable and saves you money over the long haul.\nDeciding whether to buy a condo despite bad credit is similar to deciding whether to buy any type of home under unfavorable credit circumstances: it depends. Affordability is a key factor, as lenders won't finance you if they consider you overextended financially \u2013 regardless of your credit. Generally, lenders want to see that the mortgage principal, interest, taxes, homeowners insurance and condo association dues are 28 percent or less when compared to your gross income. They typically also want you to spend no more than 41 percent to 45 percent of your income on condo payments and other recurring debts. If you have collections, judgments and tax liens on your credit, lenders need these paid off, too.\nIf you have credit problems as a result of declaring bankruptcy or foreclosing on a home, you typically have to wait to buy a condo. Depending on the specifics of your case, you usually can't make large purchases soon after a bankruptcy. Lenders also impose minimum waiting periods, typically between two and seven years. Under certain circumstances, buyers with previous foreclosures or bankruptcies can obtain a Federal Housing Administration loan several years earlier than conventional lenders allow. FHA lenders consider you sooner because the government insures them against default. FHA buyers with credit scores at 500 to 579 require a 10 percent down payment and buyers with a 580 score or higher require only 3.5 percent down. Only San Francisco condos on the FHA's approved-condo list qualify for this type of financing.\nWith a 30 percent to 50 percent down payment, you can obtain a hard-money loan to finance a condo. Unlike traditional and FHA mortgages, a hard-money lender only lends you 50 percent to 70 percent of the condo's value. The lender relies mostly on the property's value and its equity to protect its investment. If you fail to repay the debt, the lender can sell the condo and make a profit. Hard-money loans are only a temporary solution, as they generally have shorter repayment periods of a several weeks to a few years. The loans also have interest rates well above traditional and FHA mortgage rates. You must typically refinance or sell the condo soon after buying to repay a hard-money loan, which is why many investors and property"}
{"idx": "12113", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In federal-provincial relations, as in life, one rarely gets a second chance to make a good first impression. Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault is apparently on a mission to validate that truism at his own expense.\nA little more than 100 days since his government\u2019s swearing-in, Legault is fast earning the reputation of a bull in the federal-provincial china shop. So far he has more broken glass than anything else to show for his approach.\nOn his first federal-provincial appearance at last December\u2019s first ministers\u2019 conference, Legault got off on the wrong foot with a number of his fellow premiers by cavalierly dismissing their pro-pipeline agenda.\nThe Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government would not support the resurrection of the Energy East pipeline project, the premier said, for lack of Quebec\u2019s acceptance of \u201cdirty\u201d oil.\nA bridge-building opening act, it most certainly was not.\nSince then, Legault has earned the public reprobation of Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister for presenting the prime minister with a take-it-or-leave-it list of demands overtly designed to trigger a pre-federal election bidding war between the parties. Subtlety is not the rookie premier\u2019s strong suit.\nOver the past two weeks, Justin Trudeau has flatly refused two of those demands.\nFirst, he nixed Legault\u2019s proposal that Ottawa hand over the collection of the federal income tax to the province.\nThat would allow Quebec \u2014 the only province that has a separate provincial income tax collecting infrastructure \u2014 to move to a single tax return. But adjusting the federal regime to fit the Quebec fiscal framework may be easier said than done. Some experts fear it could lead to a two-tier national income tax system.\nThe New Democrats were initially favourable to the move but backed off after the public service unions pointed out that the closure of the Quebec fiscal centres that currently process income tax files from across Canada would result in severe job losses within the province\u2019s federal workforce.\nAlone of the three main federal parties, Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives would acquiesce to Legault\u2019s proposal. That stance played to mixed reviews outside Quebec.\nThe second Quebec-Ottawa clash came Thursday, on the heels of the presentation in the national assembly of an immigration bill that would impose new conditions on immigrants to that province before they could obtain the status of permanent residents from the federal government.\nAmong those conditions would be a commitment to live in regions outside Montreal. The bill also gives the province new powers to \u201caccompany and verify\u201d the learning of the French language and Quebec values.\nThe proposal would require a change in federal citizenship regulations, and Trudeau rejected that possibility out of hand.\nIt would be controversial for any national party to embrace a policy that would allow a provincial government to impose a different set of rules on the immigrants it takes in than those Ottawa applies in the rest of the country. So far, neither of the main opposition parties has stepped up to the plate.\nStung by two consecutive federal refusals, Legault responded with talk of ominous electoral consequences for the ruling Liberals this fall. But he may be overplaying his hand at the risk of unintended consequences for his party.\nMuch as Quebecers would be happy to file only one tax return, the inconvenience of filing two forms is unlikely to be a ballot-box issue. And more than a few voters are not sold on Legault\u2019s immigration policy. Lest the premier forget, it was a prominent item in the CAQ platform that saw more than 60 per cent of Quebecers vote for"}

A mob torched the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, prompting Saudi Arabia and a number of its Sunni allies to break diplomatic relations with Iran.\nIn response to the unfolding chaos, the Wall Street Journal responded by asking \u201cWho Lost the Saudis?\u201d \u2014 fretting that the lack of support from the United States could lead to the overthrow of the Saudi regime. This is a provocative query, reminiscent of the \u201cWho Lost China?\u201d attacks against President Harry Truman after the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949. But it\u2019s the wrong question. Rather than wondering if Washington\u2019s support for Riyadh is sufficient, American policymakers should instead ask themselves the following question: Is it time for the United States to dump Saudi Arabia?\nThe moral case for the United States to question its close relationship with Saudi Arabia is clear. Saudi Arabia is governed by the House of Saud, an authoritarian monarchy that does not tolerate dissent, and the country consistently ranks among the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d countries in democracy watchdog Freedom House\u2019s annual survey of political and civil rights.\nGiven the two countries\u2019 divergent values, the U.S.-Saudi alliance relies almost entirely on overlapping economic and national security interests. The United States long relied on Saudi Arabia as an oil supplier, a steadfast beacon of opposition to communism and a huge buyer of American arms. The Saudis, meanwhile, depend on the United States to protect their security.\nDespite these long-standing ties, Saudi Arabia now harms American national interests as much as it helps them.\nFirst, the Saudis and the United States diverge over American policy toward Iran. Saudi Arabia sees itself locked in a sectarian and geopolitical struggle with Iran for Middle East supremacy. Riyadh is concerned the deal that lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for Tehran dismantling it\u2019s nuclear infrastructure will empower Iran to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy in the region.

The Lions started entertaining foes on Turkey Day every year starting in 1934, facing that same Chicago team (with Grange in his last year). After a brief hiatus during World War II, the holiday tradition resumed with the Lions hosting the Rams in 1945. That would be a day known for Jim Benton posting over 300 yards receiving. That record would stand until the Chiefs' Stephone Paige broke it 40 years later.\nIt wasn't until 1969 that Detroit hosted the Vikings, a game where the weather conditions got progressively worse until the field was covered in snow in the second half.\nJust three years prior to that, the Cowboys started their own Thanksgiving Day tradition, besting the Browns behind Don Meredith's passing and Don Perkins' 100-yard rushing day. Dallas' opponents this Thanksgiving will be the Chargers, who first played on Thanksgiving in 1964 against the Bills. Interesting matchup, given that they would play again in the AFL Championship Game a month later.\nActually, the Chargers and Bills would face off the following Thanksgiving and meet in the championship later that year ... again.

Tennessee fans would like their team to exert its will in the division, but Mike Mularkey's crew simply isn't there yet. The Colts haven't rolled over for anyone since getting embarrassed in that ill-fated second half in Seattle in Week 4. Either way, with the Jaguars playing a very winnable game in Arizona, this is a huge contest for the AFC South. All those people clamoring for the Titans to be higher on the Power Rankings might be surprised to know that the Titans are the only team with a winning record and a negative point differential this season. It's not my fault.\nThe score reads like it's going to be a near blowout, but I don't think it'll get out of control until late, when Mitchell Trubisky is forced to get the Bears back in the game.

One of those things is a big flagship model, the kind that can be used for shuttling dignitaries around and showcasing the latest technology.\nFor Lexus, that model is the LS. It launched the brand over two decades ago with a combination of luxury features and impeccable build quality that put Mercedes-Benz to shame. Fast forward to 2015, though, and the current LS isn\u2019t nearly as competitive.\nLexus may be working on rectifying that. It will unveil a new LS at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show in October, reports Australia\u2019s Motoring, along with a high-end coupe model.\nLittle is known about the next LS, but it will probably feature more radical styling than the current model. Lexus has upped the style factor (some would argue too much) in models like the IS, RC, and NX in an attempt to outrun its reputation for building boring cars. It seems logical that the model that arguably defines Lexus would be a part of that.\nLexus will also have to conduct an equally thorough overhaul when it comes to technology. The current LS introduced features like semi-automated parking, but even that has trickled down to much cheaper mainstream models. The LS will need a new array of gadgets to compete with such tech-laden sedans as the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\nAs for powertrains, the current options of a standalone V8 and a hybrid system will probably remain. There are rumors that the LS will adopt Lexus parent Toyota\u2019s hydrogen fuel-cell technology, but considering the current lack of hydrogen fueling stations, that probably won\u2019t happen until later into the production run.\nThe LC will reportedly be offered in LC 500 guise with a standalone V8, and as the LC 500h with a hybrid system built around the same engine. They will be good for 470 and 540 horsepower, respectively. We wouldn\u2019t bet against a hot LC F version, either.\nIf the reports prove accurate, the Lexus LS and LC will appear in Tokyo this October, and the coupe will go into production in November 2016.

The approach represents a radical departure from the surface-exploration status quo, which generally launches single-shot, big-ticket landers or rovers that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to design and build.\nHemmati and his team got a $100,000 grant from NIAC last year to develop the \"flat lander\" concept.\nThe current vision calls for dozens of sensor-loaded sheets \u2014 each about 3 feet long by 3 feet wide (1 meter by 1 meter), but less than 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) thick \u2014 to be toted to another planet or moon by a mother ship.\nEach sheet would touch down at a different location, without the need for complicated and expensive landing systems such as the \"sky crane\" that dropped NASA's Curiosity rover onto the surface of Mars in August 2012, researchers say.\n\"These landers should be capable of passive landings, avoiding the costly, complex use of rockets, radar and associated structure and control systems,\" Hemmati and his colleagues write in a description of the project on the NIAC website.\nThe loss of a few landers on any particular mission would not be a big deal anyway, Hemmati said.\n\"They don't all have to survive; we have dozens of them,\" he said. \"Even if half of them make it, it's still good. We'll be happy.\"\nRecent advances in thin, flexible electronics would allow these solar-powered sheets to gather a great deal of data on the surface of an alien world. For example, each one could carry tiny cameras, spectrometers and environmental monitoring gear, Hemmati said.\nThe landers would beam their data up to an orbiter or passing flyby craft, which would relay the information back to Earth.\nThe baseline concept calls for the landers to be stationary. But some mobility could be achieved by equipping them with tiny legs, or with actuators that could shape the sheets into spheres when desired, allowing them to be driven by the wind on breezy worlds such as Mars.\nMars is a viable destination for a fleet of flat landers, Hemmati said, adding that the robots could be sent to places heretofore deemed too risky and rugged to explore, such as the huge canyon system Valles Marineris.\nMore far-flung celestial objects \u2014 such as Europa and the Saturn moon Enceladus, which are both thought to possess subsurface oceans of liquid water \u2014 are possible targets as well. In fact, a flat-lander delivery to Europa would make a lot of sense, Hemmati said, since NASA is developing a potential flyby mission to the moon called the Europa Clipper.\n\"These two-dimensional landers could be nice as a pathfinder,\" Hemmati said.\nBecause Europa and Enceladus are so far from the sun, any flat landers on their surface would probably need more than just solar energy to keep operating. But that power could probably be beamed down to them by an overhead spacecraft, which would need to fly by regularly to relay data home anyway, Hemmati said.\nWhile such long-distance power beaming sounds like a sci-fi dream, the concept is sound and has been demonstrated here on Earth, Hemmati said.\n\"Actually, we"}

Unfortunately, in the absence of reliable data on hospital costs, it is unclear if hospitals actually make any money on this work, but the cost to the economy is evident, both the opportunity costs of providing unnecessary services, and the burden on those queuing for care in the public system.\nHe notes our ageing population, and expresses the usual alarm at the burden this will place on our services, although that this \u201cburden\u201d, of people living in fairly good health, for longer, is well understood, can be quantified, and has been met, quite easily, by most other EU health services.\nHe compares our services to the current crisis in the NHS. I do not argue that the NHS is perfect, far from it, but it has provided ready access to affordable care for most people, something our services have yet to achieve. Its current crisis results from a failure to provide reasonable funding. I would argue that our service is in a worse state than the NHS. The most distinctive features of our service are that it is costly, hospital centred, has long queues for services, and does not provide for universal access to primary care. Irish patients face exceptionally high out-of-pocket costs, as well as high insurance costs. Our use of private insurance to avoid queues, and the opportunities for private practice, paid fee per item, which are open to most consultants, both contribute to this.\nThe costs of Sl\u00e1intecare are high, and this is inevitable. Comparing these revenue costs, to the \u20ac1.5 billion capital costs for the new children\u2019s hospital, is not very useful. A better comparison is with the costs of demographic change alone \u2013 which are about \u20ac450 million a year. The costs of inaction are likely to be much higher.

Trump has also turned his attention away from Europe, avoiding the mistake of getting into a harmful spat with allies needed to form a trading bloc and a unified front.\nInstead, Trump is focusing his trade war on China, which is seen as engaging in a wide range of unfair trade practices and industrial espionage. Three weeks ago, Trump slapped tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with levies on $60 billion in American goods. The president has threatened to levy 25 percent tariffs on the remaining $257 billion of Chinese imports if Beijing refuses to eliminate trade and economic policies that Washington regards as discriminatory.\nThe group that convened Thursday at the New Liberty Distillery in the city's Fishtown neighborhood was respectful of what the Trump administration was trying to accomplish, but believed that there's a better way to bolster American business without resorting to tariffs.\n\"The level of uncertainty is now at an all-time high,\" said panelist Angela Marshall Hofmann, deputy director of Farmers for Free Trade, which organized the Thursday morning town hall and is co-chaired by former U.S. Senators Richard Lugar (R., Indiana) and Max Baucus (D., Montana). \"And that's not just impacting farmers and ranchers, it's impacting manufacturers and"}

Here's a look at how each player's first season the pros turned out.\nHarrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors - Golden State already had some intriguing young wing talent in Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson when it drafted Barnes, a 6-foot-8 small forward from North Carolina.\nBarnes fit right in on a team that more than doubled its regular season win total and pushed eventual Western Conference champ San Antonio in an entertaining six-game series in the conference semifinals.\nBarnes started 81 games in the regular season, averaging 9.2 points per game. In the playoffs, his output jumped up to 16.1 points and 6.4 rebounds per contest. He had games of 26 and 25 points against the Spurs.\nSince the moment he stepped on campus at North Carolina, Barnes was deemed to have a bright NBA future.\nWhile he had moments in a largely solid college career that fueled doubts, his first season as a pro, which ended with a spot on the all-rookie first team, should go a long way toward quieting them.\nAustin Rivers, New Orleans Hornets - Rivers never quite found his footing during his rookie year in New Orleans. He played in 61 games and started 26 for the then Hornets - now Pelicans - before a broken bone in his right hand ended his season in early March.\nPrior to that, he was averaging 6.2 points per game. His 37 percent shooting was the worst among the Hornets' regular contributors.\nHowever, the former Duke star was solidly in the playing rotation - averaging 23.2 minutes per game. But with Eric Gordon and Greivis Vasquez likely maintaining their spots as the Pelicans' top two guards heading into next season, Rivers' future remains unclear.\nKendall Marshall, Phoenix Suns - Among the 2012 draft picks with area ties, Marshall's case was the most curious. At the start of his sophomore season at North Carolina, he was considered a solid college point guard, but not a threat to jump to the pros. By season's end, he was the most important player on the Tar Heels' roster, showing newfound scoring flair, deft leadership and unparalleled court vision. That led to the Suns making him a lottery pick. But Marshall looks to have plenty of work to do to become the point guard the Suns envisioned on the pro level.\nMarshall averaged three points and three assists in 48 games. He started only three times, failing to unseat Goran Dragic. He eventually played nine games in the NBA Developmental League.\nJohn Henson, Milwaukee Bucks - Henson was a useful, albeit not prominent, piece on a Bucks team that snagged the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. With his long wingspan and exceptional shot-blocking ability, the former North Carolina big man's potential is clear. But with his slight frame, the room for improvement was, too.\nAs a rookie, Henson started in nine of the 62 games in which he played and averaged six points and 4.7 rebounds. But with a sudden increase of playing time in the final"}

I do have the passion for tennis, the passion to serve. I do believe I can make a difference, but I also believe there is no one man or woman who can rescue, in my mind, tennis or alter the direction in which the sport is currently going,\u201d Azar said, while calling on others to get more involved in the sport\u2019s administration and development.\n\u201cI felt it was important to have a meeting like that to see if I can encourage others with the passion for the game, the time, and the talent to contribute to come off the sidelines and actually serve,\u201d Azar added.\nAzar has had issues with TJ in the past, being at the centre of a bitter election in November 2015. One member, Joseph Dibbs, actually took TJ and three of its senior members to court, seeking to have the Supreme Court rule that Azar, who had challenged former president John Bailey, was duly elected. The results of the election in question were declared null and void after six more votes were counted than the 77 eligible voters.\nHowever, Azar, who says he will be running without a slate in an effort to limit the chance of \u00adcreating any further splits in the organisation, is looking to pull all the elements together, pointing to his decision to not run with a slate of candidates as an indication of willingness to work with anyone to move the sport forward.\n\u201cThe main focus would be uniting the tennis community, convincing them that the only way forward is by persons putting aside their personal differences and realising that when individuals share a common goal, together, you can move mountains,\u201d Azar noted.\n\u201cI am not running with a slate of candidates. I am willing to work with anyone for the betterment of the sport, so if I\u2019m fortunate enough to be elected, I am prepared to work with anyone. With how divided certain factions are in tennis, I felt if I ran with a slate, I ran the risk of furthering that divide, and if I am successfully elected as president, starting on the wrong premise,\u201d he added."}

{"idx": "12144", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Clearly, we are going to see a wave of coverage this weekend -- perhaps peaking on Monday -- focusing on the Alliance Defense Fund and the protests being planned under its \"Pulpit Initiative.\" As a guy with a degree in church-state studies, I am both fascinated and stunned by what is about to happen. It's like preparing for a giant -- yet scheduled -- train wreck, and a strategic one, to boot. But here is the key. I am not sure that anyone knows precisely what is going to happen this coming Sunday.\nI say that, after reading the following report in the Los Angeles Times. Here's the start of Duke Helfand's report, which ran with the double-deck headline, \"Pastors plan to defy IRS ban on political speech -- Ministers will intentionally violate ban on campaigning by nonprofits in hopes of generating a test case.\"\nSetting the stage for a collision of religion and politics, Christian ministers from California and 21 other states will use their pulpits Sunday to deliver political sermons or endorse presidential candidates -- defying a federal ban on campaigning by nonprofit groups.\nThe pastors' advocacy could violate the Internal Revenue Service's rules against political speech with the purpose of triggering IRS investigations. That would allow their patron, the conservative legal group Alliance Defense Fund, to challenge the IRS' rules, a risky strategy that one defense fund attorney acknowledges could cost the churches their tax-exempt status. Congress made it illegal in 1954 for tax-exempt groups to publicly support or oppose political candidates.\nNow notice, right up front, that the lede contains an apple and an orange. What does it mean to say that clergy are going to \"deliver political sermons or endorse presidential candidates.\" What is a \"political sermon\" and what, precisely, makes a \"political sermon\" a violation of U.S. law?\nThere are all kinds of legal layers here. Let me sketch out a few.\n(1) Take, for example, a priest who follows guidelines and preaches a sermon against abortion and related life issues on \"Respect Life Sunday,\" the first Sunday in October.\n(2) But wait. This year, there will almost certainly be Catholic priests who stress that there are a wide array of life issues, other than abortion, that must be taken into account in the voting booth. This can be interpreted as offering theological cover for most Democrats, including the candidate for the White House.\n(3) Then there are priests who will read Vatican statements that abortion is the issue that towers over others, a unique form of absolute evil. Some may even say that it is wrong to vote for candidates who actively support an unfettered right to abortion. Will these be political sermons? Wink-and-nod endorsements?\n(4) It is also common for sermons to be delivered, in a wide variety of ethnic churches, that include statements by the pastor that say something like this: \"This candidate is one of us.\" Then everyone stands and cheers, while the pastor and the candidate embrace. Is that an endorsement?\n(5) What about pastors who strictly stick to a social, moral or religious issue in a sermon -- yet also say that it is sinful to vote for any candidate, in either party, who violates what the pastor believes is the biblical stand on that issue? These sermons can focus on the war in Iraq, abortion, universal health care, gay rights, etc. Are these \"political sermons\"? Do they, for all practical purposes, serve as endorsements for some candidates over others?\n("}

Really, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote.\nWilliam O\u2019Brien, a New Hampshire politician, accused college students of these things a few months ago. He was supporting a voter suppression bill that would prevent college students living in his state from voting there.\nHis bill is unlikely to succeed in New Hampshire, and your vote should be safe in D.C., too. But some Americans won\u2019t be as lucky in November 2012: A national movement to suppress the vote, of which O\u2019Brien is a part, has had some recent successes.\nI want to address the most common form that these bills have taken: personal identification requirements to vote. Like O\u2019Brien\u2019s favored legislation, they will shut some Americans out at the polls; unlike his initiative, these bills are constitutional and have been passed into law across the country.\nAlthough they are legal, identification requirements are unjust, harmful and costly. They threaten to hurt our political system and isolate some of our most vulnerable neighbors. We simply can\u2019t afford them.\nID requirements injure our democracy. Studies show that photo identification requirements make poorer Americans less likely to vote, while affecting the turnout rate of richer Americans little, if at all. Because poorer Americans often share party preferences, this depression of turnout could swing election outcomes away from what the people really want.\nThese requirements also isolate certain subpopulations of particularly vulnerable citizens from the political process. Elderly, middle\u2013aged and young people are all inordinately affected. Another example comes from my own research, funded by Georgetown\u2019s Raines Fellowship: Publicly available voter histories indicate that after a state implements a photo ID requirement, turnout among people who are homeless declines about five percentage points more than in states without new requirements. These effects threaten to muffle what little say in the political process such marginal populations \u2014 the sick, young or homeless \u2014 have.\nID requirements are costly to the state that implements them. Training election officials on appropriate procedure costs money, providing the free identification required by the courts costs even more and waiting in longer lines at the polls will cost our citizens and our businesses. It\u2019s estimated that the photo identification requirement in Missouri will cost the state $16 million over the next three years. Is this really where we should be spending the tax-payers\u2019 money?\nClaims from pundits and politicians about how these laws discourage voter fraud and promote confidence in elections are well-intentioned, but misinformed. Check out Lorraine C. Minnite\u2019s book, \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud.\u201d The title explains a lot, but the gist of her argument is that pervasive, outcome-changing voter fraud is little more than a rumor. And two political scientists \u2014 one from Harvard and one from MIT \u2014 have shown that ID requirements have no appreciable effect on public opinion about elections.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that these laws even prevent what little voter fraud does happen. If you\u2019re going to commit a felony like voter fraud, very little is stopping you from fabricating identification.\nThe bottom line is that America can\u2019t afford these laws. Their benefits aren\u2019t guaranteed to be big: Voter fraud isn\u2019t a huge problem, and ID laws might not stop it anyway. The costs, on the other hand, will surely be sizable. Millions of dollars will go toward enforcement and education. But perhaps more importantly, these laws\u2019 de facto suppression of turnout in some populations more than others will make our government less representative. That\u2019s a cost, too,"}

Of course the best part is the fact that the vast majority of these games, including the upcoming Dogs of War, are free-to-play, meaning there\u2019s zero risk for players to at least try the game out. And in the case of Cyanide\u2019s latest offering, you\u2019ll be able to do exactly that sometime in the next few months.\nMore than just an online battle game, players will have to take care of troop management between skirmishes, too. You\u2019ll need to cope with frequent random events, including desertion, tension between soldiers and theft. One of the best ways to keep your soldiers from getting to antsy, of course, is to send them out on additional missions to loot and pillage when you aren\u2019t going toe-to-toe with another player.\nThree armies will be available at launch including the undead Ram forces, the knightly Lion forces and the predatory Wolfen forces.\nDue out for PC sometime during Q2 of this year, keep your eyes peeled for an official launch date to be announced in the coming months."}
{"idx": "12153", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: What Is a Ramp Up Period?\nA \u201cramp-up\u201d period happens in business when the demand for a product or service is expected to surge. This could be before a product launch, before a major buying season (like summertime, back-to-school or holidays), or prior to a rebranding period or special promotional event. A ramp-up period typically requires a large amount of preparation, from product manufacturing to communications to marketing.\nDuring a ramp-up period in your business, you will likely need to increase your production efforts in order to satisfy the increased demand for your products. For instance, if your business has announced that you\u2019ll be releasing a new and improved vacuum cleaner in two months, you will need to coordinate your manufacturing efforts to ensure you\u2019ll have the supply you need to keep your waiting customers happy. Make sure you have solid production and shipment calendars in place, especially if your business has several locations.\nA ramp-up period is the time to communicate with your employees, your customers and your investors (if applicable). Good communication is key to generating enthusiasm for your new product launch or other promotion. Make sure your sales teams are fully acquainted with the product or service that will be highlighted throughout the campaign. If possible, give these teams prototypes or actual product so that they can build their own sales strategies around the features. Communicate with other employees \u2013 like customer service, HR and accounting \u2013 to prepare them for the increased workload ahead.\nIf your company is unprepared for a surge in business from a manpower standpoint, the ramp-up period is a good time to hire the support staff you need and train them up. Many retail outlets \u201cramp up\u201d for the busy holiday season by hiring a number of seasonal sales people. Because of the increased business, however, you may need to increase the number of employees in departments other than sales as well. These needs might include customer service, shipping and accounting. Part of the challenge of adding employees is ensuring that all are trained and ready to go when your product hits the market or you launch your campaign. The ramp-up period gives you time to make sure proper training is covered.\nThe ramp-up period is a time when your marketing department can generate awareness, buzz and excitement about your new product, brand or seasonal surge in business. Depending on the nature of your business, it\u2019s a good idea to start advertising a new product or service several weeks (or even months) prior to releasing it. Making sure your website is updated with the latest news and information. Leveraging this in online discussions via social media is also important during the ramp-up period. The non-marketing efforts you\u2019re making during the ramp-up period are dependent on your company winning a surge in business, so these ramp-up marketing tactics are crucial."}

One reason: People who buy yoga mats and fitness trackers on Amazon might also like grapes, nuts and other healthy items at the organic grocery chain.\nIn short, the deal stands to net Amazon a wealth of data-driven insights into how shoppers behave offline \u2014 insights that are potentially very lucrative.\nTo be sure, there are plenty of other benefits to the combination. Amazon will derive steady revenue from more than 460 Whole Foods stores; it can also introduce robots and other automation technologies to cut costs and improve the bottom line. But ultimately, Amazon wants to sell even more goods and services to both online and offline shoppers \u2014 including stuff they might not even realize they need.\nAmazon has been quiet on its specific plans so far, but analysts are enthusiastic about the possibilities. \"This will be a fun time for Amazon,\" said Ryne Misso of the Market Track retail research firm in Chicago. \"They are introducing a whole new set of shopper profiles that span grocery stores and durables.\"\nAmazon is a pro at using data on past shopping and browsing to prod you to buy more. The home page, for instance, offers quick access to recently viewed items and suggests products \"inspired by your shopping trends.\" Amazon sends emails about price cuts on items you&apos;ve searched for but haven&apos;t bought \u2014 yet.\nBrian Handly, CEO of the mobile analytics firm Reveal Mobile in Raleigh, North Carolina, said that while Amazon doesn&apos;t necessarily have better artificial-intelligence capabilities than its rivals, it has scale in the number of shoppers and variety of businesses it has.\nWhole Foods can help by giving Amazon a better understanding of what people do at physical retail stores, where 90 percent of worldwide retail spending still happens, according to eMarketer.\nAmazon could learn whether a particular customer tends to come once a month to stock up, or make smaller and shorter visits more frequently. Wi-Fi hotspots in stores might collect unique signals emanating from smartphones to figure out which aisles customers spend the most time in. Same with sensors on product shelves, something Amazon is currently testing at a convenience store in Seattle.\n\"They will break that data down to build stories about their consumers,\" Misso said.\nAll this might feel creepy, but it&apos;s something Amazon already does and does well online. Larry Ponemon, who runs the Ponemon Institute privacy think tank, said he personally would find tracking of his self-described unhealthy eating habits \"very creepy.\" But he doesn&apos;t expect any consumer backlash because Amazon and Whole Foods have both earned a high level of trust and loyalty.\nTo make stores more profitable, Amazon could push customers to order lower-profit bulk items such as detergent and toilet paper over the internet. That would free up store space for higher-profit items, such as perishables and ready-to-heat prepared meals.\nAmazon&apos;s challenge will be to \"separate the profitable businesses that can be better done online and the profitable businesses that can be better done at retail,\" said Larry Light, CEO of the brand consulting firm Arcature in Delray Beach, Florida.\nAmazon might find that some items sell better at some locations than others. It can stock just the most popular items at each location; other items are just a click away for home delivery.

And there's still a quarter of the year to go. But the numbers get crazy when totaling \"gun violence\" victims: In 2015, 2,988 people were victims of gun violence, according to records kept by The Chicago Tribune.\nThat number soared in 2016. There were 4,368 shooting victims last year, the Tribune reported.\nAs the violence in Chicago's gang plagued neighborhoods rages on, the underlying cause of the Windy City's murder rampages can be found thousands of miles away along a porous border. According to a report from Breitbart's Jeremy Segal, Mexican drug cartels are \"allowed\" to run Chicago's streets and young African-American men are killing each other as a result.\nHarold \u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, a former high-ranking member of the Gangster Disciples, one of America\u2019s largest street gangs, claims the deadly violence that is plaguing Rahm Emanuel\u2019s \u201cworld class city\u201d of Chicago is because Mexican drug cartels are being allowed by \u201cthe powers that be\u201d to operate freely and \u201crun\u201d Chicago\u2019s streets.\nThe fact is that up to 80% of Chicago's murders and shootings are gang-related, according to police.\nBy one estimate, the city has 68,000 gang members, four times the number of cops. A police audit last spring identified 59 gangs and 625 factions \u2014 mostly on the south and west sides \u2014 none of which is going to submit to things like universal background checks.\nStill Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel touts gun control and not goon control and thinks you can make people safer by disarming them in the face of armed predators.

This is quite ironic in that you wouldn't buy a PC for example based on the fact that it will turn on and stay turned on when its performance is atrocious!\nIt is here where I think the Cloud will certainly need to mature as more and more critical applications are considered for it. SLAs need to be refined around performance metrics as opposed to just uptime and availability.\nWith the company that I work for namely Virtual Instruments we can uniquely measure the infrastructure performance of critical applications deployed in the cloud by looking across the SAN fabric. What we've found to be incredibly successful is enabling our Cloud provider clients to in fact mature their SLAs based on performance metrics such as response times.\nWe've also helped these Cloud Providers to help establish SLAs for their end users who didn't necessarily have any in place for their low tier apps. This has been a clear differentiator for them in gaining new customers and convincing them to deploy more key applications into the Cloud.\nFrom what I'm seeing 2012 will certainly be the year where Performance will take more precedence in the drive towards the Cloud and that means a better grasp of SLA distinction and definition.\nCloud = mainframe. We are going backwards with new buzzwords. All these years coding for distributed servers and we are going back to consolidated operating systems with multiple cores. Mainframes - yay - I used to work on them. At least with mainframes you had the option to keep your data in house behind your own protection. With the cloud anyone can take a crack at it. Today companies like verisign are being hacked daily and they are supposed to be trust authorities. How safe do you think your data will be on a mainframe (sorry, cloud) that is accessible by millions of people. When anon get a hold of an administrator password it will not matter how compartmentalized your data is. At least when you are behind hardline firewalls your are not subject to random hacks \"I pick you pikachu\". The hackers have to be in the same geographical location, have access to your hard lines, have the technical ability to both hack your comms and hack your encryption (a rare combination). For any company where every transaction means money (Banks, stock exchanges, clearing houses etc.) doing business in the cloud is clear insanity. For music stores and book sales, go for it. It saves a lot on infrastructure costs. Shared mainframe time. Also if a music store goes down it means 10,000 people out of a job, not an entire bank and all of it's investors out of their homes. Also don't trot out the adage that the data is encrypted, everyone knows that the data cannot be attacked directly. They attack the people with the passwords to the data. Key loggers etc. It takes one little mistake in the wee hours of the morning when you are half awake to accidentally load a key logger. One person in your trust chain gets compromised and you may as well not have encryption. Why? Because encryption keys should be cycled. But they aren't. They are normally hard coded, because they are a pain to change. All it takes is one annoyed exeployee and you may as well be sending clear text. DES has been compromised.

The bedroom she shared with my father was upstairs, and it was impossible to carry the machine up and down all day and night. The pump itself was attached to a metal stand on casters, and she pulled it along wherever she went. From anywhere in the house, you could hear the sound of the wheels clicking out a steady time over the grout lines of the slate-tiled foyer, her main thoroughfare to the bathroom and the kitchen. Sometimes you would hear her halt after only a few steps, to catch her breath or steady her balance, and whatever you were doing was instantly suspended by a pall of silence.\nI was usually in the kitchen, preparing lunch or dinner, poised over the butcher block with her favorite chef\u2019s knife in my hand and her old yellow apron slung around my neck. I\u2019d be breathless in the sudden quiet, and, having ceased my mincing and chopping, would stare blankly at the brushed sheen of the blade. Eventually, she would clear her throat or call out to say she was fine, then begin to move again, starting her rhythmic ka-jug; and only then could I go on with my cooking, the world of our house turning once more, wheeling through the black.\nI wasn\u2019t cooking for my mother but for the rest of us. When she first moved downstairs she was still eating, though scantily, more just to taste what we were having than from any genuine desire for food. The point was simply to sit together at the kitchen table and array ourselves like a family again. My mother would gently set herself down in her customary chair near the stove. I sat across from her, my father and sister to my left and right, and crammed in the center was all the food I had made\u2014a spicy codfish stew, say, or a casserole of gingery beef, dishes that in my youth she had prepared for us a hundred times.\nIt had been ten years since we\u2019d all lived together in the house, which at fifteen I had left to attend boarding school in New Hampshire. My mother would sometimes point this out, by speaking of our present time as being \u201cjust like before Exeter,\u201d which surprised me, given how proud she always was that I was a graduate of the school.\nMy going to such a place was part of my mother\u2019s not so secret plan to change my character, which she worried was becoming too much like hers. I was clever and able enough, but without outside pressure I was readily given to sloth and vanity. The famous school\u2014which none of us knew the first thing about\u2014would prove my mettle. She was right, of course, and while I was there I would falter more than a few times, academically and otherwise. But I never thought that my leaving home then would ever be a problem for her, a private quarrel she would have even as her life waned.\nNow her house was full again. My sister had just resigned from her job in New York City, and my father, who typically saw his psychiatric patients until eight or nine in the evening, was appearing in the driveway at four-thirty. I had been living at home for nearly a year and was in the final push of work on what would prove a dismal failure of a novel. When I wasn\u2019t struggling over my prose, I kept occupied with the things she usually did\u2014the daily errands, the grocery shopping, the vacuuming and the cleaning, and, of course, all the cooking.\nWhen I was six or seven years old, I used to watch my mother as she prepared our favorite meals.

Clashes are continuing in Raqqa, a city under full rebel control and previously an ISIS stronghold.\nBBC world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge says the damage being done to forces opposing President Assad was clearly recognised in an audio message from Nusra Front chief Abu Mohammed al-Julani, in which he called for a truce.\n\"The regime will gain new life when it was close to collapse,\" he said in an audio message posted on Twitter.\n\"(The fighting) risks costing us dearly on the ground if it continues.\"\nHe accused ISIS - also known as ISIL - of having a \"flawed policy\" that had played \"a key role in fuelling the conflict\".\nThe al-Nusra leader proposed an initiative to end the fighting that would include a ceasefire, a prisoner exchange and setting up an Islamic committee to mediate disputes.\nHowever, a defiant ISIS audio message later urged its fighters to attack other rebel groups.\nSpokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani - although making no reference to the al-Nusra initiative - called on the militants to \"crush them (the rebels) totally and kill the conspiracy at birth\".\nHe also threatened all members of the main opposition political grouping, the National Coalition.\n\"Everyone who belongs to this entity is a legitimate target for us, in all places, unless he publicly declares his rejection of that group and of fighting the mujahideen,\" he said.\nISIS, formed in April 2013, grew out of al-Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq and has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting in Syria. It has gained a reputation for brutal behaviour in the areas it controls.\nThe SNC is itself deeply divided and on Tuesday postponed a vote on whether or not to attend a peace conference in Geneva planned for 22 January.\nEarlier on Tuesday, activists in Aleppo told the BBC that militants from ISIS had summarily executed at least 50 captives who included medics, local journalists and members of rival rebel groups.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that at least 34 foreign jihadists had been killed by rival rebel groups in Jabal al-Zawiya, in north-western Idlib province.\nNone of the reported killings can be independently confirmed.\nSince last Thursday, large-scale attacks by an alliance of rebel groups have been taking place across northern and north-eastern Syria on ISIS strongholds and strategic positions.

The move is a milestone given that Spotify is the first stand-alone streaming business to go public\u2013even though it\u2019s not preparing for a traditional IPO but is readying its stock to be publicly traded through a direct listing. Spotify\u2019s filing also signals continued growth and confidence for the battered music business, which has only recently begun to see a resurgence in large part due to Spotify and other streaming companies.\nBut the decision to go public, a shot across the bow, leaves some clear winners and losers in the streaming space going forward, and it raises questions about Spotify\u2019s strategy for the future\u2013beyond paying back investors.\nWith over 140 million active users\u201360 million of which pay for a monthly subscription\u2013Spotify has long been the dominant player in streaming, with Apple Music (30 million subscribers) and Amazon (16 million) distant rivals. Then there are the smaller, independent companies like SoundCloud, Tidal, and Deezer. Even with a recent $1.6 billon copyright lawsuit, and criticism that its financial losses are growing almost as quickly as its revenue, which hit $3.3 billion in 2016, Spotify remains the streaming service to beat.\nAs a public company, analysts predict that Spotify\u2019s lead will only grow stronger and will put pressure on Apple and Amazon to dig into their deep war chests. As diversified conglomerates whose main revenue streams come from, respectively, hardware and e-commerce, Apple and Amazon have always had far more resources at their disposal than Spotify. But with a valuation of $20 billion, Spotify\u2019s IPO \u201cwill bring them cash, so they can continue to compete meaningfully,\u201d says Chris Carey, CEO of Media Insight Consulting. \u201cThat could be a real threat\u201d to Apple and Amazon.\nCarey and others predict that Spotify will use its new resources to continue to invest in companies that help it improve its relationship with users and their tastes through things like algorithmically determined playlists and suggested artists and tracks. In 2017, Spotify went on an acquisition spree, gobbling up companies like Soundtrap, an online music studio; and the TV recommendation platform MightyTV. And in 2014, Spotify bought the music discovery platform Echo Nest for $100 million.\nAnd then there are the major record labels, which Spotify negotiated important deals with leading up to its IPO filing. Analysts say they\u2019re both winners and losers. As investors, they\u2019ll get a payday from the IPO. But if down the line Spotify decides to offer its own stock on the market, a bigger balance sheet will mean more negotiating power with the labels.\nBut according to Carey, the biggest winner of all is the music streaming industry as a whole. \u201cIn the big picture, this is about to be a significant influx of money into the music tech space, which has probably been under-invested in in the last couple of years because people had their fingers burned a couple of times.

And no matter how voters feel about other issues \u2014 especially Obamacare \u2014 polls show they still see the economy as the most important issue facing the country, as they do in most elections.\nThe public\u2019s mood is so sour that in a recent strategy memo, pollster Stan Greenberg warned Democratic candidates not to even say the word \u201crecovery,\u201d because it strikes voters as out of touch and will make them tune out the rest of the economic message. And the last thing they want is for Republicans to pounce on them for celebrating too early.\nThat\u2019s why, when the new jobs report came out Friday, vulnerable Democrats either stayed away from it or embraced it cautiously, with the only safe thing to say: Yes, it\u2019s good news, but there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. No champagne corks were heard popping.\nAnd other Senate Democrats in the most closely watched races, like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, avoided saying anything at all.\nThe reality, Democratic strategists say, is that even a good jobs report isn\u2019t a sure ticket to an easier re-election campaign \u2014 especially since there\u2019s no guarantee the trend will hold up beyond one report.\nMost vulnerable Democrats have been taking pains to assure voters that they understand their economic struggles. That\u2019s how Mark Udall of Colorado tackled the sensitive issue in a recent campaign speech: \u201cFor far too many, times have been hard. Too many middle-class and working Colorado families are still struggling to get by, struggling to get ahead. There are certainly some signs of hope \u2026 But we can\u2019t let up.\u201d Campaign spokesman James Owens said Udall still stands by that quote.\nBut it gets even more complicated in states like North Carolina, where even Democrats have pointed out that the labor force is actually shrinking, according to Thomas Mills, a Democratic consultant who\u2019s based there.\nThat was also a theme of Republicans\u2019 responses to Friday\u2019s jobs report, as both House Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, pointed out the jobs report also showed more than 800,000 people had left the workforce."}

Both numbers are up since March.\nTwo days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported: \"Hillary Clinton's stature has been battered after more than a month of controversy over her fundraising and email practices.\" Four in 10 people view her negatively, according to a new WSJ/NBC poll, and only a quarter of registered voters call her honest. Both numbers are down since April.\nFive days ago, an Associated Press-GfK poll showed that 61 percent of people don't think \"honest\" is a good description for Clinton.\nFirst, these are all solid polls. The differences in findings are due to a variety of factors including the wording of questions, the makeup of people surveyed, and the public's inattention to an election that is still 18 months away.\nSecond, these vagaries are a reminder of two separate and distinct questions that journalists and operatives should ask themselves during any political controversy.\n1. How does it affect the campaign? This is where polls are important; measures of voters' shifting opinions are relevant, if not reliable (see above).\n2. How does it reflect the kind of president the candidate would be? This is where public opinion doesn't rule; journalists, in particular, need to follow the facts and not the polls.\nWhether the next survey cuts for or against Clinton doesn't change what we know about her actions, what we still must find out about her actions, and how those actions might be predictive of her presidency.\nWhat we know so far is that she violated White House ethics rules on government email and foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation. She deleted emails, disabled her rogue email server, and allowed the brazen comingling of government business and the family business.\nIntegrity. Transparency. Accountability. These are attributes that people, particularly younger Americans, expect to see from leaders in an era of radical connectivity, social change, and institutional decline. So far, they're not seeing such qualities in Candidate Clinton.\nI think she needs to come clean to win the public's trust: Allow an independent review of the email and return foreign donations, because anything less fails to recognize how much media and information has been democratized since the 1990s, when the tactics she's now using were effective. But I may be wrong.\nPerhaps The New York Times poll suggests that people won't base their votes upon these early controversies.\nOr maybe voters will judge her harshly, but then Republicans will nominate a person whose character and leadership ability looks worse than the Clintons'.\nShe could win a lesser-of-two-evils election, which would further divide and polarize the nation.\nThat would be OK with people like Eric Boehlert, an unyieldingly liberal partisan who works for the pro-Clinton Media Matters.

{"idx": "12172", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It\u2019s the final week of our Critterati contest (winners will be announced on Wednesday). The Book Bench asked one of our judges, Alexandra Horowitz, the author of \u201cInside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know,\u201d how your pet might feel about being dressed up.\nThe philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked, in his titular essay, \u201cWhat is it like to be a bat?\u201d: what, in essence, is the subjective experience of a non-human animal?\nInasmuch as I can speak to the experience of any animal (including members of my own species), my answer is \u201cThe dog, he does not like it\u201d.\nThis is not to say that it is entirely torturous for your pet. The dog is of the species Canis familiaris: the latter part of that name indicates their familiarity with, well, their extended family, humans. Thoroughly domesticated, having put up with human behavior and its attendant silliness for something on the order of fourteen thousand years, the dog may suffer some costuming gladly. And this is why: by submitting to be a jack-o-lantern, hot dog (with bun), biker dude, or princess, the dog gains something valuable. He gets your attention, and probably an extra round of liver treats. Aside from the liver, there is little as nourishing to a dog as the attention of his owner. So we have bred dogs, and so they cooperatively are\u2014sometimes to a fault.\nOn the other hand, to put raiments on a dog is to blithely ignore his essential dogness. Consider the Canis part of his heritage. Both wolves and dogs are descended from some wolflike ancestor; thus, we might look at the behavior of the dog\u2019s cousin, the present-day wolf (Canis lupus), in order to provide one explanation for dog behavior. Among wolves, one animal may \u201cstand over\u201d another: literally placing his body on top of and touching the other, as a scolding or a mild putting-in-one\u2019s-place. To a dog, a costume, fitting tight around the dog\u2019s midriff and back, might well reproduce that ancestral feeling. So the principal experience of wearing a costume would not be the experience of festivity; rather, the costume produces the discomfiting feeling that someone higher ranking is nearby. This interpretation is borne out by many dogs\u2019 behavior when getting dressed in a costume: they may freeze in place as if they are being \u201cdominated\u201d\u2014and soon try to dislodge the garments by shaking, pawing, or rolling in something so foul that it necessitates immediate disrobing.\nAnother approach to answering the question of what Halloween might be like for the costumed dog is to engage in a little exercise of perspective-shifting. Imagine that you arrive at work one day and are told that today is the day you will be walking around in your skivvies (the human equivalent of putting a naked dog in clothing, perhaps). Socially, this is awkward; physically, it might be decidedly uncomfortable. But your colleagues grin at you, point and giggle happily, and ply you with extra liver treats\u2014er, I mean, candy. In the end, you might put up with it for the day, secure in the approval of those around you, and the happy circumstance that you can wear your full office regalia tomorrow. So might it be like for your dog.\nWe are, ultimately, a culture of celebrants, and our dogs will be included in that celebration, regardless. But if you are willing to be that over-exposed owner aside your"}

Leave it to Paul Allen, the cofounder of Microsoft, to think otherwise. Last year, the team Allen owns, the Seattle Seahawks, became the first NFL club to incorporate radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology into its concession sales. The Seahawks' RFID system was designed to speed sales and cut lines that all too frequently snake around stadium snack bars\u0097keeping fans away from the action, not to mention the food. The system has also helped drive sales up.\nRFID has long proved its efficiency for collecting tolls, recording marathon times, and keeping track of inventory, but the Seahawks system represents its first use in a sporting venue. Then again, Seahawks Stadium is not a typical venue. Opened in July 2002, the stadium went high-tech from the start, with 200 high-definition televisions, a multimillion-dollar video production studio, high-speed Internet access in all 82 luxury suites, and state-of-the-art video boards designed so that replays can be seen even from the 5-yard line.\nThe RFID system was added in the stadium's second season, and not all fans use it. So far, it has been installed only in the premium Club Seat sections (7,000 plush seats that surround the field). But that's likely to change, given the system's success.\n\"It certainly speeds up lines,\" says Mike Flood, Seahawks vice president for community relations. \"And the less wait at the concession, the more incentive there is to buy. We're seeing an uplift in sales, though the final numbers are not in yet.\"\nSmart System Technologies, the company that makes the PowerPay RFID system used in Seattle, says that on the average, RFID sales figures are 18 percent higher than with cash transactions.\nBy season's end, approximately 40 percent of the eligible patrons had signed up for the PowerPay program. These fans specify the credit cards they want assigned to their accounts. Each one then receives a key fob (featuring the Seahawks logo) that contains a Texas Instruments RFID chip and an antenna. The only information on the chip is an identification number unique to the user.\nAt the concession stand, the fan simply passes the key fob in front of a PowerPay reader connected to the point-of-sale terminal. The reader produces an electromagnetic field that sends out just enough energy to power up the RFID tag, which sends its ID number to the reader. Because the reader has a range of just a few inches, there's no danger that the key fob in your pocket is going to be charged for the food the guy in front of you just ordered.\nEach reader is integrated into Tangent software running the POS terminals. The 52 terminals are linked to a set of servers in the stadium, which take each tag number and pass it to the PowerPay server. That server then sends the number via a broadband VPN to PowerPay's central database in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThis proprietary database, built on Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition, matches the number not only with a credit card account but also with specific discounts, rewards, or promotions. This is potentially the real power of the system.\n\"With PowerPay, the Seahawks can see what fans like to buy and then target them with cou"}
{"idx": "12177", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What makes \"killer\" bees so deadly?\nWhen bees attacked a Texas couple over the weekend, it seemed like a scene out of a horror film, according to the way one of the victims described the scene to the Associated Press. More than 30,000 bees swarmed the couple as they exercised their small horses. At first, the woman and one of the horses jumped into the pool to avoid the stings. There were so many bees that the sky turned dark, as if it was night, she said.\nThe couple eventually escaped into the safety of their house, covered in bee stings, but the horses suffered a fate much worse. The first horse died before help arrived; the second died several hours later despite the efforts of an equestrian veterinarian. Five hens also died in the attack. According to the AP, the bees are being tested to see if they are Africanized or \"killer\" bees.\nThe ordeal comes just weeks after a 62-year-old Texas man died when he was attacked by 40,000 bees. In March, two Tampa Bay public park employees survived after being attacked by about 100,000 bees.\nAccording to experts at the University of Illinois' Department of Entomology, there are about 40 fatal bee attacks each year. The reason Africanized bee attacks are more deadly, explains Dr. May Berenbaum, a professor at the school, has more to do with the sheer number of stings than the actual bee venom.\nWith killer bees, \"the venom is not more toxic,\" she explained to CBSNews.com. Rather, when killer bees are disturbed, \"they are more likely to pursue the source of disturbance more consistently.\"\n\"Bee venom is a cocktail of biologically active components that are designed to inflict pain. The honey bee stings only defensively -- they don't try to kill, they try to educate,\" Berenbaum said. The pain is meant to warn predators -- in this case, the humans that disturbed the hive. The venom also sends a signal to fellow bees, marking the predator. This accounts for the repeated stings.\nKiller bee attacks are so much more aggressive because when a killer bee hive is disturbed, the entire colony attacks. By comparison, when a European honey bee hive is disturbed, only about 10 percent of the bees will attack.\n\"If you can't escape that's when the fatalities occur,\" said Berenbaum.\nKiller bees are a mixed breed of African and European honey bees. They made their way to the U.S. in 1990, traveling north from Brazil, where they were first introduced in 1957.\nThe attacks started growing in frequency around 2011, when fatal attacks were reported in Arizona and Texas, as well as aggressive attacks in California and Florida. Berenbaum says this has to do with expanding populations, rather than a biological change in the bees.\n\"One limit on the spread of Africanized bees is cold temperatures, they can't over winter,\" she said. \"If winters are getting milder, there are more places that they'll persist.\"\nAdditionally, as the killer bees spread to new territory, they are encountering people who are not accustomed to dealing with them.\n\"Honey bees have been in the U.S. since the 17th century, so people have had a long time to get used to them,\" she said.

Ghost Rider is a series from the classic Marvel comic book which has become a big hit among the readers.\nAmritraj considers that the market for Hollywood movies in India has seen a gradual rise over a period of time and expects it to grow further in the next 10 years.

Now, many movies are releasing on the same day in India, as in Hollywood.\u201d Amritraj attributes this growth to multiple factors, including the economy, advent of multiplexes, better connectivity in the world, etc.\nWhile Amritraj is an Indian producer in Hollywood, there are acclaimed Indian directors like Mira Nair, Deepa Mehta, Manoj Shyamalan and Shekhar Kapoor who have also made their presence felt in the western film industry.\nOn being asked about the probability of making a Hollywood film with any of the Indian directors, Amritraj says that he has neither heard of any such proposal till date, nor thought about it till now."}

He also reflected aboriginal communities\u2019 concerns that federal policies have eroded their control of the land and natural resources.\nHe made no mention of campaigns to stop the seal hunt.\nEven a submission from the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the Inuit Circumpolar Institute didn\u2019t mention the environmentalist campaign.\nInstead, that submission emphasized the need for government to invest in hunting and traditional knowledge, strengthen food subsidies and boost the regional economy \u2014 recommendations reflected in De Schutter\u2019s preliminary report.\nWhen De Schutter wrapped up his 11-day trip last week, several cabinet ministers blasted him, including Aglukkaq, who said food security in the North is about fighting environmentalists lobbying to cut off access to hunting traditional foods.\nAglukkaq called him \u201cill-informed\u201d and \u201cpatronizing,\u201d since he made recommendations about the North without setting foot there.\nShe said that instead of targeting Ottawa, De Schutter should be looking at environmentalists who are trying to cut off Inuit access to the seal hunt, polar bears and fish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about fighting environmentalists that try to put a stop to our way of life, of hunting to provide for our families,\u201d she said.\nHer comments prompted critics to ask whether Ottawa was denying widespread poverty and food insecurity in the North.\nIn her interview this week, Aglukkaq said that for De Schutter to truly understand food security in the North, he needs to look well beyond the grocery store to see how the traditional reliance on hunting is under pressure.\n\u201cHunting is our way of life. The very country he comes from does not recognize the seal hunt, and in fact opposes the seal hunt,\u201d the minister said.\nDe Schutter is from Belgium, which spearheaded a ban on Canadian seal products. However, traditional aboriginal sealing is excluded from the European ban.\nAglukkaq said she would welcome the envoy back so that she could take him to the North to see first-hand how the seal hunt works.\nThe Inuit submission to the UN envoy pointed to government-funded research that shows that 68.8 per cent of adults in Nunav"}

While we think (Town Center) is exempted, there has been a lawsuit brought against those who thought they were exempted, too.\n\"When dealing with a $100 million loan and putting in $30 million equity, it's concerning,'' said Elkington, who formerly was the longtime manager of Beale Street.\nIn early January, the affluent Memphis suburb approved a moratorium on construction of new apartments outside smart code zones where more density is planned.\nHowever, at the Jan. 22 board meeting, Alderman Dean Massey sought unsuccessfully to change and strengthen the new moratorium. He proposed replacing the words \"apartment buildings'' with \"multi-family'' buildings that could include condos, townhomes, duplexes and brownstones. Massey also proposed making the moratorium broader by prohibiting multifamily in the entire city instead of just smart code districts.\n\"When I'm fighting against apartments I'm really fighting for my family,'' Massey said at the meeting.\n\"Put ourselves in the shoes of mothers and fathers with children or their grandparents who just want to retire in their homes and live out their lives in the Germantown we all knew and loved growing up,'' he said.\nThe existing moratorium \"does little to protect the city, especially our schools, from becoming overcrowded,'' Massey said.\nCity Atty. David Harris told the board that the new moratorium was not intended to stop projects like Germantown Town Center that had already received some level of approval in the planning process. Germantown Town Center's outline plan was approved about a year ago.\nBut last spring the developers withdrew their preliminary plans, saying they wanted to tweak the project.

You earn one TrueBlue point for every $1 spent on the card. JetBlue Plus allows customers to earn bonus points on top of regular points in a few ways.\nYou can earn 40,000 bonus points if you spend $1,000 within 90 days of opening your account and when the annual fee has been paid, but you have to wait four to six weeks until the points are credited to your account. Bonus points also compounded depending on the type of purchase you make. You\u2019ll earn six points for every $1 spent on JetBlue purchases, including reservations, and two points for every $1 spent at restaurants and grocery stores.\nPoints can be redeemed for one-way and roundtrip flights to your favorite destinations. If you aren\u2019t much of a traveler, you can also give those points for someone in need. JetBlue allows you to donate points to be used by one of a select list of charities, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the USO of Metropolitan New York, Americares and JetBlue\u2019s own charity, The JetBlue Foundation.\nThe credit card comes with an interest rate of 17.74%, 21.74% or 26.74% APR, depending on your credit history. For balance transfers, no interest is charged for the first 12 billing cycles recorded on your account, and those must post within 45 days of opening the account.\nThe card carries an annual fee of $99. Balance transfers incur a charge of either $5 or 3 percent of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater. Cash advances require a fee of either $10 or 5 percent of each cash advance, whichever is greater.

The fact that you can earn six times the amount of points on the airline suggests JetBlue has a focus on customer retention; if you were to spend that money on another airline, you might not get the same return.

In these reports you will read of how octogenarians kill themselves at a rate of two per week, usually by tying a noose around their neck, taking a broken glass to their throat, ingesting a stockpile of prescribed drugs, or succumbing to poisonous fumes, when faced with the prospect of going to a aged care facility. This grim reality is reflected in the Australian Bureau of Statistic suicide data, which shows men aged 85 and older suicide at the rate of almost 40 in every 100,000, partly due to terminal and \u00adincurable illnesses. My grandfather was in his 80s when he died. I have vivid memories of him retiring to the sunroom of our Californian bungalow with gun case in hand, placing it at his feet, removing the numerous components, clicking them into place, and proceeding to check that his shotgun was in fine working order. This ritualistic upkeep continued until confusion, muddled thoughts, and a dead left arm brought on by a stroke made it increasing difficult for him to do so. One evening at the dinner table, he confided to the family that he had spent all day trying to assemble his shotgun without luck. Sensing his frustration, I offered to help. My father remained silent. A few months later, I overheard my dad telling a family friend that he had secretly removed the fore-stock from the gun case, rendering the shotgun useless. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what the old man is likely to do in his desperate state,\u201d said my dad. My grandfather died peacefully years later in hospital 2 days after he suffered his second stroke. He was one of the lucky ones. Just as my father took measures to prevent a violent death in the family, our lawmakers have a responsibility to do the same for the elderly and terminally ill. An elderly neighbour who was recently diagnosed with a life terminating illness explained on how he planned to end his life through carbon monoxide poisoning. \u201cWhy this way?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause my wife does not want a messy death.\u201d She did not want to find him dead in a pool of blood on the living room rug or discover his corpse hanging from a rope in the back shed where there was chance of the grandchildren catching sight of him in a game of hide and seek. Funneling poisonous fumes into the family station wagon, preferably in an abandoned industrial lot in Melbourne\u2019s peripheries, seemed a better alternative. Perhaps. But surely much more can be done for this man and others in a similar predicament. Undoubtedly the state has dedicated significant funds and attention towards advancing palliative care, as it should continue to do so, especially on the back of voluntary assisted dying laws. But it must also be recognized that for certain people, sustained, unwanted and mandatory palliative care is a form of violence. The terminally ill ought to be free to say, \u2018I appreciate your concern and I acknowledge your commitment to"}

I\u2019m Neil Cavuto.\nAnd forget the Super Bowl this weekend, the president going long, really long, today, offering a budget that is super big, really big. We are talking record super budget bowl big, nearly $4 trillion in spending for one year, next year, likely a $1.6 trillion deficit this year, but all supposedly getting better in future years, thanks to combined deficit cuts totaling more than a trillion bucks over 10 years.\nHere\u2019s the problem, a lot more taxing than cutting to get to those better numbers.\nTo former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin on what the heck is going on here.\nDouglas, it is staggering that a lot of these savings over the years, the future years, are borne by the super rich, who are going to be paying a super tax bill. That\u2019s 90 percent of how you get there. What do you make of that?\nDOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIRECTOR: Well, it\u2019s a big-tax budget. You can see it in two places.\nThe first is that, if you look at the year 2020, 10 years out, we\u2019re raising, in this budget, 19.6 percent of national income in taxes for the federal government. The historic norm is 18.2 percent. So, that is an extra 300-odd billion dollars every year that\u2019s built into this budget. And if you look at the tables included in the budget themselves and just start adding up, tax increases, tax increases, subtract the tax cuts they want to advertise, you\u2019ve got $1.1 to $1.2 trillion in new taxes over the 10 years that this budget covers.\nCAVUTO: Now, they always counter by saying, look, we\u2019re just focusing on the $250,000-and-over crowd. Obviously, when you tax them, the numbers are big. So, Douglas\u2019s math kind of skews that point.\nBut, to your point, just raising the income tax rates on the top two levels, that\u2019s going to get $678 billion, the Treasury hopes, over the next 10 years. Taking away a lot of their benefits to charitable deductions, mortgage deductions, or eliminating or cutting them down is another close to $300 billion, bank fees, another $90 billion.\nThere you go. Those are your savings.\nHOLTZ-EAKIN: This is not a recipe for faster economic growth, which I think everyone agrees we need. It is not a recipe for even solving our budget problems.\nSo, you have to ask the question, why do this if, even after you do it, you\u2019re running a trillion-dollar deficit 10 years from now and you\u2019re impairing economic performance every year in between?\nCAVUTO: Not that I would have been happy with the tax hikes on any group of people, rich, in between, anyone, but I might have been more OK with it, Douglas, if there was serious effort to cut spending. And this relative chump change, from $220 billion to $250 billion over 10 years, about $25 billion per year in multi-trillion dollar budgets each year, doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s very serious.\nHOLT"}

The team also plans to use the camera with a lure consisting of an electronic jellyfish which mimics the various bioluminescent light patterns given off by its real counterpart.\n\"We are hoping to do some honest to goodness unobtrusive observation, which really hasn't happened in the ocean,\" said Widder. \"Ultimately the goal is to see animals or behaviours nobody has ever seen before.\"\nAlthough the deep sea makes up about 78% of the planet's inhabitable volume, little is known about most of its inhabitants - more than half of which are capable of making their own light, or bioluminescence. This is in part because traditional research methods, such as deep-towed nets, can damage animals making their natural behaviours impossible to observe in the lab. Vehicles can deliver humans deep down, but typically ther lights, motors and electric fields scare animals away or frighten them into unnatural behaviour.\nIt was for these reasons Widder helped create the new unobtrusive camera system called the \"Eye in the Sea\". The system operates automatically on the seafloor and is designed to be unnoticed by animals. When the system detects animals nearby giving off bioluminescent light, this triggers a video camera to record the light being produced. A red light - which is out of the animals' normal vision range - is then turned on to take illuminated footage. The system can also be programmed to film surrounding areas at regular intervals, for instance when it is set up with bait to attract animals.\nWidder also wants to trial an electronic device designed to mimic the various bioluminescent light patterns given off by the Atolla jellyfish (pictured). The artificial jellyfish lure has a ring of blue LED lights around its outer edge that can be programmed to light up in patterns similar to those created by the real Atolla.\nWhen threatened the jellyfish sometimes respond by creating a moving circular wave of light around their outer edge which is referred to as a \"burglar alarm\" response. Scientists theorise that jellyfish use this response to attract large animals in to eat jellyfish predators. Widder wants to use the lure, camera and a box of bait to test this and other hypotheses about how and why animals such as jellyfish use their bioluminescent light. She also wants to use the jellyfish lure to attract large predators to the area, which would be captured on film."}
{"idx": "12212", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The proper role of religious discourse in political discussion and decision-making has been a subject of long-running interest among scholars working in a variety of fields, from law and political theory to philosophy, theology, and ethics. Participants in these debates have described the problematic features of religious argumentation in different ways, but they have usually focused their analyses on the content of religious claims. In Prophecy without Contempt: Religious Discourse in the Public Square, Cathleen Kaveny is concerned with the divisiveness of our contemporary religious and moral discourse. She begins her book with a critique of efforts by prominent scholars to explain this polarization. Alasdair MacIntyre traces the problem to the fragmentation of our moral norms; John Rawls points to reliance on arguments based on faith rather than shared beliefs and modes of reasoning; and Stephen Carter blames the failure to frame arguments in civil terms. According to Kaveny, none of these explanations is sufficient to fully understand and address the contentiousness of today\u2019s discourse because each fails to look beyond the substance of religious claims to consider their rhetorical form as well.\nIn particular, Kaveny argues that scholars have overlooked the characteristically American practice of prophetic indictment and its deep roots in American history. Like the Puritan clergy who delivered fiery \u201cjeremiads\u201d in early New England, today\u2019s culture warriors use harsh and uncompromising language to condemn social and political evils that they believe threaten fundamental national values. Their goal is not to engage in moral deliberation but to deliver an urgent and unequivocal message that will precipitate repentance and reform. Kaveny observes that when American jeremiads were first delivered in seventeenth-century New England, they served as a unifying force. Modeling their sermons on the moral indictments of Jeremiah and other Hebrew prophets, Puritan preachers such as Cotton Mather denounced breaches of the community\u2019s covenantal relationship with God and called upon New Englanders to recommit to a shared vision of social and political life. However, as covenantal theology was supplanted by a vaguer American exceptionalism and pluralism replaced a unified political vision, the fiery rhetoric of the jeremiad became an agent of division rather than unity. Indeed, by the time of the American Revolution, the jeremiad was being used to advance social change and innovation rather than to shore up existing consensus.\nKaveny is deeply ambivalent about the use of prophetic rhetoric in contemporary American political discourse. When today\u2019s prophets excoriate their opponents with harsh and sometimes brutal language, the divisiveness of their rhetoric has significant social costs, and the breakdown of conversation and community can occur even among those who share the same religious traditions and basic moral premises. Kaveny points to the debates over abortion and torture among Catholics and evangelical Protestants during the 2004 presidential election. Members of these communities shared the belief that torture and abortion are grave evils, but they clashed with one another when they split over whether to approach these issues with the rhetoric of prophetic indictment or with the more nuanced and multifaceted form of deliberative discourse that characterizes our ordinary moral language and argument.

It\u2019s unclear just when this was inserted into Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution, but his status was obvious from the audience gathered to hear his verdict on Wednesday. Policymakers, economics editors, broadcasters \u2014 all had come to note down, and take as gospel, what this friendly, slightly gangly 42-year-old had to say. \u2018It\u2019s amazing how one man came to wield so much power,\u2019 muses a Treasury source. Just what to do about it has been on the Tories\u2019 minds for some time.\nOver the eight years that Chote has been running the Institute of Fiscal Studies, it has come to occupy its own place in public life. The IFS, rather than any committee of MPs, is seen as the Britain\u2019s leading economics watchdog. Last year, when George Osborne was unexpectedly given Alistair Darling\u2019s post-Budget slot on BBC radio and was asked if there were any hidden nasties in the Chancellor\u2019s statement, he said he did not know, but that he would when the IFS had spoken. Even the man who is now Chancellor regards Chote as some kind of economics oracle.\nThere was a time when the media performed this role. But newspapers have for years been haemorrhaging sales and staff \u2014 and, with them, the expertise required to root out economic spin (as Gordon Brown found to his delight). Over the years it is Chote\u2019s team, rather than any newspaper, which has routinely found the big Budget story. Last year, it was the hidden spending cuts. Before that, the fact that the 50p tax would mean less tax revenue, not more. Before that, how Brown\u2019s 10p tax would hit millions of the worst-off. Chote\u2019s hit rate became so lethal that politicians would nervously pass him their draft policies to see, unofficially, if he approved. \u2018We do give advice,\u2019 he says. \u2018We\u2019ve done it with the Liberal Democrats. And when Labour was in government we even did it with sections of government that didn\u2019t feel that was a question they would like to ask the Treasury.\u2019 It is, he says, technical help; simply applying the IFS expertise to various policies. But those who seek his advice know it runs deeper. If he thinks numbers don\u2019t add up, and says so in public, the media will trash the policy. His decisions are seen as final.\nIf politics is a battle of ideas, whose side is Chote on? He broadly approved of the Budget but \u2014 annoyingly for Osborne \u2014 pointed out that the VAT rise was not \u2018unavoidable\u2019 and required to pay for child tax credit. And even the increased tax credit is a \u00a32 billion ruse by the Treasury to make sure the Budget passes the test of famous IFS charts which purport to measure child poverty. The Treasury has, yet again, spent billions seeking to manipulate these poverty spreadsheets.\nIt is a perfect example of the power of metrics. \u2018The phrase \u201cchild poverty\u201d refers to Gordon Brown\u2019s flagship income redistribution programme. It is an ingenious piece of spin. An ever-moving poverty line is chosen (60 per cent of average income) and tax credits are used to lift people from just below this line to just above it. The person is then declared to be \u201clifted out of poverty\u201d.

However, the evidence of harmful effects over any perceived benefits of sleep deprivation should encourage students of all ages to seek simple yet effective ways to improve their sleep cycle, and therefore their mood, health and performance. This simple goal of improving sleep for the new year can help you begin to reach other goals, from making healthier food choices to focusing better in school.\nA University of Minnesota study found that students who pulled all-nighters tended to have lower GPAs, but with increased and regular sleep time, students\u2019 grades consequently tended to improve. The importance of sleep not only lies in academic performance, but in the overall energy, positivity and focus that follows a good night\u2019s sleep.\nIn an interview for UCLA Magazine, neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried points to the fact that when individuals are deprived of sleep, both their motor abilities and their perception of the world slows down.\nIn 2017, Fried conducted a study observing the effects of sleep deprivation on individual brain cells details the mental lapses one experiences after an all-nighter \u2013 a mental lapse quite similar to driving a car or taking a test drunk.\nPaul Macey, a neuroscientist and associate professor in the school of nursing at UCLA, said researchers have been seeing links between poor sleep habits, and issues from resultant depression and anxiety to more latent effects like diabetes or Alzheimer\u2019s.\nA board member of the mental health awareness club Active Minds, Elena Sternlicht said she feels social consequences from a lack of sleep.

So not only are the memories of these four years at school at risk of being partially erased, but the memory of lectures of the day are also at risk, affecting academic life.\nFirst-year public affairs student Amy Stanfield recalls the downward spiral stemming from decreased sleep quality and how it affected her work throughout her first quarter at UCLA.\nLuckily for Stanfield, Sternlicht and many other students, there are many ways to improve sleep length, quality and regularity, which are the key to maintaining a sense of calmness and regularity in daily routines.\nThere are tried and true ways to enhance your sleep, many of which are as easy as making your bed in the morning to create a comfortable, anxiety-reducing space for later, and allowing that space to be a sleep-inducing tech-free zone.\nGiven the melatonin-damaging nature of the blue light we interact with on our numerous screens, making conscious efforts to reduce light by wearing blue-light blocking glasses or an eye mask proves essential to a good night\u2019s rest.\nAlongside the multitude of light sources, there are sound sources that can further disrupt a night routine on campus.

Of course it is sometimes interesting to hear what business leaders have to say.\nBut so-called business coverage is still dominated by news of the big companies with stock market quotations who have to report their shareholders.\nVast swathes of business life all over the world are simply ignored by the business broadcasters, and the financial pages of the newspapers.\nWe don\u2019t hear much about private companies, or family-owned businesses, some of them much bigger and more influential than the public companies with traded stocks.\nAnd the news editors seem to be obsessed by the minutiae of monthly or weekly official statistics, endlessly speculating or whether or not the figures (out in a few minutes...) are going to show we are in depression or recession, whatever that means.\nWe\u2019ve had an explosion of financiers\u2019 news, pushing real, hands-on business into the background.\nAnd those business leaders who give interviews have been trained and polished by advisors who ensure they give nothing away but still generate a good feeling about their corporations.

YouTube videos of previous sermons indicate the church maintains a congregation of about 50 people.\nWilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said 26 people were killed and 20 people were injured in the shooting. Eight victims were taken to Brooke Army Medical Center, nine were taken to University Hospital and others were taken to Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, along with other area hospitals. Most victims' identities have not yet been released.\nA witness said Kelley was in tactical gear when he stormed into the church and began shooting. Kelley fled the church in a car and led authorities on a brief chase into Guadalupe County.\nABC News confirmed Kelley was previously a U.S. Air Force member who served in Logistics Readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge in 2014. An Air Force spokesperson told ABC News he was court-martialed in 2012 for two counts of Article 128 UCMJ, Assault on his spouse and assault on their child. He received a bad conduct discharge, confinement for twelve months and a reduction to the grade of E-1.\nA law enforcement source told ABC News that the Ruger rifle used in the church shooting was purchased from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio. The sports retailer has 240 locations. Officials said Monday Kelley purchased 2 guns in Texas and two guns in Colorado in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 -- one gun a year. Officials did not say when in 2017 he purchased the latest gun.\nAcademy Sports + Outdoors sends our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and the entire Sutherland Springs community. Based on information we received from law enforcement, we confirmed that the suspect purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations, one in 2016 and one in 2017. We also confirmed that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). We are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate further.\nSeveral emergency vehicles were seen at the intersection of Hartfield and Sandy Elm Roads in La Vernia, approximately 11 miles away from the church.

Few, however, could have predicted the scale of the backlash when the resolution, which called on the UCU to circulate a boycott request by Palestinian trade unions to all branches for \"information and discussion\", was passed by 158 votes to 99.\nWithin hours it was headline news in Britain and Israel, within days it was making waves in Europe and north America, and soon every newspaper from the Kansas City Star (\"A stain on British academia\") to the Turkish Daily News (\"Israel discusses retaliation to boycott threats\") was in on the act.\nTony Blair phoned the Israeli prime minister to reassure him that the motion did not reflect wider public opinion. In Israel, MPs began drafting a bill to label British imports \u2013 allowing consumers to stage their own counter boycott.\nBut in the two weeks since the vote, it is the US that has had the biggest surge of activity among the anti-boycott camp. About 2,000 American scholars \u2013 including at least nine Nobel laureates \u2013 have vowed to stay away from any event from which Israelis are excluded.

Thirty other members of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors.\nAlan Dershowitz, the prominent lawyer and Harvard law professor, says he has mustered a team of 100 high-profile lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic to \"devastate and bankrupt\" anyone acting against Israeli universities.\n\"If the union goes ahead with this immoral petition, it will destroy British academia,\" Dershowitz told the Guardian last night. \"We will isolate them from the rest of the world. They will end up being the objects of the boycott because we will get tens of thousands of the most prominent academics from around the world to refuse to cooperate and refuse to participate in any events from which Israeli academics are excluded.

According to the Icelandic Sagas, Eric the Red\u2013exiled from Iceland for the crime of murder\u2013stumbled upon Greenland\u2019s glacial shores in the late 10th century. Though \u201cColdland\u201d or \u201cSnowyland\u201d would have been more apt, he dubbed the place \u201cGr\u0153nland\u201d in the hopes of luring settlers to the remote outpost with the promise of bountiful forests and fields.\nEric the Red\u2019s false advertising, however, may become more appropriate in the not-too-distant future, an international team of researchers report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Climate change is quickly converting once-frozen tracts into potentially hospitable places for trees and shrubs. In some parts of the country, pieces of land have already opened up and only await a few chance seeds to blow in and begin the process of converting the rugged landscape into lush forest.\nThese findings sprouted up through a computer model the researchers built of Greenland\u2019s predicted climate for the next 100 years. They overlaid that climate model with known data for various North American and European tree species\u2019 ideal habitat niches. Within a century, they found, all 56 species of trees and shrubs they tested would likely be happy to take up residence or expand their reach in Greenland. Greenland, they predict, could start looking a lot more like Alaska or western Canada, though the exact composition of trees and bushes depends upon which species make it there first and take advantage of the new ecological niches.\nCurrently, only five species of trees or large shrubs occur naturally in Greenland\u2013Greenland mountain ash, mountain alder, downy birch, grayleaf willow, and common juniper\u2013and and those hardy plants grow only in scattered plots in the far south. Field experiments and ambitious gardening projects, however, have confirmed that a range of other species\u2013including Siberian larch, white spruce, lodgepole pine and Eastern balsam poplar\u2013can get a root-hold in Greenland if given the chance. Those species, along with the five other long-established native varieties, may begin to spread as temperatures warm. The team also predicts that invasive species\u2013species not currently found on Greenland\u2013will inevitably find their way to the island as well. How soon this will happen, however, remains a matter of speculation.\nWithout help, the researchers\u2019 models indicate that some species of trees would take around 2,000 years to find their way to a hospitable patch of Greenland soil. In today\u2019s age of tourism and regular flights between continents, however, the plants will most likely receive some significant, though inadvertent, colonization assistance. Researchers and tourists alike tramp around with all sorts of seeds unknowingly stuck to their shoes. A study conducted in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway with a similar ecosystem as Greenland, found 1,019 seeds of 53 species clinging to just 259 travelers\u2019 shoes. Twenty-six of those species germinated in Arctic conditions when given the opportunity. Migratory birds, likewise, have been known since the time of Alfred Russell Wallace and Charles Darwin to bring along seeds stuck to their plumage and feet or passed through their bowels.\nWhether human-mediated or not, this ecological shift, the team points out, would be no small change for Green"}

He has battled officials and advocacy groups on this issue for almost a decade, losing more often than not in court after court. But his latest move \u2014 petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to take up his complaint \u2014 is one colossal step too far. Asking the highest court to declare the California Coastal Act unconstitutional doesn\u2019t just threaten a cherished and sound law that establishes the public\u2019s access to its beaches, it could erode efforts to provide that kind of coastal access across the nation.\nKhosla\u2019s property in Half Moon Bay offers the only dry land route from Highway 1 to Martins Beach, a secluded but popular stretch of the coastline. Before Khosla bought it in 2008, the previous owners had long offered the public access to the beach for a fee via a private road on the property, as well as providing parking and restrooms. Beachgoers have availed themselves of this access since the 1920s.\nKhosla\u2019s property isn\u2019t being unfairly confiscated just because the courts have told him to keep his road open to the public for a fee.\nKhosla continued these practices for several months, closing the gate to the road intermittently during bad weather \u2014 something he says the previous owners had done. But the closures prompted a warning letter from the local San Mateo County authorities. And with that, an ornery dispute over whether he could close the road at all and what he could charge beachgoers escalated into a barrage of lawsuits against county officials, the California Coastal Commission and the State Lands Commission, as well as lawsuits by public interest groups against Khosla, all of which have landed us at the Supreme Court\u2019s doors.\nThat\u2019s an overly broad (and dramatic) reading of the Coastal Act. In practice, public access is intensely negotiated between the Commission and property owners. Many of the ensuing legal battles are over easements that owners agreed to grant but reneged on later. The complication in Khosla\u2019s case has been whether he must keep open a road that had no official easement on it. The reason he should be compelled to keep it open is because the public has been using it for nearly 100 years. As the commission puts it, the public holds a \u201cprescriptive right\u201d to the road based on that lengthy use \u2014 and that should be as legitimate as a recorded easement.\nKhosla\u2019s property isn\u2019t being unfairly confiscated just because the courts have told him to keep his road open to the public for a fee. But in trying to prove that his rights are being violated, Khosla is seeking to dismantle a law that, for four decades, has provided reasonable access to California\u2019s beaches along the entire coast to millions of people, vanishingly few of whom can afford to buy houses along the coast.\nIn fact, the Coastal Act and the Commission\u2019s enforcement of it may be the only thing that has stood between the public\u2019s access to the beach and high-rollers buying enough property to block it off. The idea that Khosla would use his wealth to resolve a dispute about his private road by trying to demolish that law and diminish access to the coast is unconscionable.\nThe Supreme Court should not take this case. The Coastal Commission is still trying to work with Khos"}

Investors have watched Apple closely in recent weeks as a string of poor forecasts from the smartphone supply chain signaled that iPhone demand may be lower than previously expected. They have also been watching carefully for signs of what Apple plans to do with its hundreds of billions of dollars in cash.\nApple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year.

The company sold 52.2 million iPhones versus expectations of 52.3 million, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, up from 50.7 million last year.\nAverage selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. Maestri told Reuters that clearing channel inventory of 1.8 million iPhones - most of them iPhone X and iPhone 8 models - accounted for some of the difference.\nProfits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share and up from $2.10 a year ago.\nThe company forecasted a midpoint of $52.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, beating analyst expectations of $51.6 billion.\nApple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion.

No Democrats voted for the bill. Ryan could lose 22 GOP votes, but in the end, he only lost 13.\nThe main goal of the House\u2019s \u201cTax Cut and Jobs Act\u201d is to lower taxes on companies in an effort to make them more competitive and discourage them from moving abroad. The bill reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and the rate for pass-through businesses down to 25 percent (with some restrictions). Many families would also pay less, although Ryan has admitted that won\u2019t be the case for everyone. Here\u2019s a rundown of what is actually in the final version of the bill that passed.\nIt keeps the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. The House voted on a tax bill only. The Senate bill includes a provision to scrap the legal requirement that almost all Americans buy health insurance or pay a penalty. The House isn\u2019t touching that, which may lead to a showdown between the two chambers if they have to resolve their very different versions of the bill.\nBig businesses win. The House bill cuts the top rate that large corporations pay from 35 percent to 20 percent, the biggest one-time drop in the big-business tax rate ever. It is a permanent change that does not expire. On top of that, companies would get some new tax breaks to help lower their bills, such as the ability to deduct all the costs of purchasing new equipment for five years, as well as a special low rate on any money they bring back to the United States from low-tax countries such as Ireland. Many businesses have been holding cash overseas to avoid 35 percent U.S. taxes. Now they would get to bring the money home at a tax rate of 12 percent.The entire business tax system would also change from a worldwide system, in which money anywhere around the globe is taxed, to a territorial system in which it\u2019s mostly money made in the United States that is taxed. Businesses have long lobbied for this change.\nSmall businesses get a mini-win. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the largest small business lobby, initially was against the House bill, but Republicans made some changes and now the NFIB is giving its blessing. 95 percent of American businesses are organized as pass through companies (LLCs, S-Corps, partnerships), and they \u201cpass through\u201d the business income to the owner\u2019s individual tax rate. The House plan lowers the top rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent for small businesses (excluding \u201cservice companies\u201d like consultants and lawyers) and requires a complex formula where the 25 percent rate only applies to about 30 percent of the business income. But the reality is most small businesses \u2013 85 percent \u2013 already pay taxes at rates of 25 percent or less. To help out the small \u201cmom and pops,\u201d the final bill has a 9 percent rate on the first $75,000 in income for business owners making $150,000 or less. But that tax break phases in, meaning it isn\u2019t fully available until 2022.\nThe rich do very well. The wealthy get a lot of benefits in the bill. The estate tax, which is"}

I've never had an experience like that making a movie.\"\n\"Stronger,\" directed by David Gordon Green, is the kind of movie that holds as much drama off the screen as on it. The movie chronicles Bauman's struggles after a bomb explosion tore through his legs while he was waiting by the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon. He was there to greet his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Erin Hurley, who had previously chided him for never \"showing up.\"\n\"Stronger,\" based on Bauman's 2014 memoir, is an undoubtedly inspiring story, but maybe not in the way you'd expect. Honest, painful and funny, it avoids the familiar Hollywood beats for a more truthful tale of personal growth. \"The big moments of our lives don't happen in a close-up,\" says Gyllenhaal.\n\"Stronger\" captures Bauman, now 31, recalibrating his life after the tragedy, still struggling with relationship and drinking problems that predated the bombing and chafing at the role cast upon him as a heroic symbol of \"Boston Strong.\" Bauman instead saw himself merely, he says, as: \"Just a dude with no legs.\"\nBauman's modesty remains, but he's also come to terms with being someone who gives hope to others, who can now connect with a wide world of amputees, war veterans and other sufferers trying to get by. One memorable scene, taken from a real experience, shows Bauman mobbed at Fenway and listening to story after story.\n\"There's so much love coming at Jeff,\" says Gyllenhaal. \"People line up \u2014 they really do \u2014 to talk to him. They're like: 'This thing happened to me,' 'That thing happened to me.' We are not alone in all that, and that's what his story says.\"\nMeeting for an interview at a Toronto hotel shortly after the film's festival premiere, the close bond between Gyllenhaal and Bauman was plainly evident. In the two and a half years since they began working on the movie together, they've gotten to know each other well through Gyllenhaal's regular trips up to Boston to spend time with Bauman and study how he moves physically. Bauman came to New York to see Gyllenhaal on Broadway. They threw out the first pitch at Fenway Park together.\n\"Since we first met, I think he's a totally different person now,\" Gyllenhaal says. \"Particularly in the past year, since getting sober. I think he's been much more open. When we first met, trying to learn about him and figure out what was going on was a little harder. And now I feel like I know him better than even when I played the role.\"\n\"Bromance\" is a term that has often been applied to their relationship, but Gyllenhaal, 36, is more like an"}

(AP) \u2014 As he made his way through a parking lot full of tailgating North Dakota State University football fans on a recent rainy weekend, there was no question Rep. Kevin Cramer is President Donald Trump\u2019s guy.\nPeople awaiting kickoff with spreads of food and drink greeted the Republican Senate candidate with good wishes and some free campaign advice: Stick with the president.\nOne man called out to Cramer, shouting, \u201cYou\u2019ve got my vote\u201d and \u201cMAGA,\u201d the acronym for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d which supporters still use as a rallying cry.\nThe three-term congressman and early Trump supporter has made loyalty to the president in a state that overwhelmingly supported him in 2016 the main selling point of his campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\nIt\u2019s an argument that put Heitkamp in a bind over how to vote on Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court. She said Thursday she will vote no, a decision that will embolden Cramer and his supporters to try to paint Heitkamp as out of step with North Dakota.\nEven before the Kavanaugh controversy, the Senate race here was among a handful of close contests that could decide whether Republicans keep control of the Senate, where they have a 51-49 majority. Heitkamp, a first-term senator and former state attorney general, is one of 10 Democratic senators trying to win in states Trump carried in November, and her fight may be tougher than most. Trump won North Dakota by 36 points, his best showing in any state where a Senate Democrat is seeking re-election except West Virginia.\nHeitkamp argues North Dakota voters don\u2019t want hyper-partisan lawmakers. She has supported many of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and judicial nominees, including Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch. However, she has opposed him on issues such as his tax cut bill and his tariffs on China, which she says have hurt many North Dakota farmers.\nYet even as some Republicans elsewhere distance themselves from Trump, Cramer has maintained he is \u201c100 percent\u201d with Trump on issues important to North Dakota. Trump has rewarded him with two visits this year, including a rally in Fargo that drew thousands.\nTrump and Cramer are something of a natural pairing. They both have a reputation for making the kind of unfiltered comments that can provoke outrage, particularly from liberals and other critics.\nEarlier this year Cramer said farmers raising concerns about the trade war needed a \u201chigher pain threshold.\u201d Last week he made headlines for his comments about Kavanaugh, who\u2019s been accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her while they were in high school. She testified Kavanaugh held her down and covered her mouth while trying to take off her clothes; Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\nHeitkamp criticized Cramer for the remarks, saying they diminished the severity of assault allegations. She suggested last week she had concerns about Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, saying there are many qualified lawyers who could do the job. A confirmation vote could be held this week.\nThe remarks, and the candidates\u2019 stances on Kavanaugh, got a mixed reception from voters.\nRobyn Bancroft, who was eating breakfast at a Grand Forks cafe with her daughters when Heitkamp stopped in last week, had a one-word reaction to Cramer\u2019s remarks: \u201cDisgusting.\u201d She"}

They echo those raised by postwar big-city mayors who bemoaned the inevitable suburbanization of that era\u2019s white middle class, which created sharp and enduring social and economic differences between cities and their suburbs. Those politicians also were bufuddled by enormous changes that they did not fully understand.\nAnd, indeed, this parallel between the experience of California\u2019s recent out-migration and that of postwar suburban flight reflects a more general, national migration dynamic which is forging new and demographically distinct regions, whose differences may well supersede those that separated post-war cities from their suburbs.\nThis dynamic finds, on the one hand, large flows of domestic migrants pouring out of highly urbanized states to create a mostly suburban, middle-class \u201cNew Sunbelt\u201d region. At the same time, immigrants continue to flow into the ethnically diverse, more urban \u201cMelting Pot\u201d states, almost unaware of the former out-movement and its causes.\nMeanwhile, a residual cluster of \u201cHeartland\u201d region states, mostly unaffected by either migration flow, is increasingly defined by its relative stagnation.\nThe New Sunbelt\u201413 states in the nation\u2019s West and Southeast of which Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina are prime examples\u2014is the present-day counterpart of America\u2019s suburbs.\nIt contains one-fifth of the U.S. population but is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the nation (it grew by 28 percent vs. 15 percent over the 1990-2002 period), in large measure thanks to suburban-like in-migrants: white middle-class families, singles and retirees; the Southeast, they are joined by a returning black middle class.\nIn each case, the new migrants are trading the pricey, congested commuting towns of the more urban metropolises in California and the Northeast for more peaceful, family-friendly 21st-century Levittowns in the sprawling suburbs and exurbs of places like Atlanta, Las Vegas and Phoenix.\nIn essence, they are making long-distance moves to achieve the suburban dream that no longer exits for them in Connecticut, New Jersey or Orange County, Calif. While immigrants and Hispanics in search of low-wage service and construction jobs are beginning to follow, the inflow to the New Sunbelt is dominated by mostly white and black households with middle-class incomes and good educations.\nThe New Sunbelt, it should be said, does not include the \u201cold\u201d Sunbelt meccas of California, Texas and Florida.

I'm originally from Russia so I grew up in the Soviet Union behind the iron curtain and I remember that in 1970s things were changing - political prisoners were permitted to leave the country, soviet leadership was convinced and persuaded to engage with the West in exchange for certain actions in improving its human rights records, Soviet Union was permitted to deal more actively on the economic front.\nI believe that the same grand bargain can be achieved in relations with North Korea.\nELEANOR HALL: You mentioned sanctions, are Western sanctions over North Korea's nuclear actions contributing to some of the problems that are raised in this report like hunger?

There are a number of myths that can confuse you and waste your precious time. However, here are five common cleaning myths that could be doing more harm than good in your house.\nCommon house cleaning methods may not always give you clean air to breathe. Combat indoor air pollution with smarter ways to remove hidden dust in surfaces and corners.\nMukesh Khare, Vice President, Society for Indoor Environment and Professor, IIT Delhi and Evan Stevens, Head of Category - Environmental Control, Dyson, debunk some common house cleaning myths.\nYes, they're soft and fluffy, but contrary to their name, feather dusters don't really do much than just spreading the dust around. Instead, a vacuum cleaner that provides several key features like powerful suction, versatility, a post-motor filter, sealed system and hygienic bin ejector, can be of greater help when trying to get rid of dust that is visible, and also hidden.\nTo begin with, air fresheners don't really get rid of bad smells or odors. They simply mask them. However, the chemicals given off by scented candles and air fresheners are known to be a prominent indoor air pollutant. Having an air purifier that filters smaller ultrafine particles up to 0.1 microns and gases and VOCs (Volatile organic compounds) is a must if you are a strong user of air fresheners.\nGenerally, carpets can stand to be vacuumed several times a week without sustaining damage. Leaving dirt in a carpet, however, actually breaks down fibers underneath the carpet and creates a breeding ground for dust mites and bacteria. Of course, you will need to use care when vacuuming delicate floor coverings, and also use the right attachments meant for carpet cleaning.\nNot only do outdoor pollutants and dust particles seep into your home every time a door is opened, or even through minor gaps present in your doors and windows, but your home itself has a whole array of indoor pollutants that come from cleaning agents, cooking fumes, indoor paints, pet dander, pollen from plants. It is hence advisable to use an air purifier which automatically senses the pollution in the air and helps capture harmful gases and pollutants found in indoor air.\nAir pollution is a year-long phenomenon and is not limited to winter months or to the north of India. Indoor air can be far worse and polluted, adversely affecting babies/toddlers, senior citizens, asthma sufferers and expecting moms amongst others. Air purification technology, hence, becomes essential to have a clean home all-year round, regardless of which part of the country you live in.\nIndoor air pollution can be five times or more worse than outdoor air pollution. Both household air pollution and outdoor air pollution can increase the risk of COPD, asthma and lung cancer. Here are few simple tips to avoid indoor air pollution."}

Just two months before another key deadline to sign up for 2014 coverage, MNsure has deep technical design flaws, unreliable functionality and a woefully understaffed call center \u2014 problems that make it unlikely initial enrollment projections will be met.\nThe problems plaguing the site weren\u2019t altogether surprising given the high-profile news coverage of MNsure\u2019s mounting problems as consumers raced late last month to meet an end-of-the-year deadline for coverage beginning Jan. 1. Still, the big picture provided by Optum, a subsidiary of Twin Cities-based UnitedHealth Group, was sobering.\nEven though the state has spent millions (mostly from federal grants) building its customized marketplace, it now appears even more is needed to make the site reasonably functional.\nNo estimates on how much it will cost to fix MNsure were offered during the Wednesday board discussion of Optum\u2019s pro bono \u201cend to end\u201d review. But the price tag will be substantial for this in-demand expertise.\nAccording to a Dec. 29 MedCity News report, Maryland hired Optum \u201con an emergency basis for a two-month, $4 million stint\u201d to fix its troubled insurance marketplace. Timelines given Wednesday by Optum, which has cultivated a healthy business repairing these online marketplaces, to fix or overhaul MNsure ranged from 16 to 24 months.\nOne note to state officials evaluating MNsure options: A \u201clarge infusion\u201d of federal funds is reportedly helping to pay for Maryland repairs. Whether similar aid is available for MNsure is unclear, but this is an avenue to be promptly pursued given current demands on the state budget.\nSome of the initial descriptions of the Optum report, particularly on social media by health reform opponents, misleadingly suggested that the firm had recommended scrapping MNsure entirely. The clear message from Optum is that the site is fixable.\nThe firm laid out three options for doing so. The first two offered varying intensities of repair to the current framework. The third option is the equivalent of replacing a car engine during a vehicle repair: rebuilding the site\u2019s technical architecture, something that could be done in 12 to 18 months, while still leaving the current site operational for consumers. Optum also recommended beefing up call-center staffing, as well as more efficiently routing phone calls \u2014 something MNsure has begun already.\nThe fixes won\u2019t be completed before March 31, the last day consumers can buy 2014 coverage and avoid the penalty for not having insurance. But the repairs are doable and substantive improvement realistic.\nOptum\u2019s review covered a lot of ground, but it didn\u2019t delve into broader questions about MNsure\u2019s governance structure, funding, accountability and mission.\nLegislation authorizing the marketplace was passed on a mostly DFL party-line vote in 2013, just months before the website\u2019s Oct. 1 launch, after a Republican-controlled Legislature stonewalled development during two previous sessions. The toxic politics likely influenced decisions about the MNsure board\u2019s independent structure and future funding from a premium tax instead of state funds. This helped"}

The bribery allegations have also triggered corruption investigations in Switzerland, where Mr Steinmetz lives, and the US, where one BSGR intermediary is facing years in jail. Neither investigation has brought charges against Mr Steinmetz nor Guernsey-registered BSGR.\nBSGR has denied allegations of corruption in its Guinean dealings since they were first revealed in the Financial Times in November 2012. The company has threatened to seek international arbitration if the government proceeds with what it calls an \u201cillegal\u201d move to seize its assets based on \u201cincredible and unsupported\u201d claims.\nBut the Guinean inquiry, part of a review of mining contracts struck under past dictatorships, concluded in its 33-page report that there was \u201cprecise and consistent evidence establishing with sufficient certainty the existence of corrupt practices\u201d in the way BSGR won its mining rights. A committee of ministers endorsed the inquiry\u2019s recommendations last week, according to a person familiar with the matter, and they are expected to be enacted by the cabinet forthwith. BSGR\u2019s only recourse would be through the courts.\nBSGR won the jewel of its Guinean prospects \u2013 rights to half of Simandou, a remote mountain that ranks among the world\u2019s richest untapped iron-ore deposits \u2013 in late 2008, days before the 24-year dictatorship of Lansana Cont\u00e9 ended with his death.\nAccording to the inquiry\u2019s findings, beginning in 2006 BSGR\u2019s representatives offered millions of dollars in cash and shares to Mamadie Tour\u00e9, the dictator\u2019s fourth wife, to help ensure that those rights were stripped from rival Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto and then granted to BSGR.\nAfter spending $160m on preliminary development of its Guinea assets, BSGR in April 2010 struck its $2.5bn deal with Vale, of which $500m was payable immediately. The balance was to be paid if targets were met but Vale halted payments last year, after the corruption allegations surfaced.\nThe inquiry concluded that, although payments to Ms Tour\u00e9 allegedly continued following the Vale transaction, it was \u201clikely\u201d that the Brazilian group \u201chas not participated in corrupt practices\u201d. Nonetheless, it said the Vale-BSGR joint venture \u2013 which BSGR says has spent $1bn at Simandou \u2013 should be stripped of its rights to that and other prospects.\nVale, which is under new leadership since the departure in 2011 of Roger Agnelli, chief"}

But other residents and activists aren\u2019t waiting around for the additional funding. They\u2019re launching grassroots campaigns to completely provide young people with critical resources such as libraries.\nOn Tuesday, November 11, over 100 parents, teachers, students, and education advocates attended a Baltimore school board hearing on what schools will be closed as a part of the funding and revitalization plan called the 21st Century School Initiative. Among those attending was Jamal Jones of the Baltimore algebra project, which is a youth-led education advocacy group. He discussed the challenges members of the Lake Clifton community are facing as they try to ensure that their school receives funding.\nJAMAL JONES, COEXEC. DIR., BALTIMORE ALGEBRA PROJECT: These goals allocated a roundabout figure of $50 million to reconstruct their schools after a year, almost, a year or so of lack of communication and lack of transparency between the school system and the community members who have been previously engaged in the Lake Clifton community, that they were going to defer Lake Clifton, which essentially meant that Lake Clifton wouldn\u2019t be done, because the reconstruction for Lake Clifton was estimated to be about 90 million, and they wanted to spend about 50 million.\nSo today we were coming out to, one, propose\u2013well, to kind of show our grievances against the idea that we would close, that they would close. Like, and the other idea is that the lake would be deferred.\nSHERMAN: Other community members suggested alternative proposals, such as keeping some schools open for longer. School board officials stated that they would be announcing the fate of schools like Lake Clifton and Patterson on another date.\nThe 21st Century Schools Initiative is in its infancy. Feasibility studies used to gauge the utilization rate of each school have been underway since the fall of 2013 and were delayed due to some miscalculations of the cost to renovate each building.\nAlison Perkins-Cohen, the executive director of the New Initiatives Department of Baltimore City Public Schools, talks about the reasons behind the delayed studies and the purpose of closing certain schools.\nALISON PERKINS-COHEN, EXEC. DIR., NEW INITIATIVES DEPT., BCPS: We want to make sure that each individual feasibility study was as efficient as possible, so providing the best in the education possible in the most efficient way possible, so that we could spread the resources to as many schools as possible. And that process took us a little longer than anticipated. And now we\u2019re kind of back on track with those and bringing feasibility studies to the board for approval, and we\u2019ll be meeting with communities again in terms of the next phase of design.\nIf you\u2019re trying to maintain all these buildings, many of which are underutilized, that\u2019s very expensive. So if we can have students in a smaller number of buildings, where they\u2019re actually utilizing it at a higher percentage, and have enough students in those programs to support better programming, then it also cuts down on our maintenance cost and allows us to focus those resources on the schools where students are and to provide better facilities to all students.\nSHERMAN: Many who were present during the meeting"}

Garcia went on to have a successful film career, most notably his work in The Godfather: Part III and Ocean's Eleven.\nThe idea of making The Lost City began 16 years ago, and Garcia - who says he has always believed that someday Cuba will be freed from Fidel Castro's control - never gave up on the story.\nRecently, Garcia spoke about bringing his most personal project to the screen.\nWhat do you think it took for you to get to this point of your life?\nFor me to be here, my parents had to sacrifice. They had the courage to get on a plane and go to a country where they didn't speak the language. They had to start anew, giving up their professions. Their professions in a sense were taken away because once everything was nationalized in Cuba ... whatever businesses you had were confiscated. Newspapers were confiscated. Businesses were confiscated. The monetary standards were changed. Your money was confiscated.\nAs Fico [Garcia's character] says in the movie, \"There was nothing left for me in Cuba, so I took Cuba with me.\" My parents made the sacrifice to bring me here so I could live in a place where I can be free to think for myself and to articulate my ideas without any repercussions.\nDo you still have relatives in Cuba?\nNo. We had a very small family and we all left.\nWhat did your parents do in Cuba?\nMy father was a lawyer and a farmer. His father died at 54. We had a farm outside of Havana and my mother was a high school ... teacher. My father loved the farm.\nWhat sentiments did your parents share with you about leaving Cuba?\nWhen we came here, there was never any sadness in our household. We were blessed that we were here. We were able to be in America and have an opportunity to pursue our dreams and live free. We knew what was going down in Cuba and still is: the lack of human rights and freedoms [which are] essential to human beings.\nWe grew up living in a one-room apartment for all six of us.

If that sounds like a match made in heaven, Les Toits du Monde in the Upper Laurentians would be your paradise.\nLes Toits du Monde (roofs of the world) offers glamping par excellence, a beautiful mix of creativity and the great outdoors. You\u2019ll bed down in magical huts like the Hobbit House, an authentic Mongolian Yurt or the Enchanted Treehouse, and relax in a snowy, secluded landscape of maples, birches and firs.\nFall, originally from Senegal, and Neuenschwander, from France, are computer engineers who met when they were students in Europe. Both yearned for a back-to-nature lifestyle and they fulfilled their dream to the max in Quebec, developing a rustic vacation domain outside the town of Nominingue.\nThe huts are tiny, eco-conscious architectural wonders.\nThe couple hired a master carpenter to help with construction and an engineer for the structural plans, but otherwise designed and crafted their huts and furniture by themselves, by hand.\n\u201cThe lodges each give off a special energy,\u201d said Neuenschwander. \u201cThey\u2019re flights of fantasy that transport visitors to dreams of adventure, discovery and sharing.\nThe scene: Guests check in at a welcome pavilion housed in a prospectors\u2019 tent and that\u2019s as far as cars go at this pristine site.\nLes Toits du Monde is a bring-your-own-almost-everything place \u2014 food, bedding and camping accessories \u2014 so be prepared to haul your baggage by sledge between 300 and 900 metres from the parking lot to the accommodation.\nThe site supplies mattresses, pillows, cooking utensils, drinking water, firewood for heating and propane for cooking. If you want to cook on an open fire, there are logs for sale.\nTo take your adventure up a notch and polish your outdoor skills, Neuenschwander offers a two-hour forest survival course ($40, $30, $25 p.p., for two, three, four or more people).\nThe lodging: There are five unusual lodgings of different styles and comfort levels, for two to four people.

The pound has fallen about 20 percent against the dollar since the vote on concern about slower economic growth and reduced investment.\nMay\u2019s government fought hard to avoid putting the matter before Parliament, in part because amendments to the legislation could delay her timetable and force her into complicated concessions with her own lawmakers before she even sat across the table before the other 27 members of the EU.\nPutting the issue before Parliament is not a simple matter. While May holds sway in the House of Commons, the House of Lords have in recent years stalled dozens of pieces of legislation with which they disagreed, including an attempt by May\u2019s predecessor to impose welfare cuts on the vulnerable. The government backed down after the delay.\n\u201cDefeat in the House of Lords would not stop Brexit from happening, but it could delay it until mid-2020,\u201d Souta said.\nThe lawsuit was considered the most important constitutional case in a generation because it centered on the question of who ultimately wields power in Britain\u2019s system of government: the prime minister and her Cabinet, or Parliament.\nMay had said she would use centuries-old powers known as royal prerogative to invoke Article 50 of the EU treaty and launch two years of exit talks. The powers \u2014 traditionally held by the monarch \u2014 permit decisions about treaties and other specific issues to be made without a vote of Parliament.\nThe prime minister argued that the referendum gave her a mandate to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc and that discussing the details of her strategy with Parliament would weaken the government\u2019s negotiating position.\nFinancial entrepreneur Gina Miller sued to force the government to seek parliamentary approval. Leaving the EU, she said, would change the fundamental rights of citizens and this can\u2019t be done without a vote of lawmakers. The Supreme Court agreed.\n\u201cThe referendum is of great political significance, but the act of Parliament which established it did not say what should happen as a result, so any change in the law to give effect to the referendum must be made in the only way permitted by the U.K. constitution, namely by an act of Parliament,\u201d Supreme Court President David Neuberger said in reading the decision.\n\u201cTo proceed otherwise would be a breach of settled constitutional principles stretching back many centuries,\u201d he said.\nGina Miller, the lead claimant in the legal fight to get"}
{"idx": "12290", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The study, which was known as ProTECT-III (Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment), was conducted between April 2009 and October 2013. UC researchers enrolled 85 of the 882 patients enrolled nationally, making UCMC the highest enrolling hospital. In the study, eligible patients were randomized to receive progesterone or placebo within four hours of sustaining head injury, with most injuries received in automobile crashes. Patients were treated with progesterone or placebo for 96 hours and then closely followed by researchers for six months.\nProgesterone is a hormone that is associated with pregnancy but is also found in the brains of males and females. Animal studies have shown that progesterone may help improve recovery and reduce the extent of brain damage following traumatic head injury. Additionally, two single-center clinical trials showed decreased mortality and improved functional outcomes with progesterone treatment as compared with placebo.\nResults published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 51 percent of patients who received progesterone and 55.5 percent of patients who received placebo had favorable outcomes. This suggested that progesterone did not significantly improve outcome after head injury. Researchers originally planned to enroll 1,140 subjects across the country but the trial was stopped following a safety review showing that early results suggested no benefit to administering progesterone treatment after head injury.\nThe study, which was led nationally by researchers from Emory University in Atlanta, was conducted under exception from informed consent following federal Food and Drug Administration regulations. Because moderate to severe traumatic brain injury patients are generally not able to immediately provide consent to participating in trials such as ProTECT III, the study protocols allowed physicians to enroll patients after unsuccessfully attempting to reach a family member after 60 minutes of diligent effort. UC conducted extensive local community consultation and public disclosure activities about the trial before it started allowing local residents to opt out of the study if they wished. When a legally authorized representative was available, written informed consent was obtained before enrollment of the patient. For patients enrolled under the exemption from informed consent, patients or their legally authorized representatives were notified about enrollment by the study team as soon as possible and were asked to provide written informed consent to continue in the study.\nThe progesterone was administered by infusion after the patient was initially treated in the UC Medical Center emergency department. The treatment was generally well tolerated with similar rates of adverse events in both the progesterone- and placebo-treated groups. Vein inflammation, or phlebitis, was significantly more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group. Episodes of phlebitis were frequently categorized as not serious and were self-limited. The rates of other serious and nonserious adverse events were also similar in the two study groups.\nThe study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NS062778, NS059032 and NS056975) and was coordinated by the Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials network (NETT). UC is one of 22 academic medical centers within NETT.\nMore than 2.4 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations or deaths are related to traumatic brain injury annually, and approximately 5.3 million Americans are living with disability from TBI.

From Colorado and Connecticut to Ohio, Virginia, and Alabama \u2014 and everywhere in between \u2014 gun sales are exploding. Indeed, government data show 2013 was the best year for domestic sales in U.S. history after beating the previous high set the year before. Restrictions on gun rights, meanwhile, are overwhelmingly getting less draconian at the state level.\nIn terms of the numbers, 2013 was another record year, government data from the FBI\u2019s controversial \u201cbackground check\u201d system showed. According to news reports, over 21 million applications were processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) last year. Because one background check can be used to purchase multiple firearms, the number of guns sold might even be higher. In 2012, there were just under 20 million.\nOverall, nationwide gun sales, as measured by NICS data, were up eight percent over 2012\u2019s record-setting figures. Every year for the last 11 years has seen an increase in gun purchases. However, analysts say the \u201cshameless\u201d post-Newtown mega-push for new infringements on gun rights by the Obama administration and its increasingly discredited allies in the establishment media played a key role in the dramatic surge witnessed in late 2012 and into 2013.\nIndeed, all 10 of the top gun-sales weeks occurred since Obama announced his schemes to further restrict the human-rights protections in the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment. Eight of the top 10 weeks were in 2013, with the other two in December of 2012, according to numbers cited in the Washington Times. Since Obama has been in the White House, background checks have soared by 66 percent. Gun-manufacturer stock prices have been surging, too.\nDespite the full-blown attack on the Second Amendment by Obama and his allies in the press, state governments have overwhelmingly been loosening firearms restrictions. At the federal level, the administration\u2019s scheme to assault gun rights via unconstitutional legislation went down in flames, too, with the proposal failing to get through even the Democrat-controlled Senate.\nOf course, radical Democrat politicians in a few states \u2014 Colorado, New York, and Connecticut, for example \u2014 have managed to impose a number of draconian new violations against the gun rights of citizens, costing some of the politicians their political careers. On balance, however, the right to keep and bear arms has secured far more new legal protections than violations in America over the last year.\nIn fact, a recent analysis by the New York Times found that of the 109 new gun laws enacted at the state level since Obama\u2019s push began, 70 actually loosened restrictions \u2014 almost double the number of laws that tightened restrictions. Some states, such as Kansas, have even nullified unconstitutional federal restrictions, sending disgraced Attorney General Eric Holder into an outburst of rage.\nJustice Department boss Holder, who was caught on video calling for a taxpayer-funded program to \u201cbrainwash\u201d Americans to reject gun rights, and who is currently in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over documents on the administration\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d scheme to arm Mexican drug cartels, responded to Kansas with a bizarre but threatening letter.

On the sea below is an Australian navy Air Warfare Destroyer.\nThe battle will be all about who can stay hidden for long enough to get in close to deliver the lethal blow.\nThe Australians do this by using the combination of their networked radar systems to precisely target the Chinese threat, while using the Growler to jam the Chinese planes' own radar sensors.\nWithin this frantic move and countermove taking place over minutes and seconds, the jamming, hiding, searching and finding is constantly shifting back and forth. When the Chinese are jammed, they can shift the frequency of their radar and try to free up their eyes on another wavelength.\n\"It is really a battle of frequencies. It is a battle in the electromagnetic spectrum between their jamming systems, our jamming systems and so forth,\" Davis says.\nTraditionally, jamming has been a function of brute power \u2013 an enemy's radar can be neutered by blasting it with a more powerful radar. But newer techniques are more sophisticated: for instance, overloading the enemy sensors so that they are not just blinded but confused or even actively misled \u2013 though these capabilities cross into the classified realm that sources who spoke to Fairfax Media declined to discuss.\nDan Gillian, vice-president for the Growler at Boeing, the prime manufacturer of the Growler, said that stealth \u2013 the sleek shape and special coating of a plane like the JSF \u2013 only renders"}

Archie returns from the phone call to find Ricky gone. The tension builds as he searches the dark house. All that was missing was a shadow moving across the camera or something. Ricky ends up behind Archie holding a knife. The only way the Gargoyles will let him play, he says, is if he kills Archie, the Red Paladin. No matter what, Archie can\u2019t escape this weird tabletop RPG gang that wants to kill him. Ricky slashes up Archie\u2019s chest pretty good before Fred arrives home and the kid runs off. We don\u2019t get a sense of where this is all leading, but the story was thrilling enough that I don\u2019t mind for now. At least the creepy Ghoulies den is going away. Jughead and the Serpents take it over, planning to give it a fresh coat of paint and make it the new HQ.\nSpeaking of, the teen gang and business leaders are all beginning to lose control in this episode.

But he was unhappy.\nAlways awash with doubts and anxieties, Axelrod would agonize over the nuances of the stories he was writing, putting in long hours in the city's wards doing research and then spending hours more at the computer keyboard. But that was who he was.\nMuch more troublesome to him was how his career had begun to plateau. He was told that he would never be given the coveted title of Tribune political editor and would have to make do with the lesser designation of political writer under his byline.\nNot only that, but Axelrod felt his top bosses, who used to cover politics themselves, were micro-editing his stories and second-guessing his analysis of the local political landscape. And they had imported from Washington, D.C., a rising star, Steve Neal, who was also given a column and a political writer title.\nMany in his position would have bit the bullet and soldiered on. But Axelrod wasn't satisfied.\nEven though he and his wife, Susan, had two young children, one with serious health problems, he jumped ship--not only leaving the Tribune but journalism as well--taking a job as the press secretary for Democrat Paul Simon's run for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois.\nA quarter century later, Axelrod is one of the nation's pre-eminent political consultants--the most successful one not based on one of the Coasts. And, capping a career of putting Democratic hopefuls into office, he's the top strategist of the presidential campaign of his close friend, U.S. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).\n\"He's as good as it gets,\" says Mark McKinnon, the chief media adviser to President George W. Bush.\nBut Axelrod's still not satisfied.\nBy his own admission, he is driven to succeed. And succeed.\nWhen his daughter Lauren was a young girl in the 1980s, she would hold the receiver of a toy phone to her ear and pace back and forth, as she'd seen her father do constantly.\nToday, Axelrod carries a cell phone and a BlackBerry, and he's almost always on one of them. Or on a landline phone. Or tapping with two fingers on his laptop. Usually, it's some combination of all those.\nLauren's brother Michael recalls, \"To put me to sleep, he would pace while he was on the phone with me in his arms.\" Now 24 and an employee at his father's firm, Michael says, \"He literally wears phones out.\"\nOver the past six years, Axelrod's 11-person firm has worked for candidates in 42 primary and general-election campaigns, winning 33, or nearly 80 percent.\nUnlike a candidate who, once elected, gets a break from campaigning, Axelrod is never done. There's always another race to work on--actually, many more races to work on. It's a constant grind of travel and long hours. And phone calls.\nAnd a constant grind for his family--which also includes 20-year-old Ethan, who just finished his sophomore year at Colorado College. \"He was consumed by work,\" says Michael. \"I don't want this to sound"}

What's his background?\nStormzy was born in July 1993 and grew up in Croydon, South London.\nHe went to Harris Academy South Norwood and it was here, at the academy, where he started rapping at the age of 11.\nIn an interview with music magazine Clash, he referred to himself as a \"proper little s***\" during his school days and was \"excluded from school every week\".\nHe left school at 17 and joined an engineering firm, but spent a lot of his time trying to perfect his freestyles on Post-it notes.\nAt 25 years old he's won two MOBO Awards and was named as an artist to look out for in the BBC's influential Sound of 2015 list.\nHis first studio album, Gang Signs & Prayer, came out on February 24 and went straight to Number One in the UK album charts.\nWhy is he called 'Stormzy'?\nBorn Michael Omari, he chose the performing name of Stormzy simply because it \"sounded really cool\".\nSpeaking to Live Mag UK back in 2014, he revealed: \"I think God puts names in my head, like, \u2018Wicked Skengman\u2019.\n\"It just came to my head and I ran with it.\"\nHow did Stormzy become famous?\nStormzy first found fame through his YouTube videos, which he has been making since 2011.\nBut it was his Wicked Skengman freestyles on the channel which garnered wider appeal.\nThe Londoner had started as a road rap MC which was more stylistically hip-hop than grime.\nHe later became the first unsigned rapper to perform on Later with Jools Holland.\nStormzy made his acting debut in Noel Clarke's Brotherhood, the final film in the Kidulthood trilogy.\nBut days after the release of the film one of the actors and a childhood friend of the rapper, Aaron Eaton, died suddenly.\nHe paid tribute to him at the time, writing: \"This one has hit home I can't lie.

Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.\nSMS carrier messaging is used by billions of people every day and enables people to reach anyone around the world, regardless of their device, carrier, app or location. However, the features available in SMS haven\u2019t kept up with modern messaging apps. RCS is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features that people now expect from mobile messaging, such as group chats, high res photos and more.\nIn other words, RCS will help texting become more like instant messaging. That\u2019s already happening, but users need to have mobile data if they want more than simple SMS.\nJibe has raised $9.1 million to date. The most recent round, $8.3 million in December 2012, was meant to help the startup build rich communications (such as video chat), real-time games, and other innovations on mobile devices.\nUpdate at 10:20 a.m. PDT: Shortly after publishing, Jibe Mobile\u2019s homepage was updated with a letter from CEO Amir Sarhangi. Here it is in full.\nAs a good friend once told me, if you want to do something big, start with something small \u2014 a single, singular challenge you can lead, and rally others to support.\nFor Jibe \u2014 a company we founded in 2006 \u2014 that lesson came true today with the announcement that we\u2019ve been acquired by Google. The big opportunity we saw at the start: to change the way people communicate using their mobile phones.\nThe \u201csmall\u201d challenge we focused on: the future of messaging, the super simple mode for communication that\u2019s favored by billions of people, all over the world.\nAs the mobile world was opening up, we had a hunch that carriers had to become more competitive by becoming innovative. So we decided to start a company with the vision of bridging the newer world of Silicon Valley with the older world of telecommunications.\nTogether, with the entire industry, we are making our vision come true.\nAt first we focused on the fringes, thinking the most important problems had already been solved by the industry giants who had invested millions in IP communications. But we then realized that the world of mobile was moving quickly, and the industry had not been able to keep pace.\nThis journey was absolutely necessary for us to find our way, by bumping into a real problem which needed to be solved = messaging.\nIn 2010, we foresaw the future of messaging and invested heavily in Rich Communications Services (RCS), the new standard that was being positioned as the evolution of SMS. We then introduced the Jibe model to put carrier messaging in the cloud and flip the infrastructure business model upside down.\nOf course, convincing the first carrier to trust a small startup with their messaging \u2014 a core part of their business \u2014 was not easy. But once we did, we knew we were on to something and never looked back. At times we have been seen as mavericks as we try to balance the need to stay competitive by running ahead versus making sure we build industry consensus. But one could argue that this is exactly what the industry has needed. Our persistent position has gradually been vindicated, first by our customers \u2014 who in every way deserve credit for our success \u2014 and now by Google\u2019s belief in and commitment to us.

Penney, which does not carry the home designer's name.\nMacy's filed a lawsuit against Martha Stewart's company after it announced plans in December 2011 to open mini \"Martha Stewart\" stores within J.C.

The baby-faced crooner's star has gone supernova this year. Witness the monster success of his album \"Confessions,\" which sold 1 million copies in its first week in stores. The release is the biggest-ever debut for a male R&B act.\nThe album remains a force to be reckoned with on the music charts. When the artist re-released an expanded version of \"Confessions\" that featured a DVD, new tracks and artwork, it claimed the No. 2 spot on Billboard's album charts. To date it has sold 6 million copies.\nNot one to rest on those laurels, Usher appears to be positioning himself to be a music mogul. In addition to starting his own label, he has issued an Usher debit card that features his face.\nAll of this work is paying off with new fans. It used to be the typical Usher fan was a hot and bothered, frenzied teenage girl. Plenty of them are found during the meet and greet session during the Atlanta stop of his \"Truth\" tour. They are in diverse company nowadays.\n\"I had a few truckers,\" he muses in a five-minute breather before preparing for the show. \"I was really shocked to know they were fans of mine. David Copperfield's mother is a really good fan of mine. I didn't know. He told me.\"\nMothers and fathers of teenage girls, single thirtysomething men and couples appear to be admirers, too.

Atlanta is where he launched his career at LaFace records. He also still has a residence here.\nUsher bills himself as Mr. Entertainment. In concert, he lives up to the moniker. From the moment he is lifted onto his make-believe stage through an eruption of flames, he doesn't slow down or disappoint. There is a band, a DJ, eight dancers, and multiple costume changes and video screens. But it's Usher who captivates, pouring through his greatest hits of the past and present with the stamina of an Energizer Bunny. Even during a music break for his song \"You Remind Me\" he is doing handstands and popping and locking.\nSome of his costumes are reminiscent of vintage Michael Jackson, the signature fedora and the jacket that resembles the one from Jackson's \"Thriller\" video.

Mail.ru says it touches 94% of the country\u2019s Internet-using population across properties like Mail.ru; VK.com, the Facebook-like social network popular in Russia; and ICQ.\nIt was a relatively short stay in Russia for Foodpanda.

The company is positioning it as a win: \u201ca great return\u201d in its words.\nBut it comes as one of its parent companies, the now-publicly traded Rocket Internet, which owns 49% of Foodpanda, continues to try to whittle down its many-tentacled, loss-making business of incubating and growing dozens of e-commerce startups around the world, which has proven to be a challenge. Foodpanda now will be active in 20 markets.\nOther Foodpanda sales this year have included selling holdings in Spain, Italy, Brazil and Mexico to Just-Eat for $140 million, and selling off operations in Southeast Asia including Indonesia.\nIt\u2019s also been part of a bigger consolidation play that Rocket Internet calls (in its charismatic way) the Global Online Takeaway Group, which has seen the company make an investment in Delivery Hero as well as swap assets with this one-time rival.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the Russian business was profitable in itself but more generally, it\u2019s a sign both of the difficulties of scaling profitably in the market for online takeaway and delivery services, and of the challenges these days of raising external cash to bridge the gap.\nIndeed, this is a way for Foodpanda to finance itself. \u201cThe cash proceeds will be re-invested to continue the expansion in Foodpanda\u2019s core regions in Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe,\u201d the company writes.\nAnd the core is definitely something that Foodpanda needs to focus on now, because even if Foodpanda now plays nice with Delivery Hero, there are a number of new competitive threats on the horizon, including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and now Amazon Restaurants.\nUber Eats is a big new priority for the formidable Uber transportation business, and this summer it hired a new exec in Asia to build the business out there.\nFoodpanda has disclosed in total some $318 million of external funding. \u201cDisclosed\u201d because it may be more, since there has been a lack of transparency about much of the funding for Rocket-incubated startups. This is all that has been disclosed publicly.\nFor Mail.Ru, it\u2019s another sign of how the company is trying to diversify its business and add more services on top of its existing business, which includes Russia\u2019s most popular email client (mail.ru) as well as social network VK.com, known as \u201cthe Facebook of Russia,\u201d and messaging platform ICQ.\nIn addition to other services like games, Mail.R"}

Then he passed Lake Francis on his way to the Goat Haunt Ranger Station near the head of Waterton Lake. There he turned north and ran along the shore until he reached the town of Waterton.\nWhen he arrived, still panting from his 35-mile jog through the wilderness, he probably straightened his shirt, brushed his hair and walked into a dance hall. And after he danced the night away and swung a few partners around, Cosley headed south and ran all the way back to Polebridge, just in time for work the following morning.\nThe account of Cosley running 70 miles round trip to shake a leg, recorded in the book \u201cBelly River\u2019s Famous Joe Cosley\u201d by Brian McClung, is just one of many amazing tales about one of Glacier\u2019s first rangers.\nCosley was born in Ontario in 1870 and was raised by a French fisherman and an Algonquin Indian. While in his later years Cosley would spin tales about his high-class eastern education and beautiful mansion near the Hudson River, it\u2019s likely he was educated in a convent near Lake Huron. In the late 1800s, Cosley moved to Montana and made a living trapping animals and selling furs. As a trapper Cosley learned the ins and outs of the land that would eventually become America\u2019s 10th national park.\nCosley would hike and snowshoe for miles to find his catch, which he would often shoot, skin and eat on the spot. Members of the Blackfeet Nation called Cosley the \u201cpanther on snowshoes,\u201d according to local historian Dave Renfrow. Cosley also left his mark on the park by carving his name into hundreds of trees over the years.\nIn 1910, when Maj. William R. Logan arrived to become Glacier National Park\u2019s first superintendent, he hired Cosley and a rough-and-tumble group of locals to serve as the first rangers. While hiring a known poacher to protect the resources of a national park may seem unusual, in the words of Logan, \u201cIt takes a poacher to find a poacher.\u201d Cosley was assigned to the Belly River Ranger Station, deep in the northeast corner of the park.\nA year after he was hired, Cosley was fired for poaching near Lake McDonald. He apparently disregarded his pink slip and kept working in the park, and somehow the park continued to pay him.\nAccording to author Jerry DeSanto, in 1913 Cosley spent $1,500 (about $36,000 today) to buy a diamond ring and proposed to a Canadian girl. According to historians, the woman\u2019s family was not impressed with Cosley\u2019s poaching career and the ring was returned. Some say Cosley was so distraught that he buried the ring in a tree and it\u2019s still somewhere in the park today. Others say Cosley dug it out a few years later to buy more gear.\nBy 1914, the park finally fired Cosley for good and, with nothing else to do, he joined the Canadian army and went to Europe to fight in World War I. According to legend, or at least stories Cosley would later tell, he was a sure shot and killed more than 6"}

Greg sees it as a calling from God.\nGreg Rake, assistant principal at Craig Middle School, has a heart for children, even though he has none of his own. Instead, he spends his working hours with them buzzing all around him.\nRake spent several years at the Abilene ISD's Jefferson Center. At the middle school level, which he's taken on for the first time this year, the students can be trying as they go through what he sees as one of the most difficult times in their lives. But he's a service-oriented guy looking to help the youngsters.\n\"It can be frustrating day to day, minute to minute, working with children,\" he said. \"But I can\u2019t imagine having a career not working with people. And the joy, the opportunities I have, the greatest pleasure I get is if I can help one child. I'm just so blessed.\"\nRake, 43, isn't just school-oriented, though. While he does handle many of the discipline issues of the entire sixth grade and some of the seventh grade at Craig, he also works with other Abilene youth who have different needs.\nHe's coming off a stint as president of the Big Brothers Big Sisters board of directors and, through a side business he runs, assists families setting up visitations with children in various legal situations.\nThese visitations can be set up through the courts, with Judge Paul Rotenberry overseeing the affair, but their presence in the Child Protective Services system isn't required. Visitations through the foster system can also be arranged, he said.\nSome travel from as far away as Houston to be able to see their children should, say, another parent with the child live in Abilene, he said.\nHe counts this work as just another part of his calling to work with children. He sees some of the worst and some of the best in his dealings, which opens him up to wanting to help when and where he can.\nIt's especially prevalent with the adults, though.\n\"The parents love their kids the best they can, but sometimes they just don\u2019t know how to parent them,\" he said. \"We try to take each case individually and ... work for the best interest of the child in everything we do. This has been one of the most rewarding things I've been able to do in my career.\n\"You see a lot of families coming together and kids doing better (once they) have that stability.\"\nAway from children, Rake has been involved at Cavalry Baptist Church. There, he's been serving as interim pastor for the congregation.\nHe said he originally saw himself as a full-time minister. But as he began working with children, education became a primary drive in his life.\nIt's all part of why Joel Rake thought his older brother fit the description of Everyday Hero.\n\"Abilene is blessed to have such an honorable man doing so many important roles in our community,\" Joel wrote in his nomination. \"I hope you will take Greg in consideration for your paper as an Everyday Hero.

{"idx": "12321", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: If the labor department rejects the independent marketing organizations' applications, it will be more proof that it is just being capricious.\nIndependent marketing organizations aren\u2019t letting the Department of Labor kick them out of the retirement fund market \u2013 well, six of them, at least.\nThey are applying to become financial institutions in the eyes of the DOL so that they can oversee sales affecting retirement money. When the DOL published its final version of its conflict of interest rule in April, not only were fixed indexed annuities moved into the best interest contract exemption (BICE) but IMOs also were not on the list of organizations that can be considered a financial institution.\nThat latter part is important because exemption allows agents and advisors to collect third-party payments, such as commission, when selling variable or fixed indexed annuities. But a financial institution would be required to sign the BICE with a client. Insurance companies would be considered financial institutions, but execs have already said they did not want their company to sign such onto that liability with an independent agent that they can\u2019t control or monitor very well.\nSo, some IMOs are stepping into the void by applying for the status. It is far from easy \u2013 the app itself is 20 pages. Nor is it a quick process. One of the applicants told us that they hope to hear about it by the end of the year. Considering that the deadline to implement the rule is in April, that does not give anyone the opportunity to construct a system to work with agents as the financial institution or structure the business without the status.\nThen, on top of that, I heard from a few people that they didn\u2019t think the DOL would ever allow IMOs in that role. That might be a bit of cynicism but would make sense, considering the DOL\u2019s war on commissioned sales. Those staffers don\u2019t want them, it\u2019s clear. That is why the regulation is called the conflict of interest rule.\nIf the DOL rejects the applications, the department will be showing that they don\u2019t trust consumers to make their own decisions. The IMOs were required to show how they would live up to the rule. A rejection would be tantamount to calling IMOs untrustworthy. That doesn\u2019t speak well about how they would handle other aspects of the rule.\nAfter all, this is the department that removed fixed indexed annuities from the PTE 84-24 and threw them into the BICE in the final rule without warning. So, after years of rule-making and many months of commenting, the DOL changed the rule substantially without assessing the impact or allowing comment.\nThat seems careless or arrogant. Insurance industry representatives meeting with DOL staffers had reported that the staffers said they made a mistake in not realizing the FIAs were the same thing as variable annuities (VAs) and should be treated the same. They knew about the court and congressional decisions in 2010 to treat FIAs as insurance rather than securities, such as VAs.\nIf the DOL is successful in destroying the independent agent channel and consumers of the future are not retiring with a secure nest egg, where do we go to get that industry back? Is there a judge who can grant that?"}

Blake Farenthold's Texas District 27 seat will get maybe six extra voting days.\nGov. Greg Abbott has just wasted millions in hard campaign dollars that could be spent on other tough races across the country in November.\nThe governor has called for an Emergency Special Election to fill the seat of Rep. Blake Farenthold, who resigned in early April. Texas already had its primary March 6. In that race, neither of the top two Republicans in this R+13 District reached 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff May 22. The winner of this runoff, assuming the defeat of the Democratic challenger in such a heavily Republican district, would have been elected and seated in Congress immediately after the Nov. 6 election \u2014 likely the evening of Tuesday, Nov. 13, when Congress is slated to come back into session after the election.\nAbbott felt compelled to spend the hundreds of thousands of state money it takes to host this election. Millions more will have to be raised and spent by Republicans and Democrats in the Emergency Special Election. Neither party had planned on spending this money. He stated that it was important for the \u201cDistrict to be represented\u201d \u2014 but at what price? Let\u2019s look at the timeline and what this means for the representation of the 27th District since it is clear that the governor did not.\nSince the governor called the Emergency Special Election, the Nov. 6 election is no longer technically a special election. It is simply a general election. Whomever wins the seat in November will not be seated until the new Congress is sworn-in in January 2019 unless that person is the winner of the Emergency Special Election.\nFriday, Sept. 28 \u2013 the Emergency Special Election runoff \u2013 if no candidate reached 50 percent June 30.\nIf the Emergency Special Election goes to a runoff (and there is a very good chance that there will be a runoff given the number of candidates), the special will allow the winner to be in office a total of 18 full legislative days (excluding fly-in days which usually have very little meaningful legislative business). Looking at the House calendar for later this year, that is six days in October, six in November, and six in December.\nIf the governor had let the special election occur along with the general election as it was originally planned, he would have only lost the six legislative days in October. That is a lot of trouble, confusion and money for only six legislative days.\nTexas is well represented by the 26 Republican members and many Texas Democrats of the House and Senate that have been pulling very hard for hurricane relief dollars from the federal government. All this election turmoil was simply unnecessary for potentially and realistically six legislative days of representation of the district by what would be the newest and least experienced member of Congress.\nSeveral district judges begged the governor to not hold this election citing the lack of resources to host it. What a waste of money that could be going to disaster relief and much more needed campaigns in Texas and across the nation.\nGlenn B.

It's not just visiting a school.

Yet it could also help programs demonstrate their level of interest in an athlete, while also allowing players to gather more information about programs earlier in the process.\n\"It's an opportunity for guys, especially when they don't have the time or resources to do all these visits, to see more places and get more of a feel for the coaching staff and the places recruiting them,\" said Butler (Pennsylvania) Area guard Ethan Morton, the only 2020 target Purdue so far to make an an official visit.\n\"When this rule changed we were like, 'Well, we might as well try and use as many as we can if universities want us to because the spring is tough with the live period and evaluation period and (the rule) turns over at the end of your junior year.

But this time, perhaps, the poll seems unlikely to descend into a piety contest.\nAs in 2014, incumbent Joko Widodo is running against retired General Prabowo Subianto, whose military background (his father-in-law was Suharto) and ties with hardline Islamist groups make him a popular choice in some parts of the country - especially in the west of Java, which alone contains around 17 percent of the country's voters.\nDespite Subianto's claims to \"Make Indonesia Great Again\" Widodo looks set to hold power bolstered by a clever choice in running mate: 76-year old muslim cleric Ma'ruf Amin, who is the man behind a fatwa against Christian Jakarta mayor \"Ahok\" (who eventually had to step away from his campaign for re-election, and was later jailed for insulting the Quran).\nWidodo - known universally as \"Jokowi\" - still faces major opposition among conservative Islamists, who see him as too liberal, too friendly to the west, and too chummy those who would exploit Indonesia and its people for financial gain.\nHe's the first Indonesian leader to come from outside the country's political and military elites, and has faced accusations he's a communist, and a traitor who has allowed \"millions"}

Chittister\u2019s father, Daniel Daugherty, died when she was a toddler. Joan\u2019s widowed mother, Loretta, soon married Harold \u201cDutch\u201d Chittister, an alcoholic with a fierce temper who subjected her to physical abuse and consigned Joan to a childhood full of fear. It was only in 2011, at age seventy-five, that Joan was ready to tell this part of her life story. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she told Roberts.\nJoan\u2019s memories of her adoptive father show how complicated love and family life can be. Despite the trauma he inflicted, she was grateful to Dutch for providing materially for her and her mother, and remained so attached to him that she decided, as an adult, to keep his surname. And while Dutch, a non-Catholic, had refused to pay for her Catholic schooling and had initially been opposed to her entering the convent, he came to love the Benedictines. When Chittister contemplated leaving the community in the tumultuous early days of post\u2013Vatican II renewal, it was Dutch who spoke to her about the bonds of love and loyalty.\nJoan\u2019s relationship with her mother was far more loving but equally complex. She remembers Loretta as a wisdom figure who did the best she could to protect her daughter and to remove obstacles in her way. When Joan first applied to enter the Benedictines, the prioress refused her permission; as an only child, she explained, Joan would need to care for her mother in her old age. It was only through Loretta\u2019s insistence that the prioress relented. That prioress, it turned out, had proved oddly prescient. Loretta did indeed need to rely on her only child in her old age. Diagnosed with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease, she moved into the Benedictine motherhouse where she was cared for by the entire community until her death four years later, a development made possible only by the Benedictines\u2019 shift from an almost exclusive focus on education to a broader corporate commitment to social justice.\nThrough her leadership in the community and beyond, Chittister spearheaded that transition and the others that reshaped women\u2019s religious life after the council. In 1971, she was elected president of the Federation of St. Scholastica, one of four Benedictine Federations in the United States. She would later be elected president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, prioress of the Erie Benedictines, and president of the Conference of Benedictine Prioresses. All the while she maintained a grueling speaking schedule and devoted significant time to her writing, emerging as a national and international authority on religious life and a prophetic and fearless advocate for women, a commitment she ascribes to her mother.\nLoretta\u2019s influence endures. Though her mother had died several years before, Joan sensed her presence at a pivotal moment in 2001, when she was informed that the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life had demanded that the Benedictines forbid her from speaking at a conference on women\u2019s ordination in Dublin, Ireland. She heard her mother tell her, \u201cYou go ahead and you\u2019ll be all right.

The city received millions in federal grant money to help pay for the overhaul, but that money only applied to electrical operations.\nHe projected a $11.5-million deficit for the current fiscal year.\nThe idea behind the tiered charges is that those who use more water are driving up Glendale\u2019s need to buy water from Metropolitan, which is more expensive than local groundwater.

Bates said that disability is a broad term that can encompass many conditions, both obvious and invisible. While mobility, sensory and other common disabilities may be visible to the eye, others are less apparent, she said.\nFor the luncheon, Bates said she plans to have speakers from different area businesses discuss their ability to work despite being considered disabled.

For nearly 20 years, she has used an electric wheelchair for mobility. In 2000, Bates was diagnosed with advanced peripheral neuropathy, which caused intense numbness in her legs and feet and led to issues with balance and stability.\nBates said she could walk with the assistance of a walker, but only for short distances. The transition to using a wheelchair as her primary source of mobility was sped up by a car wreck that required her to use a wheelchair for six months. Following that transition, Bates said she knew she could continue her work with Workforce Solutions, a job she has had for nearly 40 years. The only issue at the time was a lack of adequate transportation.\nBates was able to convert a van to meet her needs.

Farley wore a plum-colored eyeshadow and heavy sweeps of mascara to make her pretty eyes pop. A dusty-rose gloss covered her plump pout.\nFarley has been busy these days.

Perkins Career and Technical Education program\u2014would get a major makeover under a proposal unveiled by the U.S. Department of Education last week.\nThe proposal outlines the administration's vision for reauthorizing the Perkins law, which was funded at $1.14 billion in fiscal 2012. The Obama administration is seeking to ensure the program, last reauthorized in 2006, does a better job of preparing students to join the labor market. The administration also wants to boost collaboration among high school programs, postsecondary institutions, and business partners.\n\"This is not a time to tinker or just look for change around the margin,\" U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told reporters during a conference call April 19. The program, \"must be transformed if it is to live up to its potential.\"\nOne piece of the proposal\u2014which would radically revamp the way the grants are allocated within states\u2014already is setting off alarm bells with advocates for career and technical education, as well as key members of Congress.\nRight now, funding for the Career and Technical Education program is distributed within states by a formula. But, under the administration's proposal, states would set up a competition to distribute the funds. That change might leave some career and technical students out in the cold, said Alisha Hyslop, the assistant director of public policy at the Association for Career and Technical Education in Alexandria, Va.\n\"In a competitive grant situation, there's no way you don't create winners and losers,\" Ms. Hyslop said. \"Our goal is to make sure all students have access to high-quality [career and technical] programs. \u2026 Somebody is going to get left out.\"\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is concerned that the change could create \"haves and have-nots\" that may worsen achievement gaps in struggling districts, said Eli Zupnick, her spokesman. But overall, Sen. Murray strongly supports the administration's proposal, he said.\nSen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee, also is a fan of the proposal.\n\"I want to commend Secretary Duncan for bringing attention to the need for more alignment, collaboration, accountability, and innovation, as well as the need for equity,\" he said in a statement.\nThe proposal also seeks to boost collaboration among districts and postsecondary institutions by making them share grants.\nRight now, districts and postsecondary institutions get separate funding. The administration instead would fund consortia of districts, postsecondary institutions, and their partners. Partners could include employers, labor organizations, and industry associations, among others.\nJessica Cardichon, the director of federal advocacy at the Alliance for Excellent Education, a nonprofit organization in Washington that promotes high school transformation, applauded that move. \"This could be something that has a positive effect in terms of collaboration, alignment, performance, and accountability across institutions,\" she said.\nBut Ms. Hyslop worried that if just one member of a consortium holds the purse strings, the funds may not make it to the other partners. \"We're not sure the consortia structure is going to be the most effective way\" to ensure partnerships, she said.\nThe proposal also would require a 25 percent private-sector match for grants, which could be filled through actual dollars, or in-kind donations, such as equipment, or training facilities.\nThe idea is to make \"business and industry really feel like they have some skin in"}

{"idx": "12379", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Professor Sally Baldwin, who has died in an accident in Rome at the age of 62, was one of the first academics to articulate the links between social security policy and community care. In a career at York University that spanned more than 30 years, her work contributed to the introduction of the enhanced rates for disabled children in our current benefits and tax credits. An emphasis on the needs, views and preferences of beneficiaries and recipients of service provision was arguably the defining interest and concern of her research.\nBorn in Coatbridge, north Lanarkshire, Sally was the eldest daughter in a large, close family, and she carried much of the responsibility after her parents' illnesses and early deaths. She gained a first-class degree in English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow and came to York to study social administration, after working in the library at Edinburgh University. She took the diploma with distinction in 1973 and was almost immediately appointed as the first research fellow in a group created to evaluate the work of the Family Fund, later the Social Policy Research Unit (SPRU).\nShe became director of SPRU in 1987 and was made professor in 1990. Under her leadership SPRU doubled in size and established its reputation as a national centre for research on social security, disablement and policies for carers. Her own research encompassed all these fields. Her doctorate, which she received in 1982, was a pioneering study of the financial costs to parents of a severely disabled child, published as The Cost Of Caring: Families With Disabled Children (1985). An influence on current policy, it is a remarkable example of the impact of research evidence.\nWhile she was director, SPRU was engaged in a programme of research on the outcomes of social care, especially in relation to older people, disabled adults and their carers. This innovative work identified the outcomes that individuals hoped to gain from care services, as well as the outcomes that professionals considered important.\nLong before it was fashionable to talk about \"joined-up\" policy and practice, she argued that it was important to recognise that people's lives do not divide into neat segments of professional and organisational boundaries. She also undertook research on informal carers of people with mental health problems, and on deafness, and ran a continual critical eye over community care policy.\nIn 1994, she became head of the University of York's department of social policy and social work and director of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences in 1998. After retiring as director of SPRU in 2002, she began to develop a new and innovative stream of research, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which sought to apply \"evidence-based\" methods, including systematic review, to social policy and social care.\nWithin the university she was a keen supporter of the Centre for Women's Studies, and of women's rights generally, and she taught the first course on women and money. She was heavily involved in planning for the Alcuin Research and Resource Centre, which will eventually incorporate one of the largest groups of applied social scientists in the UK.\nOutside the university she was a founding member of the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences, a trustee of the Family Fund, a member of the executive of the Disability Alliance and chairwoman of the Association of Directors of Research Centres in the Social Sciences. She acted as adviser to many research funders, most recently working with the NHS research and development programme on service delivery and organisations as it developed its own links between evidence and policy.\nLocally, she had"}

Pantelakos that the governor should direct the attorney general and the state police to become involved in this investigation. It is my opinion that Lt. Rodney McQuate should never have offered any possible scenarios in the press as plausible explanations for the tombstone that appeared on port property on Aug. 17. It seems he did so after it had been previously stated that port personnel would handle the investigation and later he stated publicly that the detective division of the Portsmouth Police Department would be handling the investigation.\nIs it possible that his earlier explanations concerning the event might compromise any future investigations into the matter?\nIn the past, defenders of port management have categorized previous allegations, including the current \"WHISTLE BLOWERS COMPLAINT\" as \"sour grapes\" and that they were brought forward for \"ulterior motives.\" I wonder how they feel about port management philosophies and abilities now that the safety of a man's wife and children have been jeopardized by shots fired into the sanctity of their home while they slept.\nAsk yourselves this: If all allegations brought forth previously were lies then why haven't any charges of defamation or slander ever been brought forth against any critics of the port?\nI ask you how anyone could assume that any member of the port staff could possibly conduct an unbiased investigation regarding Mr. Roach when they themselves have witnessed him being forced to work in the Port office surrounded by \"NO RATS ALLOWED\" stickers on the computers or had knowledge of the fact that a dead rat in a rat trap had been placed in his driveway and had been observed by his wife and daughter earlier this year? So much for diversity training.\nIn my opinion, the most appalling aspect of this whole situation is that there are two police officers, the chief and deputy chief harbormasters, that one could only assume because of their lack of action, apparently condoned this behavior and were also in charge of the \"in-house investigation\" regarding the tombstone.\nI wonder if perhaps all Mr. Roach's co-workers should be questioned in regards to any comments they might have heard concerning his well being prior to these two despicable and cowardly acts (tombstone and shooting)?\nI truly hope that the recent shooting incident involving Mr. Roach and his family strikes at the heart of everyone's moral standards as I feel it should. Regardless of anyone's opinions concerning the port, I hope everyone feels as I do, that these recent acts severely cross the line, particularly when they involve innocent family members.\nIt is also my opinion that the ability of current port management has to come into question due to the fact that Mr. Roach specifically brought his concerns for his own and his family's safety to the attention of the port's law enforcement officers and the PDA before the shooting incident occurred.\nIt is my deepest hope that anyone with any information concerning the shooting incident will contact the Rye Police Department.\nThe writer is a resident of Newmarket."}

Reasons for burning trash have changed over time, and so have the hazards. In the past, burning may have been the only option for many, but now there are safer alternatives available.\nAbandoned piles of garbage and other refuse, known as open dumps, pose a risk to public health and safety and the environment. This web page provides information about reporting illegal dumping and protecting your property against illegal dumping.\nThe mission of the Illinois EPA\u2019s Used Tire Program is to ensure the proper management of used tires in Illinois to protect human health and the environment and to promote legitimate markets for used tires. Those markets include: 1) tire-derived fuel; 2) civil engineering applications using tire-derived aggregate; and 3) ground (\u201ccrumb\u201d) rubber for use in molded rubber products, recreational applications, and rubber-modified asphalt. If managed improperly, used tires pose a threat to human health and the environment by 1) providing a breeding habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes and 2) presenting a fire threat that can contaminate air, land and water and adversely affect human health through various means of exposure to the contaminants resulting from a fire. To this end, the Illinois EPA regulates the used tire industry and conducts or forces used and waste tire removal actions at sites that are determined to pose a threat to human health and the environment.\nThe Illinois Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agrichemical Container Recycling Program offers permanent and single-day container collection sites. The container recycling schedule, listing of permanent collection sites and information about preparing pesticide containers for recycling is available at the Illinois Department of Agriculture\u2019s web site.\nThe Illinois Department of Agriculture enforces regulations concerning animal welfare. Animal welfare officials also respond to complaints concerning a variety of animal issues, including the improper disposal of dead animals. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s web site contains additional information about the Dead Animal Disposal Act.\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health produces a number of fact sheets about private sewage systems. U.S. EPA's Homeowner\u2019s Guide to Septic Systems provides information about septic system maintenance.\nState laws and environmental regulations governing Composting in Illinois apply based on the waste type, the source of the waste and the location of the compost facility. Different regulations and State laws apply to organic waste composting, landscape waste composting, livestock waste and livestock mortality composting and sewage sludge composting in Illinois.\nGenerally, if off-site generated organic wastes will be received for composting, a permit from Illinois EPA is required. An exception from permit is made for landscape waste composted and used on an agricultural crop farm that can meet certain setback, operating and location restrictions. Livestock waste generated on the farm may be composted and the finished compost applied to farmland under normal agricultural practices without a permit from the Illinois EPA.

Two days later, President Obama called the new reform-minded Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\"It was viewed as, 'We're not going to war,'\" said Hooman Majd, an Iranian-American commentator and author. \"People who hand over griffins and talk on the phone are not going to war any time soon.\"\nPublicly, the U.S. framed the repatriation as a gift and a sign of \"respect\" for the Iranian people, and upon his return to Tehran from New York, Rouhani noted that it had been given with \"due ceremony.\"\nNot mentioned was the fact that the authenticity of the item is a matter of some controversy.\nOfficials in both hemispheres describe the griffin as a relic that dates back to the 7th century BC and which was plundered from northwestern Iran by treasure hunters in the early 1990s.\nIt was brought to the U.S. in February 2000 by a prominent Geneva-based antiquities dealer named Hicham Aboutaam, who arranged to sell it to a New York collector for just under $1 million.\nThe deal came to the attention of federal investigators, who busted Aboutaam and seized the griffin. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to falsely telling a Customs officer that the piece was from Syria.\nWhile some experts have authenticated it as an ancient and priceless piece of art, others doubt that it's 2,700 years old.\nRetired Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Oscar White Muscarella agrees the griffin is from Iran, but in a paper published a year before the handover, he declared that technical and stylistic characteristics were a giveaway that it's a modern fake.\n\"It was made in a forgery shop,\" Muscarella wrote.\nBut as Majd points out, the value of the griffin to international relations had almost nothing to do with whether it was real or not.\n\"The gesture was much more important than the griffin itself,\" he said.\nA Los Angeles Times article detailed the behind-the-scenes work that brought the griffin home, starting with a meeting of the Obama administration's Middle East experts to come up with a way to symbolically extend a hand to Rouhani.\nOne of them brought up the chalice, and when Rouhani announced plans to speak at the General Assembly, a plan was hatched to gift it to Iran.\nAn unnamed, mid-level diplomat at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations sent a courier to pick up the vessel, bought a plain white bag for it and then"}

He\u2019s just started a part-time job with tea company Chaigaram, which provides employment to refugees and aims to help them better integrate into the UK.\nYousefi is one of an estimated 118,995 refugees living in the UK, many of whom face extreme difficulties in finding a job, never mind returning to their previous professions. But businesses and social enterprises like Chaigaram are trying to change this. Pranav Chopra, Chaigaram\u2019s founder, says: \u201cBy employing refugees to run tea stalls across London\u2019s food markets it allows them to boost their English, regain confidence and work on skills required to enter the UK job market.\u201d At the moment, Chaigaram\u2019s sales don\u2019t cover costs \u2013 Chopra funds it \u2013 but he expects them to soon.\nSome entrepreneurs have personal experience of the struggle to find work as a refugee. Mursal Hedayat, for example, witnessed the plight of her mother, a civil engineer who not only had to abandon her possessions and social connections when she fled Afghanistan for the UK in 1994, but also the professional identity she\u2019d worked hard to build. \u201cSettled in one of the world\u2019s most developed economies, she encountered numerous barriers to using her ample skill and experience for the benefit of herself or society,\u201d says Hedayat. These included no recognition for her overseas qualifications and lack of UK-based experience.\nInstead, Hedayat says, her mother spent years either unemployed or underemployed. Spurred on by her mother\u2019s experience, last year Hedayat set up Chatterbox, a language tutoring service that employs refugees whose language skills are often in high demand. So far it has trained more than 40 refugee tutors and provided them with more than 500 hours of employment while paying the Living Wage Foundation hourly rate.\nAnother organisation offering refugees a step into a longer term career is the social enterprise Bread & Roses. Set up by friends Sneh Jani and Olivia Head in May last year, it trains refugee women in floristry, and provides them with the opportunity to learn English, develop skills and build their confidence \u2013 with the overall ambition of helping them find employment. The women start by arranging jam jars of flowers and move up to creating carefully cultivated bouquets and posies, which range from \u00a330 to \u00a370 and are sold to individuals and organisations. They receive expenses to participate in the programme. The money that is made on the flowers sold funds their training.\nBread & Roses trained seven women in its last programme, and will start the next programme in October. Jani says the duo have learned from their first year and will make changes such as extending the training from six weeks to 11 weeks, and being stricter about who can join. \u201cSome couldn\u2019t work as it would affect their benefits, two were on employment support and couldn\u2019t work part-time, but they can all get a lot from it.\u201d Ideally, she and Head want those on the course to be able to use the UK-based experience, and the skills they\u2019ve learned, to take on paid employment, whether through Bread & Roses, or elsewhere.\nGaining employment is an integral factor in the successful resettlement and integration of refugees."}

While the overall jobs picture is unchanged\u2015the unemployment rate remains a steady 4.1 percent one slice of the workforce put up its healthiest numbers in four decades. At 6.8 percent, the latest unemployment rate for black Americans fell to its lowest recorded level since the 1970\u2019s. On top of that, the stubbornly high gap between black and white unemployment also fell to its lowest level on record, clocking in at 3.1 percent.\nI spoke with Bernstein about the latest unemployment numbers, the somewhat friendlier economic landscape for black workers, and Trump\u2019s unconvincing attempt to take credit for the whole thing.\nMother Jones: The jobs report usually rolls by with little fanfare. What was significant about the December report?\nJared Bernstein: You never want to read too much into any monthly report, because these data can be pretty noisy. But the African-American unemployment rate fell to its lowest level on record, 6.8 percent in December. Those data begin in the early 1970s, so that was kind of a big deal. Also the gap between the black and the white rate\u20143.1 percentage points\u2014was the smallest gap on record. There are a number of points to consider: first of all, the overall unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. So right out of the gate you know that the black unemployment rate is still quite highly elevated even with this positive development. I don\u2019t want to pop the champagne when you\u2019ve got a significant group of people who are still facing almost 7 percent unemployment, but the trend is moving in the right direction and the persistent strength of the job market is reaching folks who have been typically left behind. White people with advanced degrees typically do well no matter what\u2019s going on in the macroeconomy. But African-Americans, Hispanics, immigrants, non-college educated workers depend on a very tight job market, and not just tight for a month or two, but persistently tight to begin to reap some of the benefits of the growing macroeconomy.\nMJ: Black unemployment is consistently double that of white unemployment. What\u2019s some of the economic and political backdrop for that gap?\nCertainly, one important piece of it is discrimination. Minorities have been discriminated against in labor markets, but when things really tighten up, employers often find that can\u2019t afford to discriminate against minority workers. They either have to hire someone who they might otherwise discriminate against or leave profitability on the table. That\u2019s one of the ways in which full employment makes discriminating against minority workers an unaffordable luxury for discriminatory employers. There is a reason why Dr. [Martin Luther] King was advocating strongly for full employment toward the end of his life: He recognized that if labor markets are slack, employers can afford to discriminate against minorities in a way that they can\u2019t when labor markets are tight.\nMJ: What about on the wage front? Do these job gains reflect a meaningful rise in the standard of living for black workers and workers more broadly?\nJB: We have not seen the job gains map onto wage and income gains as much as I\u2019d like. However, there\u2019s something happening there. Black wages and incomes are rising in real terms. And I think if things continue to proceed apace they\u2019ll do a bit better. If we look at the overall wage data, the low unemployment rate is helping to generate some wage pressures, but not as much as I would\u2019ve thought. And so there"}

So 1000memories created a service for digital memorials, where all of these friends and family members can upload their photos and share their favorite memories in a single place.\nNow, over a year later, 1000memories is changing things up a bit. Don\u2019t worry, those digital memorials are still a core feature of the site, and all of the memorials that have been created aren\u2019t going anywhere. But the service is adjusting to better cater to the way its users are actually using it. In short, they\u2019re making it a place to share all kinds of digital memories, not just those that concern the recent passing of a loved one.\n1000memories cofounder Rudy Adler explains that as people go to create their digital memorials, they often pull out their old shoeboxes full of photos and stumble across pictures of many family members and old friends \u2014 not just the one who recently passed away. They\u2019d start uploading all of those to the site as well, but so far 1000memories hasn\u2019t offered a great way to do this.\nToday that\u2019s changing: 1000memories is launching a handful of new features that make it better suited to share any sort of antique content with friends and family. Another way to put it: the service is now a social network for sharing memories.\nThe first feature that will help do this is a section called \u2018Shoebox\u2019, which is a feed of everything you\u2019ve uploaded to the site, and what your family and friends have shared as well. To help with this, users will also be able to create memory pages (sort of like profile pages) for anyone, which you can link a piece of content to. And, finally, you\u2019ll be able to set up a family tree that shows how each of these memory pages are linked.\nTo facilitate the process, in the next few weeks the service will also be releasing an iPhone app: take a snapshot of an old photo or letter using your phone\u2019s camera, and it\u2019ll get uploaded directly to the service. This caused me to raise my eyebrows (I\u2019d think people would want to scan these old photographs to make sure they\u2019re saved at maximum quality), but Adler says that the results are surprisingly good. He adds that the service was inspired to do this, because, again, it\u2019s what its users are already doing.\nIn a sense, 1000memories is setting out to become a Facebook for the past. In fact, Adler says that Facebook\u2019s recent launch of the Timeline will actually make things easier for them (it\u2019ll make 1000memories easier to explain)."}

The problem is that the difference between the recommended dose and a toxic dose of Tylenol is a little as two to three pills.\nTylenol recommends a maximum daily dose of 3,000mg, or six pills a day, spaced four hours apart. According to The National Library of Medicine, taking 4,000mg (that\u2019s eight pills per day) for three to seven days is enough to begin damaging your liver. The good news is that if you stop taking the drug within this time period, your body will most likely bounce back.\nKnow Your Dose\u2014a coalition of healthcare providers and consumer advocacy groups\u2014says that taking more than 4,000mg in a day is considered an overdose and can damage your liver. That\u2019s just three daily pills more than the recommended dose. Below is an infographic laying out some important acetaminophen safety facts. You can click the graphic below to view it larger.\nThe best way to protect yourself from acetaminophen overdose is to take as little as possible. If you have a headache, take one Tylenol instead of two, and see if that helps. Better yet, take a different pain reliever that has a better safety record, or try some natural pain relieving methods before popping a pill at all.\nIt\u2019s also important to know what other medications you\u2019re taking contain the drug.

It is possible that the bomb was accidentally set off by the cell phones of the people manning the checkpoint. There are many possibilities but we do not want to speculate,\u201d he said.\nLt. Col. Gerry Besana, the public affairs officer of Western Mindanao Command, said it was premature to say who was responsible for the attack.\nOne soldier, five militiamen and four civilians, including a mother and her child, were killed in the blast, military officials said. The driver, the only person in the van, also was killed.\nBiazon said authorities should check if the real target was the checkpoint or if the attack was a \u201ctest mission\u201d to recruit and train extremists to carry out other attacks.\nIt could also have been a botched mission that was intended for a bigger target, he added.\nFurigay said the bomb could have been intended for a parade of more than 3,000 schoolchildren in the center of the city, about two kilometers from Bulanting, later on Tuesday morning to celebrate the culmination of a nutrition program.\nHe called the militiamen and soldiers who stopped the van \u201cheroes\u201d for preventing what could have been massive casualties.\nCol. Montano Almodovar, commander of the 3rd Scout Ranger Battalion, said the explosion happened around 5:45 a.m., just a few meters away from the checkpoint manned by militiamen and Scout Ranger and Special Forces troops.\nThe militiamen requested assistance from their superiors because they could not communicate with the driver, Almodovar said.\n\u201cOur Rangers were proceeding to the area. When they were about 20 meters distance, the van went off,\u201d he said.\nSome farm animals also were killed in the blast, which obliterated the van and gouged a small crater on the ground.\nArevalo told reporters the AFP had received intelligence information that the Abu Sayyaf group under Furuji Indama was planning to bomb various parts"}

Her death was due to a rare disease called scleroderma that destroys the connective tissues that support the body.\nMy introduction to Cosman, an attorney who specialized in the ethical and medical aspects of the law, came about last year when The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons published her article, \"Illegal Immigration and American Medicine.\"\nWritten in a style that packed powerful arguments backed with statistical data - a lawyer's brief - Cosman made the case that U.S. Public Health officials were failing (or perhaps refusing) to explain to the general public what medical dangers illegal immigrants posed.\nI was so impressed with the article that I sent it to Rep. Virgil Goode (R-VA), who read part of it into The Congressional Record. In my appearances before Virginia legislative committees, I used that information to buttress the case made by Cosman: \"We may know what illegal aliens carry in their backpacks; we do no know what they carry in their bodies.\"\nCosman tracked the growing number of illnesses - tuberculosis, often of a virulent nature, leprosy, and even Chaga's disease, for which there is no known cure - which illegal aliens may bring with them.\nUnlike the current political class of both parties who ignore this aspect of illegal immigration, Cosman was unstoppable in her pursuit of the truth.\nIn financial and medical terms, illegal aliens are bankrupting the places where they swarm. She detailed the catastrophic impact of illegal aliens on the California hospital system, where unfunded mandates demanded by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act are responsible for the closing of more than 80 hospitals.\nWhen she spoke at Carlsbad, 150 law enforcement agents were sent to prevent potential violence; a clear sign that the other side of this issue does not want to hear the truth.\nDr. Cosman was 68. She will be greatly missed.\nJoe Guzzardi comments: VDARE.COM is late in publishing this tribute to Dr. Cosman. In my many phone conversations and meetings with her, Cosman was gracious and generous with her knowledge.

It goes all the way out to the east through East Broadway, and the hospital\u2019s connected to it as well.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a fairly major infrastructure system here. They\u2019ve done some capital upgrades in the last couple of years, but they recognize they need to start putting some money aside for that.\n\u201cThe Bill this morning essentially gave them the authority to be able to impose, under an old ordinance, an old Act in the city of Hamilton, the 1917 act, a sewage tax simply for capital upgrades. The tax is likely to be very modest, the maximum they can assess is some $0.25 per hundred dollars,\u201d continued Dr Gibbons.\n\u201cFor a small residential ARV of about $30,000, that looks like it\u2019s going to be about $75 per year. Larger property maybe up to $250, that would be the maximum.\n\u201cThere was also some discussion about the need to look at how we deal with raw sewage, which is now pumped out off of Seabright and through rather a long pipe out there.\n\u201cI think the discussion revolved around the fact that depending on the amount of treatment, that could range from $20 to $60 million dollars in additional capital spending.\nNo problem with this move. CoH have every right to tax residences and businesses that fall outside of their formal governing boundary, specifically with regards to their use of CoH infrastructure. The need to plan and fund infrastructure upgrades and maintenance is vital.\nThey are too busy paving over all the parking bays, narrowing the roads and putting in an acre of paving stones from Tills Hill to Tools and Equipment, amongst other follies, to build a sewage treatment plant. Oh yeah, we need 8000 more people to increase the flow into our waters too.\nWe are going to need a TEA party as our next political party when the government has to resort to taxing sh*t.

There is no holding tank. The \u201ctreatment\u201d tank across from the Supermart is very large but almost always full. There is no alternative and the pumping into the Harbour would start within minutes.\nIf you read the bill and not the headline you will see both inside and outside valuation units will be charged this new tax .\nThe rates and current connection charges are used for maintenance of the system according to what Gibbons said on Friday.

One such law is the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires environmental review of projects that have a significant impact on the environment and require discretionary approvals from public agencies. CEQA prohibits agencies from approving projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures available that would substantially lessen the environmental impacts of the projects.\nThis article reviews California cases regarding use of preservation of agricultural land as mitigation and concludes that the California courts have not yet developed a coherent position. In a few published cases, the California appellate courts appear to accept the notion that preservation can meet mitigation requirements without discussion. In some unpublished decisions where courts addressed the issue head on, they reached the opposite decisions.\nThere are only two acceptable techniques for mitigating environmental impacts that involve the loss, destruction, or significant alteration of unique resources such as land or habitat: creation and enhancement. However, most laws (including CEQA) define mitigation more broadly to include notions of avoidance, minimization, and preservation. Such techniques should not qualify as mitigation because these strategies should be elements of project design. When beginning a project that may have significant environmental impacts, one should seek to avoid and minimize those effects from the onset. After those steps, one would mitigate the remaining impacts through creation or enhancement. Preservation as mitigation is inappropriate because it admits that destruction of the amenity will occur. It results in an overall net loss of the amenity. It may prevent future impacts, but it does not address present problems.\nDavid C.

For me, it was about re-creating the childhood I had as an only child \u2013 the undivided attention, the quiet, the unit of three. For him, it was the financially sound option; he'd grown up as one of three, with money tight at times, and he didn't want us to feel stretched.\nBack then it was just our plan, like all the decisions you make before your hypothetical child is born, a seemingly rational strategy we didn't debate.\nThen she was born. She brought the kind of joy we hadn't thought possible. I wavered; how could we not relive this utter bliss? I mourned each milestone a little bit, knowing a part of her childhood was over, never to be revisited with another baby. My husband was steadfast in his decision, though, and ultimately I agreed.\nThe financial reasons for sticking with one still stand for both of us, and while I've seen the happiness of larger families as our friends have had second and third babies, there are new factors at play. My career is just getting back on track and, as much as it's a constant juggle, that juggle is evolving alongside my child.\nMy husband, meanwhile, is building up to a PhD. And as our daughter grows up, the possibilities for all of us seem to widen, from small things like having a lie-in, to a summer-long sabbatical together in Italy. I love the dynamic of the three of us, and she's never wanted a sibling. So far.\nStill, as one of the very few one-child families we know, we often think of ourselves as an anomaly. And so, it seems, does everyone else. Although our families and friends rarely comment, strangers are full of opinions. An old woman in the post office queue told me I ought to get cracking on baby number two, as my toddler waggled her tongue at her from her buggy, \"so she doesn't get too used to being an only child\". And everyone, from the mortgage adviser to the train conductor, tilts their head to one side before asking, \"Is it just her, then?\"\nWith this kind of commentary, I assumed we were in the minority. But the number of one-child families is on the rise. According to new data from the UK, nearly one in five mothers born in 1972 has just one child, compared to one in seven for their mother's generation.\n\"Women today are eager to complete their educations and settle into careers before starting families,\" says Dr Susan Newman, social psychologist and author of The Case for the Only Child. \"Late starts often lead to fertility issues. Costly medical intervention is prohibitive for many couples or single women hoping to have more children, and the economics and practicalities of raising children lead many to stop at one.\"\nWhile we knew what we wanted from the outset, for others it's decided when that child becomes a reality. Bek, 36, realised when her son, Seth, was born that one was enough. \"My husband and I always spoke about having two children. But when our boy was born, he completed us as a three.\"\nA copywriter for four years before Seth was born, Bek decided to change career when her son started school and is now studying integrative counselling, which would have been far less manageable with a second child. \"I realised I am being a better mum by making sure I am happy, and for me that meant going"}

At the time the seal was in use, the monastery had hundreds of monks.

The salvage digs revealed the remains of a farmstead dating from the Byzantine period.\nThe archaeologists discovered that the site had been abandoned at the end of the Byzantine period, only to be resettled during the Crusader period (11th to 12th centuries).

{"idx": "12426", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Fire alarms are tested to ensure malfunctions won't prevent them from sounding if there is a fire.\nFire alarms are installed most often in commercial buildings and large structures like apartment complexes. They may also be used as part of residential security systems. Fire alarms emit an alarm when smoke or heat is detected, but if the unit is not able to sense smoke or heat, or if it cannot emit the alarm, then it is not doing its job. Fire alarms must be tested annually with specialized tools to ensure they are in proper working condition.\nSome fires produce little or no smoke. In the event that there is not enough smoke to set the alarm off, the fire's heat would be the only indication that a fire has occurred. To accurately test your fire alarm\u2019s ability to sense heat, you must create heat in the range that is most likely to set off the alarm. Matches or lighters cannot do this, and they\u2019re a dangerous way to test your alarm. Heat guns and blow dryers are also inaccurate tests of your fire alarm\u2019s ability to sense the heat of a fire. Instead, a heat testing device is used for this purpose. Heat-detector testers are usually manufactured as portable pads that use saline to heat up, and they can be used to test a range of temperatures.\nOne of the primary ways your fire detector determines whether there is fire is by detecting smoke. Aerosol smoke sprays are used to test the alarm's ability to sense even small amounts of smoke. These sprays work on ionization- and photoelectric-type fire alarms, which are commonly used in residential installations. The spray creates a simulated smoke, which the fire alarm should detect. This will set off the alarm, confirming that it is working properly. If it does not go off, clean the vents of the fire alarm system and test again. Fire alarm vents and sensors should be vacuumed or cleaned monthly to ensure proper functioning.\nResidential fire alarms are sometimes made with a magnetic test strip that would activate the device to determine if the alarm itself is working. A test magnet is a basic tool that is held to the test strip on the unit. The test magnet displays a status on the LED display to let you know whether the alarm is functioning properly. Test magnets only test the functionality of the fire alarm unit, however, not its sensitivity. It should never be considered an adequate test by itself and should be used in conjunction with heat and smoke testers.\nIn commercial installations or in large structures such as apartment buildings, there may be several units to test, and these are often located on a high ceiling that is not easily accessed. Testing is also difficult in homes with cathedral ceilings because ladders cannot provide proper access to the units. In these situations, a telescoping wand is used. The tester is attached to the wand, which usually has a gripping end. Then you can reach up to carry out the test safely and effectively.\nMiller, Renee. \"Fire Alarm Testing Tools.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/fire-alarm-testing-tools-29922.html.

{"idx": "12432", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell met with reporters last week after a closed-door Republican strategy session.\nIT\u2019S LONG BEEN OBVIOUS that the US Senate is broken, but nothing better illustrates the problem than the recent debate over DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 and the Dreamers. One proposal failed 52 to 47. A second went down 54 to 45. A third lost by the same margin.\nBut how can the three proposals all have been defeated if they all had majority support? Because in today\u2019s Senate, everything needs 60 votes, the number it takes to end a filibuster. Or, more accurately, a threatened filibuster or virtual filibuster, since these days, no one actually gets up and talks as part of a filibuster unless it\u2019s for political show.\nSo on a matter where there\u2019s widespread public support for action, and where Republican leaders have repeatedly said a deal should be within easy reach, nothing happened.\nTime was, important issues were routinely decided according to a majority vote. A filibuster was only an occasional thing. And a senator or group of senators had to hold the floor and talk in order for a filibuster to continue. But no longer. Once a senator threatens to filibuster, action on that item stalls unless 60 senators vote to move forward.\nNeither party escapes blames for filibuster abuse, but most of it lies with the GOP. And, particularly, with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who as leader of the Republican caucus, has transformed the Senate into an instrument of obstruction. \u201cI would say flatly that nobody has done more to destroy the comity and the norms and the more commendable way the Senate has operated for a long period of time than Mitch McConnell,\u201d says Norm Ornstein, congressional expert and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\nAlthough some senators are apparently confused about this, the filibuster wasn\u2019t part of the Senate\u2019s original design.\nIn his years as Republican Senate leader during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, McConnell (and his caucus) used the filibuster to slow down everything and anything the Democratic president wanted. With Republicans now controlling all three branches of government, Democrats, viewing turnabout as fair play, are using the filibuster more. It\u2019s evolved to the point where virtually any issue of importance has to clear the 60-vote threshold.\nWitness DACA. As majority leader, McConnell promised a fair debate, saying that \u201cwhoever gets to 60 [votes] wins.\u201d (Nobody did, of course.) But why should passing a DACA bill require 60 votes rather than a simple majority?\nSo what would it take to fix the Senate? Among the possible rule reforms: expanding the list of matters that aren\u2019t subject to a filibuster and limiting to one the number of times a filibuster can be used on a specific piece of legislation. A broader proposal is to require those filibustering to hold the floor and speak in order for their filibuster to continue.\nAn informal solution would be for senators to change the Senate through behavior rather than rules. That would require a bipartisan bloc who would agree to vote routinely to end filibusters on all matters except for those that were truly vital to them. That would mean accepting that one side or the other would sometimes lose on an issue they could have blocked.\nWith such an understanding, the ubiquity of the filibuster might fade.

All are available, with photos, at mountainx.com or gospeljerry.com.\nA lot of people let their hair down in my castle, but Rapunzel never did.\nNo, the answer to the third-most-frequently-asked question about my former residence lay deep in the bowels of the ominous, imposing tower at the west end.\nAt the bottom of the tower sat a huge coal furnace which, assisted by a big pump, delivered hot water through thousands of feet of pipe to the radiators spread throughout the castle and in the four-car, freestanding garage and chauffeur\u2019s quarters some 300 feet to the north.\nI didn\u2019t really appreciate the enormity of the task of keeping this massive heating plant going until the caretaker was out of town for a couple of days during an extreme cold snap, and the king had to shovel what seemed like tons of coal into the stoker\u2019s gaping maw and remove innumerable clinkers.\nShortly after that, we converted the system to oil, employing a 2,000-gallon tank, retrieved from the junkyard, that could hold a whole tanker load of fuel. This turned out to be far more cost-efficient and less labor-intensive, and I always wondered why Asheville-Biltmore College hadn\u2019t done it years before.\nIn the interest of conservation, we kept the radiators in the public areas turned way down, creating an appropriately frigid English castle atmosphere. Surprisingly, the bedroom was very comfortable; in the rest of the house, we simply wore sweaters and let our teeth chatter in our best British accent.\nAbove the furnace at ground level sat an austere room that had originally been guarded from the outside by a very unusual curved, ornately carved oak door. Unfortunately, the previous owner had transferred it to his home in Memphis, Tenn., where I had occasion to admire it.\nOne might have mistaken this room for a sort of concrete dungeon if not for the vaultlike safe that many banks would have been proud of. This, my friends, was the countinghouse, where I\u2019m sure much treasure and secret documents pertaining to the many enterprises undertaken by Seely and his extraordinarily wealthy father-in-law, E.W. Grove, were stored.\nIt\u2019s also rumored that secret papers from the Teapot Dome oil scandal in the early 1920s had been locked in this safe.\nWhen I acquired the house, the safe\u2019s doors were locked open and I didn\u2019t have the combination. When I tried to close the doors they would bang and gape, as if mocking me for not having anything of value to stash there anyway.\nThe very proper dining area, which could probably have accommodated 30 or 40 people, was reached by a set of stairs that wound down from the great room. We put red-velvet wallpaper above the oak wainscoting, and with a beautiful chandelier and a very large table (a family heirloom that was almost big enough for the space), it achieved a very satisfying effect.\nTo take advantage of this, I wanted to hold at least one very special dinner for my family and close friends. I engaged legendary chef Bob Werth and his talented staff at A-B Tech to cater an evening to remember with candlelight, wine, incredible food and impeccable service. On this night I truly felt like a king.\n"}

{"idx": "12435", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Will Apple Finally Part Ways With Samsung?\nAccording to an HSBC report, Apple is finally moving on from its biggest competitor in a way that would benefit Taiwan Semiconductor.\nIt's always been a strange relationship between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). On one hand, these two companies compete among high-level devices including tablets and smartphones. However, Apple depends upon Samsung as a supplier to fabricate the heart of its devices -- Cupertino's signature A-line series of chips. In a recent HSBC research note, analysts Steven Pelayo and Lionel Lin estimate that Samsung produces 60%-70% of Apple's current-gen A9 chip.\nMore recently, however, Apple has been looking to divest itself from Samsung's clutches. Starting with the A8 chip, Apple decided to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) as the lead fab. Later iPhone teardowns found Samsung providing up to 40% of fabrication. In the current A9 chip, this dual-sourcing strategy continued.\nBut that's not the biggest news from HSBC's report: It appears Apple has finally decided it's time to make the jump to Taiwan Semiconductor as its only source of fabrication for its next-gen A10 chip. If true, this could be a big win for TSMC at the expense of Samsung's future revenue and profit drivers.\nFor Samsung, this would serve as both a tangible loss and a symbolic one. As for the former, in its third-quarter earnings report, Samsung reported its first year-on-year operating profit increase in the past seven quarters. The reason for this reversal was not the company's smartphone line, but rather its semiconductor business, which increased a massive 62% over last year's result, contributing nearly 50% to Samsung's total operating profit.\nGoing forward, Samsung specifically noted 14-nanometer foundry growth, in reference to the fabrication node it manufactures Apple's A9 chip on, as a source of future earnings improvement. And while Apple should still contribute to Samsung's operating profit in the short term, this would hurt Samsung's year-on-year comparisons when this revenue and profit no longer show up on Samsung's income statement.\nIn addition, the symbolic blow could affect Samsung's 14-nm business. Earlier reports were that iPhones equipped with Samsung's A9 chip were prone to overheating with noticeably worse battery life. And while Apple later rebutted the reports, stating that the battery-life variance was only 2%-3%, moving away from Samsung amid quality reports has the potential to scare other smartphone makers away from Samsung, much as the company itself did to Qualcomm after reports that its previous-gen Snapdragon 810 flagship chip was prone to overheating.\nWhether it's Apple's desire not to depend upon its main competitor, poor performance from Samsung-fabbed A9 chips, or seeming superior next-gen technology (see below), this would be a huge win for TSMC. Right now, Apple contributes more than 14% to TSMC's top line, with forecasts that the company will contribute $3.7 billion in the nearly completed fiscal 2015 versus companywide revenue estimates of $26.24 billion.\nAccording to the report, TSMC is working with Apple to introduce integrated fan-out packaging"}

More than 70 percent of the students from developing countries on the Quota program return home after their studies are completed.\nA government-commissioned evaluation revealed that there were some issues with the program. Concerns were raised, for example, over the large amount of resources that went into its administration, with the government not knowing whether the students stayed in their home country or not.\nThe government thus proposes replacing the Quota Scheme with two alternative programs: one that works on short-term exchanges with the Global South, and another that creates a \u2018Panorama\u2019 program with the BRICS countries (including Brazil, India, and China).\nISU opposes the replacement programs because they are vaguely described, incomplete, and have entirely different objectives than education for development. These actions also go against the recommendations from the evaluation that recommended improving the Quota Scheme, not scrapping it.\nRepresentatives from academia have expressed support for the Quota Scheme, including University of Oslo Rector Ole Petter Ottersen, and several department heads such as Poul Wisborg, the head of the Department of International Environment and Development Studies at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.\nDespite the importance of this program, there has been a lack of attention on its possible demise. Many university faculties are still in the dark, yet some of their programs could be shut down without the funding the Quota Scheme provides to its researchers.\nWith negotiations on the state budget nearing an end, ISU seeks the support of the Liberal and Christian Democrats parties, which have lobbied for education and development in the past. Without the Quota Scheme, students from developing countries will have little chance of fulfilling the study permit requirements to take a full degree in Norway."}

This broad-based coalition of prominent Italians will focus its efforts on the protection of personal privacy online for citizens in Italy and throughout Europe.\nProtection of personal privacy and data online is a growing problem that will challenge European policy-makers. Implementation of an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework that is pro-consumer, transparent and allows for customer control is an important first step in the protection of privacy.\nRecent actions by the Italian Government demonstrate that steps must be taken to protect online data. The government's release of the tax returns of Italian citizens is just one example of a large-scale breach of privacy.\n\"It is quite scary that citizens can suddenly have their personal data displayed online for everyone to see,\" said Luca Bolognini, spokesman for The Italian Institute for Privacy. \"The government's decision to make private financial information about every Italian citizen available to the general public was a fundamental breach of trust. This extreme action shows how vigilant we citizens must be in defense of our basic right to privacy.\"\nProtecting personal data online transcends across all of Europe, not just Italy. As the internet grows it offers new and innovative services to online users. While these innovations are exciting, they also pose significant risks to consumers. It is the obligation of ISPs and content providers to ensure that privacy protections are in place and that users are able to make informed decisions about their participation in online services.\nRecently, the Article 29 Working Party, composed of Data Protection Authorities of the EU Member States and chaired by the European Commission, issued a landmark report that recommended that the storage length of personal data that can be reasonably justified by search engines be limited to no more than six months. Internet search providers and content providers must disclose their data collection, retention and privacy policies upfront.\n\"The Institute believes it will be imperative for European policy makers, especially those in Brussels, to ensure appropriate action is taken to protect people's privacy online,\" said Bolognini.\nThe Italian Privacy Institute, based in Rome, works to ensure that Italian and European Internet users are properly protected against invasions of their personal privacy. We conduct our analyses and formulate our policy proposals based on the following principles: Privacy is a basic human right. Without privacy, citizens are not fully free to search for information, conduct business, and participate in the public debate online; The Internet industry (i.e. service providers, search engines, and others) has a responsibility to ensure the privacy of their customers; Governments have a responsibility to ensure the privacy of its citizens, including properly safeguarding personal information in public databases; and Governments should not be able to infringe on privacy without proper cause and due process.

Bowing to pressure, Obama intends to permit continued sale of individual insurance plans that have been canceled because they failed to meet coverage standards under the health care law, officials said Thursday.\nIt was unclear Thursday whether insurance companies in California would follow President Barack Obama\u2019s lead after he announced new rules to clear the way for companies to extend the health plans of millions of people who had received cancellation notices.\nObama\u2019s move would allow, but not require, insurers to rescind the cancellations and keep the plans in place for one year.\nThose old policies were slated for termination because they do not comply with the new, stiffer coverage requirements under the health care law, known as Obamacare. Insurers, especially those selling through the state-run health care exchange, Covered California, spent a lot of time and energy designing 2014 health plans that comply with the Obamacare requirements.\nThey calculated the premiums of those plans based on their best estimates of how many people would buy them and what their average ages and health status would be. If a significant proportion of the 1.1 million Californians who received cancellation notices were to stick with their existing plans for another year, it could siphon off a large pool of potential Covered California customers and tangle the delicate web of calculations that went into the exchange.\nHealth care experts say that the people most likely to keep their existing plans tend to have fewer health problems, because many of those plans carry high deductibles and require large out-of-pocket spending by enrollees. Those kinds of policies would not appeal to somebody who needs a lot of medical attention. That means Covered California could get a higher-than-expected proportion of sick people, which might in turn require insurers to revisit the premiums they have already set.\nFor Marianne Olson, a Tustin woman who received a cancellation notice from Anthem Blue Cross that recommended a more expensive policy, Thursday\u2019s news brought little solace.\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Oh, good, we don\u2019t have to do it for a year,\u2019 \u201d said Olson, a stay-at-home mother of eight children. \u201cBut then I thought, \u2018What will the insurance companies do? They\u2019ve already canceled the plans and changed premiums.\nThe California Association of Health Plans, the state\u2019s industry trade group, took a dim view of Obama\u2019s announcement, warning of a \u201csignificant disruption in the marketplace\u201d if insurance companies were to reverse course and reinstate the canceled plans.\nThe association\u2019s comments no doubt reflect the concerns of its constituents. But individual insurance companies were lying low on Thursday, waiting for things to settle down.\nSome plans circulated non-committal statements like the one from Blue Shield of California spokesman Stephen Shivinsky, who said his company \u201cwill work with state regulators, public officials and Covered California to understand the implications of today\u2019s announcement.\u201d Anthem Blue Cross, one of the state\u2019s biggest insurers, declined to comment.\nInsurers are holding back not only because of the uncertainty stemming from Obama\u2019s announcement but also because their hands are tied for now.\nThe ones that are participating in Covered California \u2013 which collectively account for about 90 percent of the state\u2019s individual market \u2013 are required by their exchange contracts to cancel the non-compliant health plans on Dec. 3"}

These range from the platform of the Republican Party to \"compromises\" designed to allow more drilling, logging and unrestrained profiteering off national forests, national parks, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) landscapes and wildlife refuges.\nWith 650 million recreational visits per year to federal land, 60 percent of Americans' water supply coming from national forests alone, and with these places serving as the cornerstone of wildlife habitat, everybody should be concerned with what reporter Maxine Bernstein of The Oregonian/OregonLive called \"the turbulent politics of public land ownership\" (\"Malheur jury selection begins,\" Sept. 7).\nSome county commissioners and some members of Congress (not mine, I'm proud to say) have jumped on a boisterous bandwagon that raises troubling questions about the mantra of \"taking back\" federal land. First of all, you can't do that. Nearly all the federal land in the West has belonged to America's taxpayers ever since we took it from the American Indians.\nWhat the naysayers mean is that they want to \"take\" our federal land away from all of us who own it. Sometimes they soften their claim by advocating for state ownership. But look no further than ongoing efforts to sell off the Elliott State Forest to see where state control of our federal estate would end up.\nLiquidating or otherwise compromising even pieces of every American's greatest inheritance would diminish us all. Our Western backcountry -- just out the door -- is available for everyone to visit, camp, walk, drive, hunt, fish, paddle, ski and simply relax. Our federal properties produce clean air and vistas of green that draw visitors and homeseekers alike from no less than 38 states that have only nominal amounts of public land available to their residents.\nThe values of public land most evident to me in the pursuit of my own livelihood are in the rivers flowing from national forests and BLM land. Look no further than the water we drink, the streams where we swim and the fish we catch for sport or in commercial fisheries at sea.\nVirtually every one of Oregon's renowned waterways -- from the Rogue to the Deschutes, the Umpqua to the Willamette, the Snake to the Siletz -- flows relatively clean and unspoiled because of the nationally owned acreage at its headwaters and along its banks. Appreciate clean tap water? Like to fish? Then the land at the sources of those streams must be protected -- as only the federal government has been able to do.\nIn my travels and photographic expeditions to rivers statewide, I've been amazed and heartened at how widely shared our rivers and public places are by Oregonians and visitors alike. I see hundreds of people appreciating our public estate for every person that I hear complaining about \"too much federal land.\"\nMalcontents like the ones waving guns at law enforcement officials and at the people of Burns, Oregon, are not going to care about the values that these lands provide to the rest of us. Nor are the county commissioners who claim that state or private ownership of our magnificent commons is necessary to balance their budget next year.\nHere in the West, the best thing we have going is public land.

Hernandez was widely regarded as a second-round talent, but many teams took him off their draft boards because of failed drug tests and rumors that he hung out with the wrong crowd.\nOwner/general manager Mike Brown acknowledged to Fox Sports Ohio that his Cincinnati Bengals were one of those teams with no intention of rolling the dice on Hernandez three years ago.\n\"That one is no secret. We just stayed away from (Hernandez),\" Brown said. \"We didn't question the playing ability. But we went for (Jermaine) Gresham.\"\nBrown also revealed that Rob Gronkowski -- the other tight end drafted by the Patriots in 2010 -- was taken off the Bengals' board \"because he had a bad back\" coming out of the University of Arizona. Gronkowski recently had back surgery.\nPerhaps even more interesting than those revelations was Brown's guileless discussion of the team's evolution in philosophy regarding players red-flagged for behavioral issues. It's a dilemma to which NFL teams have begun devoting more resources.\nThe Bengals had been more conscientious about drafting the \"right type of person\" under Brown's father, Paul Brown, the legendary founder of the franchise. Mike Brown liberalized the policy on ne'er-do-wells once other teams \"sort of had us for lunch\" with the aid of talented but troubled players. He began taking chances on players with lengthy rap sheets such as Chris Henry, Cedric Benson and Tank Johnson. Over a 17-month span between December 2005 and June 2007, 10 Bengals players accounted for 17 arrests.\nBy the time Hernandez entered the draft three years later, Brown had decided to return to the \"old formula\" of bringing in \"sound people.\" That shift in thinking has coincided with the recent rise of social media. NFL teams are finding more and more that the poisonous publicity risk isn't worth the on-field reward.\nUPDATE: Add the Indianapolis Colts to the list of teams that didn't want to draft Hernandez.\nFormer Colts general manager Bill Polian told the Wall Street Journal that the team passed on Hernandez despite its need for a tight end.\n\"There were questions there, which is why a guy of that talent lasted until the fourth round,\" said Polian, who added that the Colts, who took tight end Brody Eldridge in the fifth round, \"never got that far\" in evaluating Hernandez.\n\"We were not in the Hernandez business,\" Polian said.\nUpdate: The Bengals and Colts have company. The Miami Dolphins removed Hernandez from their draft board, reports the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\nThe Dolphins were concerned that Hernandez confessed to punching a bar employee and was questioned by police in a Gainesville area double-shooting."}

Or, if he asked for a trial, they would invoke his earlier drug convictions from 1993 and 2004 and, if found guilty, he would face an automatic sentence of life without parole.\nWhile mandatory sentence laws have frustrated judges and defense lawyers for nearly three decades, calls to revise the laws have surged in the past year. Driven in part by budget concerns as the federal prison population continues to grow, proposals in Congress to restrict lengthy automatic sentences to drug-gang leaders, kingpins and violent offenders have won bipartisan support. In August, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. instructed federal prosecutors to avoid harsh charges for some lower-level drug defendants.\nBut the outcry goes beyond mandatory sentences and three-strike laws. Using their discretionary power to apply lengthy \u201cenhancements\u201d on top of required terms, critics say, federal prosecutors are strong-arming defendants into pleading guilty and overpunishing those who do not \u2014 undermining the fairness and credibility of the justice system.\nA new study by Human Rights Watch, in New York, is the first to quantify what some call the \u201ctrial penalty,\u201d the extra prison time that federal drug defendants get if they exercise their right to a trial and lose.\nIn 2012, federal drug offenders convicted at trial received sentences averaging 16 years \u2014 triple the average of five years and four months for those who accepted a plea bargain, according to the report, published Thursday. The study also found that while the prior-conviction multipliers were applied to 24 percent of eligible defendants who pleaded guilty, they were applied to 72 percent of those going to trial.\nRoy Lee Clay in a photo used as a trial exhibit. After being found guilty in a heroin case, he received life in prison without parole. Had he pleaded guilty, prosecutors would have recommended 10 years in prison.\nProsecutors respond that using leverage to obtain plea bargains with clearly guilty defendants is a sound way to conserve resources and obtain cooperation, and that the harsher sentences that defendants like Mr. Clay receive after a trial are consistent with the law.\nThe result is that federal drug trials have become a rarity: 97 percent of defendants plead guilty.\nUnder federal sentencing laws adopted in the 1980s, drug crimes may be subject to mandatory minimum sentences of five or 10 years depending on the quantities of drugs involved, which can be reached by adding up small amounts from several deals.\nMichael S. Nachmanoff, the chief federal public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, said that the prospect of staggering penalties puts defense lawyers in the position of urging clients to consider a plea to avoid them, even if the lawyers see a chance of acquittal or reduced charges.\nAnother problem with the prior-felony and gun enhancements, critics say, is the arbitrary variation in their use. In a lengthy analysis in August, Judge Mark Bennett of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, in Sioux City, described a \u201cshocking, jaw-dropping disparity\u201d in use of the prior-conviction enhancements, with some prosecutors routinely invoking them and others rarely.\nMr. Holder also praised bills before the Senate Judiciary Committee that could make sentencing more flexible for lower-level offenders.

Furthermore, he forced his subordinates to drive his car and force them to go drinking.\nIn particular, there has been controversy over his remarks that regularly provoke sexual humiliation among unmarried employees. It has been confirmed that he made sexual harassment comments such as \u201cHave you done everythin?\u201d and \u201cWhere are you doing it?\u201d. Furthermore, he frequently ordered his subordinates to buy his groceries and return with them to the office.\nThere was also mutiny.

{"idx": "12460", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Bible teaches, \u201cResist the devil and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6).\nMany great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, \u201cIt takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.\u201d This is a true saying!\nI believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls. By \u201cfirewall,\u201d I mean something that acts as a barrier so that the temptation does not easily penetrate the heart. Proverbs 4:23 instructs us to guard our heart because out of it flow the issues of life.\nMost people have no firewalls set up; thus, as soon as a strong temptation comes their way, the only thing stopping them from sinning is their own will power, which is based on the spiritual and emotional condition they are in at the moment of the test.\nIn order for the enemy to trip me up and get me to fall into adultery or other forms of sexual sin, he would have to get through not only my will power but also five layers of firewalls I have set up to protect my soul.\nNo firewall is foolproof, of course. The primary way to resist temptation is to be in the strength of the Lord, as Ephesians 6:10-13 teaches. However, there are times we may not be at a high level of spiritual and emotional strength or times when we are caught off guard. Firewalls are something the Holy Spirit can use to further strengthen our resolve.\n1. Maintaining intimate fellowship with the Lord. By far, the most important relationship I have in my life is my friendship and covenant with the Lord. I told the Lord when I first started in ministry that I would never allow the ministry to be so consuming that I did not have time to pray and walk in His manifest presence. The main reason we were born is to grow in the knowledge of and relationship with the Lord, and I never want to exchange my walk with Him for any earthly pleasure (see Eph. 4:30).\n2. Maintaining the trust my spouse and children have in me. Besides my commitment to the Lord, the greatest call and joy of my life is caring for the family God has entrusted to me. Before I fall into temptation, I will think about the commitment I have to my wife and remind myself that I do not want to devastate her. I will also consider that I never want to do anything to destroy the way my children view me and possibly hurt their view of the Lord and His church. Our greatest legacy will be the life we lead, which is the inheritance we pass on to our children\u2019s children (see Prov. 13:22).\nI want my legacy to include leaving a generational blessing to my biological family that will continue to speak after I am long gone (see Heb. 11:4).\n3. Staying true to the purpose of God and His call on my life. I believe a person can derail his purpose and the call of God on his life by the choices he makes. I have worked more than 35 years to fulfill His call, and I do not want to blow it for momentary pleasure.\n4. Setting a good example for my spiritual sons and daughters. I have only five biological children, but I have many close spiritual sons and daughters. I have seen and read about how church members and spiritual children become disillusioned with the things of God because of their leader"}
{"idx": "12461", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: It's 2011, and yet we're still sorting through the veracity of the crazier theories of election 2008. Today, Politico and Salon have attempted definitive explanations/debunkings of the most virulent of those political fringe conspiracies: Birtherism and Trig-Trutherism.\nWhat the Conspiracy Is: \"Trig Trutherism holds that Trig's real mother is either Bristol Palin or some third party, and that Sarah Palin herself faked the pregnancy to avoid embarrassment for her daughter or for political gain or some combination of reasons,\" writes Elliott.\nWhy the Conspiracy Still Exists: People have been making claims that Sarah Palin is not actually the mother of 3-year-old Trig Palin since early 2008. But recently a new academic paper by a journalism professor at North Kentucky University has fanned the flames of the \"Palin-hating left\" once again.\nNew Information Added To Debate: Salon conducted \"new interviews with multiple eyewitnesses who interacted with a pregnant Sarah Palin up-close in early 2008,\" including Associated Press and McClatchy news reporters who saw a visibly pregnant Sarah Palin. These \"eyewitness accounts should carry more weight than the doubts of bloggers scrutinizing a few photos [of Palin not looking pregnant] posted on the Web,\" Elliott contends.\nYou can believe that Palin was wearing a pregnancy suit and Hollywood-quality makeup for weeks, all before she had a national profile. You can believe that she fooled all of those journalists with her pregnancy costume, including the AP reporter who literally inspected Palin's belly in her office. You can believe that Palin, and her entire family, and her doctor, and her disgruntled former aide Frank Bailey, have been lying to the press in a tightly organized and mind-bogglingly elaborate conspiracy. You can believe that the medical workers who were involved in Trig's delivery were paid off or have simply kept inexplicably quiet about the hoax. You can believe that Bristol Palin gave birth to Trig and then had another child just eight months later.\nOr you can believe that Trig is Sarah Palin's son.\nWhat the Conspiracy Is: Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii as he says he was and has produced a fake certificate of live birth, making him ineligible to be President. An alternative theory in the same vein: \"Obama was born in Hawaii but had a Kenyan father, and his mother was only 18 years old. Therefore, under existing immigration law, he was not eligible for automatic citizenship upon birth,\" writes Politico.\nWhy the Conspiracy Still Exists: Have you been paying attention to Donald Trump lately? The man has morphed from media mogul to raging birther. Following Trump's revival of the theory, it \"has taken root--a New York Times poll Thursday found that a plurality of Republicans believe it.\"\nNew Information Added To Debate: The Politico reporters don't exactly report anything new as much as bring to light the copious amount of information already detailed in order to trace the history of the movement. They dig up, for instance, that the first birther to put his name to the email chain was \"Phil Berg, a former Pennsylvania deputy attorney general who had spent the previous years accusing President George W. Bush of complicity in the Sept. 11 attack.\" They also find that the movement didn't begin in earnest until the Obama campaign tried to debunk rumors in 20"}

Their 1-1 draw at home to St Johnstone on Wednesday night was greeted by jeers from their own fans.\nBut, while Warburton accepts the level of Rangers\u2019 second half performance merited that reaction, he is confident the vast majority of the club\u2019s support still have faith in his ability to create a team ultimately capable of challenging for the title.\n\u201cWe have spoken to enough genuine Rangers supporters and we are not listening to the five per cent minority,\u201d said Warburton. \u201cWe are not listening to them at all. The feedback we get from the rest is positive. They understand that we are trying to play. The second half against St Johnstone wasn\u2019t good enough. Why did I say the boos were understandable? Because it wasn\u2019t a good second half. You pay your money to be entertained. I know I wasn\u2019t entertained in the second half, I didn\u2019t enjoy watching my team. So I understand the boos, absolutely.\n\u201cBut I know the vast majority of Rangers fans have been first class, they\u2019ve been fantastic. There are rogue comments in papers or on radio stations. We don\u2019t listen to that.\n\u201cIf the board come and speak to me, that\u2019s different. If you listen to certain comments, you\u2019d think the pressure comes from the board because we have won four out of 10 in the league. If we had won on Wednesday, where would we be in relation to Aberdeen and Hearts? We are just 10 games in, it\u2019s still very early in the season. We still have players gelling and settling in.\nWarburton was quickly installed as one of the leading candidates for the Wigan job after the sacking earlier this week of former Celtic and Scotland defender Gary Caldwell.\n\u201cNo disrespect to Wigan, they are a very good club, but I have got to ask where did that come from?,\u201d said Warburton.\n\u201cDoes it really warrant being on the back page, Warburton being linked to the Wigan job? I can\u2019t control that, but it is nonsensical.\n\u201cWe are more than committed to Rangers and I hope the Rangers fans know that. They see the project we are doing here.\nWarburton was speaking before Joey Barton reported to Ibrox for talks with Rangers officials in regard to his ongoing suspension from the club following a training ground bust-up in the aftermath of the 5-1 defeat by Celtic on 10 September. Barton declined to make any comment as he made his way into the meeting which lasted for two hours. The 34-year-old\u2019s suspension remains in place as the disciplinary process continues."}

Give an old dress a makeover inspired by high fashion \u2013 at a fraction of the cost of a new outfit.\nOn the racecourse, the pressure is exceedingly high \u2013 for the men behind the reins, yes, and for the women in the crowd, maybe even more so. Aside from sourcing the perfect hat for the occasion, much stress goes into finding the perfect dress. Simple strapless numbers repeated from previous affairs and humdrum high-street halter buys aren\u2019t easily disguised, and are quickly forgotten. They\u2019re not viable options for those seeking to take away \u201cbest-dressed\u201d trophies, and many women would rather stay home than be dragged out wearing attire that\u2019s plainly unremarkable.\nThis poses quite the challenge for female race attendees, and can lead to last-minute, late-night shopping trips to the mall where, in sheer desperation, dresses are purchased that are neither very loved, nor within budget. After they\u2019re worn, \u00adphotographed and perhaps published in the social pages of \u00admagazines, they\u2019re hung in the backs of closets, boxed up and put in storage or given away to charity. What a waste.\nFor those on the brink of succumbing to the social pressure of buying a new dress for every ritzy occasion, there is a solution, both fashion forward and cost-efficient. It will require some imagination and willingness to let go of the old, but could result in a truly one-of-a-kind, custom-made, \u00adcouture-inspired masterpiece.\nWith a bit of rejuvenation, even a decade-old prom gown or bridesmaid\u2019s dress can be made into an entirely new creation, consistent with current runway trends, and perfect for an outing such as the Dubai World Cup. New dresses can cost up to Dh1,000 on the high street, and Dh25,000, or more, if they\u2019re designer wear. But any existing dress can be chopped, lengthened, panelled and pleated to create something fresh and as good as new, costing \u00adanywhere from Dh100 upwards, depending on the design.\nSara Al Dimachki is the managing partner of 800 Tailor, which is a personalised, \u00adcontemporary tailoring service that offers pick-up and delivery from and to clients\u2019 doorsteps. She suggests why the idea of redesigning dresses may not appeal to all women in the UAE. \u201cThey always like to be seen in the latest collections, and some might see going to the tailor as a hassle,\u201d she \u00adexplains.\nAnother off-putting factor for women may be the fact that many tailoring shops in the UAE lack fashion-forward proficiency and are skilled only in \u00admaking simple garments or copying existing cuts. The team behind 800 Tailor, on the other hand, is style savvy and experienced in high fashion, offering mass production and sampling services for established fashion designers, too.\nOnce on board with the project, hacking up an old dress shouldn\u2019t be too emotionally challenging, especially if it was a one-time wear. The DIY craze has hit women worldwide for a reason: it\u2019s fun.

{"idx": "12475", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: After decades speculating on what Islamists would do when they came to power, academics and Islamists themselves finally have their answer. And it is confusing. In the Sunni hinterland between Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State established a government by brute force and implemented an extreme interpretation of Islamic law. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Tunisia\u2019s Ennahda Party governed in coalition with two secular parties, ratified a liberal constitution, and voluntarily stepped down from power. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood presided over a controversial year in power, alienating most of the country\u2019s major political forces before being overthrown by a military coup.\nThese dramatic developments, coming in rapid succession, have challenged, and in some cases undermined, the conventional wisdom on political Islam, and forced policymakers to confront the fact that their knowledge of and capacity to engage with such groups remains limited. The 11 working papers which form part of our \u201cRethinking Political Islam\u201d initiative are an attempt, drawing on the latest field research from top young scholars, to think more systematically about changes in the mainstream Islamist movement and what to do about it. What lessons should academics, policymakers, and mainstream Islamists out of power draw from these divergent examples of Islamists in power?\nWhile Egypt and Tunisia received the most scholarly attention after the Arab uprisings, Islamist parties in Morocco, Yemen, and, importantly, Indonesia and Malaysia, have all played important roles in government that have, so far, received only limited attention. Malaysia and Indonesia are often held up as \u201cmodels\u201d of Islam and democracy, but, as we see in Joseph Liow\u2019s fascinating working paper on Southeast Asia, more Shariah ordinances have been passed in these two countries than in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, or Morocco. Southeast Asia might be a model of something, but it is very much not an example of the virtues of secularization or even, for that matter, the victory of liberalism, or something like it, over Islamism.\nThere are also new areas of inquiry that have become all the more vital in a post-Arab Spring world, including how Islamists view the viability of gradualist approaches to political change. The use of violence receives the most attention for obvious reasons, but the willingness to use tactical or situational violence is embedded in a broader debate about the nature of political change in contexts where violence becomes normalized.\nIn recent decades, mainstream Islamist movements had increasingly adopted \u201celections-first\u201d strategies, devoting organizational resources and attention to electoral politics at the expense of social outreach and religious education (Steven Brooke\u2019s paper on Egypt focuses on the role of social service provision in the Brotherhood\u2019s changing strategy). But the era of electoral politics has passed.\nHow do Islamists adapt to a world where elections are of increasingly marginal importance? We now have several cases of movements adapting to contexts where the currency of politics is violence. The most striking cases are Syria and Libya, where Brotherhood affiliates have proceeded down an uncertain path, allying themselves with local armed groups or attempting to form their own militias. As Rapha\u00ebl Lef\u00e8vre explains in his paper on Syria, debates over the use of violence in the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood have been contentious. The experiment of funding and supporting allied militias in Syria\u2014\u201cThe Shields\u201d\u2014has been a failure, demonstrating the difficulty the Brotherhood has had in shifting from its traditional strengths to something it doesn\u2019t do particularly well.\nWhat these papers demonstrate is that everyone learns lessons, but that\u2019s different than learning the right lessons."}

{"idx": "12483", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: President Obama may believe that paving $50 billion worth of new highways is a recipe for recession-ending, but it's a far cry from the innovative transportation thinking expected of the visionary president.\nNEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Vice President Joe Biden's chief economist made an interesting comment trying to defend President Obama's plan to jump-start the stalled U.S. economy by paving $50 billion worth of roads. \"The car ... is finally moving in the right direction, but it needs to go a lot faster,\" wrote Jared Bernstein, chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, in a White House blog post arguing in favor of Stimulus: the Sequel.\nWhat's interesting about Bernstein's comment is the metaphor chosen to defend the economic stimulus package: the car. Indeed, the metaphor is enough to give a guy road rage.\nI recently took a road trip from Milwaukee to Chicago where I was able to get a firsthand view of the original stimulus package: lines and lines of cars burning up their gas tanks while backed up in traffic bottlenecks caused by all the construction started after Obama's first attempt to rescue the U.S. economy with a New Deal-esque works projects. I've never spent so much time looking at the Chicago skyline, and not enjoying it. By the way, and maybe not by coincidence, where did Obama make the formal announcement about the infrastructure spending plan? Milwaukee.\nIt's not the traffic in the Midwest intensified by the current road-building that can really rally a traveler against the new stimulus. There are plenty of legitimate arguments, arguments that don't circle around to construction-triggered road rage, to make against the latest bid by the White House to show its hands -- to use its own metaphor -- firmly on the steering wheel of the U.S. economy.\nThe new stimulus plan is a not so subtle pleading for positive headlines from the newspapers during a mid-term election fight. For a president who came into office with an aura of innovation, invoking the New Deal doesn't exactly indicate that Obama's vision is unique. It's more like the latest attempt to use a well-worn presidential trope to lull the American public into awestruck acceptance. FDR ... New Deal ... Who can argue with that? The Republicans of course see the $50 billion as the latest example of a federal government and democratic administration run amok and wastefully burning greenbacks. Burning gas is more like it.\nIn any event, none of this is what really gets our cranky motor running.\nIt's the fact that the President who came into office with an aura of innovation opening up the federal wallet to build more and more roads (so White House blogger Bernstein's car can keep moving in the right direction) does nothing to get this economy headed in the right direction when it comes to a comprehensive plan to overhaul our transportation infrastructure for a greener future.\nThe debate over comprehensive energy legislation is almost none existent in the current fight over Obama's stimulus plan and the Bush-era tax cuts which are so dear to Republicans, and so important to Obama's rhetorical aim of showing that Republicans aren't fighting on behalf of all Americans.\nIf Americans care more about whether or not Bush-era tax cuts for those making over $250,000 are extending than they do about the future of energy policy in the U.S. it wouldn't really be any surprise, as that's just the type of short-term thinking that has always handicapped broad energy policy in Washington D.C.

If you were crushed but still alive, someone can still find you.\"\nOther inventors have developed emergency locator mobile applications, he said, but none use a single touchscreen button or are sold as widely.\nTaiwan's last major earthquake killed about 2,400 people and injured 11,300 in 1999. Almost two years ago a typhoon on the island triggered mudslides that killed hundreds, with search and rescue work set back partly because authorities did not know where the victims were.\nThe new mobile application can also work during abductions or other situations that are impossible to escape without help.\nLiang said it was too early to tell how many people had downloaded it so far."}
{"idx": "12488", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Vindicator Editorial: August 9, 2018 at 12:00a.m.\nMaine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap had an observation about the unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud that Republican President Donald J. Trump and other purveyors of such fakery should take to heart \u2013 but won\u2019t.\nSo said Dunlap, a Democrat, in a letter last week to the now-disbanded voting integrity commission launched in May 2017 by the Trump administration.\nThe letter was sent to Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, both Republicans who led the panel. It was prompted by an analysis of administration documents that provided no evidence to support the claims that have become political red meat for Trump\u2019s supporters.\nIt is instructive that the commission was disbanded in January with little fanfare, unlike its launch last year when Trump went on a tear about the millions of people who voted illegally in the 2016 election.\nTrump\u2019s denigration of the electoral process has everything to do with his bruised ego and nothing to do with the facts.\nWhile the Republican nominee for president won the Electoral College vote and thus the 2016 election, his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton received 2.8 million more votes overall.\nThe president has refused to accept that result, saying that illegally cast votes gave Clinton the edge.\nYet, his commission, which only met twice, went out of business without issuing a report. In other words, Pence, Kobach and other members could not come up with the evidence to support the president\u2019s claims.\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped him from continuing to cast doubt about the integrity of elections in this country. Such a blanket indictment of the process has resulted in Republican and Democratic secretaries of state stoutly defending themselves and their states, and rejecting Trump\u2019s broadsides.\nIn April, the president was in West Virginia for what was billed as a roundtable discussion about taxes when he went off script and repeated a claim about voter fraud.\nLegitimate, independent organizations that monitor elections in this country have all challenged Trump\u2019s assertions, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him.\nHe has correctly concluded his supporters don\u2019t want to be confused by the facts. They want to believe Trump not only won the Electoral College vote, but also was favored by a majority of Americans who cast ballots in 2016. Like their idol, they cannot fathom the idea that Clinton won the popularity contest.\nThe Brennan Center for Justice at New York University also has weighed in on Trump\u2019s go-to issue when he\u2019s trying to fire up his base.\nThere is very real concern that Americans\u2019 trust in the electoral system is further diminished every time Trump makes some ridiculous comment about what\u2019s taking place in the voting booth.\nBut Kobach, the vice chairman of Trump\u2019s voter-fraud commission and a candidate for governor of Kansas, remains firm in his contention that a problem does exist.\n\u201cFor some people, no mater how many cases of voter fraud you show them, there will never be enough for them to admit there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line: Voter fraud isn\u2019t the major problem Trump and his allies claim it is. They must know that their constant attacks serve to further undermine people\u2019s trust in the electoral system.\nAugust 3, 2018 6:45 p.m."}

She said Mr. Luna was not the person who could discuss the work of the task force.\nEfforts to reach Mr. Luna directly at work and at home were unsuccessful.\nMs. Aspey added later that the task force is an internal group consisting of department heads at the agency who oversee vocational and adult education, special education, and elementary and secondary education, and members of their staffs.\nMs. Kusler said that not all has been lost on the advocacy front simply because the rural task force has appeared inactive. Education Department officials have helped preserve some federal funding for rural schools during the past four years, she said.\nMr. Mooneyham is hopeful that the new secretary of education, Margaret Spellings, will give rural education a fresh look.

All such reports go through very careful analysis (and usually several different drafts) by experienced human rights officers and lawyers in the field and in Geneva before the final version is reviewed by the High Commissioner and published. There is careful methodology involved regarding credibility and strength of evidence, and if a particular element does not pass certain thresholds, then it is not included, however interesting or dramatic it may appear to be.\nThe information contained in the final version was the information which the various field and HQ reviewers felt was sufficiently well-supported to include at this point in time. This is the reason for the changes you highlight: the original versions of events were checked, and the information gathered during that cross-checking process was insufficiently solid for some of the original material to remain in the final draft, or a detail here and there was found to be factually incorrect and had to be amended. Once again, I stress this is normal practice. It does not of course mean more supporting evidence that may subsequently emerge will be ignored. It is our hope that if there is a second, fuller, more thorough investigation it would revisit all these elements -- and others involving major violations -- to see if more supporting evidence, one way or the other, can be found.\nWhile I understand it is tempting to imagine some conspiracy lies behind the changes, it is important to understand the meticulous fact-checking processes UN human rights reports go through before they are published. Secondly, given that the report -- preliminary though it is -- still concludes that the violations described in it \u201ccould amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes\u201d (i.e. two of the most serious crimes known to man), the repeated claims in your articles that it has been \"watered down,\" \"air-brushed\" and contains a \"systematic underplaying of abuses by Sudan\" seems a bit strange: a classic case on your part, perhaps, of not seeing the wood for the trees?\nremoval of draft paras 53-54: After fact-checking, we did not feel we could substantiate the allegations in these two paragraphs. This does not necessarily mean they were not true -- just that we did not have sufficiently solid evidence to include them at the time we finalized the report.\nI would like to point out that previous human rights reports produced jointly by the High Commissioner and the human rights sections of peace-keeping missions have not shied away from criticizing the actions of peace-keepers if the facts warranted such criticism (the report on Abyei is one example, and there have been several examples from DRC). There is absolutely no reason why we would hold back in this particular case, when we haven't in others.\nI would like to stress once again that the High Commissioner clearly stated that this report is preliminary, rather than exhaustive, and as a result she called for a further more thorough investigation to be conducted into the events that have been taking place in Southern Kordofan. This was a point she made during her briefing of the Security Council, as well as publicly at the time the report was released.\nI hope this lengthy explanation answers some of your concerns."}

Note: It's entirely possible that this oversized Darth Vader helmet will be the \"it\" thing for Spring 2013, but in my professional opinion, I think this is a trend to pass on.

We all probably have or have had items in our wardrobe that we never wear and wonder, \"why did we buy that?\" Well, that has happened to me a lot over the years.\nIn the past few years, I've donated to Goodwill boxes and boxes of printed t-shirts, embarassingly patterned dress shirts, cheap, ugly ties and pants that were way too baggy for my body type. When I became more informed about the environmental impact of consumerism, I began analyzing these bad habits to understand my purchasing mistakes.

Illawarra\u2019s hopes of making the post-season went up in flames in a heartbreaking 98-87 overtime loss to the Brisbane Bullets on Thursday night. Despite leading down the stretch and having three chances to ice the game in normal time, the Hawks were gunned down by the hosts in the added period. Import guard Jordair Jett missed a pair of crucial free throws with 30 seconds remaining before Todd Blanchfield spurned his effort from inside the key in the final seconds. The Hawks retained possession after Blanchfield\u2019s miss, but an errant inbounds pass from AJ Ogilvy denied them any chance of taking another shot.

A TV was a TV and the lack of truly high speed internet meant that loading up anything more than a short news clip was a struggle, and to even do that you\u2019d likely have to power up a computer and wait for it to finish updating.\nIn short, the world of media was simpler then.\nIn the media world, we talk in acronyms of emerging platforms - of SVoD, BVoD and AFVoD; of blockchain, programmatic and addressable media - and the new opportunities these delivery mechanisms offer for marketing.\nIn investigating this idea, I decided to go through the TouchPoints data from the perspective of a consumer to look at video, audio and text consumption from their perspective. I grouped all the available media in 2006 and 2018 that fit into these three categories, immaterial of how they were delivered, and I analysed the data to look at the reach on an average day from the TouchPoints Diary.\nMy expectation was that I would end up with two charts that bore no resemblance to each other. The reality was quite different.\nText and audio based media still peak around breakfast time and video builds across the day to deliver that large peak in the evening.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cHang on a minute, that\u2019s not what I\u2019ve been told! The media world is in turmoil, surely consumers are literally spinning in their connected worlds, frantically swiping left and right in search of an ever elusive content fix.\"\nIn the 12 years between the launch of TouchPoints and its most recent release, yes the delivery mechanisms of content have changed dramatically. However, when it comes to the media need states of today\u2019s consumer, not much has changed at all.\nOf course, this thinking itself isn\u2019t even new. In reality we\u2019ve know these things all along. What makes the point suddenly more striking is the fact that industry standard nationally representative data from TouchPoints provides real data to bear these assumptions out. It's data which provides gold-standard justification for pre-existing assumptions.\nIn 2017, the IPA and ISBA joined forces to launch 'A Matter of Fact', an initiative to re-inforce the need for accountable media data whereby all interested parties on the buy and sell sides support 5 key principles.\nThe key point was to support the gold-standard Joint Industry Currency (JIC) model for audience data, and to hold proprietary datasets to the same level of accountability that the JICs are subject to. The underlying goal was to re-inforce trusted relationships between clients, agencies, media owners and, ultimately the person at the heart of all of this, the consumer.\nAs Eric Schmidt of Google said, \u201cin a networked world"}

But the fossil record shows that there was no instant leap to humanity: rather our species\u2019 physical hallmarks appeared gradually over the past several million years. \u201cHumans did not suddenly come into existence, but we share features with many other [species],\u201d John G. Fleagle, an anatomist at Stony Brook University, has said. Fingernails evolved 54 million years ago (mya) and the opposable thumb 25 mya, for instance. The pelvis shape needed for walking upright as well as the knee appeared more than 3.5 mya, and the foot arch arose around 1.8 mya. Although skull construction was set around 35 mya, brains only ballooned in size between 2 and 1 mya, and the chin dates from around 200,000 years ago. With apologies to Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet: what a patchwork is a man.\nOne feature that visibly separates us from most other mammals is our lack of fur. As Nina G. Jablonski explains in our cover story, \u201cThe Naked Truth,\u201d the transition of hirsute to hairless helped to set the stage for the emergence of large brains and symbolic thought. The appearance of bare skin was one of a suite of adaptations that allowed our ancestors to thrive on the savanna as grasslands expanded in Africa starting about three million years ago.\nOur forebears abandoned their easier foraging habits, traveling longer distances through a tropical landscape to acquire sufficient food to survive. Adding meat to their diets meant more calories, but finding prey also took more work. Their activity level increased and with it their need to dissipate body heat to avoid tissue damage. By 1.6 mya, protohumans had long legs for sustained walking and running. Along with that trait came naked skin and a large number of eccrine sweat glands, which produce moisture that removes body heat through evaporative cooling. The hairs on our head also help to combat overheating, by shielding our big brain from direct sun.\nAlthough the board of editors didn\u2019t plan it this way, many of the other feature articles in this issue also examine changes over time. The connection is most direct in \u201cThe Art of Bacterial Warfare,\u201d by B. Brett Finlay, which describes the ancient battle between infectious agents and their human hosts. But other articles also describe \u201cevolution\u201d in various areas.\nWhereas Finlay\u2019s article focuses on inner space, for instance, \u201cCloudy with a Chance of Stars,\u201d by Erick T. Young, looks at outer: how stars arise and change over time, a seemingly simple question that has long puzzled astronomers. \u201cThe Prolific Afterlife of Whales,\u201d by Crispin T. S. Little, explores how sunken whale carcasses today\u2014and dinosaurs millions of years ago\u2014support a series of ecosystem oases on the seafloor. Even \u201cBetter Mileage Now,\u201d by Ben Knight, looks at how internal-combustion engines are changing, creating improved performance. By explaining such advances, Scientific American strives to fulfill its mission of demystifying a changing world."}

Organic food, weird jams, and a sense of community have drawn shoppers nationwide for years. But a new study says the markets don't really fulfill their reputation of promoting a healthy diet\u2014and definitely don't save people money, Pacific Standard reports. \"There seems to be much enthusiasm for using farmers markets\" to improve food quality in areas where healthy food is lacking, a team of researchers writes in the journal Appetite. \"It is hard for us to share this enthusiasm.\" Their study of 26 farmers markets and 44 stores in Bronx County, NY, found that the markets offered 26.4 fewer items of fresh produce on average, fewer commonly-purchased foods, and more expensive items overall, even among regular produce.\nPretty much a crappy article... and here's why... 1) Nowhere does it mention that one of the main differences between organic and conventional food is pesticides, gmo's, antibiotics, growth hormones and dyes. 2) Yes... the food may cost more...You are supporting your local economy and local farmer. You know who is growing your food and can talk to your farmer about their cultivation practices. 3) There's crap where ever you go. Some farmer's Markets are better than others. You can always find \"organic\" junk/processed food anywhere. 3) By supporting your local farmer you are a FOOD ACTIVIST. You are directly taking yourself out of the gmo/big agra loop if you choose. 4) You have reduced your carbon foot print. Most farmers markets don't allow resellers and generally the produce/meat/dairy/baked goods/body goods has to be produced within a 100 miles. 5) Tennessee has the largest proliferation of farmers markets in the country. 6) Freshness and quality. We have several markets where the artisans are stellar. No comarision to conventional crap in the store. Where's the study? Let's see where the info is coming from.\nI would say that it really depends on where you live. In the greater Seattle area, there are MANY Farmer's Markets...usually each neighborhood has one...and the produce you get from them is FAR superior to the imported junk the supermarkets carry! I don't shop at them nearly enough...but when I do, I am always rewarded by FRESH produce that tastes FAR better than the container ship delivered crud you find at Safeway!\nHonestly, this is anecdotal at best. I do most of my shopping at our local Farmers market and the prices are lower. I pay 2.99 for a head of Romaine lettuce at Publix or get a bigger, fresher one at the Market for 1.49. There is a bigger variety of produce (especially fruits) than the big chain grocers. It really depends on where you live. To be more accurate the study should have a broader scope of areas."}

In 1938 and 1944, Flood Control Acts were passed which led to a lengthy study of nine sites on the Des Moines River. Two of the sites studied were chosen for the construction of dams: Red Rock and Saylorville.\nConstruction of the Red Rock Dam began in 1960, and the dam was finished in 1969. The primary purpose of the dam is to reduce flood damage along the Des Moines River below the dam, as well as along the Mississippi River further downstream.\nThe Red Rock project cost a total of 88 million dollars. This amount was divided three ways. Approximately one-third was spent to purchase land around the site. Another third was spent to relocate 96 miles of the Wabash Railroad, 42 miles of highway, 2 miles of gas lines, 225 miles of electric lines, and 8 cemeteries. The final third was used to construct Red Rock Dam. The project was costly to build but has paid for itself many times over. By protecting property, lives, and crops, an estimated 449 million dollars had been saved during 1969 to 1999.\nThe Des Moines River Basin begins in Minnesota and extends through Iowa to the Mississippi River. The runoff from over 12,000 square miles of land drains from this basin into the Des Moines River above Lake Red Rock. The Des Moines River joins the Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa.\nSaylorville Dam and Red Rock Dam work together to provide flood control on the Des Moines River and Mississippi River.\nWhile the earthen segments make up most of the dam, the control structure is where the action is. Each part of the structure has a specific and important function.\nThe \"Stilling Basin\" functions to still the river water as it flows out of the dam. Slowing the water decreases bank erosion. To slow the water, large concrete blocks called \"baffles\" were placed in the basin. There are 25 baffles, each the size of a passenger van, lined up in two rows in the basin.\nThe \"Sluice Gates,\" located inside the control structure, empty into the stilling basin. There are 14 hydraulically- operated sluice gates. Each is five feet wide and nine feet tall. These gates are used when outflow is less than 38,000 cubic feet per second.\nUnlike some dams, Red Rock has a \"controlled\" spillway through the use of the \"Tainter Gates.\" Each gate is 41 feet wide and 45 feet tall. These high outflow gates are used only during high water conditions."}

{"idx": "12537", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: PTO can be earned or awarded, depending on the employment contract.\nThough most companies do offer vacation time to employees, there is no federal law that states that you must provide it. This means that it's up to your company to create its own vacation policy. You'll have a lot of choices to make, but you should try to offer policies that are similar to other companies in your area. An insufficient vacation policy could send your best employees looking for jobs elsewhere.\nYou'll need to establish a policy about whether you'll pay for time off or not and when you'll pay for it. Some companies offer separate \"vacation\" and \"sick\" days that employees can use throughout the year. Others offer \"paid time off,\" which applies to both sick and vacation days. Most companies will pay for a certain number of vacation days and some may even allow employees to take more days off without pay.\nIf you've decided to offer paid vacation days, you need to decide how many days you will offer employees. Typically, this works on a tenure system, with employees who have worked at the company receiving more vacation time than those who have just started. A typical vacation plan may look like two weeks the first year, three weeks after the third year and four weeks after five years.\nSome companies institute a waiting period--usually 6 to 12 months--before the employee can start to use his vacation time. For example, if you have a 1-year waiting period, the employee will technically accrue his 2 weeks vacation time during the first year, but he cannot take a vacation until his 1-year anniversary. After that, he receives the full 2 weeks and starts to accrue his vacation time every paycheck.\nConsider whether you want to allow employees to \"roll over\" their vacation time. This would allow employees to save up their vacation days in order to take a longer vacation. For example, instead of taking two 1-week vacations during the first year, an employee might decide to take a 3-week vacation halfway through her second year.\nYou should set a requirement for how much notice your employees must give before they can take a vacation. For example, you might require an employee to submit a request for vacation time at least a month in advance. Vacation time should be awarded on a first-come-first-served basis. If another employee has already requested the time off, you may have to deny the request to the second employee to ensure adequate coverage.\nYou can also set a policy regarding whether you'll \"pay out\" vacation time or whether you have a \"use it or lose it\" policy. When an employee leaves the company, for example, she may have accrued a significant amount of vacation time. You can offer to pay this out as money that she's earned.\nMcCormick, Maggie. \"Policies on Vacation Days.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/policies-vacation-days-3556.html.

The bill also would give a minimum of 12 weeks\u2019 paid leave to adoptive parents. In dual-military families, both service member parents would be able to take the 12 weeks leave under H.R. 4796.\nThe legislation, introduced by Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., aims to consolidate the military\u2019s \u201cdisparate and confusing parental leave policies into a single policy that is both consistent and equitable for all parents while also helping improve military readiness and workforce competitiveness,\u201d said a statement from Duckworth\u2019s office.\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter announced in January that the department would provide 12 weeks of maternity leave for female service members. The Pentagon has broad discretion over determining the amount of maternity leave for female service members because giving birth is considered part of convalescent leave. Before Carter\u2019s announcement, most female service members received six weeks of maternity leave (though the Navy received 18 weeks).\nDuckworth\u2019s bill goes far beyond some of Carter\u2019s other proposals. The Pentagon chief recommended increasing paternity leave for male service members from 10 to 14 days, as well as expanding leave to care for an adopted child to the second parent in dual-military marriages (there are 84,000 military-to-military marriages). Currently the department provides three weeks of paid leave to one parent to care for a new adopted child. Carter\u2019s proposal would provide two weeks of such leave to the second parent if that second parent is also in the military.\nCongress, however, has to approve any changes to paid leave outside of maternity leave.\nOther family-friendly Defense proposals that don\u2019t require legislative change include a pilot program allowing service members to freeze their eggs and sperm, preserving the option to start a family later on if they choose.\nOn the civilian side, Democratic lawmakers for nearly two decades have tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation granting that benefit to civilian federal employees to care for a new child. President Obama has endorsed the idea in his last two budgets and through an executive action, in which he directed agencies to advance federal employees up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child or ill family member. Right now, the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to most government and private sector workers for the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for seriously ill family members. Federal employees who give birth or adopt can tap their accrued sick and annual leave to avoid three months without a paycheck, but many bristle at having to use hard-earned leave when paid parental leave is becoming more prevalent in the private sector."}

In 2002-5, diverted by the war in Iraq, US imperialism took its eye off the ball and was outflanked by the leftward development of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela and by the election of the Evo Morales\u2019 MAS (Movement towards Socialism) government in Bolivia. However since 2006, the revanchist right, backed up by huge amounts of US money and political support, has been fighting hard for the overthrow of Evo Morales and Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In both countries crucial questions of left-wing strategy are posed by these developments.\nOn 8 May Evo Morales declared a referendum on the future of the government for August 10. The prefects of the country\u2019s regional departments will also have to submit themselves to a popular vote on that day. This is a make-or-break strategy in which Morales is hoping to reinforce his position as well as deal the right-wing opposition \u2013 who hold several regional prefectures \u2013 a major blow.\nBut taking the struggle onto the terrain of a referendum or bourgeois democracy in general is an extremely dangerous tactic for it is normally the strongest terrain of the right and the ruling class. It is also the one most open to manipulation by right-wing forces who control most of the means of mass communication. This was a major mistake of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua that led to their overthrow in 1992. That the referendum gambit is an uncertain one is shown by the defeat of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform on 5 December last year.\nMorales and the MAS-led government have adopted the referendum tactic because of the pressure imposed by the pro-autonomy vote in Santa Cruz, a virtual declaration of unilateral independence by this gas-rich and white-dominated province. The rightist leaders of Santa Cruz organised this illegal referendum on the back of a racist campaign against Morales and the indigenous population. Claiming \u2018they want to dominate us\u2019 the campaigners demanded the right to dispose of the Santa Cruz gas profits for their own exclusive use.\nSanta Cruz is one of several \u2018Media Luna\u2019 (half moon) states that surround the centre of the country in a semi-circle. In all of them the rightist leaders advance the demand for autonomy. If their campaign succeeds it is easy to foresee a similar demand being raised in the oil-rich Venezuelan province of Zulia as a means to attack the Bolivarian revolution.\nThe political space for the right-wing offensive has been created by the stalled transition in Bolivia. This centres on two major questions. First, the Morales government has ruled out any move towards socialist transition in favour of the creation of \u2018Andean capitalism\u2019. This means that the 2006 \u2018nationalisation\u2019 of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon resources amounted only to a renegotiation of the tax revenues of the transnational corporations that retain effective control of those resources.\nSecond, the attempt by Morales and the MAS government to effect progressive constitutional change through the constituent assembly came to nothing.

As an ode to the house's history, the upper part of the building was kept the signature light blue.\nOnce open, SABG will boast a massive 62-tap wall. Fifty-three of those taps will be devoted to beer ranging from domestics to Texas craft brews with the other nine pouring out two wines, five craft cocktails, and two nonalcoholic options.\nIn addition, the bar will offer a selection of bottled wine, packaged beer, and a full liquor setup. Frozen drinks will be available for kids, though adults can also enjoy them spiked with their favorite spirit.\nAlthough SABG will not have a dedicated kitchen, the site will be the home to several food trucks.\nThe first to sign on is Cluck-N-Burger from husband-and-wife team Aaron and Kassandra Esserman. The menu of loaded fries, wings, burgers, and sandwiches is classic pub grub with a few twists. Jalape\u00f1o poppers have a sweet/tart burst of dried cranberries, a sweet potato and rice veggie burger used Texas ch\u00e9vre, and wing flavors run the gamut from Thai buffalo to beer barbecue.\nOnce permitting and last-minute construction subsides, the beer garden will have an approximately one-month soft opening to ensure every server is well-versed on the beers.

We also get to know Jassim (played by Darius Homayoun), who\u2019s an amalgam of people Martha interviewed. It was a story that felt truthful, that felt beautiful and also ugly.

OK, tell me everything.\u201d Even in that microcosm of being there [on location] and not being in any danger, having the pretend sense of what\u2019s going on, it was intense.

I personally feel that if Bambi could do it, Nickelodeon could do it, which is why the network may have changed its mind later on, choosing to state that Chuckie's mom had died.\nHowever, fans had to wait for a later version of the series before the show would ultimately decide to go down that path, showing us Melinda Finster, who was voiced by Kim Cattrall and shown in flashbacks. After Rugrats' initial run, the animated series grew more popular in reruns and was rebooted with the same characters but a different staff.

They act as catalysts for the advancement of a nation. They record new ideas, preserve and communicate knowledge, impart education and values, and aid the overall development of an individual. The publishing industry in India is counted among the top seven publishing nations in the world. According to PwC, India has more than 9,000 publishers to serve its nearly 1.3 billion people but also imports a lot of books. The Indian publishing industry has grown and evolved over time and in 2017 was estimated to be at $6.7 billion, according to Nielsen. With the coming of the Digital age the nature of the industry has changed. The advancement in technology and Indian\u2019s skilled manpower resource makes the country a major outsourcing hub for print and pre-publishing services in the world be it print, design or editorial. The sector has tremendous potential, both in the domestic as well as the export markets. The Government allows 100 percent FDI to publishing houses across the country to make India a publishing hub, by utilizing the vast English-speaking technical manpower.\nThe prospects of the Indian academic publishing industry have never seemed brighter. India is witnessing a growing interest in the international circuits for the Indian customer base. This has resulted in several international publishing houses set up a base in this country. There are a number of opportunities for academic publishers in India as well. Over the years, demand for digital content has increased, as the students are more inclined towards digital education and they are more receptive towards animations, VR/AR and any kind of videos. Hence, the whole ecosystem has changed and now both print and digital channels co-exist and supplement each other. To add on to this, the publishers are now coming up with more technology-driven products to meet the students\u2019 needs. There are more digital innovative products in the market to enhance the learning outcomes in the fields of STEM education, Science Labs, Math lab, Language labs, Robotics, etc.\nIf you look at the numbers, India has a very low per capita book consumption. The major reasons for this were low literacy rate and disposable income and to some extent non-availability of books. Expensive books would not sell because of the first two factors. With changing times, education is becoming more and more important. Literacy is beginning to be emphasized and higher education is being sought by people who would not have considered it an asset in the past.\nThe reason for this is the growing population which leads to more competition in the job market. In the past, people could find jobs paying a decent wage after passing class 8. As the competition grew, completing schooling became necessary. In today\u2019s job market, even a graduate degree is no guarantee of obtaining a job. Technical or professional training might ensure you a job but not always. This is resulting in people going for more specialized education and hence, more demand for books.\nDue to its massive population, numbers get amplified in this country. Even with a small percentage of people that are buying academic books, we are still quite a huge market. A market that is by no means saturated. As the need for academic books grows, the academic publishing industry is going to see a massive rise in demand. It is the anticipation of this demand that is bringing foreign publishers to our shores. However, Indian academic publishers might find themselves better prepared for it considering that they already know the ins and outs of this industry.\nThe new Companies Act 2013 has brought a new opportunity in the field of research and Companies earning over a certain amount now need to put in a percentage of their profits into social responsibility projects."}

Parents don\u2019t feel safe after the Florida school shooting which took place February 14 a day of love and kindness which sadly turned out wrong for the 17 injured and deaths.\nWhen will the next mass shooting occur? Are our schools really safe, or are they not? All questions which the parents from the victims ask themselves and their community. Top charts of death and injuries in 2017 from mass shootings in public and school places range up to 2,239 people, leaving 437 people dead. Columbine High school, Sandy Hook, Virginia tech, these are names of the past major school shootings. But what has the government and N.R.A done to reduce or prevent the number of shootings?\nAccording to CNN Politics: Donald Trump has addressed the nation and said \u201cOur entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families. To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you \u2014 whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain. We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\nYet is this the solution to the rising of mass shootings. Although Trumps remarks were very apologetic, one thing true, was the fact that \u201cEach person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them \u2014 a life filled with wondrous beauty and unlimited potential and promise. Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give, and talents to share with the world. And each one had a family to whom they meant everything in the world.\u201d The last worry a parent should have to consider is \u201cwill my child be back from school.\nRegarding to the NY Post the House Speaker Paul Ryan stated that in the wake of the shooting in Florida, Congress will consider to make it harder for people with mental illness, mental issues and mental disabilities to obtain permission to a gun. In the other hand Florida senator Marco Rubio stated that Evil is Evil, and kept on restating the fact that no matter what, evil is everywhere and that stricter regulations on the acquisition of weaponry would not have done much to prevent the shooting.\nFebruary 14, was by far the deadliest school shooting in the U.S since the beginning of 2018. Nikolas Cruz charged with 17 counts of murder; 14 students and 3 school staff. Trump\u2019s response to America, and children who fear for their safety addressed that \u201cI want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you.\nThe fact that there have been many school shootings does not mean that we are vulnerable to these anytime. It is the fact that you never know when somebody might just lose it all in a quick moment and lead many innocent people to their death. It is amatter of time, it is just indeed a matter of how long a person can hold in his/her anger and let it out calmly or get triggered and lose it all in one quick moment.\nMy gun has never killed someone. It is well behaved, and is knowledgeable about when it ought to shoot. It keeps itself hidden, and is impervious to anger. At Stoneman Douglas School, several sheriff\u2019s guns went and hid when confronted with a criminal gun. My gun won\u2019t hide like those sheriff\u2019s guns did \u2014 or if it does, it will hide just long enough to get the advantage on the criminal gun, and then it will do what it needs to do to defend me"}
{"idx": "12571", "prompt": "Continue the following text: \u201cOut Of Scythe\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily more guilty of this of-the-moment storytelling than other episodes, and normally I try not to focus too much on the reboot context of this show. Since the pilot, it has been clear that Charmed 2018 is its own entity entirely, borrowing some of the mythology and broad magical strokes of the original series but otherwise shaking most things up, from the age of the central sisters to their powers to the longer, serialized arcs the show is built around. That said, for Charmed 2018 to really work, it should feel more current than it sometimes does.\nI don\u2019t mean current in the sense of its pop culture references and use of technology. There\u2019s something slightly outdated about Charmed\u2019s aesthetics and sensibilities, which isn\u2019t even necessarily a wholly bad thing. Throwback camp elements on the show have proven to be fun and stylish in its own specific way. But that camp works best when there\u2019s more underneath it, when Charmed taps into something deeper about its approach to character development and emotional storytelling. There are times I wish this show had the budget to give it a look more like Riverdale or Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina. But if it isn\u2019t going to deliver on a stylization front, then the low-budget effects would be easier to swallow if it consistently fired on all cylinders when it comes to the writing.\nAnd that just isn\u2019t happening, especially in an episode of \u201cOut Of Scythe\u201d which dabbles in several genre conventions without ever really saying much or delving into something more meaningful. Tropes can be enjoyed when they\u2019re employed well, and Charmed has shown shades of depth before, especially when it really locks in on the relationship dynamics of the show and the way that sisters\u2019 magic has real, human stakes and consequences. But it\u2019s still falling into lazy genre traps, as with the moment when Maggie accidentally reads Parker\u2019s mind and learns that he\u2019s hiding some deep, dark secret. But wouldn\u2019t his thoughts include the actual secret itself and not just the thought \u201cI can\u2019t tell her the truth\u201d?\nThere are essentially two sides to Charmed\u2019s storytelling: the sisters\u2019 demonic issues, and their real-life ones. Charmed might technically balance those worlds, but it doesn\u2019t blend them, and that makes the show feel, at times, disjointed. \u201cOut Of Scythe\u201d is one of those episodes that is especially fractured. It tries to take on the magical issue of the scythe, a key that opens the gates of a demon prison called Tartarus that has been split into three pieces and bestowed upon generational sentinels for protection for many years. Macy, it turns out, triggered an evil plot to piece the scythe back together when she came across the key that the psychic led her to last episode. But \u201cOut Of Scythe\u201d also takes on the human issues of Maggie\u2019s struggle with whether or not to continue college and her burgeoning romance with Parker, Macy\u2019s work issues (her new boss at the lab gives her a leadership position but with the caveat that she fire Galvin), and Mel\u2019s unemployment/procrastination on her grad school thesis.\nTechnically, there are little threads that connect those two sides of the narrative, but there\u2019s only one that\u2019s truly compelling. As it turns out, Parker is the half-demon son of the season\u2019s Big Bad. He\u2019s the shadow demon who Maggie detects some humanity in, and it appears that there\u2019s a lot of pressure"}

Chris Christie today announced major upgrades to that seawall \u2014 a symbol of the weak links in New Jersey's storm preparedness \u2014 that state and local officials hope will give residents peace of mind while delivering on the governor's pledge to build a continuous barrier along the entire Atlantic Coast of the Jersey Shore.\nThe Monmouth County borough \u2014 one of the most heavily hit by Sandy \u2014 will receive $8.5 million to repair and expand the seawall to protect against future storms.\nStill, Christie noted today\u2019s announcement was only one part of New Jersey\u2019s ongoing effort to rebuild. With the second summer since Sandy struck about to fade, he stressed the state has more steps to take to prepare for similar events and protect its $40 billion tourism industry \u2014 even if a storm with Sandy\u2019s power never again ravages the shoreline.\n\u201cWe know that rebuilding the state is the most important challenge we have, and it\u2019s a challenge that continues,\u201d Christie said at a news conference in the parking lot Sea Bright\u2019s municipal hall, which had been flooded in Sandy\u2019s wake.\nChristie touted that the Shore is in the midst of a successful summer 22 months after Sandy.

And that\u2019s on top of the fact that New Hampshire already has the costliest health insurance in the country. Read on for more details.\nObamacare cuts Medicare by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022 in order to pay for part of the law\u2019s $1.9 trillion in new health-care spending for younger people over the same time frame. My co-blogger Robert Book and Michael Ramlet have published a paper for the University of Minnesota showing that New Hampshire\u2019s share of those Medicare cuts is $2.2 billion. This year, New Hampshire has 231,444 Medicare enrollees, which means that these cuts amount to $9,488 for every senior in the state.\nRobert Book published another paper, this time with former White House budget official James Capretta, detailing Obamacare\u2019s cuts to Medicare Advantage on a state-by-state basis. Robert and Jim found that, in 2017, Obamacare will cut $3,367 in Medicare Advantage services for every Granite Stater enrolled in the program: a 26 percent cut.\nLast month, the Physicians Foundation published one of the largest physician surveys ever conducted in the United States, with 13,575 respondents. They asked physicians a broad range of questions, including several about their views on Obamacare. 41 percent of New Hampshire physicians said that the Affordable Care Act made them \u201cless positive about the direction and future of healthcare in America.\u201d Only 24 percent said it made them feel more positive.\nIf Medicare fees decrease by ten percent or more\u2014as the Affordable Care Act will require\u201425 percent of doctors in New Hampshire say that they will place \u201cnew or additional limits\u201d on accepting Medicare patients. 20 percent say they\u2019ll stop accepting Medicare patients altogether.\nThe survey also has bad news for New Hampshirites on other forms of insurance. 16 percent of New Hampshire physicians say that they\u2019ll place new or additional limits on Medicaid patients as a result of the Medicare cuts; 20 percent also say they plan to raise fees on those with private insurance in order to compensate for the cuts.\nOne of the most under-appreciated aspects of Obamacare is the degree to which the law drives up the cost of health insurance, especially for people who buy it on their own. While there are no published estimates for how Obamacare will affect non-group premiums in New Hampshire, we do have estimates from a number of analysts\u2014including those from a key adviser to President Obama\u2014for other states. And this matters for New Hampshire, which already has the highest premiums in the country.\nObama adviser Jonathan Gruber has estimated that, by 2016, the cost of individual-market health insurance under Obamacare, relative to what it would have been under prior law, will increase by an average of 19 percent in Colorado, 29 percent in"}

According to his report, Irani Jews fear that restrictions against them would be initiated if a new government with predominant religious influence were to come to power.\nWhen Shiite Moslem Ayatullah Shariatmadri was interviewed by foreign correspondents recently, the visitor said, this influential leader expressed the view that Jews had traditionally enjoyed the protection of the Moslem state, and they would continue to do so under a religion-oriented government. Shariatmadri added, however, a proviso to the effect that this would only be the case as long as the Jewish community in Iran agreed not to support Zionism or the State of Israel.\nUnder the aegis of the Shah, the visitor explained, the Jewish community and other minorities have enjoyed human rights, religious freedom and prosperity. Minorities are recognized and represented in the Irani Majlis, or Parliament, with the Jewish community served by their elected representative, Yosef Cohan.\nAccording to the Shiite religious edicts, however, Jews and other non-Moslems are adversely regarded. For many such devout Moslems, it has not been customary to have contacts with the Jewish community. There were instances of anti-Jewish literature being distributed in bazaars during the latest upheavals, the visitor said, but these supposedly originated from individual Moslem leaders and the Moslem religious leadership publicly disassociated itself from them.\nThere are approximately 80,000 Jews now living in Iran, with the majority in Teheran and also large clusters in the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan. Under the Shah, Irani Jews have become relatively affluent, enjoyed complete freedom to enter professions, and established industries and businesses, with the encouragement of the government, the visitor said.\nThe Jewish community in Iran is composed of three separate groups, he explained. The majority are members of the Irani Jewish community which is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, Jewish communities in the diaspora. There has been such a community in parts of Iran ever since the destruction of the first Temple.\nA second group, an offspring of the first, is called the Mashedi community, originating in Mashed, one of the cities holy to the Shiite faith. These Jews were forced to embrace Islam about 150 years ago, but kept Judaism secretly alive and returned to open practice when conditions permitted. Because of its unique history, the visitor said, this group of 3000 families generally keeps to itself. They are primarily occupied with carpet dealing, and now have communities outside of Iran, in Israel, Milan, Italy and elsewhere.\nIraqi Jews who came to Iran as recently as the 1930s and 1940s comprise another small group. They are usually merchants and their traditions differ slightly from those of the other communities.\nUntil the turn of the century, Jews in Iran, as in many Moslem countries, lived in special quarters, or ghettos. Since the time of the father of the current Shah, they have been allowed to live in all parts of Teheran and other cities. The Jewish community has a representative body called Anjumman Kalimian, which is elected periodically by members of the community. All matters of communal life, welfare and education are administered by this Jewish committee, the visitor said. At present, there are about 80,000 Irani Jews living in Israel."}

We're trying to get a look at these kids to see who's going to fill the spots of the kids we graduated last year.\"\nOne question that seems to be answered is at quarterback. Junior Michael Radford (6-foot-2, 175 pounds) will start this year after the graduation of two-year starter Morgan Roberts, now at Clemson.\nRoberts was a dual-threat last year, rushing for 706 yards and 14 touchdowns and passing for 1,968 yards and 22 touchdowns.\nRadford also proved at times last year that he can tuck the ball and run, getting 19 carries for 62 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"Mike Radford's a great athlete. He's got a strong arm, he just needs experience, and missing that scrimmage is going to hurt,\" said Witman.\nThree players are competing to replace running back Thomas Passenant, who rushed for 1,021 yards and 14 touchdowns. Seniors Tyler Byrd (5-foot-10, 170) and Will Roberts (5-foot-10, 165) were the backups last year, and sophomore Michael Shields (5-foot-11, 175) also saw time in the backfield.\nThe lone returning starter at wide receiver is senior Bryan Erb. He, with juniors Jimmy Kleitches, Royce Turnbull and Tripp Mulligan, will try to make up for the graduation of all-state wide-out Wake Hamilton and receivers Lee Harrison and Brandon Santiago.\nWith the seniors gone, Witman isn't sure this year's offense will have the same explosiveness and quickness.\n\"We don't have the team speed we had last year, so that's a little bit of a concern because I don't see that changing a whole lot,\" he said.\nThe line is the most experienced part of the offense, with three returning starters, but it lost an important piece in all-state right guard Ward Showalter. Senior tackles Brian Duncan (6-foot-5, 225) and Marcel Souffrant (6-foot-2, 230) return with senior guard James Howe.\nMany of those names will be on the defensive line this year, led by Howe (6-foot-1, 220 pounds) returning as an all-state defensive end. Duncan will fill the other end spot, and senior Martin Comer (5-foot-8, 195) will play tackle.\nThe only returning linebacker for the Bucs is junior Robert Engel (5-foot-7, 170), who will be joined by juniors Jack Hamrick and Pete Showalter. The secondary is more experienced, with Erb and Mulligan playing safety and senior Mac Clark and junior Scott Phillips at corner.\nAfter winning the school's first football championship since 2004, Witman knows there's pressure to repeat.\n\"There's high expectations, like there should be,\" he said. \"I think the kids realize that there's a lot of pressure on them to perform this year.

Her beseeching face will point upward toward the ceiling, as if she were rising from the depths toward the surface of the sea. Long paper ribbons will cascade beneath her like tentacles, stretching downward all the way to the white columns that support the mezzanine. It will be a splendid display by one of the world\u2019s most famous artists \u2014 if all goes as planned, that is.\nBrooklyn-based Caledonia Curry, better known by her pseudonym Swoon, says that art-world acclaim is awesome, but it can also be stressful. While the gap between conceiving a grand-scale artistic idea and having all the funding, facilities and helpers she needs to make it a reality has never been narrower, having to juggle the constant art-producing pressure can be taxing.\nIt was in late summer 2010 that NOMA curator Miranda Lash invited Curry to use the museum as the site for a future artwork, giving her an impromptu after-hours tour of the atrium roof. Curry eagerly accepted.\nBut now it\u2019s June 2011, just eight days before the opening reception, and Curry\u2019s running a little behind schedule. Thalassa \u2014 that\u2019s the name of the goddess \u2014 is 13 feet tall, and that\u2019s just her torso. She\u2019s the largest linoleum-block print Curry has ever made. So large, in fact, that Curry had to bend the huge sheet of linoleum to fit it inside her New York studio, where she hand-carved the image, a process that took days longer than she predicted. The Thalassa print is pasted to a stiff plywood cutout that will be suspended by chain from the NOMA ceiling.\nIn a nondescript Crescent City warehouse, Curry demonstrated the sort of sliding dance move she used as she pressed huge sheets of paper onto the inked linoleum with her feet to produce Thalassa. She learned the foot-as-printing-press technique by accidentally stepping on prints during the inking process in her cluttered studio, she said. Big paper prints are Swoon\u2019s stock and trade, but they\u2019re not the sort of tame art reproductions so often found framed on apartment walls. Swoon, 33, gained international fame as a graffiti guerrilla, aggressively applying her artwork to public places with \u2014 or without \u2014 the property owner\u2019s permission.\nBut Swoon\u2019s style has always been a bit gentler than most taggers. Curry\u2019s lacy paper prints, often perforated with hundreds of shaped holes and affixed to public walls with old-fashioned wheat paste, aren\u2019t permanent like spray paint. In time, they peel away.

By moving security protection to the network level, Box products protect all the devices on the network, including fridges, game consoles, and security cameras.\nWith V2, the Bitdefender Box gets a makeover; the slim, white Apple TV-esque box has been swapped for a tall and conical gadget reminiscent of the Asus Google OnHub router, but with panels of clean, white plastic accented with black strips. A blue LED beneath one of the plastic panels displays the status, similar to the color-changing effect on the Google Home.\nThe original Bitdefender Box includes the company's malware protection, which PCMag has reviewed favorably in the past. A URL blacklist also protects against malicious websites, and a vulnerability assessment can ferret out poorly configured devices on your network. The original Box also has device management tools, letting you see all the devices on your network and set policies for them. A unique feature of Box is Private Line, a VPN-like service that allows users to connect to their network remotely.\nThe new Box V2 includes all of these features, plus an enhanced assessment tool that scans for weak or default passwords and other vulnerabilities hackers could exploit. The new Box also leverages heuristic data gathered by Bitdefender about what safe and normal network traffic looks like. Should it detect anything untoward\u2014exploits, brute-force attacks, port scanning\u2014the Box blocks access.\nBox V2 can also monitor where you enter personal information\u2014such as address, Social Security number, etc.\u2014and prevent you from accidentally submitting that data on fraudulent or insecure websites.\nBox V2 will have far more capable hardware than the original under the hood. Bitdefender says the new device will sport a dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor and 1GB of DDR3 memory as well as 4GB of eMMC/NAND storage. The beefier hardware is designed to run more activities locally, from the Box V.2 itself.\nWhen Bitdefender unveiled the first Box unit, the company made it clear that it was meant to function in tandem with, not replace, users' home routers. Bitdefender says this is still the case, but the Box V2 has improved wireless hardware. The device supports Dual Concurrent 2.4GHz and 5GHz, 802.11n MIMO 2x2 + 802.11ac MIMO 33 AC1300. There are also two 10/100/1000 BaseT Ethernet ports on the device.\nThe Box Version 2 is expected to retail in the sub-$200 range, and will go on sale later this year with pre-orders beginning in summer 2017. Bitdefender says it will likely keep both devices on the market to provide different price points. Either device comes with a free year of security coverage from Bitdefender, which will cost consumers $99 a year afterwards.\nBoth Box devices are now part of Bitdefender Total Security and provide consumers with unlimited licenses"}

{"idx": "12604", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A form of immunotherapy gaining ground as a way to treat childhood food allergies has shown promise in treating another rising scourge of children and young adults: Type 1 diabetes.\nIn a small but rigorous clinical trial, British investigators gave patients recently diagnosed with the metabolic disorder a truncated version of the chemical that gives rise to insulin.\nAfter a quarter-century of failed efforts to treat diabetes with an immune therapy, the experimental treatment appeared to quell the immune system's assaults on the body's insulin-production machinery. The authors of the new study call their experimental treatment \"an appealing strategy for prevention,\" both in the earliest stages of Type-1 diabetes and in children who are at high genetic risk of developing the disease.\nOver the trial's 12-month duration, eight newly diagnosed diabetic subjects who got a placebo treatment required steadily increasing insulin doses to maintain glycemic control. As their immune systems progressively destroyed the pancreatic cells that normally produce the essential hormone, their daily insulin use grew on average 50%.\nThe 19 subjects who got the experimental immunotherapy, however, continued to produce their own insulin. Among the subjects who got the experimental immunotherapy, the need for added shots of the hormone did not escalate in the year following their diagnosis.\nThe different metabolic trajectories of subjects in the trial's control group and its active arm were evident at three months \u2014 the earliest point at which a surrogate marker for insulin production was measured.\nThe report of the early-stage clinical trial, published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine, offers some preliminary reassurance that immunotherapy could be used safely in this growing population.\nResearchers have been wary of pursuing the strategy in diabetes, worried that it could accelerate or strengthen the immune system's attack on insulin-producing pancreatic cells, or cause dangerous allergic reactions. In the current study, injections of an immunotherapeutic agent caused no detectable worrisome response -- not even redness or swelling at the site of injection \u2014 prompting the authors to declare its safety profile \"very favorable.\"\nRecent years have seen progress in the bid to develop chemical mimics of allergens that train and reassure the defenders of the immune system rather than inflame and encourage them. The approach, called antigen-specific immunotherapy, has seen growing success in the treatment of allergies to common foods, such as peanuts, eggs and soy.\nSimilar to food allergies, Type-1 diabetes is an immune disorder \u2014 a disease in which the immune system misidentifies a harmless or even necessary agent (whether ingested peanuts or insulin-making cells in the pancreas) as a threat. The immune system's assault not only can cause discomfort and danger in the form of itching, swelling or anaphylactic shock. In diabetes, it destroys a function that's essential to the body's ability to extract fuel from food and to keep freely circulating blood sugar from damaging organs and blood vessels.\nJust as lab-produced chemical snippets of peanuts accustom an overactive immune system to the eventual introduction of real peanuts, the researchers hoped that the chemical flag they devised would teach the immune systems of newly diagnosed diabetics to recognize insulin and call off their attack on its source.\nBy using just a piece of the antigen that typically causes the immune reaction, the approach of such \"peptide immunotherapy\" aims to inure the immune system to the object of attack while avoiding a full-on allergic response.\nAt Card"}

It seems a shame that he only enters the headlines when people rip him off. Johns was in court this week to give evidence against a Queens, New York foundry owner, Brian Ramnarine, who has now pleaded guilty to faking one of the artist's works. It was a bronze version of one of the most iconic of all American paintings: Flag. Johns had made four bronze copies of Flag in 1960 at Ramnarine's foundry. Although Ramnarine did not have permission to keep the original mould or create more sculptures from it, he made one more and tried to sell it for $11m (\u00a36.6m).\nPictures of Jasper Johns outside the courthouse revealed his age. He is the last survivor of a great triumvirate. In the 1950s he, Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly revolutionised art. They are the Cubists of contemporary art \u2013 by which I mean profound pioneers who opened the way for everything since \u2013 and yet whose originality has never quite been equalled. Now Twombly and Rauschenberg are gone.\nWith one court case behind him, Johns faces another when his long-time assistant goes on trial for selling his works behind his back.\nIn the end, these stories are just tittle tattle. The only interesting thing about the Flag trial was a moving photograph, produced in court, of Johns presenting one of the four bronze versions he made to John F Kennedy.\nWhy did he make those bronze flags? For money? And is it OK to scam a modern artist because modern art is a money-making scam anyway? No, for Flag is great art.\nThe original painting, also called Flag, is not exactly conventional. It is an object, with a waxy solidity as much sculptural as painterly.\nJohns made this first Flag in 1954 to 55. When you look at its surface, fragments of newsprint peep through a semi-opaque hardened surface. Its strange texture comes from the artist's use of encaustic, a wax medium that is as old as Ancient Egypt. It gives the painting a frozen quality, a monumental stillness. Through this coloured death mask you try to read collaged news stories.\nWhat seems simple is complex and suggestive. The realities of the US, as told in the news, peep through the iconic stars and bars. Flag is an epic poem about the United States.\nWhen Johns cast it in bronze, he gave it another layer of monumental dignity. This was a patriotic souvenir, one he gave in high hopes to JFK. The bronze edition of Flag is not just a money-making gimmick, but a declaration of faith in the new America of the 1960s.\nFlag endures. The criminal case is just one more story in its great US collage."}

His timing is perfect \u2013 and not because he was due to report to spring training this weekend. It\u2019s the right move, and despite his coy non-answers in those interviews before the Super Bowl, no one should really be surprised.\nHe\u2019ll forgo that $4.7 million bonus from the Oakland Athletics. He\u2019ll likely become the first athlete ever chosen in the first round of both the Major League Baseball and NFL drafts.\nAnd never mind his size, no one should be too surprised if he excels.\nMurray\u2019s talent is undeniable. The Heisman Trophy winner is blazing fast, sure. Pay close attention to what he runs in the 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine (if he runs, and boy, we hope he does); he might not just be the fastest quarterback in Indianapolis \u2013 he\u2019ll be among the fastest players, period. He has an NFL arm and the accuracy to go with it. But yes, we know: he's tiny.\nMurray\u2019s spectacular impact is outsized.\nSure, but can he do it at the next level? The question will dominate the next few weeks, during the run-up to the draft. And once a team has made him a first-round pick and bet on him as the face of the franchise \u2013 pretty clearly, this is going to happen; it\u2019s only a question of which front office falls in love \u2013 the story line will only grow.\nMurray is not exactly a wisp, by the way. Oklahoma listed him at 195 pounds. Whatever his official weight in Indianapolis, he\u2019s solidly built, especially in the lower body. Go ahead and cringe at the vision of a defensive end crushing Murray from the blind side \u2013 or in the open field, a safety blasting him at full speed \u2013 but it\u2019s worth noting how few hard hits he actually took at Oklahoma. That\u2019s in large part because of his awareness, but also because he is possibly the best quarterback at sliding, ever (he drops, then pops up like he\u2019s just stolen second base).\nIt\u2019s at least as tantalizing to envision Murray escaping the pocket, then rifling the ball to a receiver downfield. Or taking off, leaving defenders grasping at a vapor trail.\nIn baseball, he\u2019s a five-tool prospect. But emphasis on the noun. Murray might one day become a baseball superstar, but he\u2019d first have to work his way up through the minor leagues. He showed promise on the diamond a year ago with Oklahoma, but it\u2019s a hard road and there are no guarantees.\nIn football, despite bigger risks, the payoff could be immediate. Murray arrives at the perfect time, with NFL front offices growing gradually more open toward quarterbacks who don\u2019t fit their preconceived notions of size \u2013 and at least as important, suddenly enthralled with wide-open college offenses like Oklahoma\u2019s modified Air Raid, which Murray took to another level. Ten years ago, or maybe even five, it\u2019s likely scouts would have been far more skeptical of someone like Murray. He\u2019d have gotten questions like, \u201cWould you consider a position change?\u201d And he\u2019d probably have chosen baseball.\nBut there\u2019s now room in the NFL for a guy like Murray to move.

Where as in the US the color choices will be limited to just one: black/turquoise, Japan also gets a white/orange option. But that's not the end of the choices. Kotaku made us aware that Nintendo announced it would be offering a special edition of the 2DS XL to help celebrate the launch of Dragon Quest XI, which arrives on July 29.\nIt will cost roughly $200, so about the same as a New 3DS XL, but in return you'll get a Metallic Slime 2DS XL. There will be a limited supply of these special editions featuring a custom case including a raised shiny mirror metal slime on the exterior alongside Dragon Quest symbols printed across the black plastic casing. There's also custom detail below the D-Pad, and a Takenagi Metal Theme that will only be made available for this version of the 2DS XL.\nDragon Quest is extremely popular in Japan. Dragon Quest XI is being released on 2DS/3DS, Switch, and PS4, and Sony is also planning to offer some special editions including a PS4 Slim and an unusual PS4 controller. It would be surprising if this Metallic Slime 2DS XL did not sell out on launch day.\nAlthough nothing has been confirmed yet, it seems unlikely we'll get the same special edition handheld in the US or Europe. However, Nintendo is clearly still happy to produce limited edition versions of its hardware to support the more important game launches, so we'll likely see some special 2DS XL handhelds appearing. You also have to wonder how long it will be before we get a special edition Switch."}

Meanwhile, to boost Iran\u2019s collapsed economy, the country\u2019s moderate forces\u2014a coalition of progressive politicians, intellectuals and pragmatic conservatives headed by President Hassan Rouhani, who advocates reintegrating Iran into the global market\u2014are encouraging foreign partners and investors to invest in Iran.\nBut the extent of the Iranian market\u2019s readiness for international investment has not been addressed yet. Iran\u2019s autocratic system has unique characteristics that make it different from other autocracies in terms of dealing with foreign investors. This raises the question: how plausible is it to expect a fruitful economic relationship between Iran and foreign investors, and what are the possible uncertainties and obstacles regarding foreign investment in Iran?\nWhile President Rouhani\u2019s administration will not aquiesce to hard-liners, who oppose any Western presence, skepticism over foreign intentions is an age-old feature of the Iranian political psyche. After the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, political elites believed that Iran\u2019s economic sovereignty should be protected by limiting foreign capital\u2019s influence in the country as much as possible. Yet they remain in this antagonistic position due to their deep-rooted economic interests, which they believe can be jeopardized by foreign investment. These elites can be found in certain factions of the parliament, at the head of Iran\u2019s state-run industries, and in the business enterprises of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and revolutionary foundations, also known as Bonyad. These interest groups\u2019 influence is, therefore, substantial.\nIran\u2019s economic relations with the outside world in general, and foreign investment in particular, have been affected by sanctions imposed by the international community due to its illicit nuclear activities. Sanctions have been imposed on other grounds as well, such as Iran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism and human-rights violations.\nAlthough there exists virtual consensus regarding the necessity for foreign investment in Iran, it is not clear whether the environment is propitious for investment. The current debate is based on predictions with no basis in reality; identifying the real obstacles is crucial for facilitating foreign investment in Iran. Both Iran and international companies harbor doubts about economic rapprochement and foreign investment. Although similar concerns exist in economic relations between investors and investees in any other country, they have unique characteristics in Iran.\nFirst, interest groups that control the pulse of Iran\u2019s economy fear foreign investment. They believe that, when foreign investment occurs, foreign businesses will access capital, rivals will be excluded and, given the weakness of domestic competition, foreign investors may achieve a local monopoly, consequently leading to a loss in these interest groups\u2019 power and position. In other words, they argue that giving more access to foreign firms will lead to a loss in terms of both their economic independence and their political power.\nSecondly, interest groups fear that foreign investors may pull out in times of crisis, leaving the country vulnerable. A clear example of this was when countries and individual companies recently steered clear of business with Iran after a threat of U.S. sanctions. As a result, a stream of major international corporations announced a departure from the Iranian market. For instance, the French company Total withdrew from developing the South Pars gas field, which is in the hands of the Revolutionary Guard. China National Petroleum Corporation replaced the French company; however,"}

He was worried his new brother and sister would think it was strange.\nThe couple told him he should ask the other kids. He got a thumbs up.\nChanges to Ontario\u2019s adoption programs are helping other families like the Bondys go through the process and get support once the adoption is finalized.\nThe changes include making more families eligible for monthly funds, a new support program and more recruiters to help match kids with parents. They take effect over the next year and a half.\nWith the Bondys, the adoption process began about two years before they met Shane. The couple had already thought of adopting before giving birth to Hailey, 6, and Noah, 4.\nThey had worried it would be hard to raise children with special needs or medical conditions. But then Noah was born with a rare bleeding disorder. It sent them on some scary visits to the emergency room and to London for frequent medical treatment.\nThe couple had put a zero to 10 age range on their adoption application, but were willing to adopt someone older if it felt right. Shane was 15.\n\u201cThere are more challenges in placing children that are older, or children who have complex needs,\u201d said Linda Goodhue, director of permanent services with the Windsor-Essex Children\u2019s Aid Society. That\u2019s why the government program gives parents about $950 a month per child to help cover the costs.\nThat program is being expanded. Parents who adopt children from eight to 21 years old can now apply. Before that it covered adopted children from 10 to 18. Families that earn $93,700 or less qualify.\nGoodhue said the money can encourage foster families that want to adopt children in their care, but can\u2019t afford it.\nThe first meetings between the Bondys and Shane were on neutral ground. They went fishing by the river, they got ice cream, they talked about woodworking and cars \u2014 things Shane and his dad have in common.\nAfter two and a half months, Shane moved in. That was last September.\nSince the family hadn\u2019t known what age to expect, they had to convert Amy\u2019s office into a comfortable bedroom for Shane. They started paying for riding and piano lessons. Shane also has some specials needs. The Grade 11 student will be in high school until he\u2019s 21 because he\u2019s in the STEPS program, which helps children with special needs.\nThe subsidy provided a monthly fund to help with some of the costs.\nMike said the family also set up opportunities for Shane, Hailey and Noah to spend time together, learning how to be siblings. They did some small family vacations, and went out in the community. Shane met all his relatives \u2014 cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents.\nMost families try to adopt younger children, to avoid upsetting the birth order. Shane bumped Hailey out of the oldest child slot, which took some adjustment. Noah still teases that Shane is his younger \u2014 not older \u2014 brother.\nThe adoption was finalized in June. Although they still have contact with the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Amy said the government\u2019s new support network would help parents like them after the adoption, when questions about the transition come up.\nThe province is also funding more Wendy\u2019s Wonderful Kids recruiters through the Dave Thomas Foundation.

The treats are made with all-natural, human grade ingredients.\n\"There is nothing in these treats that you yourself couldn\u2019t eat,\" Meghan said.\nThe main ingredient: recycled beer brewing grains.\nCraft Canine treats get most of their grains from Six Ten Brewery and Brew Bus in Tampa. Both breweries donate their used grains to the business and they get a second life as healthy dog treats.\nThe Betourney's rescue dog, Boston, has a crucial role in the business.\n\"He is what we call our director of quality control,\" Meghan explained with Marc adding, \"He gets to sample all of the treats before they go out. Especially when we roll out a new flavor, he gets to try them before they hit the market.\"\nBoston is not the only dog to benefit from these treats. Craft Canine donates a portion of profits to a different local animal organization every month. A partnership that just made sense to the couple.\n\"I think just seeing how many animals are available for adoption, and the limited resources these rescue groups are working with. And owning rescue pets, it was just an instant connection. It just made sense, and any little bit of money we could provide them with, we saw the impact it was making,\u201d Marc said.\nThe company is getting ready to celebrate its one year anniversary.\nAs the couple looks to the future, in true Tampa Bay area fashion, they are focused on their home.\n\"It\u2019s about the community where we live.

The well-meaning father brings home a pair of tame white rats, which thoroughly delight his children. They are curious, playful and, to the innocent children, display what seem to be affectionate qualities. But, they also procreate to the limits of available resources. This leads to a happy family project: building a hutch in the yard to accommodate the burgeoning product of all that affection. Before long, the hutch is nearly bursting with healthy, curious, affectionate little wiggling noses and bright, shiny inquisitive little black eyes\u2026until one night, near dawn, there comes a hideous screeching and tumultuous shrieking from the hutch in the yard. When the children finally set out in the morning, they discover an awful spectacle. The rats are all dead except for one barely alive, and they have all been ripped and gouged and gored and gutted and torn to bloody shreds. There is no breach in the wire of the cage. The little door is still fastened with the tiny padlock. No interloper has committed this atrocity. It was, incredibly, an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inside job\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nIn cultures that practice ritual scarification, hard times produce deeper cuts, more widely distributed patterns of scarification, and a tendency to be less cautious about the quality of ash and abrasives rubbed into the wounds. Ritual warfare is practiced with heavier clubs and longer blades. Arrows are drawn against stiffer bows. Whips and slings are wielded with more conviction. And sooner or later, this pleases the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gods\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, who restore prosperity by reducing the number of mouths to feed and the number of erect penises which must be satisfied.\nAs we pack more and more people into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prisons for profit\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, perhaps we, too in our primitivism will appease the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gods\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We\u2019ll come up with some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153righteous\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cause celebre which will appeal to the masses, and they\u2019ll make terrible sacrifices certain in the faith that, horrible though it may be, the greater good is the end that justifies the means. The lovable rats will once again have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lebensraum\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in which they can playfully cavort and be the delightful creatures they truly are. War inevitably produces the technology which allows available resources to sustain larger populations. The cycle repeats, but the technology cannot advance as rapidly as the population. So, war produces solutions to both negative aspects of intractable human \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progress\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. A drastic reduction in population reestablishes the equilibrium so that profit motivation can implement the new technology which ultimately leads to prosperity\u2026until hard times return. The last time one of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153righteous\u00e2\u20ac\u009d causes got out of hand, various estimates suggest we eliminated between 50 and 60 million \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useless eaters\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

These taxes on consumption raise revenue for local governments, but do they also stymie business and hurt consumers? In America, sales taxes are collected by municipalities and states and generally added to a good\u2019s sale price at checkout. In many other countries, like France, \u201cvalue-added tax\u201d (VAT) is included in the stated sale price and collected by the national government.\nA new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at who benefits when a sales tax is repealed. In this case, in 2009 France reduced the VAT collected in sit-down restaurants from 19.6 percent to 5.5 percent (which happens to be the VAT charged at take-out spots). Policymakers who cut taxes often argue that the money firms or individuals would have paid will now be spent in other parts of the economy. In the case of firms, this is supposed to stimulate higher wages or the hiring of more workers; for individuals, increased spending on consumer goods.\nRestaurant owners benefited the most from the tax cut, pocketing around 41 percent of the savings. Employees received about 25 percent of the cut without increasing hours; restaurant suppliers received around 16 percent. Consumers received the remaining 18 percent, as menu prices fell about 2 percent after the reform. The authors were not able to measure any change in food quality.

In an article published the arXiv Quantitative Biology archive, Dongjin Seo, Michael Maharbiz, and colleagues from the University of California at Berkeley propose a system they call 'Neural Dust'.\nBrain-computer interfaces today generally work by sticking electrodes into the brain. That runs into severe problems - all those electrodes cause trauma as they penetrate the brain, and leave wires that wind through and between the brain's neurons, potentially attracting scar tissue or driving the brain to reject the implant.\nThe proposed 'Neural Dust' system (and it's just a proposal for now) would work differently. The authors propose sprinkling tiny dust-sized passive silicon sensors, about 100 microns across, throughout the human cortex. These sensors would be about as big around as the thickness of a human hair, and fabricated via a CMOS process, the same as used for many conventional computer chips.\nThey'd be sprinkled through the cortex. Just outside the cortex but underneath the skull would be a larger chip, still only millimeters across, that would communicate with them via ultrasound. The use of ultrasound would let the neural dust particles send information pulses without disrupting the activity of neurons around them, and without needing to have any wires or electrodes getting in the way.\nOutside the skull entirely would be the external transceiver. This chip would provide wireless power for the chips inside the skull, and would read the data out from the brain, allowing scientists and engineers to see what's going on inside.\nThe brilliance of this system is that it could potentially allow scientists to see what's going on with thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of neurons inside the brain at once, by sprinkling enough neural dust particles and sub-dural transceivers.\nOf course, it's still only theoretical, though the researchers have published the paper in part to seriously work through the knot of design questions involved and to stimulate others to take steps towards fabrication. The neural dust proposal would also be only one way - it would allow data to be pulled out of the brain - to allow you to control a robot arm, say, or to let someone see what you're thinking or feeling - but not allow data to be transmitted into the brain - to give you touch feedback on that robot arm, or to show you what someone else is thinking or feeling.\nEven so, I'm delighted to see this. In fact, I learned of it when someone tweeted this paper at me, suggested it might be a step towards the brain-linking nano-drug in my novel Nexus. Heh. I think they just might be right. And I sure hope so.\nYou can read the arXiv paper's abstract, and the whole paper if you like, here: \"Neural Dust: An Ultrasonic, Low Power Solution for Chronic Brain-Machine Interfaces\""}

MSF treated about 300,000 Somalis in the first half of 2013.\nDozens of foreign MSF staff had pulled out of Somalia in past weeks, the charity said, while some 1,500 local doctors, nurses and assistants will now be jobless.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Somali government, which is struggling to pull the nation out of two decades of conflict and is unable to provide basic public services including health and education.\nThe pullout came a month after two female Spanish MSF workers were freed by their Somali kidnappers after almost two years in captivity.\nIn early 2012, MSF closed two major medical centres in the capital Mogadishu after two international staff were shot dead by a former colleague."}

After a scoreless two periods, sophomore defenseman Chad Krys broke through the Friars\u2019 defense and scored his first two goals of the season within 1:37 of the other. Sophomore goaltender Jake Oettinger\u2019s 31-save night also contributed to the 2-0 win and marked his fifth collegiate shutout.\nHowever, BU was unable to carry this momentum into the following night as it hosted No. 13 Northeastern University. Forwards Bobby Hampton and Nolan Stevens got the Huskies on the board twice during the opening frame in what appeared to mimic last season\u2019s Hockey East quarterfinals to a tee.\nUnlike like the quarterfinals, the Terriers were unable to come back despite junior forward Jordan Greenway\u2019s second goal of the season. Stevens went on to score twice more in the second period to bring Northeastern home a 4-1 win while BU accumulated two game misconducts in the final period.\nWhile the Terriers were unable to match the Huskies\u2019 offense, they will have another chance next Friday night at Matthews arena. Then the following night BU will host the University of No. 9 New Hampshire at Agganis Arena.\nFormer Boston University men\u2019s hockey forward Johnny McDermott is taking his talents to Hockey East rival Providence College, the sophomore announced Wednesday night via Twitter.\nAfter receiving playing time in 14 games of his first season with the Terriers, McDermott was stuck behind a loaded freshman class of forwards on the depth chart this year and was unable to break onto the ice.\nThe Darien, Connecticut native took seven shots as a freshman, including two each against Union College and the University of Massachusetts-Lowell.\nWhile he did not score a goal during his BU tenure, he recorded an assist in his first collegiate action. In a 6-1 win over Colgate University last season on Oct. 8, McDermott combined with current sophomore forward Gabriel Chabot (who has also struggled to find ice time this season) to set up former forward Tommy Kelley on a goal to give the Terriers a 4-0 lead in the game.\nMcDermott joins a Friars program that handed BU a disappointing 3-0 loss in Rhode Island on Saturday night and will take on BU this Friday night at Agganis Arena.\nThe No. 6 Boston University men\u2019s hockey team fell to both of its opponents, the No. 1 University of Denver and No. 11 Providence College, over the weekend.\nOn Friday at Agganis Arena, Denver proved its dominance early with two tallies in the first four minutes of the game. Freshman forward Ty Amonte\u2019s first goal of the season and another power-play goal from junior forward and assistant captain Bobo Carpenter in the same period tied the score.\nHowever, another strike late in the 1st period from Pioneers forward Colin Staub gave them a 3-2 lead Denver would keep until sophomore defenseman Dante Fabbro evened the score more than halfway through the final period.

The lake is 12 miles from the northwest/Manzanita Lake entrance, making it close to the halfway mark of the 30-mile highway running through the national park.\nSummit Lake is a place to wade, swim, kayak, fish, picnic. Or perhaps to simply chill. Lassen Park, after all, has summer temperatures typically a good 10 to 20 degrees cooler than those in the valley. The northwest entrance to the park is only about an hour\u2019s drive from Redding.\nTo make more than a day of it, the lake has a 94-site campground split into north and south sections. If flush toilets are important to you, they are in the north campground. Neither campground has RV hookups.\n\u201cSummit Lake Campground is a great place for families,\u201d says Amanda Sweeney, interpretive media specialist at Lassen Park.\nThere\u2019s a nice shoreline walk. The north end of the quarter-mile-long lake has a swimming area that is sandy and stays shallow a good distance into the lake. And rangers offer programs during the summer on nature topics or the park\u2019s cultural history.\nThe lake is at 6,700 feet in elevation and offers a pleasant perspective on 10,457-foot Lassen Peak.\n\u201cThe eastern shore provides an excellent view of the sunrise on the tip-top of Lassen Peak,\u201d Sweeney says.\nSummit Lake gets its name from its location on a slightly rounded plateau, she notes. Water from the lake area drains in two directions to different watersheds \u2014 north to Pit River and south to Feather River.\nIf you come for the day, there is a small parking area near the picnic spot on the north shore.\nSummit Lake is the starting point for backpacking and day-hiking on Cluster Lakes Loop Trail. An easy day hike, if you just want to do part of that route, is an up-and-back to Echo Lake. The hike is a four-mile round trip with an elevation gain of 416 feet. The trail goes into a fir forest and then through an open area with lots of ground-hugging manzanita.\n\u201cThere is a great view of Lassen Peak halfway up the trail,\u201d Sweeney says.\nThe trailhead parking lot is off the park highway just north of the campground.

With multiple headwinds converging at once, full-year results suffered.\nTo make matters worse, the company began diversifying its toy production away from China as a result of the trade spat with the U.S. That ate into profit margins, although management said it is on track to reduce its exposure to China to 60% by the end of 2020. Hasbro also had to deal with sliding sales in Europe. Management cited a report from market research group NPD that said toy and game sales fell 4% on the continent in 2018.\nTo put it simply, it was a bad year for the toy industry. It was the first annual industrywide sales decline since 2009 -- the year the financial crisis started to abate. Reflecting the ugly numbers -- especially during the all-important holiday shopping season -- Hasbro&apos;s stock carries a trailing-12-month price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 52. Wall Street feels optimistic, though, as the 12-month forward expected P/E is only about 19. That would indicate a dramatic rebound is in the cards.\nThough the numbers were underwhelming, Hasbro did post some significant accomplishments. The company said it was the No. 1 toy seller on Amazon in 2018, and its online points-of-sale grew by a double-digit percentage as it shifted away from its now-defunct legacy partner. While transitioning to digital can be a painful process, it&apos;s a necessary one to survive in the digital-first world we live in (ahem, Toys R Us). The milestone paves the way for Hasbro to eventually return to growth.\nThe company purchased the Power Rangers in 2018, with a new TV show set for release later this year. That builds on Hasbro&apos;s history of turning popular toy brands into media assets as well, a vertically integrated franchise that capitalizes on all aspects of kids&apos; entertainment. In a similar fashion, Hasbro wants to build on its board-game and card-game strength by bringing popular titles like Dungeons & Dragons to the video-game world. With video games only growing in popularity, management has made it clear it wants to bring more of its brands into a digital format and has promised some examples will be forthcoming.\nAnd finally there&apos;s the partnership development pipeline, most notably at Disney. Hasbro handles all the toy production for Mickey and company, and it&apos;s shaping up to be an especially busy year for the theme park and movie studio."}

By its own account, it is close. Will this happen in late April? We can\u2019t know for sure, since it\u2019s all super hush-hush.\nLast summer in New Orleans, Mark Brown, the president of the Sazerac Co., which owns Buffalo Trace, gave a presentation on Project Holy Grail to a group of journalists. He told us that project workers had already identified 15 variables in whiskeymaking, which can lead to millions of outcomes. They had isolated 125 of the more than 300 chemicals in bourbon. They had rated all locations in Buffalo Trace\u2019s vast rickhouses, where its barrels age for decades at a time, for quality.\n\u201cWe know which aisles in which rickhouses make the best whiskey,\u201d Brown told us.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he added, \u201cwe are being purposefully vague.\u201d To date, Buffalo Trace has concocted more than 300 experimental whiskeys, many of which have been released as special editions in the Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection over the past few years. So far, nothing has achieved perfection in the distiller\u2019s eyes. Regardless, most of the ones I\u2019ve tasted, I must say, have been pretty delicious.\nWe all know that \u201cperfect\u201d is a slippery term. Several of the journalists in New Orleans wondered aloud: On exactly what basis will perfection be determined? Brown told us he had \u201cdissected\u201d the 10 top-rated whiskeys of a handful of influential spirits writers, among them F. Paul Pacult, who publishes the newsletter Spirit Journal; Gary Regan, the cocktail columnist of the San Francisco Chronicle; and John Hansell, editor of Malt Advocate magazine. Based on the ratings of those writers, Buffalo Trace developed the profile for its holy grail.\nIn the world of wine, there has been a lot of recent soul-searching about the validity, objectivity and overall worth of 100-point rating scales. What, some ask, do the points mean? Many of us feel overwhelmed by the shelf talkers posted in wine shops, trumpeting 90-something points for this, 90-something points for that. There\u2019s evidence that Wine Spectator-style rating scales, which were so effective for baby boomers, are getting less traction with succeeding generations of wine buyers. Translation: More of us are saying \u201cmeh\u201d when faced with a score by Robert M. Parker Jr.\nApparently that is not a concern in the world of whiskey. Like the great white whale, a 100-point whiskey remains out of reach, at least for Buffalo Trace. In any case, in the manner of Ishmael I\u2019ll be sojourning to Kentucky soon to observe and taste, and I\u2019ll chronicle my efforts for you.\nOf one thing I am certain: This perfect, holy-grail whiskey ain\u2019t gonna be cheap.\nPrice. Value. Those were not discussed as part of the holy-grail algorithm, just as they are rarely discussed in 100-point rating scales. Which is why I\u2019d like to mention a few of the imperfect bourbons I\u2019ve been enjoying lately.\nBourbon is one of my favorite spirits, and early spring is probably my favorite time of year to drink it.

Your old save games are useless here, because the new content in Enemy Within is tied right into the campaign. The campaign\u2019s not entirely overhauled, but there are a few new (excellent) missions thrown into the fray and, more importantly, some pretty huge mechanical changes from last year\u2019s game.\nThere are two main additions to Enemy Within: Exalt and Meld.\nExalt is that group of humans you see in every alien invasion film, standing on the street corner with signs that say, \u201cJudgment is nigh!\u201d and \u201cThe aliens are here to save us!\u201d Only evidently Exalt skipped the buy-markers-and-make-signs step and went straight to the buy-guns-and-commit-global-acts-of-terrorism step.\nExalt causes chaos and steals XCOM\u2019s lunch money. Once you\u2019ve been introduced to Exalt (four or five missions into the game) you\u2019ll have to keep an eye out for both alien and human threats. They're terrorists.

{"idx": "12680", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I\u2019ve spent years researching the DNA of high-performing companies, and much to my surprise the leaders at most of those companies did not fit commonly espoused theories of leadership.\nMany people believe great leaders are charismatic, have a commanding presence, are visionary and educated at elite schools. Almost all of the leaders of the high-performing companies that I studied had none of those traits.\nInstead, they are what I call servant leaders.\nI discovered them while researching well-run organizations such as Chick-fil-A and the old Home Depot, both based in the Atlanta area, and even the U.S. Marine Corps, headquartered in Arlington. I found them again and again in research I did on high-performance organizations such as Best Buy, UPS, Ritz Carlton, Room & Board, Whole Foods, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Levy Restaurants, the San Antonio Spurs and TSYS.\nThose leaders tended to share common characteristics.\nThese leaders were servants in the best sense of the word. They were people-centric, valued service to others and believed they had a duty of stewardship. Nearly all were humble and passionate operators who were deeply involved in the details of the business. Most had long tenures in their organizations. They had not forgotten what it was like to be a line employee.\nThey believed that every employee should be treated with respect and have the opportunity to do meaningful work. They led by example, lived the \u201cGolden Rule,\u201d and understood that good intentions are not enough \u2014 behaviors count. These leaders serve the organization and its multiple stakeholders. They are servant leaders.\nMany people think that you cannot be people-centric and maintain high standards, because employees will take advantage. That\u2019s another leadership myth.\nThese high-performance organizations show that people-centric environments and high performance are not mutually exclusive. Employees in these companies have high emotional engagement, loyalty and productivity, and outperform the competition on a daily basis over long periods of time. In fact, the relationship between high performance, high employee engagement and how you treat employees is compelling. My research clearly demonstrates that employee satisfaction drives customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nMost people seek a leadership position because they want more pay, more prestige, more perks and more power. They seek and fall for the intoxicating powers of leadership.\nServant leaders side step that failing. They are paid more, but very few ever make the highest-paid CEOs list. Instead, they fight elitism in themselves and their organizations. Many of these organizations eschew corporate jets, executive dining rooms, big decorated executive offices and other trappings of elitism. Some of these leaders had small windowless offices. Some shared administrative staff with other executives.\nHow servant leaders behave is a key to their successful leadership. Behaviors are means of communicating. For example, treating people with dignity, being in the moment and not multitasking, not interrupting others, listening intensely, smiling, saying please and thank you, acknowledging the contributions of others, admitting mistakes, apologizing, not having to be the smartest person in the room all the time and spending time on the front lines with employees and customers.\nServant leaders do not abuse, humiliate or devalue people. They understand that behaviors either build trust or destroy it, and without trust one cannot generally achieve consistent high employee engagement and high performance.\nLike behaviors, a servant leader\u2019s attitudes and beliefs underpin successful leadership.\nAttitudes and beliefs are fundamental because what you think and feel drives behaviors. Servant leaders do not think they are better than the people they lead. Servant leaders do not think that unless employees"}

Yet every election cycle brings promises to improve children's lives in the name of bipartisan family values.\nWith 16 months to go in the long presidential campaign slog, candidates are polishing up their talking points on how to improve the lot of the American family. Some even talk about supporting programs that help parents better prepare their preschoolers for academic success.\nThe reality is that parents all across the economic spectrum face struggles they shouldn't have to because when it comes to valuing what families need, our elected representatives are out to recess.\nMy sister has a well-paying executive job, yet she has to juggle childcare for her 8-year-old daughter, especially in the summer months, because of how much the quality and costs vary in her area. A close friend, also a single mom with a 2-year-old, has told me that even with reliable child care, she couldn't manage it all if her parents didn't periodically come up from Atlanta to lend a hand.\nThese women are well-educated parents with full-time jobs and benefits.

This condition worsens kids' health\u2014homeless children have four times the respiratory infections, four times the rates of asthma, and go hungry at twice the rate of other kids.

Housing-assistance grants for low-income families went down $1.5 billion from 2011 to 2013, a significant hit on the estimated $9 billion of government housing assistance that impacts children. And while mandatory spending on nutrition assistance programs, most commonly known as food stamps, went up slightly since 2011, that's because the formula that decides that responds more to economics than year-to-year appropriations. Discretionary spending in the area went down.\nPromising to support young kids and their parents to level the playing field and help them thrive is good.\nMaking interventions in families' most basic needs\u2014making sure they eat, have a roof over their heads, and that parents can count on viable and healthy child care options when they work\u2014would be even better.\nCarolina Gonz\u00e1lez is a Next America contributor based in New York City."}

Two plays later, he hit Branch again for a 3-yard gain, and UK linebacker Ronnie Riley was forced to leave the game with a knee injury.\nThe very next play, Ragone picked on Riley's replacement, true freshman Dustin Williams, and found Ghent for an 11-yard touchdown strike. U of L misfired on the two-point conversion attempt but still had a 22-10 lead with 9:57 left.\nLorenzen fumbled the center exchange on UK's next play from scrimmage at the Louisville 10, and T. J. Patterson scored two plays later to give U of L a 29-10 cushion at 9:32.\nAfter a UK three-and-out, the Cards marched 69 yards in nine plays and Patterson bounced around right end for a 6-yard TD run to put a final nail in the coffin.\nMorriss said the offense's inability to produce left the defense on the field far too long in the second half.\n\"How many times did we go three-and-out?\" Morriss said. \"You can run sprints until you're blue in the face, but if we could have done what we were committed to do offensively and helped our defense out, I don't think the game would have gotten out of control.\"\nDefensive coordinator John Goodner said his unit will have to develop some depth in order to survive.

Hosted by a partnership of the park\u2019s annual Summer on the Hudson series and Lamprophonic, an Upper West Side writers group, the free festival featured an afternoon of writing workshops, panel discussions with local authors and readings.\nMoosiki Kids, a music program for children led by Laura Nupponen, opened the event, and families who arrived at noon filed into seats, strollers packing the audience. A few toddlers bounced to the tune of the acoustic guitar as a breeze cut through the late spring heat. Afterwards, in the Emerging Writers Showcase, six new writers were invited to the stage to share their work. The showcase featured writers of all ages, and high schooler Dylan Manning\u2019s father jumped in to share her short story when an obligatory class trip kept her from attending.\nAuthor Katie Kitamura then read several passages from \u201cA Separation,\u201d her latest novel, which explores one woman\u2019s journey to find her missing husband. Clare Smith Marash, Lamprophonic\u2019s founder, then engaged Kitamura in conversation. The women discussed the literary elements at play in Kitamura\u2019s novel as well as her life as an author.\nMarash founded Lamprophonic as a reading series for emerging writers in 2012 while pursuing an MFA in creative writing from Columbia University.\nThe organization \u201cencourages a robust, diverse and supportive literary community in New York City,\u201d according to their mission statement.\nAs Lamprophonic\u2019s readings grew in popularity, Marash came in contact with Zhen Heinemann, the director of public programs for Summer on the Hudson. The series is the city Parks Department\u2019s annual outdoor arts and culture festival. Heinemann asked Marash if Lamprophonic would be interested in holding readings in the park.\nLamprophonic, in 2015, initially hosted monthly readings and discussions with local authors in the park through this collaboration with Heinemann and Summer on the Hudson. Last year, these readings evolved. Instead of monthly events, Marash said she and Heinemann decided to invest more deeply by hosting a full-fledged festival that still incorporated readings while introducing workshops and panel discussions.\nWhile last year\u2019s AmpLit Fest lasted seven hours and featured more events, this year\u2019s festival was condensed. Marash explained that she wanted to concentrate her efforts and fewer events meant fine-tuning the ones they did have. She wanted to stick to what Lamprophonic does best, she said, which is \u201cbringing literature to the park;\u201d to achieve that, they focused on readings.\nThose who took a break from what was happening on the main stage could explore other pop-ups, which included a portable reading room courtesy of The Uni Project. Founded by Sam Davol and his wife, Leslie, The Uni Project provides a place for learning to happen outside the walls of a classroom or library by popping up in public spaces and providing books that span across reading levels to attract multiple generations of readers.\nAll of Summer on the Hudson\u2019s events are free to the public, and AmpLit Fest was no different.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never done an event that we charge for because New York City is a creative hive, but it\u2019s very expensive and I don\u2019t think we should perpetuate that by putting a price tag on things,\u201d Marash said.\nBoth Summer on the Hudson and Lamprophonic funded the small literary festival that drew humble crowds to Pier I on that"}

Thanks to the proliferation of faster, more powerful computers and the availability of cheap bandwidth, this popular form of cyberattack\u2014which prevents users from accessing a targeted website by bombarding it with messages from a group of hijacked machines\u2014are frequently reaching 100 gigabits per second.\nDDoS attacks are one of the most effective ways that attackers can crash a website they don't like. Last March, for example, the antispam activists at the Spamhaus Project were hit with an attack that tracked as high as 300 Gbps. But is there anything we can do to combat it?\nIncapsula, a cloud-based cybersecurity solutions provider, says it is rolling out 20-core Behemoth computers that could make DDoS a thing of the past. It's an audacious claim, to be sure, and many cybersecurity experts see it as marketing hype. But Incapsula officials say their \"brains and brawn\" solution will keep clients ahead of the DDoSers.\nDDoS attacks tend to come in one of two forms, says Tim Matthews, spokesman for Incapsula. There's the brute-force network attack, which overwhelms the router connecting to the Internet. And there's the app attack, which is a little more discriminating\u2014targeting only parts of a website, such as its shopping cart.\nIncapsula's Behemoths are designed to take on both. The company began rolling out its Behemoths in June; they are already operating in eight cities, with five more around the world expected by the end of the year. Alone, each computer has the capacity to mitigate 170 Gbps and can process up to 100 million packets per second. Working together, Incapsula claims, they can defend against attacks of spectacular size.\nTo protect clients, Incapsula's cloud-based service needs to quickly and efficiently filter incoming traffic for botnets. Here, looking for blacklisted IP addresses is not enough; the defender may encounter an attack from an address it's never seen before. So the system must analyze the contents of the packets too.\n\"We are looking at very large numbers of packets every second, looking at the timing of individual user actions, comparing payload to known exploit patterns, and the like,\" Matthews says. \"To do this, you need not just very high bandwidth but a lot of computer power.\" And don't forget software constantly updated to counter new kinds of attacks.\nAccording to Matthews, Incapsula's Behemoth was successfully put to the test when, in August, a client, an affiliate of a gaming company, \"got attacked for 38 straight days, and the attackers continued to shift between different tactics, combined different attacks, looking for a way to get in.\"\nLarge banks and corporations used to have hardware on their premises to protect themselves from DDoS attacks. \"But a lot has moved to the cloud, so a lot of companies don't have racks anymore. They are owned and run by Amazon or racks on Verizon, or whoever is hosting their website or Web app,\" he says. Likewise, smaller businesses, which have started to attract the nefarious attention of DDoSers, have also taken to the cloud, relying on software products like salesforce.com to manage employers, or Magento for their e-commerce platform.\nThe current crop of Behemoths are built to"}

Few nineteenth-century dioceses have undergone similar territorial changes. The Concordat of 1802 gave the Diocese of Besan\u00e7on all those districts which, in 1822, constituted the Diocese of St. -Claude. In 1806, Besan\u00e7on was given jurisdiction over the three parishes of the principality of Neufachatel (Switzerland) which fell under the control of the See of Lausanne in 1814. In 1870, after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany, the district of Belfort was withdrawn from the See of Strasburg and attached to that of Besan\u00e7on. The metropolitan jurisdiction of Besan\u00e7on also underwent singular changes. In 1802 its suffragans were the Bishoprics of Dijon, Autun, Metz, Nancy, and Strasburg. Under the Restoration, Dijon and Autun were withdrawn from Besan\u00e7on, the latter becoming the metropolitan of the Sees of Saint-Di\u00e9, Verdun, and Belley. In 1874, after the German conquest, the churches of Metz and Strasburg were under the direct control of the Holy See.\nLocal legends attribute the evangelization of Besan\u00e7on to Sts. Ferr\u00e9ol and Ferjeux, sent thither by St. Iren\u00e6us, Bishop of Lyons. Duchesne has proved that these legends belong to a chain of narratives forged in the first half of the sixth century and of which the \"passion\" of St. Benignus of Dijon was the initial link. The catalogue of the earliest bishops of Besan\u00e7on is to be read with caution. The first bishop known to history is Celidonius (c. 445); other incumbents of the see were St. Rothadius, a monk at Luxeuil and organizer of the monastic life ; St. Donatus; St. Hugh I (1031-67), prince of the empire, the real founder of the city whose markets, commerce, and schools he established; Cardinal de Granvelle (1584-86), the famous minister of Philip II, who built the palace of Besan\u00e7on; Antoine-Pierre de Grammont (1662-98), who strenuously opposed Jansenism and the Reformation, strove to uplift the clergy, and, in 1691, transferred to Besan\u00e7on the University of D\u00f4le; Le Coz (1802-15), former constitutional bishop whose personality provoked in the diocese no little opposition to the Concordat ; Cardinal de Rohan-Chabot (1828-33); Cardinal Mathieu (1834-75), who distinguished himself by his defence of the temporal power, and was a member of the \"Opposition\" at the Vatican council . He opposed strenuously in his diocese the \"simultaneous churches\" which sprang up throughout the district of Montb\u00e9liard where Protestants are numerous.\nThe monastery of Luxeuil, founded by St. Columbanus (d. 615), gave to the Diocese of Besan\u00e7on a series of saints.

Moreover, gene modulation efficacy of nonviral vectors have been hindered by numerous in vitro and in vivo barriers that have resulted in subviral performance. Specifically, delivery a vector must overcome barriers including the extracellular milieu, cellular uptake, escape from the endosomal compartments prior to trafficking to lysosomes, cytosolic transport and nuclear localization of the genetic cargo. This thesis describes the development of a second generation of bio-synthetic gene delivery vectors in the context of conducting a systematic structure-function assessment using a library of mannosylated poly(beta-amino esters). Through a top-down screening methodology, an optimized polymer was selected on the basis of gene delivery efficacy and was then selected as the compositional background for the synthesis of a stratified molecular weight polymer library. Moreover, by eliminating contributions of polymer compositional background, we were able to analyze gene delivery efficacy as a function of (1) polymer molecular weight, (2) relative mannose content, (3) polymer-membrane biophysical properties, (4) APC-uptake specificity, and (5) serum inhibition. In summary, the flexibility and potential of the hybrid design featured in this work highlights the ability to systematically probe vector-associated properties for the development of translational gene delivery candidates."}

{"idx": "12709", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have pointed to the opioid epidemic as an important factor. Figures from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention show that from 1999 to 2017, almost 218,000 people died from overdoses related to prescription opioids. During that period, the number of such deaths quintupled.\nThe drug most responsible for this catastrophic abuse of prescription opioids is OxyContin, produced by Purdue Pharma LP, which is reported to have made more than $31 billion from OxyContin sales.\nThe dominance of OxyContin among prescription opioids was not due to any inherent advantages; several carefully controlled trials concluded that it had none. It owed its success, instead, to Purdue\u2019s aggressive marketing, pioneered by Arthur Sackler.\nPurdue is a privately held company that has generated enormous wealth for Sackler, his brothers Mortimer and Raymond, and their descendants.\nArthur Sackler died in 1987, eight years before OxyContin was released, but he paved the way for OxyContin\u2019s success by directing his sales force to invite doctors to conferences at attractive locations in Florida, Arizona, and California, with all expenses paid.\nPurdue also offered them paid speaking engagements. Sales representatives received substantial bonuses that varied with the quantities of Purdue\u2019s drugs prescribed by the physicians they visited \u2013 particularly good salespeople earned bonuses of more than $200,000.\nThat changed last month, when the state of Massachusetts filed documents in a lawsuit against the company and 16 executives and members of the family, including Arthur Sackler\u2019s nephew, Richard Sackler.\nNew York City and other local governments have also added individual members of the Sackler family to their lawsuits seeking compensation for damages from Purdue.\nThe Massachusetts lawsuit alleges that members of the Sackler family continued to push sales of the drug long after they became aware that it was dangerous and addictive. The company\u2019s response was to redirect the blame.\nThe Sacklers have used some of their wealth to support the arts. Their names are on wings, galleries, and other spaces at many eminent museums, including the Metropolitan and Guggenheim museums in New York, the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, the Louvre in Paris, and the Royal Academy of Arts and the Tate in London.\nThere are also Sackler schools, institutes, libraries, or centers at Tufts, Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, Tel Aviv, and several other universities, and a Sackler lecture at Princeton University, where I teach.\nMore than a year ago, the New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organisations that received significant sums from foundations overseen by Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, who ran Purdue when it launched OxyContin. None indicated that they would return donations or refuse future donations.\nThere are grounds for arguing that Arthur Sackler\u2019s name can remain on the wing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that houses the spectacular Temple of Dendur. His marketing techniques breached ethical constraints on what pharmaceutical companies may do to persuade physicians to prescribe their products, but the real damage was done when these techniques were applied to a highly addictive drug like OxyContin.\nBy that time, Arthur was dead and his heirs had sold out of Purdue. So Elizabeth Sackler, too, is not responsible for what happened afterwards.\nWhether a"}

Markley says the 21-foot long bridge has been closed since September of 2015 and that has caused a lengthy detour on county roads. The old bridge was made of wood and the new one will be made with concrete and be wider, The $850,000 project is expected to help the flow of the creek. The Davis County Regional Trail project received $230,000.\nMarkley says this will develop the final segment of the multi-use trail and connect the Mutchler Community Center in Bloomfield on one end to the Davis County McGowen Recreation Wildlife Area on the other. \u201cThat wildlife area is 313 acre outdoor facility with about 3.5 miles of trails, fish ponds, unique prairie, campgrounds and a community garden,\u201d according the Markley. The total cost of the project is 461-thousand dollars.\nThe Story County Conservation Board won $300,000 dollars to pave part of the Heart of Iowa Nature Trail. \u201cThis project will pave two-point five miles of that existing limestone trail \u2014 connecting the cities of Slate and Huxley in Story County,\u201d Markley says. The total project will cost $939,000.\nKeokuk County received $328,000 to for a segment of the Lake Belva Deer Area Trail \u201cPaving 2.65 miles of a granular surface trail to connect an existing trail head near Sigourney,\u201d Markley says. \u201cSo, it would connect the trail head in Sigourney to the Belva Deer Park. That park is a 1,669 acre county park which includes a 260-acre recreational lake, modern campgrounds, as well as a primitive trail system.\u201d The cost of that project is $1.18 million dollars.\nThe other project will connect the Fort Madison Hospital to an existing trail \u2014 which includes a portion that passes through a wetland area on an elevated boardwalk. The project won a $91,000 grant. Markley says a mix of money is used for the projects.\nHe says it requires a minimum 25 percent local match and the Iowa Legislature annually puts money into the trails funds and this year they put in one million dollars. Markley says some past project came in under budget and a few did not get done, so there was one-point-three million dollars available. The State Recreational Trails Program was created in 1988 and Markley says the trail system has gone from being small local projects to become a regional and state system as more and more pieces have gotten done and that makes a longer and longer trail, and you can now get on a trail and ride for a day more.\nMarkley says there is a federal trails program too, that also has helped provide some of the money for the segments in Iowa."}

It may not be possible to avoid damage from them, but it is possible to be prepared.\nUnion County Emergency Management director Jo Anne Duckworth said the first thing to do to prepare for severe weather is to sign up for emergency alerts.\nThe Union County Emergency Notification System is the best option in our area. It is geo-coded so that residents can get only the alerts relevant to them.\n\"You can pick any community you like within the county,\" said Duckworth. \"So if you live in Afton but you work in Creston, you might want to get both of those areas.\"\nAdditionally, residents can pick the types of alerts they receive: warnings and/or watches for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, blizzards, floods or all severe weather.\nIf evacuation is impossible for someone because of not having a vehicle or if an extended power outage would put a resident at risk because they are dependant on electricity for things like oxygen or medication that must be refrigerated, the system permits individuals to specify special needs. This allows emergency management to check on the most vulnerable people first.\n\"I find that very valuable in my planning processes, \"Duckworth said.\nThe notification system has also been used for alerts such as water outages or when the city is doing smoke testing in sewers -- to keep people from panicking when they see smoke and overwhelming the emergency phone system.\nAccording to Duckworth, a communication plan is one of the most important and most overlooked parts of being prepared for severe weather. Everyone should know how to reach their family members in an emergency.\nIn case of an area wide emergency, families should choose an out of state contact who everybody calls to say, \"This is where I am, and I&apos;m safe.\"\n\"It sure takes a lot of worry off the plate,\" said Duckworth.\nAnother often overlooked preparation for a disaster is to have insurance.\nRenter&apos;s insurance is particularly important because there are rarely programs geared towards renters after a disaster.\n\"It can make the difference between recovering or never recovering from a loss,\" Duckworth said.\nDuckworth explained that residents should have two plans: a plan to stay and a plan to leave.\nIf the situation requires staying in their homes for an extended period, they should have three days&apos; worth of non-perishable food that does require cooking and three gallons of water, per person, per day, for at least three days.\nFor situations where evacuation is needed, residents should have a plan for how to leave and where to go.\nAn emergency kit in a 5-gallon bucket is an easy way to keep all of your emergency supplies together -- whether you need to evacuate or not. It is relatively secure and easy to grab in an emergency.\nDuckworth said the kit should include a passworded USB drive with vital information. A second USB drive should be stored in a bank box or with a trusted friend or family member out of state.\nDriver&apos;s license records, bank accounts, medical and other insurance information, prescription and pharmacy records and important phone numbers should be stored on the USB drive.

The wall, after all, seemed meaningless: with the program lacking even a Southeastern Conference title game appearance since 2000, none of them appeared on it.\nAnd, the players say, the program's history wasn't relevant during the Ron Zook era.\n\"It wasn't a big deal around here,\" senior free safety Jarvis Herring said. \"But it is now.

The old guys stopped before some of the photos, pointing to themselves, their smiles dwarfed only by the ones from their families.\nSuddenly, decoration became motivation. The wall means something, and the players, particularly Florida's eight fifth-year seniors, want their faces on it before they graduate.\nThat mission starts tonight, when the Gators open their conference season by facing Tennessee at 8.

No player proved that more than Herring, now a co-captain, who spent a night in jail last summer after an incident downtown.\nAnd don't forget how the veterans' time here started.

{"idx": "12727", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Was That the Best Super Bowl Ever?\nSomewhat incredibly, eleven men have quarterbacked their team to two Super Bowl victories. (Working from a sample size of 46 games, that sorta seems like a lot.) One of them is now Eli Manning. One of them is not Peyton Manning, Dan Marino, or Brett Favre. Manning is 31 years old and one of the five men to have won multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. It used to seem strange \u2014 as recently, honestly, as mid-December \u2014 that Eli Manning had once won a Super Bowl MVP. When will it stop feeling weird that he has two?\nOne of the most fascinating \u2014 and impressive \u2014 aspects of Manning's two Super Bowl MVPs is that each time he has beaten Tom Brady, Brady played outstanding. (Lunatics notwithstanding.) Manning hasn't won two Super Bowls because somebody choked, or because the Giants caught a bunch of breaks, or because the Giants played conservatively to limit his mistakes, Dilfer-style. He has gone out and won these games, on his own. It's strange, because even in winning the MVPs, Manning has a way of blending into the background. The most famous plays from each game are considered more the result of the receiver's brilliance (David Tyree four years ago, Mario Manningham last night) rather than Manning's initial throw. (They're \"The Catch,\" not \"The Pass.\") But Manning made both plays happen, from his mad scramble for space and time in Glendale to an absolutely perfect pass to Manningham, in the only place he could catch it. The Giants won each Super Bowl because of Eli Manning. He made them happen.\nThis is really quite amazing. Much has been made about the fact that we have gone from \"is Manning elite?\" to \"is Manning a Hall-of-Famer?\" in the matter of about five weeks. But of course any notion of Manning as a Hall-of-Famer exists solely because of eight postseason games. You have to pick the right eight postseason games, too: In seasons in which the Giants don't win the Super Bowl, Manning is 0\u20133 in postseason games. Manning's regular season stats don't measure up \u2014 not even close \u2014 to current and impending Hall of Fame quarterbacks. He has built a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the Hall of Fame \u2014 he has secured his place as one of the most important quarterbacks, and New York City athletes, of the last 25 years \u2014 essentially over two separate months of work.\nThis is more common in other sports, specifically baseball. David Freese can go nuts for a fortnight and go down in history; David Eckstein, Jermaine Dye, and Mike Lowell have all won World Series MVPs in the last decade. Now, obviously, Manning is a better football player than all those men were baseball players, and he's smack in the middle of every play, after all. But so much of the narrative of Important Quarterbacks is about building, establishing, and securing legacies brick-by-brick, the way that Brady has, the way that Peyton has, the way that Elway (the foundation of the whole narrative, really) did. Eli has not done this. He has quarterbacked an underdog that sneaked into the postseason twice now, and he has bum-rushed the stage each time. Heck, if he does this again \u2014 and hey, why not? \u2014 he'll have more Super Bowl MVPs than"}

I will speak with the minister to see what we can get from the subvention from the SDF and then we can talk with Whitmore [about a new deal],\" Ricketts said in an earlier interview.\nHowever, a source close to the Ministry of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport, while confirming that a meeting is scheduled to take place this week with Grange and Ricketts, told The Sunday Gleaner that there are concerns that the JFF has resigned itself to relying on securing additional public funds, as opposed to examining other options which the ministry will be bringing to the table during the discussions.\nIt is our understanding that Grange herself was left disappointed that Ricketts and his team had apparently not exhausted all options before taking a position to request additional subvention ahead of their meeting.\nOur ministry insider underlined that while there is no aversion to providing available funding where absolutely necessary, Grange and her team - who apparently reached out to the JFF about the situation with Whitmore - are keen to temper expectations and are of the mindset that there are other options that can be engaged at this point.\nOptions, our source pointed out, included the FIFA Forward project, which provides up to US$500,000 ($63.7 million) per year for administrative and governance costs to each member association, as a part of a wider US$5 million ($636 million) subvention provided by the sport's global authority, over a five-year cycle.\n\"The focus will essentially be to mediate, put everyone together and see what is the best solution going forward,\" the source noted. \"It is important to look at all options and how we can resolve the situation between the coach (Whitmore) and the JFF.

The arrangement is supposed to foster innovation, but it also fosters frustration among users who can't get the latest version of Android in a timely manner--or in some cases, at all. It has also fostered a fragmented ecosystem that's vulnerable to attacks by hackers.\nAware of the \"instant gratification\" problem with Android, Google made a move to address it at last week's I/O developers conference with the release of a Platform Development Kit (PDK) for its OEMs. The kit does for hardware makers what a Software Development Kit (SDK) does for software writers.\nHowever, even if PDKs speed up the adoption process, they aren't likely to have much impact on the initial release of Jelly Bean. Android 4.2 or even 5.0 may be released before many users see Jelly Bean--if they ever do. After all, Jelly Bean's predecessor, Ice Cream Sandwich, introduced in October 2011, is currently on only 10 percent of Android devices.\nWhich Phones Will Get Android 4.1?\nNevertheless, some Android devices will have Jelly Bean out of the gate. Google-branded phones--the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus--will have it, as will the company's new tablet, the Nexus 7, made by Asus.\nMotorola's Xoom tablet will have the new version of the OS, too. The company hasn't made any statements about when Jelly Bean might arrive on its smartphones, such as the Razr; but now that the company's mobile division is part of Google, it is likely to adopt Jelly Bean sooner rather than later. Google completed its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola's mobile business in May.\nSamsung, which makes the Nexus phones for Google, will probably be quick to bring Jelly Bean to some of its phone models, especially its hot new Galaxy S III. In a statement to Pocket-lint, the Korean handset maker said that it will \"soon\" announce devices that it deems suitable for Jelly Bean.\nAs for handset makers HTC, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson), and LG, Pocket-lint predicts that Jelly Bean will not arrive on their hardware anytime soon. LG acknowledged to the website that it is too busy trying to implement Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) to put much emphasis on Jelly Bean.\nOf course the wild card in Google's grand design for Jelly Bean and future Android rollouts is what will happen in the messy patent lawsuit between Samsung and Apple in California. That litigation has already resulted in Samsung's being barred from selling its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet and Galaxy Nexus smartphone in the United States.\nAlthough Google isn't directly involved in the legal wrangle, elements of Android are.

This doesn\u2019t mean unity on all issues: liberal Democrats are far more likely than other Democrats to favor legalizing marijuana, ending the death penalty, and\u2014significantly\u2014a government takeover of our healthcare system. The early skirmishing over Bernie Sanders-style \u201cMedicare for All\u201d may develop into a major fault-line as the intra-party debate intensifies.\nToday liberals outnumber moderates by more than 20 points among today\u2019s white Democrats, and conservative white Democrats are an endangered species. By contrast, African-Americans are more likely to consider themselves moderate than liberal, and twice as likely as whites to call themselves conservative. These findings help explain why Sen. Bernie Sanders did disproportionately well among whites but overwhelmingly lost to Hillary Clinton among African-Americans.\nComparing Table 2 with Table 1, we see that during the years from Bush to Trump, the liberal share of whites rose by 20 points, compared to just 8 points for African-Americans and 9 points for Hispanics. We also see that African-Americans are about as likely to think of themselves as moderate as they were in 2001-2006.\nEducation matters as well. During the 18-year period Gallup studied, the share of Democrats with a BA or more rose from 27 percent to 35 percent. The bulk of the gains occurred among whites, where those with at least a four-year degree increased by 13 points, from 29 percent to 42 percent, compared to 3 points for African-Americans (from 21 to 24 percent) and just 1 point for Hispanics (19 to 20 percent).\nEducation is linked to ideological orientation. 58 percent of Democrats with BAs, and 65 percent of those with post-graduate degrees, regard themselves as liberal, compared to only 32 percent with a high school diploma or less.\nWhat stands out is that highly educated white Democrats are far more likely to self-identify as liberal than are African-Americans (or Hispanics) at equivalent levels of education. In fact, the 25-point gap between highly educated whites and highly educated African-Americans is identical to the gap between highly educated and less educated whites.\nBut doesn\u2019t the emergence of millennials in the Democratic party change this picture? Not as much as one might expect. In the first place, the share of 18 to 29-year-olds in the party has risen by only 4 points, from 17 to 21 percent, in the period Gallup studied, while the share 50 and over has increased from 45 to 48 percent. And second, age cohorts don\u2019t differ as much ideologically as they once did. The liberal share of Democrats"}

{"idx": "12743", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: While advertising itself is competitive, the business of securing airtime is concentrated, a study finds.\nThe combined market power held by a handful of media-buying agencies poses a serious threat to television broadcasters, according to a special report prepared by the Israel Antitrust Authority.\nThe report, obtained by TheMarker, found that competition among advertising agencies is intense, with dozens of large agencies holding a 40% aggregate market share and dozens of others holding sometimes no more than 1%. The financial barrier to entering the field is relatively low.\nThe problem, according to the report, has to do with agencies buying up airtime to ensure that their clients' message reaches a large number of consumers.\nOver the last decades, ad agencies have begun setting up their own media-buying units or banding together to give them better bargaining power when it comes to setting rates and other terms with television broadcasters. Advertisers who buy airtime jointly enjoy immense leverage, according to the report. In addition to helping them secure the best placement - the first ad in a commercial break, for example - it also saves them money.\n\"Media-buying involves many fewer competitors than ad agencies,\" said the report, adding that one firm, McCann Erickson, enjoys a market share of more than 30%, while several others (TMF, Zenith, MediaCom and Union Media ) hold between 14% and 18% of the market. Several advertisers and ad agencies also buy media directly without going through ad placement firms.\nThe antitrust authority began work on the report after two ad agencies, Baumann Ber Rivnay (Saatchi & Saatchi Israel ) and Gitam BBDO, asked to merge their media-buying operations.\nThe report is considered a driving force behind Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo's recent decision to bar TMF and Zenith Israel from jointly buying advertising time. Gilo has said he plans to look into broader strategies for dealing with the issue as well.\nThe report is scheduled to be presented on February 28 at aconference on competition sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nThe antitrust authority first dealt with the matter in 2008 when it refused to allow Reuveni Pridan and Shalmor Avnon Amichay (Young & Rubicam ) to maintain their partnership with United Media. Both agencies were controlled by the international Interpublic Group and it was thought that they would therefore wield too much combined power.\n\"The partnership held about a 40% market share,\" said the report. \"Upon examination it revealed rising market concentration in media purchasing and an increase in fees paid by television stations. The large media buyers grew larger while the small firms disappeared from the market.\"\nBut in 2010 the commissioner decided to allow Universal McCann and the Glickman advertising agency to combine their media-buying efforts for three years. \"An examination of the industry today shows a change in trend of concentration that was seen in the past,\" the decision said.\nNow, following its more in-depth study, the commission's viewpoint has apparently changed again. The report outlines four components of the advertising market: companies advertising their products and services, ad agencies, media planners and buyers, and the media itself. It focuses primarily on television, which captures more than 40% of all advertising spending in Israel. According to the report, television is characterized by fixed costs that aren't affected - at least in the short-term - by the number of viewers or the sale of airtime; therefore, lost revenue can't be compensated for by lowering expenses.\nOn the other hand, the supply of TV advertising"}

Since then, Rolle's only stint as a software engineer has been at a start-up that laid him off after one month.\n\"I see everybody spending all their days going to networking meetings, calling their friends, doing all the various things people tell you to do, and after months of that, they're still looking,\" said Rolle, 57, of Cupertino. \"Why work so hard?\"\nWith about $40,000 in credit card debt, Rolle would need to officiate five games a day to stay even. Since that's not likely to happen, he figures he'll have to file for bankruptcy protection in about four months. But he might as well do something he enjoys. Umpiring is \"good exercise, it's fun,\" he said, \"and you get to be with kids.\"\nAs the Silicon Valley cave-in enters its third year, thousands of Michael Rolles are emerging, hunkering down and pinching pennies instead of responding to every Internet job posting. Thousands more keep slogging away, attending workshops on resume writing and interviewing skills.\nPlenty of others have changed careers -- or left the Valley altogether. Santa Clara County lost 14,564 people in 2001, the most recent year tallied by the California Department of Finance. That's the biggest net exodus since at least 1970.\nSo, not many high-tech casualties were shocked last week when the state released new figures showing that officials had dramatically underestimated Silicon Valley's job losses since 2000. \"The pain people were feeling was based on reality, as opposed to the junk the state was feeding us,\" said Richard Carlson, chairman of Mountain View forecasting firm Spectrum Economics Inc.\nThe low-ball statistics, based on sampling, had gauged Santa Clara County's losses at about 115,000 jobs. The more accurate figures peg the damage at 175,000, or about 16% of all jobs in the county outside farming. For San Francisco and Silicon Valley as a whole, the losses added up to 275,400, or 13% of the nonfarm total.\nThat means the Valley's comedown is worse than Los Angeles' after the aerospace industry decline that began in 1990. In L.A.'s two most desperate years, 400,000 jobs disappeared, but they amounted to only 10% of the nonfarm whole.\nIn fact, Silicon Valley's fall is unmatched in state history since the Great Depression, when some regions lost 25% of their jobs, according to Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. What's more, the new statistics show that the number of people working in Silicon Valley has fallen back to the level in 1996, when the dot-com boom was barely underway.\nThe scale of the disaster foretells a longer road to recovery. \"We thought we had 100,000 jobs to make up,\" Carlson said. \"In an expansion, you can do that naturally in four or five years.

Today, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) confirmed that he has nominated the restaurateur and humanitarian for the 2019 award.\nDelaney, who has already announced his presidential campaign for 2020, said he could not discuss any specifics of his nomination or what motivated it. The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the annual prize, discourages nominators from making any public announcements. The deadline for nominations is Feb. 1, and the committee will announce the laureates next October.\nThe Nobel Foundation did not immediately respond to an email about Andr\u00e9s\u2019s nomination. According to its website, the Nobel committee \u201cdoes not itself announce the names of nominees, neither to the media nor to the candidates themselves.\u201d The committee also doesn\u2019t reveal any information about nominees until 50 years after the award is first announced.\nLast year, according to the committee, there were 331 candidates, the second-highest number ever. The record was 376 candidates in 2016.\nOnly certain individuals are allowed to submit nominees. They include people who have previously won, past and current members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and current members of a national assembly, such as the House of Representatives.\nWhen reached by phone, Andr\u00e9s characteristically downplayed the nomination.\nBut on further reflection, Andr\u00e9s said the nomination just underscores the growing importance of food in U.S. politics. Food plays a role in national security, public health, even in immigration given that so many restaurant kitchens are run by immigrants from Central America.\nAndr\u00e9s\u2019s nomination comes as little surprise. As the face of ThinkFoodGroup, the parent company behind Jaleo, Oyamel, Minibar and other Washington-area restaurants, Andr\u00e9s has been spending as much time in disaster zones as in kitchens over the past year or so.

Each subcommittee consists of four or five members of the 11-member Port Authority board, which doesn\u2019t constitute a quorum. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t trigger the law\u2019s requirement that the meetings and minutes be open to the public.\nBut the subcommittees are not required to meet privately. The difference is important, especially considering the history of the inland port.\nThe Port Authority has been under intense scrutiny since its creation earlier this year. Salt Lake City\u2019s leaders worry it may seek to usurp the city\u2019s ability to zone within its own borders. The authority\u2019s own conflict-of-interest rules, and the light cast by reporting from this newspaper, have caused two original members to resign because they have property interests nearby.\nSome members of the public are skeptical as to how the authority will handle sensitive issues. The chairwoman of the Westpointe Community Council told the Deseret News that west-side residents and other community members have a high level of distrust in the authority because of the way state lawmakers established it, mostly behind closed doors.\nA lot of money is at stake. The Port Authority will set up a customs and distribution center to potentially handle billions of dollars in goods.\nThe only way to counter distrust is to operate with complete transparency and openness, even if that means going beyond what is required. Closed doors breed suspicion.\nWe understand the arguments for secrecy. The subcommittees have no real authority to enact anything. Their decisions eventually must be presented to the full authority board for final action in public meetings. Similar arguments come up whenever any subdivision of an open board wants to meet in secret.\n\" The only way to counter distrust is to operate with complete transparency and openness, even if that means going beyond what is required. Closed doors breed suspicion. \"\nThey are weak arguments. Typically, the real negotiating occurs in the subcommittee meetings, away from public glare.

And the International Olympic Committee, which takes ten per cent of all of the money generated by the games, stands to earn more than ever in this Olympic cycle.\nMultinational sponsors were quick to jump on the Rio 2016 bandwagon. As far back as 2011, Mexican media mogul Carlos Slim reportedly paid Rio's organising committee $ 320m to secure sponsorship for his firm, America Movil, dwarfing the sums paid by brands for London. Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil's biggest banks coughed up a similar sum. At the time, Slim was the richest person in the world and Brazil's economy was growing at 7.5 per cent a year.\nFast forward five years and the host nation's economy is in freefall, the companies and politicians delivering the games are embroiled in the biggest corruption case in Brazil's history. The Zika virus, pollution, unfinished venues and industrial-scale doping have taken their toll. In a recent poll, nearly six out of ten people from countries around the world said doping has had a negative effect on the level of attention they will pay the Games.\nThere have been far fewer social media conversations about the Olympics in the run-up to Rio 2016 than before London 2012, and of those, much less are expressing a positive sentiment, according social media posts by Mindshare.\nBut many sports marketing experts don't see this having a significant impact on sponsors bottom lines. \u201cThese issues are nothing new for the Olympic Movement or sport in general and athletes can continually command year-on-year above inflation endorsement fees,\u201dsays Ben Bradley, business director at MEC Wavemeker.\n\u201cThe true test will be in four years time at Tokyo 2020.\u201d Companies big and small are seemingly undeterred. \u201cThe prospect of live sport on a global scale is enough to ensure the variety of IOC, team and athlete sponsors will get a good return on investment,\u201d says Rupert Pratt, director of Mongoose, which negotiates sponsorship deals for sporting events.\nSmaller businesses are looking to Rio 2016 as the number one sporting event to boost sales according to Barclays figures.

When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route.\nSeveral major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path.\nIt is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway). At these stores, the parking lots are full of cars, but I seldom see a bicycle. I have found three bicycle-friendly routes that will get you to the area of Costco, Lowes and Office Depot without having to negotiate through a lot of traffic.\n1. From east Medford: get on Springbrook Road, which has bike lanes along most of its length, and head north. Turn left on Delta Waters, which also has bike lanes. Head west, crossing Crater Lake Highway at the traffic lights. Don&apos;t dally crossing at these lights as they don&apos;t stay green very long. Delta Waters turns into Lear Way which will take you to all the big-box stores.\n2. From Poplar Drive, anywhere north of McAndrews Road: Poplar Drive has bike lanes. Head north and cross Highway 62 at the traffic signals. These lights also change quickly from a bicyclist&apos;s perspective. After crossing Highway 62, Poplar becomes Bullock Road. Look to your right for a paved bike lane, just before Elite Motorsports on the right. If you pass Lithia Body and Paint and the batting cages on the left, you have gone too far. Turn right on the paved Medco Haul Road bike path. It climbs a short hill and then proceeds along the edge of the airport for 1.3 miles. Turn right on Commerce Drive and right on Lear Way, which passes behind Costco and the other stores.\n3. From the Bear Creek Greenway: travel northward. Be cautious riding on the Greenway bike path as it has unmarked bumps and cracks hiding in the shadows which could dislodge you from your bike if you hit them unexpectedly.\nFrom where the bike path goes under McAndrews Road, it&apos;s about 1.3 miles to where you turn right onto the path that leaves the Greenway to get to Hilton Court. Look for a green sign on the greenway that says \"Biddle Road\" with a picture of a bicycle. Upon entering Hilton Court, cross the street to get into the eastbound turn lane.\nTurn left at the traffic light at the intersection with Biddle Road (which has bike lanes). Then turn right into the Bureau of Land Management entrance and follow their access road until you reach Bullock Road. Take a right on Bullock and proceed about four-tenths of a mile. (If you miss the BLM turn, go to the next traffic signal and turn right on Lawndale Road, then right onto Bullock Road.) Be alert on Bullock Road as there are no shoulders, vehicles seem to travel fast and drivers are often reluctant to share the road.\nBefore approaching the raised median divider on Bullock (as you approach Lithia Body and Paint), cross the oncoming traffic lane and get on the sidewalk in front of Elite Motorsports. Proceed about 50 yards and turn left onto the Medco Haul Road bike path. From here follow directions as described"}

By and large, making prevention happen \u2014 and finding the money for it \u2014 is left to local governments, which experts say are often ill-equipped to handle the job.\nSo far, state officials are declining to pay for certain Zika-preventive services through Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor and disabled. The federal government announced on Wednesday that states could use Medicaid funds to pay for mosquito repellants and family planning services to reduce pregnant women\u2019s risk for contracting Zika, which has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect that causes babies to have abnormally small heads and improper brain development.\nWhile Texas health officials are stressing the importance of prevention in legislative hearings, public service announcements and on a central website, on Thursday a government spokesman said Texas has not yet decided whether it will allow Medicaid to pay for the additional preventive services, such as mosquito repellant.\nBryan Black, a spokesman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said the agency was still \u201creviewing\u201d the federal government's proposal.\n\u201cFor several months, the agencies that make up the Texas Health and Human Services System have been collaborating to pursue every avenue to protect our citizens from this potential health crisis,\u201d Black said in a prepared statement.\nTexas has a decentralized system of public health programs that largely makes counties responsible for disease prevention services, such as mosquito control and monitoring. Experts say that arrangement means there is little uniformity in the state\u2019s preparedness for preventing infectious diseases \u2014 and will almost certainly leave Texans in the poorest parts of the state more vulnerable to Zika.\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito is prevalent in some of the state\u2019s most impoverished regions, such as the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas.\n\u201cWhere you are going to see the problems is in the high poverty areas,\u201d said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health.\nLocal health departments in Zika-vulnerable areas say they are struggling to provide preventive services because they don't have the money \u2014 and in some cases the jurisdiction \u2014 to address problems.\nLack of funding has hamstrung Hidalgo County's ability to eradicate mosquitos, Eduardo Olivarez, chief administrative officer of Hidalgo County Health and Human Services, recently told the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.

{"idx": "12761", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: As more and more Internet-connected devices find their way into our homes and businesses, it\u2019s important to remember that they represent a security risk. The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly, and in the rush for convenience, our privacy and safety is often an afterthought. Leaving them unsecured is the digital equivalent of leaving the back door unlocked.\nThere are 5.5 million new things getting connected every day in 2016, as we head toward more than 20 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. That\u2019s an awful lot of devices. They might bring all sorts of handy new features, but, whether it\u2019s the latest cutting-edge baby monitor or a wireless doorbell camera that links to your phone, it\u2019s also a network-connected computer and should be treated as such. Here are eight tips to help you secure those IoT devices.\nThe first step is to consider what functionality you need from the device. Just because your TV or fridge can connect to the internet, doesn\u2019t mean you definitely want to hook it up. Take a good look at the features it offers and learn exactly what internet connectivity brings before you connect.\nMany Wi-Fi routers support guest networking so that visitors can connect to your network without gaining access to shared files or networked devices. This kind of separation also works well for IoT devices that have questionable security.\nIt\u2019s very important to pick strong passwords, but you must also make sure that you pick a different password for every device. If a hacker manages to get one of your passwords, they will typically try it with other services and devices. Reusing passwords is not a good idea. Use a password manager to keep track of all your passwords.\nSadly, UPnP can make routers, printers, cameras and other devices vulnerable to attack. It\u2019s designed to make it easier to network devices without configuration by helping them automatically discover each other. The problem is that hackers can also potentially discover them from beyond your local network because of vulnerabilities in the UPnP protocol. Is best to turn UPnP off completely.\nIf you want to make sure you have the latest security patches and reduce the chances of a successful attack, then you need to keep your firmware fully updated. Vulnerabilities and exploits will be fixed as they emerge, so your IoT devices and your router need to be regularly updated. Automate this wherever possible or set a schedule to check for updates every three months or so.\nDon\u2019t take your personal IoT devices to work. There are lots of potential security concerns for wearables. Every enterprise should have a clear BYOD policy, and it\u2019s often a good idea to prohibit personal IoT devices from connecting to the network, or at least limit them to a guest network.\nBusinesses need to track everything connected to the network and monitor the flow of traffic. Devices need to be assessed to determine the level of access they should have, to keep them fully patched and up to date, and to protect data end-to-end to preserve its integrity. Unknown devices should flag an alert. Understanding which devices are connected and what they\u2019re doing is a prerequisite for proper security."}

Congress has been funding the government in short spurts since October, and couldn't stop a three-day government shutdown in January.\nBut an agreement in February broke a monthslong stalemate and set the parameters to write a funding bill for the final six months of the fiscal year.\nThe comprehensive spending bill, known as an omnibus, includes funding for every corner of the government, from entitlements to overseas wars, education and farm subsidies. Omnibus bills are often filled with measures known as policy riders \u2014 specific carve outs of policy that often have little to do with funding the government but involve a specific, and usually partisan, issue.\nHouse and Senate negotiators of both parties are in the final and most difficult stage of negotiations, working out the terms even as most Republicans in the House \u2014 and many in the Senate \u2014 are expected to vote against it, leaving the bill\u2019s eventual passage mostly to Democrats.\nRep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., said that he hopes the final bill includes items he supports, including additional protections for health care workers against contributing to abortion procedures. But he said that won\u2019t be enough to persuade him to vote for a bill that is expected to increase domestic and defense funding by nearly $400 billion over the next two years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can put enough good with enough poison to make it good enough to get to the place to vote for it,\u201d said Walker, chairman of the House GOP's 170-member Republican Study Committee.\nOne issue holding up a final deal is funding for a rail project connecting New York and New Jersey. The Gateway Project, which was approved by then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Obama administration in 2015, has been an important priority for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Waterboarding, too, was acceptable because it did not cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture, the 2002 Justice Department memo says.\nThe release last week of a Senate report cataloging years of such interrogation tactics has revived debate about legal opinions since discredited and withdrawn and about the decision to not prosecute the program\u2019s architects or officers who used the methods. Civil rights groups in the United States and abroad are renewing calls to prosecute those who relied on techniques that President Barack Obama has called torture.\n\u201cHow can we seriously use the phrase \u2018rule of law\u2019 if crimes of this magnitude go uninvestigated and unprosecuted?\u201d said ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer.\nThe Justice Department, which spent years looking into the matter, says it lacks sufficient evidence to convict anyone and found no new information in the report. It also is far from clear that any international case could be brought.\nDepartment officials said they will not revisit their 2012 decision to close the investigation, citing among other challenges the passage of time and the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that crimes were committed, especially in light of government memos that gave interrogators extraordinary latitude.\n\u201cOur inquiry was limited to a determination of whether prosecutable offenses were committed. Importantly, our investigation was not intended to answer the broader questions regarding the propriety of the examined conduct,\u201d the department said in a statement after the Senate report was released.\nThat conclusion followed a criminal investigation led by special prosecutor John Durham that begun in 2009 as an outgrowth of a probe into the destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogation tactics.

In closing the investigation, the department said it had examined the cases of roughly 100 detainees alleged to have been in U.S. custody, but did not find enough evidence to convict anyone.\nThe investigation focused on instances in which interrogators went beyond what was approved in memos from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. The Obama administration had stipulated that interrogators would not face charges if they followed legal guidelines set forth in the memos, which have been rescinded.\nIn great detail, the Bush administration memos explored the legality under the federal torture statute of varied interrogation methods contemplated by the CIA. The analysis established parameters for conduct, assuring the agency that actions now defined by the Obama administration as torture were within legal bounds. The government has defended such tactics as valuable in extracting intelligence in the aftermath of Sept. 11 as the country feared another attack.\nThe government gave itself permission to use the techniques by defining torture \u201cin such a way that almost any action could fall"}

Henry Hyde, the venerable chairman of the House International Relations Committee.\nThat is why his March 25 letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell is so important. It is a plea to deflect Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's wall around the Holy Land from its planned position blocking the Scriptural pathway of Jesus Christ.\n\"I fear that important religious sites will become museums for commercial purposes and will no longer be maintained as places of spiritual worship shared by billions across the world,\" Hyde, a prominent Roman Catholic layman, told Powell.\nAs Holy Week approached, he asked the secretary's help to \"ensure that the Stations of the Cross are not cut off from each other, preventing the normal celebrations of Easter and the commemoration of the last days of Christ.\"\nThat raises the question of whether the Bush administration will confront Israel on this issue. Sharon's government last year abruptly cut off negotiations with the Vatican.\nCatholic clergy and laity from the U.S., inspecting the deplorable conditions for Christians in the Holy Land, have found the attitude of the Israeli military and bureaucracy ranges from uncooperative to hostile.\nWhen worried Catholics first visited Hyde last year to tell him of the havoc wrought by Sharon's wall, he told them to come back with proof. A delegation headed by the Rev. Donald Rooney of Fredericksburg, Va., and the Rev. John J. Podsiadlo of Baltimore did just that in March. They returned to Hyde bearing photographs, taken despite the objections of Israeli soldiers.\n\"If we do not turn the tide of events,\" Fathers Rooney and Podsiadlo wrote after they returned, \"Christian charity, sacred sites and the living Christian community in the Holy Land will be destroyed.\" The wall, the priests said, \"could forever change the Holy Land and the people who live in and visit this cherished historic land.\"\nWith corroborating evidence supplied by his own staffer sent to investigate, Hyde was convinced. In his letter to Powell, he laid out the problems created by the Sharon wall.\nAn 8-meter high concrete wall will completely enclose the last passage from Bethany to the Mount of Olives, restricting the Palm Sunday procession from Bethpage into Jerusalem.\nAccess will be blocked to the Sisters of Emmanuel Monastery north of Bethlehem. A proposed route of the wall will separate the convent and school of the Rosary Sisters. The process also is certain to accelerate the continuing Israeli expropriation of West Bank land still held by the dwindling Christian community there.\nHenry Hyde is no Israeli-basher. \"I would never criticize Israel for building that fence,\" he told me. He said he is just trying to set in motion \"some negotiations\" to protect the Christian holy places.\nThe problem is that the Sharon government won't negotiate. The Vatican charges that Israel has violated the 1993 agreement between Rome and Israel guaranteeing West Bank land owned by the Catholic Church. Sharon has refused to enforce the concordat.\nThe Rev. David Jaeger, representing the Holy See, is a native-born Israeli citizen who has been working on this problem for 27 years but has run into the Sharon wall.

While many establishment Republicans have pushed for the ... let's say, Parexit, a surprising number of US businesses opposed the decision, on grounds that it will weaken the US's global competitiveness.\nAmong the most surprising combatants are oil giants like Exxon and Shell. Exxon's new CEO, Darren Woods, even wrote Trump a personal letter urging him to stay in the agreement. It's not that Woods and the other big oil magnates suddenly saw some polar bears and had their hearts grow three sizes; they are worried about a change in the global economic climate. See, most of the world has promised to transition to low carbon, and eventually carbon-free, energy sources. Many economists and industry insiders say the US will get left behind as the rest of the world transitions to a clean energy economy.\nSince last April, almost every country on the planet has signed the Paris climate agreement, a collective effort to limit global warming to 2\u02daC and try to keep it as close to 1.5\u02daC as possible. Exceptions include Syria (mired in a civil war) and Nicaragua (didn't think the Paris agreement was strong enough!). Each country submitted a commitment to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions, forging a sort of collective promise to share the economic burden of transitioning away from fossil fuels. The agreement is globally appealing because no single country wants to sacrifice prosperity or see its rivals gain an unfair advantage. \"In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, you have to restrict certain types of economic activities,\" says Rod Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Economics & Public Policy.\nTake the US. America promised a 26 to 28 percent reduction of 2005 levels by 2025. Part of getting to those numbers was enacting the Clean Power Plan. It puts heavy restrictions on emissions from coal power plants in an attempt to make coal-generated electricity more expensive, and therefore incentivize power companies to invest in cleaner energy sources. Obama's Climate Action Plan detailed numerous other efforts\u2014better fuel standards, home insulation requirements, forest protections\u2014to tip the scales in green energy's favor.\nTrump has promised to kill the Clean Power Plan, and he signed an executive order that rolls back much of the Climate Action Plan. He seems to want to get rid of all the regulations, regardless of how he swings on the Paris agreement.\nBut all this regulatory reversalism might be for naught. Photovoltaic and wind energy are now both cheaper than coal, so long as the sun is up and the wind is blowing (and new large-scale battery technology could make erase these intermittency issues). Given enough time, renewables could outscale fossil fuels.\nAnd the real change agent has been natural gas. Fracking has made gas so cheap that both coal and oil have lost market share to it. \"Wholesale changes in economy happen over time naturally; look at historic evolution of different fuel sources,\" says Godby. \"But in the past, these changes have been market driven, and this agreement seeks to drive and accelerate them by social choice.\"\nNatural gas is"}

On Thursday morning, the Architectural Review Board added its own endorsement when it unanimously gave the building's proposed design a green light. Its approval came with a few conditions, including ones relating to building signage and to public access to the building's restroom and cafe.\nAmong plans described at the Wednesday meeting of the historical board are a pair of two-story additions to the south-facing rear of the building. These upgrades will provide more gallery space and a more pleasing view from adjacent Heritage Park, and will be painted to differentiate new design elements from the building's original features, Garavaglia said.\n\"This is not a heavy-handed design project,\" he said.\nBoard members imposed three conditions on the project, voicing concerns about a planned front gate, a not-yet-commissioned exterior mural (not the historical Art Deco mural that decorates the interior), and proposed locations for air-conditioning units and an electrical transformer.\nCommunity members and local business Menlo Equities expressed gratitude that renovation efforts will improve the site that has been vacant for a decade.\n\"We are just delighted that something is to be done, and we can't think of better neighbors. This is just a wonderful addition to our community and our neighborhood,\" Channing Avenue resident Chet Frankenfield said.\nThe board approved waiving parking requirements for the historic site, which cannot accommodate on-site parking. Free city parking approximately 700 feet from the museum's future site will be available to museum visitors. Museum staff said they will work with the Public Works Department to address parking by designating the surrounding block of all-day street parking limited to two-hour parking.\n\"I can imagine where these people (displaced by the change) will park: in the national registered historical district,\" concerned resident Ken Alsman said.\nBoard Chair David Bower echoed Alsman's concerns but said addressing parking congestion falls outside of the purview of the Historical Resources Board.\nStaiger projected the Palo Alto History Museum will begin construction this summer and occupy the building next year.\nI hope that they do devote a section to Fritz Roth- a truly exceptional man, doctor, friend and fervant backer of Stanford Athletics. He took great care of me whenI was at Stanford competing in Rugby and football,and after graduation also. His nurse- Nicky Farmer was a real jewel also.\nThis is a bad idea. There just isn't enough history here in Palo Alto to justify this sort of expense. It's only a matter of time before there will be demands made on the taxpayers to provide money to operate, or maintain, this building, in one way or another.

More or less, yes. That's if it can be assumed that a president's budget assumptions for years ahead will become reality, always a dubious proposition.\n\u2014 \"I've ... put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower held this office, since before I was born.\"\n\u2014 \"As a percentage of our GDP, our discretionary spending \u2014 all the things that the Republicans are proposing cutting \u2014 is actually lower than it's been since Dwight Eisenhower.\"\nTHE FACTS: Obama hasn't achieved that yet, but he has at least proposed putting the nation on such a path with the hope of reaching that goal by the end of his presidency if he is re-elected.\nObama is talking about non-defense discretionary spending, the category of domestic spending that Congress can control year to year by deciding on priorities. It excludes entitlement spending, interest payments and other spending that is essentially locked in. His aim was to show that today's record trillion-dollar deficits were made necessary by the recession and unemployment, not by any wish by him to spend prolifically.\nThe administration's Office of Management and Budget projects that non-defense domestic spending will drop to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product in the 2015 budget year and 2.8 percent in 2016, from an estimated 3.9 percent this year. That would be the lowest since Congress achieved 2.2 percent at the end of Eisenhower's presidency.\nWhether that's really in the cards remains to be seen. Projections three or four years ahead don't carry much weight.\nMoreover, as the fact-checking organization PolitiFact pointed out when Obama compared himself to Eisenhower in February, the ledger is somewhat skewed because $54 billion in surface transportation money has been shifted from the discretionary spending column to mandatory spending, improving the bottom line on paper if not in reality."}

{"idx": "12792", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In the wake of a senseless tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary, many people are asking, \"Where was God?\" Our hearts are broken with the tragic loss of innocent life in Connecticut, and we pray daily for the God's comfort and peace for the shattered lives of the families of these victims. But still people will ask, \"Why didn't God stop this?\" That is a question that deserves an answer.\nThe truth may be that God was made unwelcome and left. God submits himself to the law of faith, and will not go where he is not wanted. He will not force us to put with him if we don't want him around. It may be that his protective presence is being removed from our land and from our schools because he has been told repeatedly that his protective presence is not wanted.\nWe have, as a culture, systematically booted God from our public schools for over five decades.. In 1962, the Supreme Court issued a diktat that American schools could no longer seek his help and protection. In 1963, the Supreme Court issued a second diktat prohibiting the reading of his Word in our public schools. And in 1980, the Supreme Court issued a third diktat prohibiting the display or teaching of the Ten Commandments, God's abiding and transcendent moral standard for human conduct.\nSo God is no longer prayed to, his counsel is no longer sought and his standards are no longer respected. Is it any wonder that he might not be around when we need him? If we have spent 50 years telling him to get lost, it should not come as a surprise that we eventually begin to feel the absence of his powerful presence.\nThere is a sobering segment in the book of Ezekiel (8:1-11:25) which describes the glory of the Lord slowly, gradually and reluctantly departing from the temple and from the nation. God speaks there of the \"abominations\" that \"drive me far from my sanctuary\" (8:6). Included in these abominations: \"the land is full of blood and the city full of injustice\" (9:9).\nAs a result, God's presence was slowly withdrawn from the temple and from the people. It moved from the \"inner court\" (8:3) to the \"threshold\" of the temple (9:3), to the \"east gate\" of the temple (10:19), and finally \"to the mountain that is on the east side of the city\" (11:23). And then He was gone. His glory, his power, his protection, his manifest presence was driven from the land by its rebellion, defiance and immorality.\nBut his manifest presence is a different thing. That's when God's power, blessing and protection is seen, felt, manifest. And God has given to us the responsibility to draw forth his manifest, protecting presence through our public acknowledgement of our need for him. This we have obstinately refused to do in our schools for half a century. If God is to be taken at his word, it should surprise no one that we are now reaping the bitter fruit of our defiance.\nBenjamin Franklin famously broke a nearly-terminal deadlock at the Constitutional Convention by driving our Founding Fathers to their knees. He reminded them of Psalm 127, which says \"Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build labor in vain.\" The Psalmist then adds, \"Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain\" (127:1).\nAn observant reader will notice that the \"watchman\" is still"}

It\u2019s how wealth tilts the playing field.\nIf you can choose from 18 sports and 150 clubs, you have more chances to excel.\nLast week, the Justice Department announced it was prosecuting a handful of wealthy parents who allegedly paid enormous sums to fraudulently get their children admitted to elite colleges. The idea that wealth can buy slots in the \u201cmeritocracy\u201d offended many. But behind that overt cheating is a plethora of less obvious ways the college admissions system unfairly favors the children of the well-off. Most notably, college athletics scholarships are rigged in favor of kids from wealthy backgrounds \u2014 even if they don\u2019t cheat.\nHere are some rough facts: Approximately two million high school graduates apply to college each year. A handful of institutions \u2014 namely the Ivy League schools of Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University, as well as Caltech, Stanford University, MIT, University of Chicago, Duke University and Northwestern University \u2014 are the most elite gatekeepers for the meritocracy.

Thus, about 1 percent of the nation\u2019s students attend these most elite private schools.\nThese schools accept a substantial number of athletes. Princeton has 990 varsity athletes, nearly as many as the University of Michigan with 1,011 \u2014 even though Princeton\u2019s student population is five times smaller. Harvard, with a student population of 6,800, has 1,200 athletes. Demonstrated achievement in athletics, therefore, provides a significant route into elite schools and so do exceptional talent in music, theater and science. Participation in international piano competitions, winning a national science competition or captaining a champion debate team makes an applicant more desirable to elite schools.\nIt\u2019s obvious why elite schools want high achievers. These schools want students who will remake and improve the world. Past achievement is likely a good predictor of future success. A young man who can run a mile in 4 minutes and 10 seconds, or a young woman who can row 2,000 meters on a rowing machine in 6 minutes 45 seconds demonstrates a combination of natural ability and willingness to work hard. The same can be said of a champion juggler or Rubik\u2019s cube solver. If those applicants scored 1500 on the SAT, they become attractive candidates for admission.\nHowever, wealthy school districts \u2014 private and public \u2014 offer far more sports and extracurricular activities than do poorer schools. Consider New Trier, an elite public school north of Chicago, which offers 18 varsity sports \u2014 including fencing and bass fishing \u2014 along with more than 150 clubs. Students at New Trier can take dance, compete in forensics, row on a crew team or participate in model U.N. Similarly, Harvard-Westlake, a private prep school in a wealthy area of Los Angeles, offers 15 sports and more than 50 clubs. In contrast, students at Romulus High School in the Detroit metropolitan area choose from among only nine sports and fewer than 20 extracurricular activities. New Trier High is located in Winnetka, which has a per capita income of $105,000 and a median home price of just under $2 million. Romulus has a per capital income of less than $45,000"}

I really don't like feeling out of the loop because I read the Internet quite a bit and like to feel \"in the know.\" At the risk of further annoying my esteemed colleagues, I'll admit that baseball comes across my consciousness about 50 seconds per year. I simply prefer watching other professional sports, but I also know and respect that Bobby is following his beloved Rangers right now.\nThat said, I will read the stories that go above and beyond the usual game story, but few sports reporters seem to know how to execute a religion angle in a compelling way. For instance, the coverage of Josh Hamilton's faith has been gone in waves, it seems. His faith came up yet again when a man fell to his death this summer trying to catch a ball at a game in front of his six-year-old son. His son threw the first pitch at a Rangers' game, where Hamilton met and talked with his mother.\nIn what appeared to be a short period of time, Hamilton later revealed an interesting conversation. \u201cI asked her if they were believers in Christ,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cShe said they were. I said, \u2018Well, we know where your husband is right now and make sure that the little one knows who is daddy was and what he stood for. Make sure he understands that.\u2019\u201d Yes, it's Josh Hamilton, but I was a little surprised that he would get in a conversation about heaven in such a short period of time and that he revealed those specifics.\nMany athletes talk about their faith after winning a game or praying before a game, but few reporters seem to look for ways the athletes \"show not tell\" about their faith. There are also some tough questions journalists could pose to Hamilton, like how God has a plan for everything in the middle of a tragic death.\nEven non-baseball fans can connect with these kinds of stories. Religion is one way sports reporters can make their stories resonate with more than just fans of a sport or team.\nI talk about this and more (hint: some more about the personal faith of journalists while they cover religion) in GetReligion's most recent podcast. Tell us: What kinds of religion details do you look for in sports stories? Are there questions you think reporters could explore specific to athletes?"}

Now, the wait is over, and Android users can finally play Hearthstone on their tablet using Blizzard\u2019s official app instead of jumping through streaming hoops.\nThe Android version couldn\u2019t have released at a better time for both fans and Blizzard, as the game\u2019s latest expansion, Goblins vs. Gnomes, released only a little over a week ago on December 8. Like with the iPad release, Blizzard is performing somewhat of a slow rollout with Android Hearthstone, and it starts with Australia, Canada, and New Zealand first. Blizzard states that the game will hit other regions \u2014 through the Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore for Android \u2014 \u201cin the coming days,\u201d so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how quickly it\u2019ll hit the US and Europe.\nAccording to early user reviews on the Google Play Store, the game is a little laggy on devices that aren\u2019t exactly old yet, like the 2013 Nexus 7. One of the biggest gripes seems to be that Hearthstone doesn\u2019t run in immersion mode, which means the Android navigation bar is always present on the screen. Some users report that brand-new tablets, like the Nexus 9, also experience a bit of lag and stutter here and there, so the reported occasional performance hangup could simply be due to optimization issues that Blizzard should smooth out in a future patch. After all, the game is so new that it\u2019s not available in every region of the internet yet.\nLike with the iPad version, Blizzard will grant you a free Classic (non-expansion) booster pack after you complete your first game on the Android version \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose.

The debate, after all, will take place only four days before the Iowa caucus, where Trump has a very real chance at a race-altering victory and at a time when any other front-runner would avoid making any sudden movements that could interrupt the momentum. And while Trump hinted for days at the possibility of a boycott, such threats were easy to dismiss given that he had made similar ones before previous debates without following through\u2014to say nothing of his never-ending on-again, off-again WWE-style feud with Fox News.\nSitting out the Des Moines debate is a gamble, but so would be taking part. Trump would have almost certainly drawn heavy fire from the Fox News moderators and from his chief rival, Ted Cruz. In the past, he\u2019s managed to survive those attacks individually\u2014but he never faced both at the same time. What\u2019s more, his absence will leave Cruz as the only front-runner on stage and, as a result, the focus of a few more broadsides from his polling-challenged rivals than he otherwise might have faced. The boycott, meanwhile, allows Trump to play to type by showing his fans that he\u2019s the give-no-quarter negotiator he brands himself as and once again allows him to flex his muscles for a GOP electorate that loves to see a show of strength. The biggest benefit, meanwhile, is that his decision ensures that Trump will remain the political story in the final days before Iowa. After seven-plus months of relentless coverage, the Donald will sleep easy knowing that Thursday\u2019s Trump-less debate\u2014and the lead up to it\u2014will still be all about Trump.

Paid family leave is part of the State Disability Insurance program, so workers that pay into that insurance program are also covered for leave.\nThe other two states to enact paid family leave, New Jersey and Rhode Island, have also used their already-existing temporary-disability-insurance programs (Washington state passed the law, but it has yet to be enacted).\nDuring the debate, Clinton also pointed to legislation proposed by New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has acted as a surrogate for Clinton. But in that piece of legislation, called the FAMILY Act, the program would be funded by 0.2 percent of wages from both employees and employers, which is to say that contributions would come from both employees and employers.\n\u201cSenator Gillibrand believes this next election is an opportunity to elect members of the Senate and House who will vote for paid leave, and a president who will sign it into law and as Hillary Clinton said Tuesday, she'll do just that,\u201d Marc Brumer, a spokesman for Gillibrand, told National Journal in a statement.\nHeather Boushey, executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who is also advising Clinton in a private capacity, has proposed having paid family leave housed within the Social Security Administration.\nBut Boushey also said there numerous other ideas about how to make paid family leave workable and that it was important to start a larger conversation, but insisted there were certain policy aspects to keep in mind.\n\u201cOne thing from a policy perspective to keep in mind, if you are going to provide a program, you need to make sure it has a stable revenue source,\u201d Boushey said.\nThere is also a matter of perception for paid leave. By having employer contributions instead of taxing the rich, paid family leave could then not be seen so much as a government redistributive program where money from one group is given to another.\n\u201cThe idea, 'I pay in what I get out of it,' seems fair to me,\u201d Boushey said.\nClinton\u2019s loud support of paid family leave certainly shows that it will be crucial part of her larger policy platform as a candidate, but as other states have shown, paying for social welfare doesn\u2019t require class warfare.\nCorrection: A previous version misspelled Marc Brumer's name."}

If you don't know what I'm talking about, it proves my point.\nThe polarisation of opinion and spread of fake news has led to renewed calls for media responsibility. Perhaps, it's argued, only a government-funded but independently run media can deliver evenhandedness and be a positive force for democracy.\nWe have a national radio station that runs on these principles. It's just that nobody under 30, and not that many people over 30 listen to Radio New Zealand. It's not the medium of the moment.\nWhich is why I find the proposal of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader in the United Kingdom, interesting. He's talking about publicly-run social media.\nOur local councils are already experimenting with Neighbourly.com as a way of communicating relevant information and fostering grassroots initiatives, from food markets to exchanging goods and services.\nFor a national platform to work, however, it would need most of the population logged in. One way to achieve this would be to link this hypothetical publicly-owned social media to voting in national and local body elections.\nTo vote, you must be registered on this platform; it's also where you vote. And here's the killer, you lower the voting age to 16 and you make voting part of the education of our young people. Make it a thing in the classroom, guide our young people through the process and some of the issues, and you might have a passionate voter for life.\nThis idea could go some way towards solving two problems, the level of uninformed debate about important issues and falling voter turnouts.\nWho knows what it might look like exactly, but investigating the viability of a national social media platform makes more sense than an old-school publicly run television channel that few would watch."}

When she was 10, the failure of Scottish herring fishing forced the family to move to Corby, a Northamptonshire village then being transformed by the development of the huge iron and steelworks. Much of the workforce consisted of displaced Scots. Jill said of her adopted home: \"[It] has Celtic and Rangers supporters' clubs, an annual highland gathering and an accent which has undeniable Scottish overtones, regardless of the forebears of the speaker, who might be Londoners or Lithuanians.\" Certainly, Jill never lost her own accent even though she would never again live anywhere but the house her family moved to in 1957.\nAfter junior school, she attended Corby grammar school, where her Latin teacher was Colin Dexter, later creator of the Inspector Morse novels. Jill went on to Kettering technical college, leaving with few formal qualifications.\nShe worked as a secretary for Corby development corporation, a firm of solicitors and finally British Steel, where she ended up as a counsellor in their voluntary redundancy programme. Eventually, she was made redundant herself. She later said: \"So there I was with my redundancy pay and a choice. I could look for another job in a town that had 25% unemployment, or I could take the opportunity to write a novel. I am not adventurous, but this adventure had been thrust upon me and I chose to write the novel.\"\nJill was always happy to mix with other writers and meet her fans. Invariably accompanied by her sister Una, she was a familiar face at conventions and festivals. In a world not short of overweening egos, Jill was an unassuming and amusing conversationalist, with the gift of a sharp but never cruel wit.\nShe is survived by her two sisters, Una and Patti, her niece Katy and great-niece Georgia."}
{"idx": "12820", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Fedora 12 made its official debut today, after a two-week slippage in its release schedule.\nCodenamed \"Constantine,\" the new RedHat community Linux distro includes power management features pulled from RHEL 5, improved support for netbooks, and a much-improved NetworkManager. The latter provides a graphical display of the WiFi networks in range and a browser plug-in for the PackageKit application installation program that allows for the installation of applications onto Fedora through HTML tags.\nBut Paul Frields - leader of the Fedora Project - sees to reason to compare the distro with others OSes. Comparisons are odious, he says. There will be no talk trash about Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10. At least not yet.\nThe Fedora Linux distribution, says Frields, is designed like a cruise ship, to have \"a little something for everybody\" while at the same time encouraging end users to participate in the Fedora community and thereby help move the code base that will eventually become Red Hat Enterprise Linux along.\nWhen pressed to make comparisons between Windows 7, Ubuntu 9.10, and Fedora 12, Frields did a little dancing at first. \"We all have slightly different targets,\" Frields explains. \"Fedora is interested in getting the latest features out there in viable form, so this is not necessarily your grandmother's Linux. That said, with Fedora 13, we will be looking at the fit and finish issues. We have tended to build a really tight ship with Fedora, but now we want to make the d\u00e9cor in the cabins a little more sumptuous and to polish the deck chairs and railings.\"\nThat's all well and good, but how does Fedora 12 - the current release of the developmental Linux from Red Hat - stand up to the Windows 7 release from Microsoft? \"I think we stack up pretty well,\" Frields finally boasted. \"Fedora 12 has one of the largest feature lists we have ever had.\"\nThen Frields got into a groove, explaining that as far as he was concerned, Windows 7 was not so much an operating system as a platform pointing users to Microsoft services. \"To a great extent, Windows 7 is a driver for online services that Microsoft wants to provide. I think a lot of the services that Microsoft is providing have been available for some time now, so requiring users to go through a specific gatekeeper to get to services seems like a poor strategy. These days, people's work is centered on a Web browser, and as long as you make a good Web browsing experience, that's all you need to do.\"\nFrields said that Fedora 12 will boot faster than Windows 7 on any particular machine, and he reminded El Reg that Fedora 12 has a wider range of PC hardware support than Windows 7. He has plunked Fedora 12 on the eight-year-old Athlon PC at home that the Frields family uses, and it works just fine. Windows 7 would never load on this box. Conversely, the relatively new Dell XPS workstation that Frields uses for work and which he got a few months ago, just loaded Fedora 12 and \"everything just worked, there was no dickering around.\"\nThe Fedora project doesn't track downloads because requiring any kind of registration or putting in any kind of tracking is anathema to the open source community. But Frields says that since Fedora 7 was launched in May 2007, the project has tracked over 17."}

About 20,000 riders were delayed for up to two hours.\nThe delays were compounded by unusually heavy traffic on highways in Westchester County that added half an hour to the county bomb squad's trip to the station. Much of the traffic was caused by people returning from Connecticut after buying tickets for the $195 million Powerball lottery.\nThe unattended nylon suitcase was spotted in the passenger waiting area by a passer-by about 3:15 P.M., the New Rochelle police said. Once the authorities were notified, they evacuated the station and blocked all trains from coming in. Six trains were stuck on the tracks east or west of New Rochelle or at neighboring stations. At 4:30 P.M., with the bomb squad still en route from Hawthorne, Metro-North stopped running New Haven line trains out of Grand Central Terminal. By 5:30, the suitcase was declared harmless and service was restored, but by that time, 13 trains had failed to depart and Grand Central's main waiting room was jammed with thousands of impatient commuters, lined up 15 deep at the pay phones or calling home on cellular phones.\n''Little kids don't understand this kind of thing,'' she said.\nPassengers on the 3:40 Stamford local out of Grand Central had a particularly difficult commute. Their train was stopped on the tracks just south of New Rochelle for the duration of the bomb scare. When the train finally pulled into the New Rochelle station at 5:50 P.M., 98 minutes late, it was on fire.\n''These people are having an extremely bad day so far,'' said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North.\nThe fire, an electrical blaze on the roof of one car apparently caused by a power surge in the overhead wires, was not serious and no one was injured, but the passengers were evacuated and put on the next train, Ms. Anders said.\nIt was a difficult day for the railroad, normally one of the most reliable in the country. At 5:50 P.M. the signal control system failed on the Harlem River line, and trains on that line were delayed for up to 30 minutes. All told, there were 89 late trains during the evening rush.\nMs. Anders said she was not sure what caused the passer-by to notify the authorities about the suitcase.\nShe said that although suspicious packages are reported on the railroad from time to time, ''99.9 percent of them'' prove to be false alarms.\nThe New Rochelle police said the suitcase was given to the Metro-North police.

He had no background in real estate, design or construction, yet watching all that television convinced him that he could make big money buying, restoring and reselling dilapidated properties.\nThen a neighbor introduced Mr. Levitt to his brother and sister-in-law, Graham and Krista Blundell, who were flipping houses in the area. By April 2015, Mr. Levitt was at an auction with Mr. Blundell, 44, who previously worked in investment banking, bidding on a vacant house in South Orange.\nA few weeks earlier, Mr. Levitt had tried to gather information about the property, driving past it after a snowstorm to see if the mail had been collected and the snow had been shoveled, or any other evidence that someone might still live there. He peered in the window and saw standing water in the basement and piles of trash and belongings scattered inside.\nHe and Mr. Blundell won the house, paying $318,000 in cash and hiring a locksmith to let them in. And so, with a cashier\u2019s check and a leap of faith, Mr. Levitt joined the growing ranks of small-time real estate investors who model themselves on spunky TV personalities.\nEnthusiasm for flipping, the practice of buying property to renovate and sell at a profit, is surging. In 2017, Americans flipped 207,000 single-family homes or condos, hitting an 11-year high, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, a real estate data company. And real estate brokers, designers and contractors credit the popularity of reality TV, specifically scrappy, do-it-yourself flipper shows, with encouraging this new generation of investors.\n\u201cThere are definitely more people interested in flipping because they watch these shows on HGTV,\u201d said Elizabeth Kee, an associate broker for CORE real estate, who frequently works with buyers of investment properties and now regularly fields calls from people with no real estate experience who are interested in investing.\nHome improvement shows have for some time played a role in America\u2019s relationship with real estate. After the housing market collapsed in 2008, HGTV was criticized for fanning the flames of an overheated market, encouraging a culture of rampant investment that contributed to the eventual bust. Today, the cable network is among the most popular on television, reaching 1.11 million viewers in May.\nIn the New York metro area, home flipping is on the upswing, with flips accounting for 5.6 percent of all 2017 sales, an increase of 29 percent from 2016, according to ATTOM. Most of these investments happen in boroughs other than Manhattan or in the suburbs, primarily because Manhattan prices leave little room for profit.

A research and development team from China has come up with a battery-operated Air Umbrella, which creates a shield against rainfall via a jet airflow.\nThe gadget may seem like something out of a James Bond movie, and though it's still in the R&D stages, it is gaining popularity on Kickstarter. The Air Umbrella has surpassed its $10,000 Kickstarter fundraising goal with over $33,000 in support from over 275 backers.\nTwo models run on a 30-minute battery life -- not ideal for long commutes in a downpour, but the creators say they are working on improving that. The very visible (and bulky) base resembles a flashlight. Several versions provide options for a range of consumers.\nThe \"b\" or basic umbrella is about 20 inches long and weighs over a pound and a half, while the women's \"a\" version is smaller, at about a foot long and just over a pound, with only a 15 minute battery life. The scalable \"c\" product, which can be shortened from 31 inches to about 20 inches, is slightly heavier at 1.87 pounds.\nAs innovative as the product seems, this is not the first time air umbrellas have surfaced. As CNET points out, a Korean designer came out with the concept in 2010, but it never took off.\nThe latest inventors, who hold doctorates and advanced degrees from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, designed each umbrella to operate with high-speed jet air flow. \"Jet airflow can isolate some objects,\" they explain on the Kickstarter site. \"So when we make use of the airflow, we can protect ourselves from the rain drops... Then the airflow forms an umbrella with out visible cover.\"\nJust like your traditional nylon taffeta umbrella, air umbrellas don't provide the best coverage in torrential rainstorms. The tech version also makes some noise. The developers admit that the products are most suitable for urban \"users who are not demanding.\"\nThey're also a lot pricier than traditional umbrellas: the market price of the product is predicted to run around $200.\nFunds raised on Kickstarter will go towards improvements in the appearance and battery life of the device.\nResearchers say they will start manufacturing next year, and supporters can expect to receive their products by December 2015 -- or they will get a refund if creators can't make their deadline."}

While some have already begun to embrace such sources, many more are still in the dark as to just what renewable energy sources are.\nRenewable energy sources are those that can be replenished in a very small period of time. The most common of these sources include the following.\nBiomass: Biomass is organic material made from plants and animals and contains energy from the sun. That energy from the sun is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, and is then passed on to animals and humans that consume them.\nWood is the most common form of biomass, as wood is used for heating and cooking throughout the world. While it's less commonly used in the United States, wood is an important energy source for much of the developing world. And since it's always possible to plant more trees, wood is among the most renewable energy sources in the world. Other sources of biomass are crops and even biofuels such as ethanol, which continues to be promoted and considered as a means of lessening the world's reliance on petroleum.\nSolar energy: Solar energy is energy produced by the sun that can be converted into other forms of energy, such as electricity and heat. Though solar energy is among the less reliable renewable sources of energy, this doesn't mean it isn't valuable. Solar energy is used to heat buildings, dry crops, and heat water.\nGeothermal: Geothermal energy is heat collected from the earth. This energy is produced through power plants that drill into the earth in areas where steam and hot water has been trapped. Pipes then carry the hot water to a plant, where the steam is then separated and used to make electricity.\nUnfortunately, thanks to its nature, geothermal energy can only be produced in places where the steam and hot water have been trapped beneath the earth's surface. For example, in the United States, all geothermal plants are located in the western region of the country, namely California and Nevada. Where geothermal energy can be used, however, the environment benefits greatly, as geothermal energy offsets the air pollution that would have been produced by fossil fuels.\nHydropower: Hydropower is one of the oldest sources of energy and is essentially energy produced from moving water. The faster water is moving, the more energy can be produced. If water can be channeled and harnessed (such as through the use of dams), hydropower can be a very valuable renewable energy source. As water is pushed through a pipe, it turns a turbine, which then begins to produce electricity. Such is the reason for reservoirs, which are essentially storing water until there is an energy shortage. Once the water is released, more energy in the form of electricity is created. Because hydropower produces no pollution, some regard it as the most valuable renewable energy source.\nThese are just a handful of the renewable energy sources that many feel will one day help offset the world's reliance on fossil fuels. To learn more, consult your local department of energy."}

It has led to many residents, particularly women and older people, feeling that they do not want to walk down their own high street during the daytime.\n\u201cThe evenings are worse and many local people now refuse to walk around the area after dark, which in the winter means they are subjected to a very early curfew.\n\u201cHowever, even staying at home does not keep people from the negative effects of antisocial behaviour. Residents now find themselves disturbed and unable to sleep, due to the shouting and fighting of large groups of youths congregating in their streets until the early hours.\nA representative from Krakus said it would combat any problems with regular staff training, CCTV and said it would not sell beer in any amount less than packs of four. It would also refuse to sell to drunk and disorderly or under-age customers.\nParts of Harehills are covered by a cumulative impact zone \u2013 an area authorities believe is more at risk of alcohol-related antisocial behaviour.

By feeding many van Goghs into a piece of software, style transfer can deconstruct his strokes of paint\u2013and then copy them, turning any photo into a conceivable mashup with Starry Night. Artificial intelligence had done something that a century of artists and scholars could not: replicate van Gogh\u2019s unique visual genius.\nBut does that make style transfer AI an artistic genius? Or is it more the equivalent of a monkey that\u2019s been taught to play pseudo-Bach hymns on a recorder?\nAsk Ahmed Elgammal, researcher and computer science professor at Rutgers University, and he\u2019s likely to say style transfer is the latter. Elgammal is going further than training an AI to simply copy art masters. Instead, he trained a system to deviate from what it\u2019s been taught\u2013and to, hopefully, create the next unexpected masterpiece.\nIn other words, Elgammal wants to create AI that thinks like an artist\u2013or whole schools of artists\u2013by looking to its contemporaries, internalizing what they\u2019re doing, and creating its own unique spin. It\u2019s exactly this process, his team theorizes, that gives rise to new art movements. Realism gave rise to impressionism, which in turn gave rise to expressionism. Art continuously builds upon itself through improvisation and critique.\nTo teach a machine to do this, Elgammal\u2019s team riffed upon the hottest tool in machine learning today: a Generative Adversarial Network (or GAN).\nThe best way to understand a GAN is not to think about it as one AI, but two AIs that have been pitted against one another. They\u2019re two virtual players competing or criticizing one another in order to make the virtual brain of the greater neural net smarter.\nA normal art-generating GAN works like this: Player One is loaded with thousands of images. Player Two is told to create images from scratch to fool Player One into thinking it\u2019s looking at art. After countless attempts, in which Player One rejects or accepts Player Two\u2019s work, eventually, Player Two might learn to make something that looks a lot like art, consistently\u2013or even copy a specific style like van Gogh. But what you get with this approach is a system that\u2019s good at copying old art styles, not creating new ones.\nElgammal\u2019s GAN works a bit differently. Player One is loaded with art of various styles. Player Two tries to make art from scratch. But in this case, Player One doesn\u2019t just label something art, or not art. It also tells Player Two whether or not the art looks like any known style. Player Two is motivated to create something that passes for art, but also passes as a totally new style of art\u2013something outside of Player One\u2019s ability to pin it as falling under any single art movement.\nWhile the pieces are, predictably, hard to describe, Elgammal is right in that they\u2019ve mostly all achieved an aesthetically pleasing baseline. Some look more like photos, others veer toward abstract expressionism. I see hints of everything from Rothko\u2019s color blocks to lazy Adobe Illustrator filters. Sometimes I see what might be genius. Other moments, idiocy.\nBut of course, this is exactly how I critique the works inside any real art gallery. My fellow humans, when asked, believed that Elgammal\u2019s neural net was making real art about 75%"}

The Whitewater probe of Bill and Hillary Clinton, for example, began in 1994 and ended more than six years later.

They seem to think that if Mueller doesn\u2019t close up shop soon in response to political pressure, Trump\u2019s position is strong enough that he could put an end to it, perhaps by firing the special counsel or the special counsel\u2019s boss, Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein, and weather any storm the move occasions.\nThe probe isn\u2019t going to end soon, simply or painlessly for this president. Trump remains in great peril.\nThey\u2019re wrong. The probe isn\u2019t going to end soon, simply or painlessly for this president. Trump remains in great peril.\nAnyone paying attention over the last year knows Mueller will not yield to political pressure. His investigators haven\u2019t leaked; they have ignored vicious personal attacks; they haven\u2019t veered in the slightest from prosecutorial professionalism.\nSo to \u201cwrap it up,\u201d Trump would have to make a move, but will he?\nThe president and his lawyers are strategizing about whether he will agree to be interviewed by Mueller, either voluntarily or under subpoena. If he were to refuse, as the current swing of the pendulum suggests, and then try to end the probe, he would only seem more guilty and undermine his support even among Republicans. If his refusal were to lead, as expected, to a court battle, we would expect the Supreme Court to settle the issue. Any move by Trump to preempt it would again only undermine his credibility.\nIn addition, the president and his circle are well aware of how fast the midterm election is approaching and what effect an attempt to fire Mueller could have on the outcome. They want to avoid any action that would help the Democrats flip the House. Such a shift would change every calculation, not least because a Democratic majority could move to impeach the president early next year.\nOf course, Trump may calculate that he could get away with firing Mueller now, if he moved quickly and the Republican leadership rallied to his side. But it is equally possible that Congress would respond with legislation to reinstate Mueller. Again, the field of battle would shift to the courts.\nMost importantly, even a successful ouster of Mueller would not derail the investigation at this point. Too much evidence has been gathered, and too many prosecutors, who have surely considered and planned for the contingency, stand ready to carry on. Should Trump try to shutter the entire special counsel\u2019s office, a much graver and politically and legally riskier act than firing Mueller or Rosenstein, other divisions in the Department of Justice, in particular the Southern District of New York, would also be ready to take up the charge.\nThe strength of all that evidence, the careful work done thus far, and the indictments already filed are the special counsel\u2019s protection against \u201cwitch hunt\u201d tweets and protestations that the investigation is already over with nothing to show for it.\nIn the course of the past year, we\u2019ve learned not to underestimate what Mueller knows and what bombshell he"}

Once they signed a contract, they figured they soon would be producing their own power.\nBut a process they anticipated would take weeks to complete instead took the better part of the year. As delays mounted, so did costs.\nPeco, the electric utility in the region, told the Edwardses that it could not connect their 3.8-kilowatt system because it might elevate the voltage beyond legal limits for their neighbors. It would cost the couple $1,300 to modify the utility's network to accommodate their solar system.\n\"I had no clue this would be a problem,\" said Sue Edwards, an environmental activist. She grumbled about having to bear the cost of upgrading Peco's equipment.\nSolar installations have increased more than 1,500 percent since 2010, including tenfold growth among residential customers. The new power production is forcing utilities to rethink the way their distribution grids are configured to accommodate the changing flows of power.\nThe solar installer shared the Peco fee, and the system was put in place in November - after the homeowners redid their roof, which added $20,000 to the price of the $12,700 solar system. But the Edwardses are still not sending solar power into the grid because Peco has yet to make the final connection.\n\"They don't like competition from nature,\" said George Edwards, expressing a common sentiment among solar advocates.\nThe couple's experience was not unusual. Of the 50 customers who signed up for solar through a community group's Solarize Greater Media campaign, 16 were initially rejected by Peco because their systems were incompatible with the utility's network.\nSolar installers say that Peco's process for reviewing and approving solar jobs is fraught with obstacles, and that customers have experienced a high rate of denials because the utility's older distribution system was not designed to handle new customer-generators.\n\"There seems to be some underlying resistance from utilities to solar,\" said Ron Celentano, a Flourtown consultant and president of the Pennsylvania Solar Energy Industries Association. \"You see it all over.\"\nPeco says it experienced a surge of interest from potential solar customers in 2016, attracted by the declining price of solar panels and a 30 percent tax credit. Through November, the utility received 3,515 requests from customers to connect solar systems, quadruple the total applications it received in 2015.\n\"We're making the commitments to expand and enhance the organization to respond to this increase,\" said Ben Armstrong, Peco's spokesman.\nThe utility has revamped its review process and added 12 new employees to streamline the assessments, Armstrong said. Peco also is developing an online portal to allow solar installers to submit plans and payments electronically, as is done with other utilities.\nSince 2009, Peco has received 6,105 solar-installation applications and approved 5,759, including 201 that required some modifications, Armstrong said. Only 6 percent were rejected, mostly because of system constraints.\nClimate activists, solar-industry advocates, and customer demand are putting mounting pressure on Peco and other utilities to accelerate renewable-energy development.\nResidential solar installations increased 16 percent this year, according to the Solar Energy"}

A strategy focused on considered and phased approach will be crucial for success.\nperiodic pruning, reorganisation and consolidation to optimise efficiency and provide the greatest value to the company. In so doing, IT teams need to develop a clear strategy for keeping data centre consolidation efforts on track.\nIn this tip, expert Hamish Macarthur explains what drives data centre consolidation and offers advice on how IT professionals should embark on an on-going data centre strategy.\nThe excitement of new applications, emerging technologies and green field site development is quickly replaced with the need to maintain, update and upgrade systems to keep the business operational, competitive and servicing customers.\nThe result of data centre growth is that different practices develop to support different sites, different business units and applications. Technologies were selected for good reasons in the past, with new developments offering a new richness of options. But, over time, growth can show a dark side. Changing business and technological needs, personnel turnover, regulatory changes and other external and internal factors can fragment the data centre. The best response is to consolidate processes, technologies, locations and suppliers in order to improve manageability and have more flexibility going ahead.\nConsolidating physical locations can reduce overhead and operational costs associated with multiple data centre locations or reduce data centre energy costs.\nConsolidating software onto fewer hardware platforms can reduce hardware maintenance costs and software licencing fees.\nConsolidation can reduce the number of server, storage and network (hardware) units to be purchased, leading to lower acquisition and finance costs.\nConsolidating core business applications such as order processing, inventory management, invoicing or management reports makes support and upgrades easier. So rather than having multiple email or database platforms for various departments, pick one and make it serve the entire organisation.\nConsolidation can simplify and reduce errors in system processes such as data protection services, security, network services, system discovery and management.\nConsolidation should also examine the business processes themselves and redefine roles and procedures to best utilise computing resources and IT staffing talent.\nChanges in the business often drive data centre consolidation. These changes can include reorganisation, acquisition of new businesses that need to be integrated, introduction of new business units, new ways of transacting business, interfacing with customers and suppliers and complying with new industry or legal guidelines.\nThe reality is that chief information officers and data centre managers must have a clear strategy as to how the system infrastructure can and will be consolidated. Without such a plan in place, the inevitable system silos will continue and system sprawl will become a real challenge.\nThe IT strategy must be in line with the business goals and the course along which the business is being directed. One of the key goals of IT evolution is to stop being a line item cost to the business, and start emerging as a partner that can add value and create opportunities for the business.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. Consider a business establishing itself in a new geography. The IT systems would need to be replicated for the data centre located in the new area. Yet, the business imperative was to be fully operational within a three-month time frame. Without any spare space within the existing data centres, constructing a new data centre, which would take 9 to 12 months, would not be possible in that time frame. The way forward would be to consolidate existing resources in order to support the additional resources needed.\nConsolidating servers and storage arrays can release floor space. A company could complete that whole task in a much shorter period, enabling the new business to develop without any drag from IT -- a positive boost to all concerned within the business units and the IT department.\nWhen consolid"}

It was written, ostensibly, as a direct rebuttal to a now-forgotten op-ed that had appeared in an unnamed New York newspaper, though it was really a response to a growing chorus of Moses critics, including the academic and critic Lewis Mumford, and, though she is not directly named, the author and activist Jane Jacobs (her The Death and Life of Great American Cities had been published just months before).\nSuppose we were to ask some of our best and most ambitious mayors, battling valiantly for limited, immediate objectives, whether concentrations of population are beyond improvement, whether the raison d'etre of the metropolis is gone, and whether their plans for redevelopment are essentially futile. I mean men like Lee of New Haven, Dilworth of Philadelphia, Miriani of Detroit, and former Mayor Morrison of New Orleans. Are the citizens who believe in such men now to be told that their trust has been betrayed?\nThere is, indeed, much wrong with cities\u2014big and little\u2014but the answer is not to abandon or completely to rebuild them on abstract principles. Only on paper can you disperse concentrations of population and create small urban stars with planned satellites around them. In the course of many years devoted to reclamation of water front, manufacturing of topsoil to cover thousands of acres of new parks, buying and preserving large areas of natural woodlands and shores in advance of the realtor and subdivider, planting thousands of trees along parkways and expressways, building hundreds of playgrounds, planning cultural centers in place of decaying tenements, tightening zoning and building laws, restricting billboards, opposing entrenched power companies and other utility corporations to keep the basic natural public resources inalienable, and stopping water pollution, I never caught a glimpse of the breast beaters who are now touted as pundits in this field. I saw none of them in our long battle to establish eleven thousand acres of Jamaica Bay within New York City as a permanent, protected, unspoiled natural game refuge. Is Jamaica Bay a symbol of urban rot, or is it just too small and obscure to attract the attention of the critics?\nMoses is at once praising the unique abilities of hard-charging mayors, a cause that has no shortage of adherents in 2015, and listing his many, many accomplishments (he\u2019ll go on to list many, many more) in an attempt to wave away those who had only recently begun to question his work and legacy.

While it would be more than 10 years until Robert Caro published his magnificent, 1,200-page biographical takedown, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York, it had been just a couple of years since Moses, in the role of New York City Parks Commissioner, had made himself the enemy of the city\u2019s cultural elite by refusing to issue permits for free Shakespeare in the Park performances.

Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested.\nBoth Ruby\u2019s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription. They combined suspicion of anything Irish in the aftermath of the 1916 Uprising and more traditional judgments of Catholics on the basis of their beliefs and practices. The case went something like this.\nThe Uprising was seen as a traitorous blow to the English war effort which indicated a broader Irish disloyalty to the Crown. Archbishop Mannix\u2019s leadership of the opposition to conscription and his outspoken criticism of the treatment of Ireland by the English Government fuelled further attacks on the patriotism of Australian Catholics, most of whom were of Irish descent. This charge echoed the broader historical attack on Catholics in England that their subjection to the Pope was incompatible with their loyalty to the King. So they and their Bishops were called on to declare their loyalty.\nOf course, the fire was also fed with other dried out chestnuts. Catholics, after all, were responsible for the Inquisition, the Crusades, the St Bartholomew Day Massacre, witch burning, the later Falangist regime in Spain, and other Evil Acts. Their leaders were called on to abjure them, too. Totally and repeatedly \u2013 no room for muttering about historical context. And of course then there were such Evil Catholic Practices as clerical celibacy practiced publicly on the city streets, clerical tyranny as displayed by a lunatic parish priest in Bandiwallop West, the ringing of the Angelus bells early in the morning, running their own school system and having the temerity to expect that good Australians would tolerate being nursed by Catholic Nuns during the flu epidemic.\nAnd then there was Papal Infallibility, which meant that all Catholics were bound to accept every Papal statement, no matter how taken out of context. Since these included Papal condemnation of charging interest on loans and of democracy, Australian Catholics were also demanded to abjure these statements that subverted the Australian way of life.\nAnd so it went on. This anti-Catholicism as I knew it from family stories, personal experience and reading, was only a ripple from a stone long since thrown into the water. It was not shared by most Australians and was no more than an irritant in daily life that was vanquished every time a Catholic boxer beat up his opponent, Catholic footy clubs thrashed those run by the Masons, and my school team beat the Nobs. Of course, Catholics responded with anti-English and anti-Protestant prejudice, demanding that English non-Catholics agree to returning Our Churches and repent of the wrongs done to Ireland.\nIt was only later that I worked out what was going on. In times of anxiety some people identified Catholicism and the Irish people in which it was embodied as Evil. They justified that belief by finding texts to which they gave decisive authority that commanded unpatriotic and brutal actions. They then postulated that all Catholics gave those texts the same authority that they themselves gave them, and"}

{"idx": "12871", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: 2001-12-30 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- In the next few days, the Wall Street Journal will announce the results of its Investment Dartboard contest for the second half of 2001.\nIn the competition, Journal editors ask four market professionals each to choose a single stock for the six months ahead. Their results are compared with the choices of four readers band stocks \"chosen at random by flinging darks at the stock tables.\"\nThe winner this time will be Jim Roumell, who heads Roumell Asset Management, an advisory firm based in Chevy Chase, Md. Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., Roumell's selection, has risen 40 percent since the contest began.\nOf course, winning any six-month, single-stock contest might be simply a matter of luck, but when I interviewed Roumell and looked at his long-term record closely, I found he had an important story to tell. Investors should not necessarily emulate him, but they can certainly learn from him.\nRoumell calls himself a deep-value investor -- that is, he looks for significant gains among unloved stocks.\nThere's nothing new in that, but Roumell has a specific strategy that is both unusual and logical. Most value mavens concentrate on the price-to- earnings (P/E) ratio, the number of dollars that investors are paying for a dollar of a company's profits, but Roumell is not obsessed with earnings.\n\"To be perfectly honest,\" he said, \"I look at earnings only out of the corner of my eye.\"\nInstead, he focuses on assets -- what a company owns. For most investors, that can be tricky since the assets of different businesses tend to be valued differently by investors, and those valuations often rise and fall with economic conditions.\nRoumell has a solution: He looks at actual transactions to determine what a company's assets are worth. It's a simple process that nearly every home buyer understands.\n\"you ask what other houses on the block have been going for. I do the same. I look at comparables.\"\nLast year, for example, he bought shares in a modest company called J&J Snack Foods Corp., which, he wrote at the time, \"dominates the market for giant pretzels.\"\nRoumell's comparable in this case was Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, which had recently been purchased by Unilever PLC, the British-Dutch packaged-goods giant, for $265 million. At the time, Ben & Jerry's had annual revenue of $240 million, so Unilever paid a price that was 110 percent of the ice cream company's sales.\nJ&J had about $300 million in sales. If a company like Unilever were to pay a comparable price for J&J, it would sell for 110 percent of $300 million, or $330 million.\nJ&J has 8.8 million shares of stock outstanding. Divide $330 million by 8.8 million, and you get a price of $37.50 per share -- again, assuming J&J is valued the same as Ben & Jerry's.\nActually, J&J should probably be worth more: It has a much larger share of its own market, and its pretax profit is 7 percent of sales, compared with 3 percent for the ice cream company. But $37.50 was the target price that Roumell used in August 20"}
{"idx": "12872", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In a year when the economy has slowed and many households have already seen their utility costs skyrocket, the City of Hagerstown is proposing a tax hike that would add $73 to the bill for a $100,000 home.\nThe football equivalent of this proposal is known as \"stretching the field\" - throwing deep on the first play, knowing the pass will be incomplete, but figuring it will increase the chances of a shorter pass's success.\nSo inevitably, we will still have a tax increase, though probably not as large as the city's opening volley.\nWith the economy becoming a concern, this isn't the ideal time for a tax increase, at least purely from a public policy standpoint. Accepted policy (just because it's accepted doesn't mean anyone actually adheres to it; it's like George Carlin said about his editorial policy - \"We recognize our obligation to present opposing views; we don't present them, but we recognize our obligation\") is to pad tax revenues and public program purses in fat times, so when the down cycle arrives taxes can be cut without curtailing government's ability to assist those on the increasing unemployment rolls.\nFurther, political wisdom holds that taxes are never raised in an election year, for obvious reasons. Not only is it an election year in the city, it's darn near an election month. This ought to make for some fruity exchanges among candidates in the next few weeks.\nThe city's problem is as simple as the solution is complex.\n1. The tax base, and therefore tax revenue, is barely growing.\n2. To increase the tax base, people (especially homeowners interested in improving their property) and commerce must be attracted into town.\n3. To attract people into town, the city must become more desirable - for instance, by beefing up the police force to make people feel safe.\n4. To become more desirable, the city must spend money. Money which it doesn't have because it's tax base isn't growing.\nThe tax hike would raise $1.3 million, much of which would be spent to enhance city life. Of this, nearly a half-million dollars is earmarked for police, fire and rescue services.\nCrime and what for lack of a better term can be called the annoyance factor (cruisers, groups of loud men standing on the corner at midnight, ladies debating boyfriend sole-proprietorships at elevated decibel levels) have become perhaps the hottest topic of the election.\nTo their credit, most candidates seem to realize that crime prevention is a multi-legged insect. If you neglect recreation opportunities and community centers, more kids with idle hands will be out on the street. Neglecting housing quality, parks and neighborhoods practically begs the destruction of traditional family life. Weeds will choke out healthy plants.\nIf you neglect basic, and in truth some not-so-basic needs, you can raise taxes and buy more cops year after year after and crime will continue to plague the town.\nSome line items the city cannot afford not to fund. The tax hike provides $25,000 for the Hagerstown Home Store. An indiscriminate tax- and budget-cutter might slice this without another thought.\nBut this is an instance where a few thousand dollars will almost assuredly save city taxpayers money in years to come. Luring homeowners into the city is a critical key to raising the tax base. Owners have a stake in increasing the value of their properties. They generally have more income, which benefits merchants and makes new businesses more viable."}

Here's how to find a deal on a GPU.\nThe graphics card market is suffering right now due to a supply and demand problem. Manufacturers continue to produce a lot of new cards, but gamers are finding it difficult to locate stock, and when they do the prices are sky high due to demand. Why? Cryptocurrency miners, who rely on the latest GPUs to keep their mining rigs profitable.\nThe good news is, both Nvidia and AMD are reacting to this demand and planning GPUs targeted specifically at cryptocurrency mining. So the market will stabilize, but not for a while yet. Gamers are therefore left with a choice: pay a large premium for the high-end graphics cards they can find, or opt for a lower performing new card (and still pay a premium).\nThe team over at TechSpot realized there is a third option, though. While we're all focused on buying new cards, used cards are not completely useless. The question is, are they good enough to run today's games? It turns out, some of them are.\nTechSpot's Steve Walton carried out a very time-consuming review of 44 used graphics cards to see which ones still perform in 2018. The tests used three games\u2014Battlefield 1, F1 2017, and Rise of the Tomb Raider\u2014to review each card at medium quality presets and a 1080p resolution. While that's certainly nowhere near top-of-the-line for gaming today, it's perfectly acceptable for most gamers out there if the frame rates are high enough.\nAn example of what Walton found is the GeForce GTX 980, which is comparable to the much newer GTX 1060 6GB while saving you around $80. You'll typically pay $370 for a 1060 whereas a 980 at auction is $290. It was $240 until the graphics card famine started to really hit the market.\nThe best value used card Walton found is the GTX 770, which costs around $135 and averages 88 frames per second in the three games running at 1080p. For AMD cards, the savings are nowhere near as great due to the cards being so good for mining. Prices remain high even for old cards, which means if you're on the market for a used card then Nvidia is where your focus should be.\nCheck out Walton's price list; you might be surprised to discover how much old cards are worth on eBay."}

Let's find out.\nTP-Link aren't a brand that most people think of when they are after high-quality networking gear, but the company have been making some truly stellar products of late, at prices that the big boys just can't compete with.\nTP-Link is a Chinese company that has been around for 17 years and now has over 14,000 employees across the world. So, if you've never heard of TP-Link, it's definitely a big company.

But, wireless is where it's at for the TL-WDR4300. It supports Dual Band Wi-Fi, meaning 2.4GHz and 5GHz. With the 5GHz band, we have the ability to crank up to 450Mbps and the 2.4GHz can ramp up to 300Mbps.\nThere's three detachable antennas, which are quite good quality, and big, too.

For example, we may use working memory to think about the new information in relation to prior knowledge and experiences. Through this process of elaboration, the new information is more likely to be encoded into our long-term memory, from which it can be retrieved later.\nIt can be helpful to think of short-term memory as having slots, each holding a distinct idea or chunk of information.\nPerhaps the most important limit for short-term memory is that while all of these pieces of information are able to be held, only one is available at a time (Garavan, 1998; Bleckley et al., 2003; Basak & Verhaeghen, 2011). Accessing one of the other pieces of information means switching focus away from the current conscious piece of information.\nThe amount of information that working memory is processing at any given time is called cognitive load (Sweller, 1988). When there is more information than can be processed by a learner\u2019s working memory, we experience cognitive overload. This overwhelming and uncomfortable feeling means we are unable to process additional information, and therefore unable to encode new information into long-term memory. How much cognitive load we are able to handle is dependent on many factors such as age, expertise and emotional state.\nThe finite capacity of working memory is a bottleneck to learning and has several consequences for learners.\nWorking memory limitations mean that multi-tasking does not exist. Instead, we switch our attention quickly between different tasks, but this comes at a cost for more than 98% of learners: they take longer to do tasks and make more errors when task-switching than when focusing on one task at a time (see Multitasking).\nHow information is presented to students will affect the efficiency in which they\u2019re able to take in and process content. The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) explains why these effects occur and suggest several ways to better present information to learners (see Multimedia Learning).\nAtkinson, R.C.; Shiffrin, R.M.

House Speaker John Boehner won't agree to any package that increases revenue, and Obama won't agree to any package that doesn't include revenue.\nSo does the world end tomorrow?\nOh. Then why are we worried?\nTo be sure, bad stuff will start happening, just gradually. The cuts come half from the defense budget and half from a mix of mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicaid or discretionary funding. A few programs, like Medicare, are exempt. (Here's a 300-word explanation of which cuts go where; here's an exhaustive one.) There are two problems with this. One, specific things are going to be bad for specific people: The administration says as many as 750,000 jobs could be lost. Federal workers will be furloughed, which could affect any number of services -- though the most commonly mentioned ones are the prospect of longer airport security lines or reduced air-traffic control coverage. Of course, we'll really have to wait and see. Fiscal conservatives have accused the White House of fear-mongering in their description of how the cuts might affect individual Americans.\nBut economists agree about what the cuts will do in aggregate. They expect that spending reductions will harm the economic recovery, slowing growth by an estimated half of a percentage point in 2013.\nAnd there's nothing we can do about this?\nTheoretically, both sides could still reach a deal at any point and forestall whatever cuts haven't yet taken effect. But there's not much optimism about that right now. As demonstrated already, both sides have drawn lines in the sand that they swear they won't cross. Keep in"}

{"idx": "12893", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: (BPT) - The trend toward smaller, more efficient homes is still in full swing, with new home builders offering floor plans that lower square footage while amping up usability. If your home is older, however, or you live in an apartment, your smaller space may just feel... well, small.\nNothing makes a small room look more cramped than filling it with furnishings that are too big for the space. For example, if your living room is 10 by 12, a 9-foot-long sofa is going to dominate the room and leave little space for anything else. Conversely, placing a smaller bed (such as a twin or single) in a modestly sized bedroom is a classic trick designers and home stagers use to make a bedroom look larger.\nWhen buying furniture for your small space, keep scale in mind. Furnishings should fit the space well, leaving plenty of area for you to move around them. Mohawk Homescapes blogger Cecilia Staniec advises homeowners take room measurements. \"You should never shop for furniture without a complete set of measurements,\" she writes.\nSmart use of wall space can open up floor space, which is often at a premium in small rooms. Some items must occupy floor space, such as sofas, tables and chairs. Others - like lighting, TVs and electronic components - don't.\nWall-mounting TVs, especially flat screens, can be a great way to conserve floor space and create an appealing focal point for a petite room. Low-profile wall mounts, like Sanus' Super Slim Full-motion VMF408, are perfect for small to medium screens of 26 to 47 inches. The mounts keep the screen close to the wall while providing a full range of motion for optimum viewing from multiple seating areas. Similarly, you can wall-mount your computer monitor - even an iPad.\nYour walls can work for you in other ways, too. Even in small rooms, the walls are one of the largest design elements. Choosing a bright or light wall color can help a smaller room feel more open and airy. Adding mirrors is another way to make a room appear larger. You don't need to install a full-length mirror on one wall; a series of smaller mirrors attractively positioned in a cluster can do the job just as well without being overwhelming.\nCarefully consider accessories you place on the wall, and don't overdo it. Too much on the walls will make them look cluttered and even smaller. Sometimes, one or two thoughtful graphic elements are all you need to make a design statement.\nA lack of lighting can make a small room look positively cramped. Whenever possible, enhance the size and appeal of your rooms with plenty of light. Natural light is optimum and adding a skylight or solar tube is a great way to bring sunshine into your home.\nIf that kind of renovation isn't in your budget, however, maximize natural light by keeping window treatments light and open. Avoid dark colors around windows, as darker hues absorb more natural light. Recessed lighting overhead can help a room feel loftier, and wall sconces provide illumination without occupying valuable floor space.\nWhen it comes to home decorating, bigger isn't always better and smaller doesn't have to mean cramped. With the right blend of furnishings, colors and accessories, it's possible to live large in any small space."}
{"idx": "12894", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Remember when Alan Moore wrote Tales From The Crypt...in space?\nIn the early 1980s, way before he was famous for absolutely anything, Alan Moore was tapped to pen a series of science fiction strips for the now-venerable British comic mag 2000 AD. Dubbed Future Shocks, these 2000 AD staples were one-and-done stories with diabolical twist endings and a quirky cast of aliens, time travelers, and ill-mannered mutants.\nRebellion Press has recently collected these vignettes by the bearded one in The Complete Alan Moore Future Shocks, which hit bookstores earlier this month. And even though no one's optioning a big-screen adaptation of the adventures of Bayer Lupo, The First Werewolf in Outer Space or protesting the status quo with masks of, uh, Phlondrutian dungeon guards, this collection remains a worthy purchase.\nIt's somewhat bizarre to think of Alan Moore as a novice. 75% of this has to do with his formidable bibliography; the other 25% stems from the fact that his primal, untamable beard has roamed the Earth for millennia, slaying mastodons before settling on Moore's jawline in the late 20th century. But yes, the reader can definitely tell that a younger Moore was still perfecting his craft here.\nAnd although none of the comics are outright bad, several of them are more generic than the Alan Moore you may be accustomed to. The worst of these shorts read like middling entries in mildewy 1970s horror anthologies. It's good when \"inoffensive\" is the worst it gets.\nBut how about the good stuff? Lo, there's plenty of it. People tend to forget that Alan Moore can be a funny dude, and the high points of this collection are off-kilter comedy. The best bits star weirdos like the aforementioned Bayer Lupo, the doomed planet Klakton (a riff on Superman's origin), Dr. Dibworthy (a time stream meddler who tosses anvils through chronoportals), and the unctuous Abelard Snazz, a problem-solving supergenius who has the uncanny knack for attracting angry mobs. Moore even pens a ripping take on Tharg the Mighty, 2000 AD's surly, Betelgeusian master of ceremonies.\n$20 would be a bargain for Alan Moore's formative zaniness by its lonesome, but when you factor in the art staff \u2014 folks like Dave Gibbons, Steve Dillon, Alan Davis, and Brendan McCarthy \u2014 this collection is a must-buy for Moore completists and a zarjaz choice for anyone else looking to take a respite from reality."}

The 6-foot-10 freshman averages just 10 minutes per game, but he\u2019s averaging nearly two blocks per game. In the last game against North Dakota State, Conditt blocked five shots in 10 minutes.\nLastly, Zion Griffin is a versatile wing defender who also averages 10 minutes per game. He\u2019s coming off MCL surgery, but he\u2019s shown he still has his explosiveness, pulling down three rebounds per game in just 10 minutes.\nJacobson said the joy and youthful abandon that they play with has actually helped him, too."}

The risk of identity theft is a reality for the millions of Americans whose personal data is stored on public and private servers.

This is why lenders have a provision for priority finance, where the lenders are given top priority at the time of settlement.\nMUMBAI: Minority lenders that are part of the consortium that has lent to Jet Airways have agreed to grant priority status to funding that would be provided by State Bank of India + (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB). This will enable SBI and PNB to provide emergency funding to keep the airline afloat until a resolution plan is in place.\nPriority status for the loans would mean that if at the time of resolution lenders need to take a haircut on their historical exposure, the emergency funding would not be subject to any deductions. Normally in the case of default, lenders are hesitant to throw good money after bad. But often, like in most bankruptcy cases, there is a need for additional finance to keep the business going. This is why lenders have a provision for priority finance, where the lenders are given top priority at the time of settlement.\nChief executive Vinay Dube is expected to stay on board the 25-year-old airline Goyal set up with his wife in 1993. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Goyal had agreed to step down as chairman and reduce his 51% stake. Jet\u2019s lenders may invoke Goyal\u2019s entire stake in the airline, and start looking for a new buyer in the coming weeks, the report said.\nEarlier, SBI was not in favour of emergency funding and wanted a durable plan rather than a \u2018band-aid\u2019 solution. However, the crisis at Jet Airways is deepening by the day with promoter Naresh Goyal playing a brinkmanship game. So far, over 80 planes in Jet Airways\u2019 fleet have been grounded by lessors for non-payment of dues.\nBankers say that a revival plan would require sacrifice from the lenders, which would be subject to a new promoter stepping in with equity infusion. With the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in place, any sacrifice is done only during the bankruptcy resolution process. However, in the case of Jet Airways, bankruptcy proceedings are not an option. Lenders say that initiating bankruptcy proceedings could result in lessors attaching their aircraft. Jet\u2019s own aircraft comprise only a fraction of the entire fleet.\nThis would mean that lenders will be left only with the brand and flight routes in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding. Considering that Jet Airways had outstanding debt of over Rs 8,000 crore, the best option for lenders is to sell the airline as a going concern. A prerequisite for selling the airline is evicting Goyal from the promoter\u2019s chair.\nThe public sector banks that have lent to Jet are Canara Bank, Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Allahabad Bank in addition to SBI and PNB in the consortium. For potential buyers, the downside of acquiring Jet as a going concern is that they will have to take on all its liabilities, including dues to Airports Authority, employees and the liability in respect of thousands of cancelled flights. In a bid to raise money for its operations, the airline had aggressively sold tickets last month. However, with aircraft being grounded by the day, the airline has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights. There are"}

As their agent, you work hard to secure strong deals, negotiate ideal terms and operate with their best interests at heart. When the transaction closes and your client is happy, your job may not always be over.

While rental property management tasks can overlap in terms of results, different firms may specialize in different types of services so it is important to ask questions.\nDon\u2019t assume you know the answer until you\u2019ve heard the answer.

Sales could soon expand to other states and Europe.\nCountry's largest SUV maker, Mahindra, is ready to make its debut on US roads. But it's starting with two wheels, not four.\nIf buyers like it, Mahindra could use the GenZe as a springboard into the car market, just as Honda made the leap from motorcycles to cars here in the 1970s.\nThe strategy has some risks. Scooters have never been as popular in the US as elsewhere - people in China buy as many electric scooters in a day as Americans do in a full year, for example. And consumers might not trust Mumbai-based Mahindra, which scrapped an attempt to sell vehicles here five years ago because it couldn't meet US safety standards.\n\"The pressure has really been on to make sure that we get this right,\" says Terence Duncan, the head of customer engagement for the GenZe and one of its chief designers. ''What we're doing, really, is introducing the brand to American customers.\"\nTo appeal to skeptics, Mahindra designed the GenZe in Silicon Valley with features favored by tech-savvy Millennials, like a secure laptop charging port under the seat. It opened its four stores in San Francisco and Portland because buyers there are more accepting of two-wheeled transportation. In Michigan, buyers can get a GenZe at the Ann Arbor factory where it's made.\nThe GenZe only goes up to 30 miles per hour, so riders won't need a motorcycle license. Its most innovative feature is a 28-pound removable battery, which riders can unhook and carry inside to charge. The battery takes 3.5 hours to fully charge, and the scooter goes for 30 miles on a charge. A 7-inch touchscreen display tells drivers their speed and range.\nOnly about 5,000 electric scooters will be sold in the U.S. this year, according to Ryan Citron, who analyzes the market for the consulting company Navigant Research. Among them: the ZEV 2700 and the Bravo EVT-168, which cost about the same as the GenZe. By comparison, 30,000 will be sold in Europe and 3.9 million in China, where electric scooters cost less than half the price of a GenZe because they use a cheaper type of battery.\nCitron says about 46,000 gas-powered scooters will be sold in the US this year. Any scooter has a tough time selling when gas prices are relatively low, he says.\nCitron believes the electric scooter market will grow to around 20,000 annual sales by 2024 as companies like Mahindra and Oregon's Boxx Corp. enter the market. Another one to watch is Gogoro, a Taiwan-based scooter maker that wants to develop stations where riders can swap out batteries.\nMahindra is targeting college campuses and also plans to supply scooter-sharing programs like Scoot. So far, it has around 300 GenZe orders from people who paid a $100 deposit. The company expects to make around 3,000 scooters in the first year, Duncan says."}

Despite the widespread belief that feminism is out-of-style or dead, this mobilization of young women fighting against gender oppression was overwhelming.\nIn Finding Feminism, Alison Dahl Crossley analyzes feminist activists at three different U.S. colleges, revealing that feminism is alive on campuses, but is complex, nuanced, and context-dependent. Young feminists are carrying the torch of the movement, despite a climate that is not always receptive to their claims. These feminists are engaged in social justice organizing in unexpected contexts and spaces, such as multicultural sororities, student government, and online.\nSharing personal stories of their everyday experiences with inequality, the young women in Finding Feminism employ both traditional and innovative feminist tactics. They use the Internet and social media as a tool for their activism\u2014what Alison Dahl Crossley calls \u2018Facebook Feminism.\u2019 The university, as an institution, simultaneously aids and constrains their fight for gender equality.\nOffering a stunning and hopeful portrait of today\u2019s young feminist leaders, Finding Feminism provides insight into the contemporary feminist movement in America."}

He said the insurer is already starting to meet with brokers and consultants about coming new capabilities of the combined company, saying what they are offering is \"not a net new concept,\" but an expansion of choices.\nInsurers are closing ranks around a model that brings the PBM closer to the health plan in hopes of creating a savvier buyer of prescription medicines while seeking more transparency. The addition of Express Scripts to Cigna\u2019s businesses puts it in competition with UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer that owns the PBM OptumRx, and CVS Health, which owns the Caremark PBM and last year bought Aetna, the nation\u2019s third largest health insurer.\nPBMs in particular have been the subject of scrutiny by consumers and policymakers with the Trump administration just this week announcing proposed new regulations for Medicare drug plans that would change how prescription discounts are negotiated. The PBM\u2019s share of rebates, which is the portion of the drug returned by the seller to the buyer, has turned into a nationwide controversy and drawn the attention of the Trump administration and Congress.\nThe regulations are seen as bringing an end to rebates, a controversial approach drug makers have used to keep drugs on PBM and health plan preferred lists known as formularies. Cigna said the new rules are focused on Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare part D drug plans. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a major implication to that business portfolio,\u201d Cordani told analysts Friday morning.\nRather, Cordani said the new regulations could provide Cigna with an opportunity to launch more value-based models with drug makers. He wasn\u2019t specific with what such value-based approaches look like but generally such models reward medical care providers for the quality of the care they provide. In this case, drug makers would be rewarded for a prescription that improves health outcomes.\nIn its earnings report, Cigna said total medical customers in its health insurance plans rose 3.6 percent to 16.96 million in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago period thanks to big jumps in new customers in its commercial and government businesses.\nNet income dropped to $144 million, or 55 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 of last year.

The portfolio rose along with the broader market, gaining 13.66% in the first quarter. In Q1, I began taking monthly disbursements from the portfolio.\nDuring the December market decline, I lowered the cash position to less than 1% to take advantage of some unusual bargains. By the end of Q1, the cash position rose to 3.28%. The current portfolio yield is 4.52%.\nFor the past several months, I've considered replacing Exxon (XOM) with Occidental (OXY). I've looked at OXY from time to time, but this is my first purchase. For the past year I've followed Kirk Spano, and for the past few weeks I have done some writing for his Margin of Safety Investing. Much of Kirk's market analysis has been with oil-related companies.

They pay a strong dividend and are buying back shares while reducing debt for a very solid shareholder yield.

Occidental's carbon capture business is a potential very big deal and\" underpriced catalyst.

Simply Safe Dividends gives XOM a \"very safe\" dividend safety score of 85 (out of 100), and OXY has a \"safe\" dividend safety score of 61. I think both dividends are relatively safe.

It was probably the wildest day in OB\u2019s history. It certainly was OB\u2019s most violent day.\nThe riot occurred when San Diego police attacked a peaceful gathering of hundreds of young OBceans and students who had gathered at a site in northeast OB \u2013 on what was to become Collier Park \u2013 as part of an anti-Vietnam war protest and a \u2018clean-up the park\u2019 project.\nCollier?

The second part included a march up Voltaire to the top of the hill on Greene Street where free food was to be handed out, a local band was setting up to play \u2013 and a clean-up of the future park was to occur. It was a protest to show support for the creation of a park \u2013 as the City was making moves to sell off all the land for apartment developments.\nBut all the plans for the event changed when a column of police showed up at the gathering.\nThen under the command of Police Chief Ray Hoobler, police back then were known to be very confrontational when dealing with African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, gays, hippies \u2013 and anti-war demonstrators.\nSo when the police showed up in force, there were no negotiations, no discussion; it was an unlawful assembly and had to be dispersed. So, rioting broke out when police \u2013 in an unprovoked move \u2013 forcefully broke up the assemblage, arresting whoever was slow to move out of the area. But many of the young people who had been chased from the park, turned around and defied the police with a massive fusillade of rocks.\nOver the course of the next few hours, 50 people were arrested, a bunch of people were injured, a cop car was engulfed in flames, as the rioting swept down the hill and over a mile to the beach.\nNow, this event, as wild and crazy as it was, wasn\u2019t the first time OBceans stood up to city and law enforcement to save a piece of Ocean Beach.

Hansen kept quiet about the discovery two days before of a massive rice theft racket throughout the WFP's network. She advised donors on March 5 when investigators arrived from the Rome head office for a three month probe.\nTHE United Nations World Food Program (WFP), Cambodia's biggest food donor, has been the target of a $2 million rice fraud involving government ministries, trucking companies, rice traders, village communes, and local government officers working in collusion with WFP distribution staff.\nSpecial investigators called in by the WFP found that an estimated 4,000 metric tons of mainly rice worth around $2 million, destined for poor villagers under the WFP's Food For Work scheme, was stolen in a systematic diversion and cover-up and sold for cash, over a 15-month period between January 2003 and April 2004.\nPrime Minister Hun Sen has promised to compensate the WFP either in cash or rice, based on estimates of losses dating back to January 2003. The exact amount is still under negotiation.\nWFP staff involved have been sacked and more may follow as inquiries continue, the WFP's country director, Rebecca Hansen, told the Post.\nThe government is involved in its own investigation to find evidence of criminal activity by government employees. Reports are going to a special committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Sok An. The Anti-Corruption Unit has been assigned to the investigation.\nHansen said if the government had not agreed to co-operate, the WFP would have been reviewing its future role in Cambodia.\nShe said the WFP has suspended all new food aid projects till its compensation conditions are met.\nThe conditions agreed to by the WFP and the government are that the government will accept full responsibility for the loss and will compensate WFP for food lost between January 2003 and April 2004, that the government will hold accountable those primarily responsible for the fraud through either judicial or administrative procedures, and that the government and WFP will put in place controls to prevent the recurrence of food theft in the future.\nHansen described the elaborate, well-hidden racket as \"a Pandora's Box that will continue to produce evidence as the lid is opened further. The lid stays on very tightly for a long time and gradually it starts to come open, and more information comes out.

Devoted to providing rehearsal space and informal but professional performances to choreographers selected by Susan Osberg and Joan Duddy, curators for the event, the series also got off to a difficult start, though professionalism triumphed, when a dancer in one piece and the choreographer-performer of another were unable to appear at the last moment because of illness.\nNeta Pulvermacher's \"Cintura,\" a duet to be danced by Ani Udovicki and Keely Garfield, suddenly became a solo for Ms. Udovicki. Set to haunted music by George Crumb, the solo was a nicely meditative showcase for Ms. Udovicki's fluid, lyrical way of moving. Ms. Osberg's \"Soliloquy,\" substituted for a dance by Sarah Skaggs, had an oddly distanced quality but eventually reached the level of intensity and commitment one might expect from the text, a poem by the choreographer that explored woman's nature. The mysterious score, a sort of cantata for small jungle animals, was composed by Joan La Barbara.\nGina Gibney's \"Calibrations\" was a spare and shadowed ritual for two men that made inventive use of vertical and horizontal stage patterns, clipped semaphoric arm gestures and brusque walks and slow half-falls. It was danced with just the right dry economy by J. Hammons and Doug Johnson.\nTake That Away From Me\" and \"Our Love Is Here to Stay.\"\nThe series, presented on Thursdays and Fridays through Nov. 16, will also feature dance by Santa Aloi, Martha Bowers, Sarah Perron, Theresa Reeves, Pat Cremins, Ms. Garfield, Shelley Lee and Amos Pinhasi."}

There's a shoe rack that doubles as a skateboard rack\u2014and there's even a skateboard, the first Ikea has ever produced.\n\"Fashion and furniture are different animals, but the creative process is similar,\" Stamp said in a statement. \"Design, no matter the medium, is always about finding the right solution to a challenge.\"\n\"Design, no matter the medium, is always about finding the right solution to a challenge.\"\nThe collection also includes a few nods to Stamp's fashion background in the form of a hoodie and a T-shirt, plus accessories like a dad cap and duffel bag.

He paints the former Arkansas governor as fiscally moderate-to-liberal, a mediocre long-term manager, and as somebody who harmed rather than built his state Republican Party.\nBut other than that small distinction, I have continued to stand by my story, for the plain reason that the words I used are accurate descriptions of what occurred. I did NOT say, for instance, that Huckabee broke any criminal laws. Instead, I described the actions themselves, actions where the facts have long been established even if the explanation, or interpretation of what they mean, can be in dispute \u2014 just as, in the realm of opinion, all sorts of facts can be spun all sorts of different ways. Example: Fact: The weather is partly cloudy right now. Interpretation one: That means it might rain. Interpretation two: It is not raining right now. By analogy, the reporting in my column, though, is of the variety that merely says, yes, there are indeed clouds in the sky. Of that, there can be no dispute.\nUnless there is something I am missing, the FACTS as stated in my column remain unchallengeable. And I stand by my contention that there is no need to call a campaign to get explanations when the explanations are already on record, especially because I was there in Little Rock when some of the explanations were offered in the first place and covered them at the time. My column Wednesday dealt entirely with the public record, and provided the links to back it up.\nBut \u2014 and this is the point of this post: Here is a very sincere offer: If the Huckabee campaign will specify to me where my facts \u2014 not intepretation, but facts \u2014 are wrong, and convince me thereof, I will correct those facts just as quickly as I corrected my self-editing oversight concerning the use of the word \u201cpardon.\u201d I do not want to leave an inaccurate record \u2014 and firmly believe that I have not done so."}

However, the not-so-good news is that you won\u2019t necessarily end up feeling any better about yourself. Self-esteem appears to be unconnected to a positive outcome after facelift surgery, according to a study done at New York Center for Facial Plastic and Laser Surgery, New York and published in October 2015 in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery. Patients felt they looked almost nine years younger but there was no change in self-esteem.\nA release from the publisher notes that facelift surgery can restore the appearance of youth to an aging face. As with all cosmetic surgery, psychosocial factors weigh heavily in both the decision to have surgery as well as defining the outcomes of the procedure. With the number of facelift procedures steadily increasing by nearly 30 percent since 1997, it is increasingly important to understand the psychosocial effects of this popular procedure.\nAndrew Jacono, M.D. and coauthors of the study used a self-esteem scale to look at the outcome of facelift surgery as perceived by the patient to understand the association between self-esteem and the results of aesthetic facial rejuvenation.\nThe study included 59 patients undergoing facelift surgery from July through October 2013. Of the 59 patients, 50 completed the six-month post-operative questionnaire. All but two of the patients were women. The average age of the participants was 58.\nPatients with low self-esteem had a statistically significant increase in self-esteem scores after surgery, while those with high preoperative self-esteem showed a statistically significant decrease in self-esteem scores. The group with average preoperative self-esteem showed a nonsignificant increase six months after surgery, according to the results. However, the overall difference between the average preoperative and postoperative self-esteem scores was not statistically significant.\nWhile patients felt they looked nearly nine years younger, that perceived change in youthful appearance did not correlate with changes in self-esteem, the authors report.\n\u201cThese findings underscore the complex nature of the human psyche as it relates to aesthetic surgery and demonstrates that patients exhibit a wide spectrum of psychological reactions after face-lift surgery,\u201d the study concludes."}

But that doesn\u2019t mean the conservative populism they championed during their campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination is as fleeting as their dark-horse candidacies.\nSince rank-and-file House Republicans began criticizing October\u2019s Wall Street bailout, a growing faction of the GOP has been channeling the country\u2019s rage at Corporate America with us-versus-them rhetoric and appeals to economic patriotism. And they are getting help from a Democratic Party whose actions often imply subservience to Big Money.\nRecall that the majority of House Democrats voted to ratify the bank bailout, and the majority of House Republicans opposed it. Recall, too, that Democratic Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is pushing to throw more no-strings-attached cash at Wall Street, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., makes headlines with calls to nationalize the banks.\nConversely, when Republicans tried to prevent bailout and stimulus money from subsidizing job outsourcing, Democrats blocked their amendments and President Obama criticized such \u201cBuy America\u201d laws.\nTo be sure, there is a vaudeville quality to all this.\nGingrich is not only the House Speaker who made business lobbyists an official cog in the legislative process. He\u2019s the Washington careerist who has spent his post-government life as an insurance industry mercenary paid to derail serious health care reform, and his \u201cpopulist\u201d panacea for righting the economy is a proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax, which primarily hits the super-rich. More broadly, while many Democrats joined in the kleptocracy, the Republican Party was the primary force behind almost every regressive tax cut, crony contract, rigged trade deal, deregulation scheme, corporate welfare handout and \u201celite bill\u201d that became law over the last three decades. The idea that the GOP\u2019s Nottingham Sheriffs have genuinely become Robin Hoods might be plausible in a burlesque subtitled \u201cMen in Tights\u201d \u201d but this is real life, not a Mel Brooks spoof.\nThen again, politics is theater of the absurd, featuring everything from a draft dodger posing as a Top Gun pilot to self-proclaimed \u201cfiscal conservatives\u201d repeatedly voting for deficit-expanding tax breaks. And as the GOP regroups for the mid-term elections, party leaders know that Americans\u2019 memories are short during a recession and that rhetoric can substitute for reality in a campaign. They also understand the electoral power of economic populism, even as an appeal to base Republican voters.\nDuring the presidential primary, for example, Huckabee won eight conservative states thanks to his speeches calling Wall Street CEOs \u201ccriminals,\u201d demanding Americans get the same health care as members of Congress, and criticizing unfair trade policies. Meanwhile, Paul attacked \u201ccorporations on welfare\u201d who are \u201cdumping all the bills on Main Street\u201d \u201d and he raised a whopping $34 million, mostly from individual conservative donors.\nFor this bombast to become a cohesive political program, rebel Republicans will have to do battle with the country clubbers that still control their party \u201d and to date, those rebels haven\u2019t been willing to wage such an explicit fight. However, should Democrats collude with the very corporate interests that the nation is so angry at \u201d say, if they obstruct proposals to toughen financial regulations \u201d they will create the incentive for an internal Republican war to explode."}

Moore aims to identify effective reading programs for struggling students based on their individual needs.\nLearning to read is probably the single most critical skill that a child will acquire in his or her lifetime. Yet we as educators have not fully mastered the art of ensuring that every child learns to read. Having spent nearly a decade treating students with learning disabilities, reading disorders, dyslexia, autism, anxiety, and ADHD, and designing reading interventions that have been used in schools, I recognize there\u2019s no silver bullet to fixing a reading problem.\nAre you talking about students who can\u2019t figure out the words on the page (fluency), or students who can\u2019t make sense of the material they are reading (comprehension)? If it\u2019s a fluency issue, does the problem stem from an inability to sound out and decode unknown words (phonemic awareness)? Or does the problem seem to be a sluggish reading rate and a poor ability to quickly recall words on sight (graphemic imagery)? If it\u2019s a comprehension issue, is the problem with absorbing the details and making connections (receptive), or with retelling\u2014in writing or orally\u2014that information in a logically connected, organized way (expressive)?\nYou probably don\u2019t have all the answers to these questions, and that\u2019s OK. Just asking them at all will help you gain a clearer understanding of the sort of challenges you\u2019re up against\u2014 and that\u2019s the first step in choosing a good reading program for your students.\nKnow the Signs That Can Help Identify the Type of Reading Problem.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble determining the type of reading deficit your students are experiencing, take a look at the indicators shown in the below chart. Recognizing these signs can give you an early indication of which support strategy will be most effective for your group.\nKeep in mind that students can have a single reading deficit or a dual one, where they exhibit a combination of more than one type of reading problem. When this happens, it\u2019s best to target one deficit at a time, rather than attempting to correct everything in one fell swoop.\nAn effective reading program includes exercises that target the specific reading deficit that needs improvement. Accordingly, it should start with some sort of diagnostic measure to help you identify that deficit. Ignoring this step is to assume that all reading challenges are the same, and that intervention is simply a matter of figuring out what skills have not been mastered and then re-teaching them.\nGood diagnostic measures account for the variant types of reading deficits. For example, the diagnostic can help determine whether there is a fluency and comprehension problem (dual deficit), or a fluency problem that is limiting comprehension (single deficit). A thorough diagnostic measure can also give an indication of whether the cause of the reading deficit is instructional or cognitive in nature. If the cause is instructional, then some factor\u2014a prolonged illness and absence from school, or a previously undiagnosed case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\u2014has caused gaps in specific content knowledge. If the reading deficit is cognitive, the problem is caused by the way the brain processes information. In general, cognitive deficits require a more in-depth treatment approach, with a longer duration and greater intervention frequency.\nIf the reading program doesn\u2019t include an assessment tool, there are some great independent ones available. The Phonological Awareness Test 2 (LinguiSystems), the Wide Range Achievement Test (PAR), and the Woodcock-Johnson are just a few of the"}

In 2008, Moshe Naish al- Nahari, a Jewish teacher of Hebrew and father of nine, was gunned down by a Muslim Yemenite who demanded al-Nahiri convert to Islam.

The agency said Yanez opened fire, striking Castile multiple times.\nThe agency said several videos, including squad car video, have been collected, though St. Anthony officers don't wear body cameras.\nA Minnesota prosecutor said Friday he has asked for a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" following the police killing of a black motorist whose girlfriend streamed the shooting's gruesome aftermath live on Facebook.\nRamsey County Prosecutor John Choi said the video is part of the investigation into Wednesday's shooting of Castile in suburban St. Paul. The school cafeteria supervisor was shot \"for no apparent reason\" while reaching for his wallet during a traffic stop, after telling the officer he had a gun and a permit to carry it, his girlfriend said in the video.\nChoi declined to provide details about the incident. Police also have refused to say what led up to the traffic stop, why Castile was pulled over or why the officer drew his gun.\nThe bureau did not give the officers' races. Reynolds described the officer who shot Castile as Asian.\nThe St. Anthony Police Department's 2015 annual report points to Yanez's volunteerism.

Yanez's attorney, Thomas Kelly, didn't return a call seeking comment Thursday.\nThe U.S. Justice Department, which quickly launched a civil rights investigation into the Baton Rouge shooting, said it would monitor Minnesota's investigation. Dayton said he and other state officials would ask for stronger federal involvement.\nAt a vigil Thursday evening outside the Montessori school where Castile worked, his mother, Valerie Castile, called her son \"an angel.\" She recalled cautioning him to always comply with police, but she said she never thought she would lose him.\nHundreds of demonstrators braved rain and gathered outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul.

{"idx": "12974", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade.\nWith their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs.\nThe drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers. They could cross the open oceans under sail and then switch to oars for lightning-fast hit-and-run attacks on undefended towns and monasteries. Far surpassing contemporary English or Frankish vessels in lightness and efficiency, longships carried Viking raiders from northern England to north Africa.\nViking expertise in naval craftsmanship soon led to the evolution of other types of ship. Among these were the knarr, or ocean-going cargo vessel, which facilitated far-flung trade networks and the colonization of Iceland, Greenland, and America. The knarr drew on similar design principles as the longship but was higher and wider in relation to its length and had only limited numbers of oars to assist with maneuvers in narrow channels. Cargo decks were installed fore and aft.\nThe secret of the Viking ship lay in its unique construction. Using a broad ax rather than a saw, expert woodworkers would first split oak tree trunks into long, thin planks. They then fastened the boards with iron nails to a single sturdy keel and then to each other, one plank overlapping the next. The Vikings gave shape to the hull using this \"clinker\" technique rather than the more conventional method of first building an inner skeleton for the hull.\nNext, the boatbuilders affixed evenly spaced floor timbers to the keel and not to the hull; this insured resilience and flexibility. They then added crossbeams to provide a deck and rowing benches, and secured a massive beam along the keel to support the mast.\nDiscovered in Norway in 1906, the Oseberg ship, the best preserved Viking ship ever found, reveals its Norse shipbuilders' graceful construction style.\nThe longships' light, economic construction was a major factor behind their success. Modern replicas have achieved speeds of up to 14 knots. In marked contrast to modern sailboats, the ships' lack of a big, vertical keel meant that they were highly maneuverable and could easily penetrate shallow surf and river estuaries. Seafarers steered using a single side rudder on the right, the 'starboard' or \"steering board\" side. (The term 'starboard' is thought to have originated in the Viking era.) They could also reef the square sails in strong winds and adjust them to permit rapid tacking.\nFamous discoveries of Viking ships at Gokstad and Oseberg, Norway, in 1880 and 1906, respectively, established the classic image of the dragon-headed warship. Longships from both sites were preserved almost intact, with lavish carved decoration, in the waterlogged clay of royal burial mounds. Built around A.D. 890, three quarters of a century after the Oseberg ship, the Gokstad vessel shows great improvements in design, particularly in the sturdiness of the mast supports.

She strikes out in her own to peck and bathe in the dust.\nZazu is the last bird in the flock. She is a Black Star, a mix of a red male and a barred Plymouth Rock female. Her orange-and-black plumage looks like glowing embers.\nZazu was skittish when she arrived \u2014 and as fast as a running back. After one 15-minute chase to get her back in the coop, Janos and I had to admit our four combined university degrees didn\u2019t prepare us for farm life.\nNow that she\u2019s settled in, Zazu is proving quite agreeable.

The results of this study are going to be presented at ENDO 2019, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in New Orleans, La on Monday, March 25.\nThose who are not aware their blood sugar is too low can spend more than 100 minutes a day in the hypoglycemic range, raising their risk of seizures, loss of consciousness and death.\nUntil now, there has been limited data on how much time older adults with type 1 diabetes spend in the hypoglycemic range, according to lead researcher Anders L. Carlson, M.D., Medical Director of the International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\"This study of older individuals shows these patients do indeed spend more than an hour per day in a range of hypoglycemia, which puts them at risk for the dangers of low blood glucose,\" Carlson said. \"Those who do not sense when low blood glucose is occurring as strongly as others can are particularly at risk.\"\nLow blood sugar can lead to blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, confused thinking, slurred speech, numbness and drowsiness.\nIf blood sugar falls below a healthy range and is not treated, it can be dangerous. Severe hypoglycemia is treated with an injection of the hormone glucagon. Severe untreated hypoglycemia can cause seizures, loss of consciousness and death.\nMany people with type 1 diabetes have low blood sugar but experience no symptoms, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. Because they don't know when their blood sugar is low, they don't know they need to treat it. This puts them at risk for severe hypoglycemia events, which requires another person to help them recover. They also are less likely to be awakened from sleep.\nThe study reflects baseline data as part of a randomized clinical trial that included 203 adults age 60 and older with type 1 diabetes who used a continuous glucose monitor for up to 21 days. The monitor automatically tracks blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. A continuous glucose monitor uses alarms to alert patients when blood glucose levels are low or start to fall quickly.\n\"The findings underscore the need for interventions to help reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia in this age group,\" Carlson said.\nNovel biomarker might help create a diagnostic tool for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) which can prevent life-threatening episodes of low blood sugar in diabetics.\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar) associated autonomic failure, or HAAF can be prevented by creating a diagnostic tool with the help of new biomarker.\nNearly one in three infants is at risk for neonatal hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), which raise a baby's risk of impaired nervous system development."}

If I'm not gay and I am afraid to mention it, I can only imagine what an athlete must be going through if he is gay....\"\n\"I don't see how any African-American with any inkling of history can say that you don't have the right to live your life how you want to live your life. No one should be telling you who you should love, no one should be telling you who you should be spending the rest of your life with. When we start talking about equality and everybody being treated equally, I don't want to know an African-American who will say everybody doesn't deserve equality.\"\nI don't to nitpick and get pedantic here, as I am wont to do in these moment. I just want to say that this is beautiful thing.\nProps to the Dish for the link.\nMORE: One other thought--I really appreciate the introspection here. Irvin, because of his own checkered biography, has been forced in these recent years into this sort of soul-searching. I don't know what that means for his future, but I think that its always a good idea to look at the struggles of other communities with an enlightened selfishness. It's always a good idea to look at how our societal sickness doesn't just infect the intended victims, but so very often rebounds back upon us.\nHomophobia, as Irvin points out, is--like white racism--more than just yelling \"Die Mutie scum.\" You can't hate black people without hating a significant swath of this country's history and culture. Likewise a disapproval of gays--and gay men, in particular--is, on some level, a disapproval of all things feminine, and thus a disapproval of some essential part of all ourselves."}

But the Brunnings committed so many blunders that \"it appears as though they did it on their own,\" says Faith A. Devine, assistant U.S. attorney, who is prosecuting the criminal case in San Diego.\n\"I don't know if they had attorneys, but if they did, they were not well counseled. They have not acted wisely,\" says Gladstone.\nThe Brunnings owned two Postal Annex Plus franchises -- one on Shelter Island Drive, the other on West Point Loma Boulevard. They did not have significant criminal records, although Terry Brunning had been convicted of a misdemeanor almost two decades ago, according to Devine.\nThe couple had problems at Postal Annex. \"We did not have the smoothest relationship with them,\" says Patrick Edd, executive vice president of the company. \"There were back monies owed us. They had not kept up with royalties and advertising fees. They were having landlord problems\" and also had unhappy suppliers, he says. \"We didn't force them to sell; they came to that conclusion by themselves.\"\nThe pair lived on their 57-foot sailing yacht, the Windsong, which was located at Shelter Pointe Hotel & Marina on Shelter Island. \"They just seemed like ordinary folks. They paid their bills,\" says Steve Carr, who manages the marina.\nBoth Edd and Carr have been interviewed by federal agents. The Internal Revenue Service, Department of Homeland Security, and Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigated the matter.\nAccording to the indictment, the Brunnings stashed $1 million and another $58,000 at two Isle of Man institutions between mid-2000 and mid-2002. In early 2002, they sold the Postal Annex franchises for $75,000 in cash and a promissory note for $155,000.\nIn August of 2002, they filed for Chapter 7, or liquidation bankruptcy, \"to discharge their outstanding debts to financial institutions, government agencies, and other third parties, while maintaining control over and access to property of the bankruptcy estate by means of fraud, conce"}

Canalside (canalsidebuffalo.com), covering 21 acres and with 33,000 square feet of ice, is one of three downtown ice rinks that have recently opened in this Rust Belt comeback city. Along with new craft breweries, food trucks and winter festivals, ice is among the new waterfront attractions that have residents and visitors enjoying the cold. Nearly 30,000 people skated at Canalside in the month after its splashy Dec. 18 opening, officials said. Canalside visitors, who\u2019ve come from as far away as Switzerland and Japan, can also rent what are believed to be the country\u2019s first ice bikes, inspired by recumbent Chinese machines and made locally with blades instead of front wheels.\nNow the Canalside ice sits where the Erie Canal here once was, and where the Buffalo Sabres\u2019 old hockey arena, Memorial Auditorium, stood from 1939 to 2009. Tim Tielman, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for Greater Buffalo History, Architecture & Culture, helped push for the unique placement. \u201cYou\u2019re skating on the same path as so much of Buffalo history, so much of American history,\u201d he said.\nAcross from Canalside is HarborCenter (harborcenter.com), a more than $200 million project financed by the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula.

The buzzing (716) Food and Sport (716foodandsport.com) allows people to watch games on a 38-foot screen. The complex will soon fill in up to 10,000 square feet of street-level retail space and be topped with a 205-room Marriott later this year.\nA 10-minute walk from HarborCenter to an industrial area along the Buffalo River takes you to RiverWorks (buffaloriverworks.com). A half-dozen 100-foot silos painted like a Labatt Blue six-pack announces that this old grain elevator has a new gig. It now holds 30,000 square feet of ice under an open-air pavilion. The year-old Buffalo Curling Club (buffalocurlingclub.org), which my husband and I joined with two friends at a combined cost of $440, has attracted nearly 500 people to slide heavy stones down the ice there weekly. Pond hockey was also scheduled.\nFestivals are bringing people out, too. In early January, Canalside and HarborCenter co-hosted their first Winterfest. One mile away, in the redeveloped warehouse district of Larkinville (larkinsquare.com), businesses held an inaugural Ice Festival at the end of January celebrating what organizers called \u201cour newfound love of ice.\u201d Both festivals included food trucks, in addition to ice bars and sculptures. Larkinville\u2019s offerings were set up in front of Flying Bison Brewing Co., which moved its craft brewery and rugged-industrial taproom to this up-and-coming area last fall.\nAmong the new cold-weather fans is the Rev.
