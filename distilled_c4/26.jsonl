Israeli troops returned fire, killing the militant.\nAccording to the Associated Press, this is the first escalation since March. Two rockets from Gaza landed in southern Israel shortly after the incident.\nIslamic Jihad, one of several militant groups in Gaza, sent a text message to journalists welcoming the attack and calling him a martyr, AP reports, although Reuters reports that the group denied responsibility for the attack.\nAlthough Hamas has not claimed any involvement in this latest attack and has actually shied away from any provocations of Israel lately, the Israeli military holds Hamas ultimately responsible for all attacks out of Gaza because it continues to amass weapons and has not renounced violence against Israel.\nReuters reports that Hamas is focusing its attention on power-sharing talks with Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and its relationship with Egypt.\nThe last bout of violence, in March, was spurred by the killing of a Palestinian militant leader. Four days of rockets from Gaza and airstrikes by the Israeli military followed. Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees carried out those attacks, with Hamas remaining on the sidelines. According to AP, Hamas wants to avoid a large-scale conflict like the one in December 2008 because it could undermine its control of the Gaza Strip.\nThe cross-border infiltration might have been a kidnapping attempt like the one that resulted in the capture of Gilad Shalit in 2006, the Guardian reports, noting that Gaza militant groups have acknowledged their intentions of kidnapping more Israelis to use as bargaining chips for the release of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. Mr. Shalit was released in October, in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, after being held in Gaza for five years.\n\"This is our strategy. It's the only way to force Israel to release prisoners,\" Abu Tarek Mudalel, an Islamic Jihad leader, told the Guardian.\nJust yesterday Israel returned the remains of 91 Palestinians to the West Bank and Gaza as a \"confidence-building measure\" intended to help relaunch peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

The group comprises patients, family members and some public health specialists advocating for regulatory reforms to improve patient safety.\nThe Health Ministry recently approved the formula for determination of compensation for patients who prior to August 2010, had received faulty articular surface replacement hip implants manufactured by the Johnson and Johnson.\nAccording to the formula, those affected were eligible for compensation ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore.\nThe government had constituted a central expert committee under the Chairmanship of Dr RK Arya, Director, Sports Injury Centre, to determine the quantum of compensation.\nHowever, the patients asked if the formula account for the specificity of patients' circumstances like cases of multiple faulty implants and medical histories.\n\"Its poor formulation renders it incomplete and riddled with ambiguities. Any process relying on this formula will not be able to deliver just and fair compensation to patients and their families, defeating the purpose of the exercise,\" the letter said.\nThe affected patients had written to Nadda on October 15 and again on October 20 this year to express serious concerns regarding the lack of transparency and exclusion of patients in the compensation process but had received no response, the letter said.\n\"We would like to clarify that in spite of repeated requests, to date not a single consultation has taken place regarding the compensation process or the formula for determining the quantum of compensation with affected patients or civil society groups,\" the letter said.\nThey said after studying the proposed formula, numerous doubts and questions have arisen. In addition, the patients are able to identify various shortcomings in the formula as well as limitations in its applicability, they said.\nMedical management, which is critically important to patients, is being ignored even though it is very much part of the recommendations put forth by the Expert Committee report and the terms of reference of the Central Expert Committee that is working on compensation, they said."}

Offering the privilege is just one way the Met is trying to curtail its $5 million deficit while showing appreciation to members.

The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored.\nNow, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession \u2013 I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up.\nLast week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.\nThat has now been more than confirmed by the latest figures from the most highly respected survey of its kind, the GfK Consumer Confidence survey. It showed the sharpest drop in confidence since 1994. Confidence has fallen even among Leave voters.\nPolitical uncertainty of a kind unseen for at least a generation will not be helping, but that too was eminently predictable (and indeed predicted) before the vote.\nThe freezing of many leading property investment funds last week heralds sharp falls in the value of commercial property values \u2013 it should not be surprising that with consumer confidence down so badly, shops and offices are likely to be less valuable.\nThe one small silver lining may be the fall in the value of the pound which may provide a lift to exports, but it also means UK companies that buy raw materials or components abroad will face higher costs.\nA weaker pound is unlikely to offset the negative effects of those higher import costs and a general slowdown in the economy.\nI, too, will now be accused of talking down the economy \u2013 if I had that power I would be doing everything to talk it up. I have a job that I want to be secure; I have a house I am trying to sell; I have family who run small businesses which I want to prosper. But I cannot make it so by burying my head in the sand.\nThere are things that can be done to mitigate the problems we face as an economy. The Bank of England can do some things, but as the Governor said, its powers are limited.\nBut action is needed on a truly national and strategic scale. Major investment in our infrastructure is one such action. Measures to encourage business investment would help, but few can act with the force and immediacy of Government.\nAnd distasteful as it will be to some, Government borrowing is the only way this can be achieved. Stephen Crabb, until recently a candidate for the Tory leadership, proposed a \u00a3100 billion fund to spend on public projects; other senior Government figures including both candidates for PM have indicated that an end to austerity is now in order.\nThey are right, but if the country is to mitigate the damage done by Brexit this will have to be more than piecemeal. It will have to be bold. It has never been cheaper for Britain to borrow money. We must do so now.\nThere will be some reading this who will cry in despair, having been solid believers that austerity was the only sensible way to proceed.\nThey almost certainly thought this way because they listened to and were convinced by George Osborne and other senior Tories in recent General Election campaigns.

However, some 17 years later, he developed a persistent cough and a shortness of breath which doctors certified as symptoms of asbestosis and mesothelioma.\nHe was placed under palliative care until his death in May 2016.\nThe second worker had served as a shipwright at the Drydocks and had likewise developed symptoms of malignant mesothelioma some 20 years after retirement, succumbing to his illness at the age of 76.\nThe scenario surrounding the third victim was somewhat different. The man had been a welder working in a private company when he was deployed for a long number of years to the former St Luke\u2019s Hospital where he assisted in the dismantling of asbestos pipes.\nSince the early 1980s, the worker spent days on end working in the basement of the hospital, removing the old pipes which placed him in close contact with asbestos fragments and dust.\nEventually, he developed similar symptoms, passing away two years later aged 67. The cause of his death was put down as \u201cmalignant mesothelioma with brain and lung metastasis\u201d.\nUpon the evidence put forward, the First Hall, Civil Court, in its constitutional jurisdiction, concluded that the medical file of each patient had left no doubt as to the fact that their illness had been a consequence of such contact with asbestos.\nIn spite of the harmful effects caused through exposure to asbestos, which effects had long been known in the scientific and medical fields, the authorities had dragged their feet in taking \u201ceffective precautionary measures\u201d as well as implementing laws to safeguard workers, the court observed.\nMoreover, in view of the argument raised by the respondents that the State was not to be held responsible for the work conditions of Dockyard employees, the court deemed this \u201csomewhat ironical\u201d, given that \u201cfor several years, the dockyard fell under state or parastatal responsibility\u201d, the court continued.\nIn the light of all evidence, the court, presided over by Mr Justice Joseph R.

(KTVU) - Four victims of childhood sexual assault have filed a lawsuit against the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and two local branches in Sonoma County, claiming the organization intentionally ignored sexual abuse by an athletic director over the course of more than 10 years.\nEarlier this year, former athletic director Paul Dwayne Kilgore, 70, of Sonoma, was convicted of two counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child and four counts of committing lewd and lascivious acts and sentenced to 150 years in prison.\nKilgore was the athletic director at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Sonoma Valley for 10 years before resigning in 2013.\nAuthorities say the offenses occurred at Kilgore's home and at local swimming pools when the boys were 14 or younger. Prosecutors said Kilgore used his position as athletic director to establish connections with the boys, though none of the sexual contact with the boys occurred at the Boys & Girls Clubs.\nStill, the lawsuit alleges that the club received multiple reports from employees, parents and club participants of Kilgore\u2019s sexual abuse, yet intentionally did not report the incidents to authorities allowing Kilgore to continue the sexual abuse of boys 6 to 10 years old over the course of many years.\nCary Leigh Dacy, the president and CEO of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Sonoma Valley, released a statement Tuesday saying the club \"cooperated fully\" with the police investigation and criminal proceedings and will continue to do so in any future proceedings.\n\"The safety and protection of the children we serve remains the number one priority of Boys & Girls Clubs of Sonoma Valley.

The probe uncovered inappropriate behavior, yet staff members did not alert parents or law enforcement of their findings, the suit says.\nKilgore resigned from his job in 2013, but was hired by a different Sonoma County Boys & Girls Club, where his behavior allegedly continued until a teacher reported the conduct to police and Kilgore was arrested and charged with multiple felonies in 2016.\nFour elementary"}

Firefighters are now battling the largest wildfire in California's history. In the Mendocino complex fire in northern California one of 17 wildfires burning throughout the state. So it's no surprise that one of the biggest concerns voiced at a recent County Board of Supervisors meeting on new home development in unincorporated areas was about the threat of wildfire and there was a change in official responses to that concern that we haven't heard before. The concept that some residents in new housing developments should shelter in place during a wildfire. That is a major shift from previous pronouncements that people need to evacuate and that sheltering in place is life threatening. And what's even more surprising is that the shelter in place advice was given by Cal Fire Chief Tony Meacham chief Meachem joins me now. Chief welcome to the program. Hey good morning. Would you like to clarify the statements you made at that board of supervisors meeting last month. Is it really the policy of Cal Fire that some residents threatened by wildfire are safer sheltering in place.\nin newer communities or communities that have adequate defensible space around the community and we're in the initial stages of the fire. You know for Jeff maybe within the first hour or two we make that decision at that moment. It is safer to leave people inside buildings that we feel will withstand fire as opposed to putting them on the roadway. Having said that if we have three or four hours notice that a fire is going to hit a community or a couple hours notice we're absolutely going to continue with our practice of evacuating everybody from the fire. But we've always had this option of shelter in place but I think it is becoming more pronounced now specific to the the two developments. Yes I feel that the option of shelter in place is a very good option. Those developments are going to have very large expansive fuel breaks and projects around the community which we as the fire service collectively feel is going to be very easy to defend as opposed to putting those people on the roadways.\nNow climate scientists and firefighters tell us that wildfires are not only burning bigger areas but they are burning hotter as well. Are you confident that the kinds of construction and interior protection and the other protections that you just explained will make residents safe inside their houses or in their developments.\nback in. Our overall reaction is our overall goal is we are going to evacuate anybody that we believe in harm's way. But there is certain circumstances where a fire is impacting for example our escape route out and it's much safer to leave those people where they're at.\nNow back at the 2007 Witch Fire about 500000 people in San Diego County were evacuated. Looking back on that do you think that it was it that was successful from your point of view should we have done anything differently.\nNo I think it was. I think it was successful and I think that we're going to continue to do that when you have 60 to 70 mile an hour winds are blowing and not wide of a fire front moving into that populated of an area. You know the the prudent thing for public safety officials to do is to issue that wide evacuation order before I let you go Chief Meecham.\nI do want to ask you just a"}

They did try - very hard as a matter of fact, with Mad Max director George Miller set to helm the film in Australia. However, Warner Brothers decided to pull the plug on Justice League when the budget of the film spiraled to $300 million.\nSorcerer's Apprentice star Jay Baruchel was set to play the villain of the piece; while out promoting Apprentice, the young actor talked to Digital Spy about what the superhero team-up might have been.\n\"I'll just say this, if we had been able to make the movie that we had gone down [to Australia] to rehearse, if you had seen the production art I'd seen... it would've been the coolest thing ever. It would have been the neatest vision of Batman and the coolest vision of Superman you've ever seen. It would have been dark and fairly brutal and quite gory and just f**king epic.\"\n\"It's weird talking about it because the blogosphere was not very kind to us - they're looking for anything to s**t on! The two of us (Baruchel & Teresa Palmer) were going to do that, it sounds really strange out of context, had you read the script it would have made perfect sense.\"\nIn my opinion, I feel that fans were negative because the film would have broken with continuity of the current Batman and (then) Superman franchises, coupled with the fact that all the actors cast in the principal roles were just too young! If Christian Bale and Brandon Routh were cast in the film then it would have been a different matter.\nDid you get as far as seeing the Justice League heroes in costume?\n\"I did. My friends, who were training to be Batman and Superman, they were down there for three months training and going to Weta in New Zealand to get their costumes. Weta, which is arguably the greatest special effects house on Earth, they had to cancel everything else. They were doing nothing but our movie. It was going to be f**king dope!\"\n\"They had everything there; maquettes, pre-visualisation, absolutely everything and we had assembled this neat cast. The rehearsal process was so strange and so unconventional and, I know it sounds hard to believe, but I assure you it would have been something f**king awesome!\"\nIt seems that the budget was just too rich for Warner Bros, especially with a cast of unknowns portraying comic book icons like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and The Flash.\n\"The problem was that, had it gone to production, it would have been the single most expensive movie in the history of movies. Sometimes people are reticent to spend upwards of $300 million. It was a fun two weeks in Sydney and I got to hang out with one of my idols, George Miller.\"\nWould Justice League have been as \"dope\" as Baruchel would have us believe? Maybe, maybe not. It's hard to say and truly we will never know. Miller is now busy making two new Mad Max films, and its very unlikely that he'll return to helm Justice League in the future.\nAt least we'll have Ryan Reynolds as The Green Lantern and Christopher Nolan is working on new Batman and Superman films - so we can't really complain!"}

Huge, hulking bureaucratic government appeals to them because, as \u201cleaders\u201d, they expect to be in charge of it one day, and the limitless, unaccountable authority the departments, bureaux and offices wield is exactly what they need to \u2018correct\u2019 society\u2019s myriad errors and faults. Moreover, a massive administrative leviathan will strangle this nation in a quagmire of regulations and brake its economic growth with confiscatory taxation, allowing other nations to overtake America politically, economically, commercially and militarily, something the international, professional left has been working to accomplish for over a century. Control of the nation through a single central government, precisely what the Founding Fathers worked to avoid, is the left\u2019s primary agenda.\nEither an outright elimination of the Electoral College by Constitutional amendment, or an underhanded, stealthy stab-in-the-back like the so-called \u201cNational Popular Vote Interstate Compact\u201d, which Delaware joined the last Friday in March, will have the same effect: Like dominoes, each key brick in the Constitutional wall, designed to preserve the individuality of the states and to prevent the federal government from becoming the only government, will begin to fall.\nWith the College effectively gone, and the president chosen by the 8 or 10 largest cities in the half-dozen largest states, the entire electoral dynamic in the nation will shift very quickly. A main purpose of the Senate is to ensure that states with small populations, like Delaware, Alaska or Rhode Island, would have an equal voice in the senate and wouldn\u2019t be irrelevant in the congress as a whole. The Electoral College comprises 535 electors, equaling the total number of congressional representatives in the House and Senate. With the College gone, no American\u2019s presidential vote, outside of the large coastal and Midwestern leftist Democrat cities, will matter. A nauseating whine of the Mediacrat party is that smaller, rural states, in our federal, bicameral system, are \u201cover-represented\u201d , which, by necessity, would mean that New York, California and Illinois are, somehow, under-represented, so eliminating the College just gets things \u201cproperly balanced\u201d. It should come as no surprise that Soros and his friends are part of the financial force behind the popular vote compact.\nMake no mistake: eliminating major democratic institutions has been the modern left\u2019s agenda for over a century.\nOnce a succession of leftist presidents are elected by overwhelming \u201cpopular\u201d votes, it will quickly become obvious to the ruling class that the states themselves, and the U.S. senate with them, no longer serve any real purpose. The concentrated Democrat leftist population centers will elect Democrat presidents permanently, and Americans in the heartland will simply no longer matter. They\u2019ll be a shrinking population anyway, socially engineered to pay for a welfare-based expansion of the urban poverty industry. And as soon as the very states themselves are legislated out of existence (Constitutionally? You\u2019re joking, right?), the Washington ruling class can do anything they want to.\nWith states, and states\u2019 rights, a thing of the past, the professional left will establish a new \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d or anything else they feel like.

Many games are ideal for teens because they promote healthy competition and are challenging enough to keep teenagers entertained for hours. Ensure that supervision is available, even if the teens know how to swim.\nJousting in the pool requires balance and skill, but is fun to play and watch at the same time. To play, have two teens each sit on one pool raft, with one leg on each side. Make sure the raft has enough air to hold the players afloat. Each player holds a foam pool noodle in one hand. Using their feet, the teens paddle close to each other and use the noodles to try and knock one another off the rafts. The player who remains on his raft the longest is the winner.\nSharks and minnows is a good game for a large crowd because more players make the game more exciting and challenging. However, the game is played in the deep end of the pool and isn't recommended for teens who aren't strong swimmers. To play, one teen is the shark and the others are minnows. The shark stands at one end of the pool while the minnows stand on the edge of the deep end. The shark tells the minnows to swim to her, the minnows jump into the pool and begin swimming toward the shark. The minnows must reach the shark's side of the pool without being tagged out. If a minnow is tagged, she becomes a shark and helps eliminate the other minnows. The last minnow standing is the winner.\nIsland Mail requires teens to work together to win. To play, divide teens into two teams with an equal number of players. Each player floats a pool raft in front of him. The first player tosses a water balloon onto the next player's raft without letting it fall off. If the balloon falls into the water, it returns to the beginning of the line. The first team that gets its balloon to the last raft wins. This game also works well with small water balls, beach balls or other floating pool toys.\nScavenger Hunt is a fun idea for private pools. To play, scatter a range of objects at the bottom of the pool and divide teens into two groups. Make sure you have two of each item so that team has a chance to collect the items on the list. Coins, diving rings, flat marbles, washcloths and bottle caps are good choices. Write the items on a list. Give each team a list, and challenge teens to swim to the bottom and bring up the designated items. The more things you toss in the pool, the more challenging the game becomes. The first team to complete the list wins."}

After six months of trying, I made our first medical appointment to seek help.\nI was subjected to endless blood tests and pelvic scans, none of which returned any answers. Then followed hormone injections and alternative medicine. None of that returned any results.\nWe were on the doorstep of IVF when our fertility specialist presented us with the option of a laparoscopy, a type of keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic. The procedure would look for endometriosis which could be treated while I was still unconscious.\nThere was no way to diagnose endo for sure without this surgery. The extent to which removing endo could improve fertility was unknown but seen as \u201clikely\u201d to help. It would be $2000 out of pocket and the public wait list for elective surgery was 12 months.

There were the usual risks (infections, allergic reactions, damage to vital organs) associated with any operation.\nThe alternative was to skip surgery and go straight to IVF. That meant police checks, daily needles, an upfront payment of $10,000 and for someone my age, an estimated 30 per cent chance of success.\nAs IVF could work in women with endometriosis, the doctor suggested IVF as the next step. IVF, she argued was diagnostic too as it examined egg and sperm under the microscope and could result in a baby.\nHer advice made some sense but I couldn\u2019t reconcile starting IVF without addressing all underlying health concerns. If IVF didn\u2019t work, I would always wonder if it was the endo I left untreated.\nIt was costly and with risks, but my partner and I chose surgery as a way of seeking information.

Ice cores can provide an annual record of temperature, precipitation, atmospheric composition, volcanic activity and wind patterns, according to NASA.\nThousands of years ago, when the ancient Greek and Roman empires ruled over Europe, lead was mined and smelted to produce water pipes and ship sheathing, for example.\nThe lead pollution drifted some 2,800 miles north with the winds over the ocean to Greenland and settled into the ice. Then, each year, as snowfall added layers to the ice sheet, lead emissions were captured along with dust and other airborne particles, and became part of the ice-core record that scientists use today to learn about conditions of the past.\nLead pollution emissions began to rise as early as 900 B.C., the study said, as Phoenicians expanded their trading routes into the western Mediterranean.\nDuring prosperous times, lead pollution was more plentiful, indicating a strong economy. According to the study, the highest levels of lead pollution emissions coincided with the height of the Roman Empire during the 1st and 2nd centuries, a period of economic prosperity known as the Pax Romana.\nPlagues, wars and political instability decreased the amount of lead found in the Greenland ice over the next few centuries.\n\"The great Antonine Plague struck the Roman Empire in A.D. 165 and lasted at least 15 years,\" said study co-author Andrew Wilson, an archaeologist from the University of Oxford. \"The high lead emissions of the Pax Romana ended exactly at that time and didn't recover until the early Middle Ages, more than 500 years later,\" he said.\nThe study's research team included an unusual combination of scholars, including ice-core specialists, atmospheric scientists, archaeologists and economic historians.\nThe study appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."}

The three didn't take their seats until after Hindu cleric Rajan Zed had finished his prayer, which focused on selflessness, the AP reports. \"Hindu is a false faith with false gods,\" said Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll. \"I think it's great that Hindu people can practice their religion, but since we're the Senate, we're setting an example of what we, Idaho, believe.\" Another of the three, Sen.

What I do remember is that they were gentle, polite, humble, knowledgeable and hard working nurses and that's what was most important to the patients and to me.\nPlease have pity for the poor Right Wing Christian Republican Conservatives.

Over the next hundred minutes Sanders staunchly defended her boss, Donald Trump, reeling off a list of his perceived achievements and grievances. Five White House correspondents took her on but, in an atmosphere more collegiate than combative, she brushed them aside with a mix of zealous certainty, down-home charm and wry jokes. The 35-year-old was lavished with praise for showing up and roundly applauded by audience members, some of whom raced forward in the hope of a handshake or photo.\nVehement critics of Trump who observed the convivial scene at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association event in Washington on Monday might have felt they had stumbled into a parallel universe. From their perspective, Sanders is an apologist for the dangerous demagogue and white supremacist who occupies the White House. But her adept performance underlined how, with greater subtlety than her hapless predecessor Sean Spicer, Sanders has effectively become Trump\u2019s normaliser-in-chief.\nPolitics and religion have been central to Sanders\u2019 life. She was born in Hope, the small town in Arkansas that also produced former president Bill Clinton, and went to Central high school in Little Rock, where in 1957 nine African American teenagers braved violent protests to attend school after the supreme court outlawed racial segregation. When she was 15 she watched Clinton and her father, Governor Mike Huckabee, open the school doors for the Little Rock Nine to mark the 40th anniversary.\nSanders has recalled a childhood of stuffing envelopes, knocking on doors and putting up yard signs for her father\u2019s election campaigns. Aged 25, she helped him to a surprise win in the 2008 Iowa caucus for the presidency (he later fell away and became a host on Fox News). She worked in legislative affairs for the education department under George W Bush and, in 2011-12, she worked as a consultant for Bono\u2019s anti-poverty ONE campaign. She was Spicer\u2019s deputy when the Trump administration took office and stepped up when he quit in July, becoming the third woman and first mother to serve as White House press secretary.\nOnce, when challenged about disarray in the West Wing, Sanders, who wakes up at 5am each day, quipped: \u201cIf you want to see chaos, come to my house with three pre-schoolers. This doesn\u2019t hold a candle to that.\u201d Her children\u2019s artwork, including several hearts, is pinned to a board behind her desk in the West Wing office she inherited from Spicer. The desk also has a flagpole with the Stars and Stripes beside it, and a giant photo of Trump\u2019s joint press conference with Theresa May sits above the fireplace, next to two TVs. A fruit bowl has been placed on a meeting table that is surrounded by four chairs on the blue and white carpet. Next to the office door is a photo of Air Force One beneath a vast blue sky.\nSpicer notoriously used his debut as press secretary to tear a strip off the media over its reporting of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size, then made a series of spectacular gaffes, for example claiming that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people and referring crassly to \u201cHolocaust centres\u201d.

School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box \u2013 a valuable ability in today's world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.\nThe course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.\nHigh school mathematics. Specific requirements are familiarity with elementary symbolic algebra, the concept of a number system (in particular, the characteristics of, and distinctions between, the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers), and some elementary set theory (including inequalities and intervals of the real line). Students whose familiarity with these topics is somewhat rusty typically find that with a little extra effort they can pick up what is required along the way. The only heavy use of these topics is in the (optional) final two weeks of the Extended Course.\nA good way to assess if your basic school background is adequate (even if currently rusty) is to glance at the topics in the book Adding It Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics (free download), published by the US National Academies Press in 2001. Though aimed at K-8 mathematics teachers and teacher educators, it provides an excellent coverage of what constitutes a good basic mathematics education for life in the Twenty-First Century (which was the National Academies' aim in producing it)."}

The refining giant posted profits that came in ahead of expectations in the fourth quarter, but earnings for the quarter and full year came in below levels from 2014.\nNonetheless, Phillips 66 is well-positioned to be a market-crushing investment for years ahead, even if -- maybe especially if -- the current energy downturn lasts longer than anyone expects. Here are three key reasons why now is a great time to buy shares of Phillips 66.\nPhillips 66 doesn't drill for oil or natural gas. Because of this, it has much less exposure to commodity price swings than integrated oil companies like ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and oil and gas producers like ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). And the bottom line is, producers -- or companies that operate a production segment -- are hurting with oil and gas prices down so low.\nExxonMobil reported 2015 earnings recently, announcing that profits were down 50% in 2015, and the losses had accelerated in the fourth quarter, falling 58% from Q4 of 2014. The biggest driver behind the company's declining profits was, by far, its upstream business segment, which is its oil and gas production business. In 2014, ExxonMobil generated $32.5 billion in profits, with $27.5 billion of that coming from upstream operations. In 2015, the company's net income was $16 billion, and with the upstream segment generating $8.1 billion, down a massive 70% from the year before.\nConocoPhillips, a stand-alone producer, is really feeling the pinch of oil prices. The company reported a net loss of $4.4 billion in 2015 after a $6.9 billion profit in 2014. Even when adjusting earnings for one-time items, including noncash asset writedowns, the megaproducer still lost $1.7 billion last year.\nWith the ongoing oil-price environment looking like it could last for a while, ConocoPhillips has been forced to take major steps to cut costs. Operating expenses were 14% lower last year than in 2014, it spent 40% less on capital projects, and sold $2 billion in assets; but that still hasn't been enough for the company to make money. Because of this, the company just announced a 75% reduction in its dividend as a step to help it preserve cash.\nPhillips 66, however, buys oil and gas, and can actually benefit when commodity prices are down. But even when there's not a benefit, the company isn't subject to the kinds of major losses that producers are.\nPhillips 66's refining and marketing business is the company's cash cow, and likely to remain so for years to come. It's also the part of the business that would generate less-attractive capital returns if the company invested to grow it.\nHowever, demand for the products made from the company's petrochemicals operations -- things like fertilizer, rubbers, plastics, and synthetic fabrics -- have huge consumer and industrial demand"}

Jerry Brown signed the measure, called the Prime Time Primary Act, into law on Wednesday The law, which passed largely along party lines in the majority-Democratic Legislature, moves the state's primaries to the Tuesday after the first Monday in March (that's March 3 in 2020), when as many as a dozen states hold their nominating contests in an electoral jamboree that frequently determines the course of the presidential campaign.\n\"Candidates will not be able to ignore the largest, most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country's highest office,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. \"The Prime Time Primary Act will help ensure that issues important to Californians are prioritized by presidential candidates from all political parties.\"\nIn past election cycles, the Democratic National Committee has awarded the California Democratic Party 70 extra delegates to keep its primary in June, away from Super Tuesday.\nThe DNC could choose to strip the state party of those delegates in 2020. That would leave California Democrats with about 400 delegates \u2014 still the most of any state by far, and coming into play at a critical point in the campaign.\nThat could be crucial for any California Democrats who join the 2020 race, a group of candidates that is widely believed could include U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\nEven if there is no California candidate to capitalize on the earlier primary, it's still a boon for Democrats, said Eric Bauman, chairman of the state Democratic Party, who called California \"the beating heart of the national resistance to Trump.\"\n\"When it comes to deciding the Democratic nominee, our voices need to be heard early in the process,\" Bauman said."}

This piece will look at some of their projected trends. You can view the full reports here.\nIn both the US and China IDC sees data storage moving from endpoints (individual devices and systems), to the core (cloud) and edge of networks, as shown below for the US. They believe that big data processing of IoT and AI workloads will be increasingly done at the edge and in big data centers, driving storage and memory requirements there but reducing relative demand at data generation endpoints.\nThese new reports focused on installed storage capacity compared with data generation, rather than annual shipping capacity (as in the November 2018 report). The US report says that in 2018, the United States had 29.1% of the world's 5.0ZB installed base of storage capacity. This share of storage capacity decreases to 28.5% in 2025, when the world is expected to have an installed storage capacity of roughly 16.5ZB. As discussed below, China will account for a growing amount of the new storage capacity.\nAccording to IDC the U.S. Datasphere is growing more slowly than many other regions. The U.S.\nDatasphere is 21% of the Global Datasphere in 2018 but only 17.5% in 2025, growing from 6.9ZB to 30.6ZB, a 23.6% CAGR for 2018\u20132025. Like other regions, much of the growth will be driven by signals from IoT devices, metadata, and video surveillance. However, IDC thinks that growth in entertainment-driven data is slowing as productivity-related (for instance in factories, smart city infrastructure, etc.) data accelerates.\nAccording to the US report, the percentage of data in the U.S. Datasphere emanating from or replicated in the edge will grow by more than seven times \u2014 from 15% to 25% of the total U.S. Datasphere \u2014 as IoT devices increasingly drive processing and analytics closer to the point of origin of the data itself.\nThe total China installed storage capacity compared with its own Datasphere in 2018 was just over 12%.

It would decline to about 4 percent of GDP by 2012 and remain between 4 percent and 6 percent of GDP through 2019.\nThe cumulative deficit from 2010 to 2019 under the President\u2019s proposals would total $9.3 trillion, compared with a cumulative deficit of $4.4 trillion projected under the current-law assumptions embodied in CBO\u2019s baseline. Debt held by the public would rise, from 41 percent of GDP in 2008 to 57 percent in 2009 and then to 82 percent of GDP by 2019 (compared with 56 percent of GDP in that year under baseline assumptions).\nSound the alarm bells, I'm sorry the public debt will reach 82% of GDP by 2019???? Holy default batman!\nPresident Barack Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year over the next decade, according to the latest congressional estimates, significantly worse than predicted by the White House just last month.\nThe Congressional Budget Office figures, obtained by The Associated Press Friday, predict Obama's budget will produce $9.3 trillion worth of red ink over 2010-2019. That's $2.3 trillion worse than the White House predicted in its budget.\nWorst of all, CBO says the deficit under Obama's policies would never go below 4 percent of the size of the economy, figures that economists agree are unsustainable. By the end of the decade, the deficit would exceed 5 percent of gross domestic product, a dangerously high level.\n5% of GDP. This is astounding!

The bond market would collapse and with it the values of debt-related derivatives on the \u201cbanks too big too fail\u201d balance sheets. The financial system would be in turmoil, and panic would reign.\nRapidly rising bullion prices were an indication of loss of confidence in the dollar and were signaling a drop in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate. The Fed used naked shorts in the paper gold market to offset the price effect of a rising demand for bullion possession. Short sales that drive down the price trigger stop-loss orders that automatically lead to individual sales of bullion holdings once their loss limits are reached.\nAccording to Andrew Maguire, on Friday, April 12, the Fed\u2019s agents hit the market with 500 tons of naked shorts. Normally, a short is when an investor thinks the price of a stock or commodity is going to fall. He wants to sell the item in advance of the fall, pocket the money, and then buy the item back after it falls in price, thus making money on the short sale. If he doesn\u2019t have the item, he borrows it from someone who does, putting up cash collateral equal to the current market price. Then he sells the item, waits for it to fall in price, buys it back at the lower price and returns it to the owner who returns his collateral. If enough shorts are sold, the result can be to drive down the market price.\nA naked short is when the short seller does not have or borrow the item that he shorts, but sells shorts regardless. In the paper gold market, the participants are betting on gold prices and are content with the monetary payment. Therefore, generally, as participants are not interested in taking delivery of the gold, naked shorts do not need to be covered with the physical metal.\nIn other words, with naked shorts, no physical metal is actually sold.\nPeople ask me how I know that the Fed is rigging the bullion price and seem surprised that anyone would think the Fed and its bullion bank agents would do such a thing, despite the public knowledge that the Fed is rigging the bond market and the banks with the Fed\u2019s knowledge rigged the Libor rate. The answer is that the circumstantial evidence is powerful.\nConsider the 500 tons of paper gold sold on Friday. Begin with the question, how many ounces is 500 tons? There are 2,000 pounds to one ton. 500 tons equal 1,000,000 pounds. There are 16 ounces to one pound, which comes to 16 million ounces of short sales on Friday.\nWho has 16 million ounces of gold? At the beginning gold price that day of about $1,550, that comes to $24,800,000,000. Who has that kind of money?\nWhat happens when 500 tons of gold sales are dumped on the market at one time or on one day? Correct, it drives the price down. Investors who want to get out of large positions would spread sales out over time so as not to lower their sales proceeds. The sale took gold down by about $73 per ounce. That means the seller or sellers lost up to $73 dollars 16 million times, or $1,168,000,000.\nWho can afford to lose that kind of money? Only a central bank that can print it.\nI believe that the authorities"}

The paper mill submitted environmental assessment regulation documents last week that laid out details of its planned \u2014 and controversial \u2014 new effluent treatment facility, including piping treated waste into the Northumberland Strait.\nBut under even the most optimistic circumstances, that new treatment facility wouldn\u2019t be operational until nearly a year after the legislated closure date for Boat Harbour.\nSo Northern Pulp, let\u2019s call the company Train A, is banking on getting that extension. Without it, company officials have suggested, the mill may have to shut down for good. Cold idling \u2014 closing temporarily \u2014 isn\u2019t a realistic option, they\u2019ve said.\nMeanwhile, the provincial government, which we\u2019ll call Train B, is vowing the deadline for Boat Harbour\u2019s closure remains immovable \u2014 unless the community agrees.\nThat seems highly unlikely. Pictou Landing First Nation, which recently celebrated beginning to count down the final year before closure of the treatment facility on their doorstep, has made it clear they have no intention of agreeing to any extension.\nProponents on both sides argue the stakes are enormous. Unifor, which represents more than 200 workers at the mill, has called on Premier Stephen McNeil to protect forestry jobs. The forestry industry had warned that sawmills across Nova Scotia rely on Northern Pulp as a buyer.\nMeanwhile, beyond Pictou Landing\u2019s clear rejection of any Boat Harbour extension, the fishing industry and community group Friends of the Northumberland Strait remain strongly opposed to plans to pipe effluent into the strait separating Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.\nThe crucial question is whether Northern Pulp\u2019s plan for a new effluent treatment plan will pass environmental muster. Despite understandably hightened emotions on both sides, the science must prevail.\nIf the mill\u2019s plan is rejected, Northern Pulp\u2019s future in this province will be in grave doubt. The provincial government is now bracing itself for that eventuality.\nBut if the new effluent treatment facility wins approval \u2014 whether through the shorter provincial path or, which could still happen, a much longer federal review \u2014 then the pressing question becomes what to do about the seemingly unavoidable need to temporarily shut down the mill.\nGiven the enormous costs the permanent loss of Northern Pulp would have on the province\u2019s economy, in that latter scenario McNeil\u2019s government may have to swallow hard and find a way to keep Northern Pulp \u2014 and others affected in the foresty industry \u2014 on life support until the new treatment plant is up and running."}

The new Nvidia Shield is a $200 set-top-box running Android TV, but it's more than that. It's a game console poweful enough to play a port of Crysis 3. And at first blush, it sure feels like a solid piece of kit.\nThe first device to boast Nvidia's new Tegra X1 processor, the Shield is as angular as you'd expect from an Nvidia-built machine. It's roughly the size of a small tablet, but rakish like a stealth fighter, with corners jutting out everywhere.\nYou know the joke about another fist beneath Chuck Norris's chin? So it is with the Nvidia Shield's angles.\nAround back, there are quite a few ports: two USB 3.0 sockets, Gigabit Ethernet, microUSB, HDMI out, and a microSD card slot. The console comes with 16GB of storage to start, but Nvidia tells us it'll fit a 128GB microSD card, and you'll be able to install games directly to that storage. The HDMI port can output a 4K signal. While Nvidia isn't expecting a lot of 4K games, the company says 4K Netflix and 4K Google Play Movies and TV will come to the microconsole.\nThe console also sports 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi for maximum performance while streaming games\u2014either from your GeForce-equipped PC or Nvidia's Grid game streaming service. Just like previous Shield devices.\nAnd for streaming audio from the Shield to the bundled Wi-Fi Direct game controller, which can let you keep on playing even when your significant other goes to bed. It's the same great controller that you can buy for the Shield Tablet\u2014a solid Xbox 360 controller knockoff with great buttons and great analog sticks, plus a tiny touchpad in the center for if you ever need it.\nOptional extras: a nice aluminum stand that lets you prop up the Shield vertically\u2014the console slides right in\u2014and a TV-style remote control with a microUSB rechargeable battery and a mic for Android TV voice commands. The new Shield also has an infrared port so you can control it with universal remotes like the Logitech Harmony?\nSo can it really run crazy-intensive games like Crysis 3? Yes it can... but it's hard to say how well quite yet. I did indeed see an early build of Crysis 3 running on the Shield, but Nvidia wouldn't hand over the controls\u2014probably because it was stuttering a bit and clearly needed some more work. I did indeed try Doom 3 BFG Edition, and it looks pretty damn good for an Android title.\nHonestly, the most amazing part of Nvidia's initative isn't this hardware at all. The original Shield and Shield Tablet were pretty impressive performers for the time, too. It's that somehow, Nvidia has managed to convince big game developers like Crytek, Capcom, and Konami to finally take Android seriously. Can you imagine that soon you'll be able to buy the likes of Crysis 3, Resident Evil 5, and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance for an Android system?\nAnd\u2014though there was no way for me to tell"}

And no, this sad tone is not an April Fool's prank, sadly.\nIt\u2019s not always easy to achieve what we want, sometimes it\u2019s not even easy to define what we want to achieve. We can have doubts, we can work really hard on something for a while and then question it so much, we\u2019re not even sure we\u2019ll ship it. We can get demotivated, uncertain, depressed even by negative reactions or interactions, and it can lead to developers stepping away from the project, taking a break or even leaving for good. And then sometimes simply seeing people enjoy what we did can boost an entire team, whether it\u2019s seeing happiness in an email/comment or getting a feeling of satisfaction after a constructive interaction which leads to a fix or an implementation.\nI personally haven\u2019t enjoyed this development cycle so far. 2 of our most talented developers have been away. Boosting performance in the Muffin window manager hasn\u2019t been, and still isn\u2019t, straight forward. Feedback on the new website and logo brought a huge amount of incertitude. We\u2019ll still have a great release in the end and we\u2019ll still achieve plenty of improvements (we did already to a certain extent), but we need to be strong and remain confident and it\u2019s not easy when so much time is invested into something and then a month later it\u2019s not ready, or it causes other issues, or it might please some people but not others.\nFor a team to work, developers need to feel like heroes. They want the same things as users, they are users, they were \u201conly\u201d users to start with. At some stage they decide to get involved and they start investing time, efforts and emotions into improving our project. What they\u2019re looking for the most is support and happiness. They need feedback and information to understand bugs or feature requests and when they\u2019re done implementing something, they need to feel like heroes, they literally do, that\u2019s part of the reason they\u2019re here really.\nI can show them 500 people donated money last month, I can forward emails to the team where people tell me how much they love Linux Mint, I can tell them they\u2019re making a difference but there\u2019s nothing like interacting directly with a happy user, seeing first-hand somebody be delighted with what you worked on. How our community interacts with our developers is key, to their work, to their happiness and to their motivation.\nClem quite literally says he is not enjoying the Linux Mint development nowadays, which really breaks my heart. Look, developing a free operating system and largely depending on donations to keep the project going is obviously stressful -- I imagine it is hard to ever feel truly secure. With that said, once you lose your passion and joy, there is the possibility the project could suffer.\nHe also expresses surprise and sadness at all the negativity surrounding the upcoming website and logo redesigns.

Alas, cities are complex and organic and the success not always guaranteed. Then, with a certain pirate town, the series changed \u2013 away from describing a single component (like a park/temple etc. and failing to take some moving bit or another into account), instead focusing on a general theme and the means for the DM to evoke this theme.

At the very least, we thought knowing how much your peers get paid would interest you.\nOver two months we collected 738 responses from across the advice profession and from the length and breadth of the UK.\nResponses were given anonymously, so the data is based only on what people have reported to us. But we looked at the distribution of salaries across regions, job functions, and the size of firm you work for, along with what makes up remuneration. We have also used the data to look at other questions, such as how much experience counts in determining pay, and the differences between the genders.\nWe will also follow this initial report with region by region breakdowns of the data, so please take a look at our headline findings and watch this space.\nReceived wisdom has it that the average age of advisers is 53. While our survey included other job functions as well, there is a very good proportion of 40 to 49-year-olds and 30 to 39-year-olds working at advice firms as planners or paraplanners.\nOur adviser category has been split between those who chose to describe themselves as advisers and those who preferred the financial planner title.\nFinancial planning has historically been a distinct discipline to advice, and financial planning is not itself a regulated activity. Granted, the title has become a little diluted over the years but some Institute of Financial Planning purists will say planning cannot be done without cashflow modelling, for example or might want to see planners using its six step process, for example. So we thought it made sense to include it as a separate category.\nThis chart shows the total remuneration of all 738 participants in the survey. This is across all ages, job functions and genders. The mode, most common, salary brackets are \u00a330,000-\u00a339,000 and \u00a340,000 - \u00a349,000. The median salary bracket, the mid-point in our data, is \u00a370,000 \u2013 \u00a379,000.\nAs you can see, however, there is a long tail of high earners. We took remuneration over \u00a3400,000 out of this chart to make it easier to illustrate the trend.\nAs shown by the upwards line in the chart above, the data supported the common sense idea that pay would increase with years of experience. But although the data confirmed the trend, it also revealed the trend to be weak.\nSome with many years of experience still had lower levels of pay.

However, it\u2019s meet with disastrous results.\nThe numerous trailers released for \u2018The Warrior\u2019s Way\u2019 promise viewers a plot full of sword-fighting and special effects. However, the film, which follows the world\u2019s greatest swordsman, Yang (played by South Korean actor Jang Dong-gun), as he refuses his latest mission, doesn\u2019t live up to his high moral standards.\nYang doesn\u2019t want to kill the last member of his enemy clan, as she is only a baby. So he turns his back on his tribe, the Saddest Flutes, and his pre-determined mission. Exiled, Yang flees with the baby to a town full of circus outcasts, including the town drunk, Ron (portrayed by Geoffrey Rush), and 8-Ball (played by Tony Cox). Among them, Yang develops a bond with knife-thrower Lynne (portrayed by Kate Bosworth), whose family was killed before her eyes when she was a young girl.\n\u2018The Warrior\u2019s Way\u2019 falls short on its promise to deliver high quality stunts and an action-packed plot-line. While Rogue, the film\u2019s studio, is hoping to earn back its $40 million budget by emphasizing Yang\u2019s need to fight the Saddest Flutes for wanting to harm a baby, action fans will surely be disappointed. Lee spends a long portion of the movie setting up the relationship between Yang and Lynne while neglecting every other relationship and conflict. While it\u2019s important to see Lynne\u2019s admiration for Yang, Lee seemed to have lost focus on the film\u2019s most important issue-Yang wanting to stand up for what he believes is right.\nYang and Lynne\u2019s relationship was also too drawn out, because Dong-gun and Bosworth didn\u2019t have much of a romantic spark.

The complaint alleged Gillum may have violated state ethics laws in 2016 when he went on vacation in Costa Rica with lobbyist friends and traveled to New York City, where he went on outings with a lobbyist and FBI agents who were undercover as part of a public corruption investigation.\nRichard, the husband of former Florida Democratic Party chair Allison Tant, said Gillum had another interview Tuesday with an Ethics Commission investigator to discuss the trip to Costa Rica. The trip wasn\u2019t included in Jackson\u2019s original complaint, but he later amended the complaint to include it.\nAlso, Richard noted, once Ethics Commission staff has concluded all if its work, it must prepare a report on the investigation. The commission\u2019s advocate, an assistant attorney general who acts as the agency\u2019s prosecutor, must then prepare a recommendation on whether probable cause exists that a violation occurred. The recommendation then has to go before the nine-member commission, which meets in closed session to vote on whether to find probable cause.\nThe Ethics Commission only meets twice before the election: on Friday and Oct. 19. It's highly unlikely the Gillum matter could come up when the commission meets Friday because interviews were ongoing as of Tuesday. That leaves only one opening on the calendar, about two and a half weeks before the election.\nGillum has denied any wrongdoing. Both trips were on his personal time and didn't involve taxpayer dollars, he has said.\nJackson said he doesn\u2019t expect the ethics investigation to wrap by the election. But he said he feels strongly that it should.\nGillum and his wife vacationed in Costa Rica the first week of May 2016, to celebrate her birthday with close friends, including Sean Pittman, one of Gillum\u2019s oldest political advisers and a lawyer/lobbyist whose clients include the city of Tallahassee, and Adam Corey, a lobbyist and former close friend of the mayor whose business dealings are part of the FBI investigation.\nLater, from Aug. 9 to 12, 2016, Gillum was in New York City as part of his then-job with the People for the American Way Foundation.

For a varying set of reasons, the prevailing culture among the population is that of engaging healthcare on a reactive than proactive basis. This means that the detection and consequent management begins when the cancer is at an advanced stage, which often causes more suffering than relief to patients.\nThe awareness of early signs and symptoms for most cancerous cases is essential in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment at an early stage. A positive diagnosis for cancer need not be synonymous with a death sentence.\nSadly, majority of the deaths due to cancer in Kenya are because of ignorance about risk factors for the illness, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, preventative care and the absence of a steady continuum of care around oncology.\nThere are approximately 4,465 new breast cancer cases and 1,969 deaths annually; and approximately 4,800 new cervical cancer cases - and sadly over 50 per cent deaths annually.\nThe increasing cancer burden in Kenya has prompted the government to outline significant intended investments in cancer care and treatment in the country. According to the National Cancer Control Strategy 2017- 2022, basic cancer treatment facilities will be available in 47 counties.\nThis includes the proposed establishment of four comprehensive regional cancer treatment centres in Mombasa, Nakuru, Nyeri and Kisii for Sh8 billion in a five-year period.\nWith an understanding of the challenges in the country\u2019s oncology treatment system, a collaborative approach involving a diverse range of stakeholders in the public, private, non-profit and academia sectors is required and is the most effective approach to solving the challenges at hand.\nAdoption of relevant technologies in cancer care has also seen many countries make great strides in fighting the disease. Recently, Aga Khan University Hospital unveiled the first advanced early detection PET CT and Cyclotron in Sub-Saharan Africa. The technology provided by General Electric Healthcare gives an accurate indication of the progress of the disease at its earliest stages.\nThis means Kenyans will no longer need to travel abroad for accurate cancer diagnosis, a shift that should significantly lessen the burden of healthcare costs.\nFurther to the introduction of enhanced equipment for cancer diagnosis, there is need to invest in training and upskilling of medical practitioners such as radiographers as well as nursing staff. Beyond training on cancer management equipment, the importance of psychiatric care for patients cannot be overstated.\nThe need for new and disruptive models to address the growing oncology burden in Kenya calls for an integrated primary healthcare approach that includes the development of human resources for health and incorporating tailored task shifting to close clinical capacity gaps.\nIn conjunction with Aga Khan University Hospital, GE Healthcare hosted a PET CT and Cyclotron symposium to drive dialogue on latest innovations and interventions in early cancer diagnosis and detection.\nOther symposia will be held to continually bridge the knowledge gap in the field.\nFor early detection to work as an effective means of stopping cancer, there clearly needs to be a more integrated system in place to both encourage Kenyans to go for screenings while at the same time equipping the healthcare sector to carry out this lifesaving task."}

The latest video, dubbed The Devil\u2019s Lair, shows off a multi-part mission that feels an awful lot like something we\u2019ve all seen before from Bungie, but it looks like so much fun anyway.\nIf you replace the little drone flying around in this Destiny clip with a Halo Guilty Spark, you\u2019d be hard pressed to convince someone that the first part of this gameplay video wasn\u2019t from the viewpoint of the Master Chief. While there\u2019s clearly dozens of actual differences here, it\u2019s hard not to see a bit of recycling in the way you get ambushed by Fallen while waiting for the little robot to complete its job.\nOnce you\u2019ve cleared everyone out, using no small list of impressive armaments and enhancements, it\u2019s time to move on through the passage that has just opened to the next part of the objective. Just as you see it in the clearing, a dropship plants a bunch of enemies and spins up the battle cycle once more \u2013 another classic Halo mission layout.\nIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re complaining, Bungie. The game looks nothing short of impressive so far, but surely your level designers have more than these tricks up their sleeve for this upcoming epic.

The internationally recognised government proposed that Sanaa-bound aircraft be inspected in the southern port city of Aden.\nMore discussions on the airport are expected in the next round of peace talks in January.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Yemeni government appointed three military commanders as representatives to a UN-organised committee set to monitor the ceasefire in Hodeidah.\nMembers of the Houthi group and UN mission to Yemen will join the government representatives to oversee the withdrawal of armed forces from the port city, a military source told The National.\nBrig Sagheer Aziz, Brig Mohamed Eidha and Maj Gen Ahmed Al Kukabani attended the first meeting for the Redeployment Co-ordination Committee on Wednesday.

Entering Monday\u2019s game against the Detroit Pistons, Washington had won two straight with Portis and Parker coming off the bench.\nEach provides something the Wizards have lacked this season.\nPortis\u2018 hustle and effort were on display right away. In Friday\u2019s win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, the 6-foot-11 forward hit his first six shots en route to finishing with 30 points. The 23-year-old is versatile, and he keeps defenses off guard with his ability to pick-and-pop effectively.\nPortis also hauls in rebounds. Against Chicago on Saturday, he grabbed 12 boards in 29 minutes. For the season, Portis is averaging 7.5 rebounds per game \u2014 a welcome change for a team that ranks second-to-last in rebounding.\nParker, on the other hand, has demonstrated flashes of being more than just a gifted scorer. More than once against the Cavaliers and Bulls, the 6-foot-10 forward grabbed a rebound and pushed the pace to lead a fastbreak.\nIn two games, Parker racked up 15 assists \u2014 a startling number for a guy whose career average is just 2.1.\nThis season has been a trying experience for Parker, drafted second overall in 2014. After the Milwaukee Bucks opted to not re-sign him this summer, Parker joined the Bulls in order to revive his career. Yet, that backfired and he fell out of the rotation for an extended stretch.\nParker said he grew from riding the bench.\nThese next few months are essentially auditions for both Portis and Parker.\nPortis will be a restricted free agent after this season, meaning the Wizards will have to decide if they want to pay to keep him around.\nThe Wizards will also have a decision to make about Parker, who has a team option worth $20 million due this summer. Washington, looking to free up cap space, will almost certainly decline the option, but would they be willing to bring him back at a lower rate?\nUntil then, the Wizards are still set on trying to make the playoffs.\nBoth are eager to prove they can help toward that goal."}

He outlines major Michigan counties and maps out interstates and county seats. Participants get a state map to follow through its corridors.\nNorth of Midland, Grandma's Pumpkin Patch, 4277 North Eastman Road, honors a Midland landmark that made way for a new one - Dow Diamond. The maze takes 20 minutes to get through if you're determined and an hour if you want to explore, said Amanda Sandow, a member of the family that runs the farm.\nThe family decided to use a consultant after attempting to cut a maze on their own one year with a tractor. The theme this year commemorates the 47 Building, as chosen by The Dow Chemical Co., the maze's sponsor.\nThe Sandow family's maze is constructed by The MaiZE, a national corn maze company. The company says their methods are trade secrets (other farmers point to Global Positioning Systems), but admit on their website that they use computers and cut the maze when corn plants are fairly short.\nIt's up to the Sandows to keep the maze clean, though.

Over multiple millennia, the creative, physical art form has evolved from ancient wrestling tactics to the sword dancing of the Tang Dynasty in China to the development of Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the early 1900s.\nThe recent revitalized interest in the traditional combat system commonly known for its focus on discipline and self-defense is often attributed to mixed martial arts, a full-combat sport that combines various techniques to allow striking, kicking, and grappling.\nRyan Gruhn, head instructor at Central PA Mixed Martial Arts in State College, says the popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the mid-2000s has helped to bring martial arts to the forefront of disciplined fitness in Centre County.\nGruhn, who has been involved in martial arts in State College since 1992, says when he began as a local martial arts student classes were comprised of 15 or so people, at best. Now at CPMMA, school membership is around 800.\nBruce Lombard, the owner of LombardMMA, formerly known as Titan Fitness & Martial Arts, agrees, saying that the popularity of UFC drastically changed martial arts, eventually leading to an increased interest and its acceptance as a sport.\nThough this increased interest and awareness was beneficial, Lombard feels it was also somewhat discouraging because of the UFC\u2019s stray from some of the traditions he learned as a martial arts student in the 1980s and 1990s.\nFor both Lombard and Gruhn, these traditions play an important role in youth programs and their continued popularity.\nGruhn says at CPMMA, children are started off with fundamental curricula in order to understand all the important skills \u2013 such as manners and respect \u2013 they will need to be successful in life.

But now, businesses are hoping to game your attention by closely examining all these bodily responses.\nThe consulting firms that specialize in this research usually start by hooking focus-group participants up to research-grade neuroscience equipment as they browse a website or use an app. The devices offer highly specific biofeedback: Sensors analyze users\u2019 gaze, their facial expressions, their skin cells, and even their brain waves. Consultants then produce reports with tailored recommendations on how their client might redesign the user experience to turn their ad, app, or website into the perfect attention trap.\nCompanies already have enormous insight into what users do online. Web-analytics tools detail what pages users click on and which sites refer them. Companies such as Facebook track users all over the web, whether they\u2019re logged in or not.

Most companies opt just for eye-tracking, the least expensive option, often coupled with facial-expression analysis. GSR is useful for longer tasks, he said, while EEG, the most expensive measure, gives the most insight into why people react the way they do. As with any focus group, diversity is key to having a representative sample, Drummond notes, but there\u2019s no evidence that respondents\u2019 race or gender significantly affects their responses. Occupation, he observes, has more impact: People in high-pressure jobs, such as EMTs and doctors, tend to respond much more slowly to stimuli than the average person.\nThe medical equipment and high-tech interfaces may seem novel, but neuromarketing is a very old practice. As early as the 1950s, researchers used skin-attached sensors to measure physiological responses to marketing.

I know there's gonna be a bounty on my head for saying that, but if it can't be the Falcons then as long as its not the Saints then I'm happy,\" Bottoms said.\nThe video went viral, and now some Saints fans have a few things to tell her.\n\"Too bad, so sad.

The study looked to find out what large companies (which we define as more than $500M in revenue) are doing to accelerate sales.\nWe developed the study in partnership with the American Association of Inside Sales Professionals (AA-ISP), Top Sales World, and the Association of Professional Sales (APS). Readers can access the full executive summary here.\nWe gave attention to three things: Structure, Systems, and Process.\nFace to face or field sales is making up 71.2% of the sales force this year with remote sales or inside sales making up 28.8% of the sales force, but remote selling is increasing to 30.2% projected for next year. Large companies surveyed tell us they are aiming for an ideal inside sales mix averaged at 40.3%, so more growth is forecast.\n59.1% of inside account executives are attaining quota, and 65.0% of outside account executives which is 10% higher quota attainment than inside reps.\nBig businesses also capitalize more than other sized organizations on the benefits of the channel (selling through partners) with 49.4% engaging in this mode of selling.\nLarge companies also have the highest number of specialized sales roles (4.4 roles \u2014 which is 12% higher than average). Smaller organizations (<$50M) have the highest percentage of inside sales reps (47%) and leverage the outbound sales development or specialized prospecting role more than any other size company.\nWhat this says: while it\u2019s traditionally argued that outside and inside sales are at odds, our data suggests just the opposite \u2014that in great companies, these teams work together closely, structured to take optimal advantage of the things each provides best. The technology and automation that rules the inside sales world can streamline and accelerate the sales interactions that leverage the power of face-to-face communication.\nPerhaps the greatest surprises in the 2017 data are the growing evolution in process between inside sales (in which most selling is handled remotely) and outside sales (in which the reps primarily sell face-to-face). Using census data, we estimate that of the 5.7 million non-retail U.S. salespeople in 2017, 43.5% are inside sales professionals, and 56.5% are field sales reps. That balance is progressively shifting toward equilibrium, as we might anticipate.\nThe big surprise in this category is that outside sales reps are now spending nearly half of their time (45.4%) selling remotely, which is an 89.2% increase since 2013. Additionally, companies report the primary purpose of inside sales is to create a model that more fully partners with field sales (86.1%).\nWe mentioned last week that the average number of sales technology solutions companies utilize is rising and is expected to grow from 5.23 in 2016 to 5.80 in 2017 (a 10.9% increase from 2016), and to 6.15 by the end of 2018 (a 2-year increase of 18%).\nSpending on sales technology solutions has increased from $2546 per sales rep in 2014 to $4581 in 2017.\nTechnology is accelerating the pace of sales conversations.

The first part is known as the Establishment Clause. The Establishment Clause essentially says the government can't pass laws that will establish an official religion. This is commonly interpreted as the separation of church and state. The second one is the Free Exercise Clause, and it prevents the government from interfering with or controlling a person's practice of his or her religion. Religious freedom is an absolute right in this country, and it includes the right to practice any religion, or no religion at all, for all Americans.\nVELSHI: Suppose our government leaders or New York state leaders do step in, in some capacity, whether official or non-official, and assist in moving the mosque elsewhere. Then what? What kind of precedent does that set? Timothy McVeigh was raised Catholic. Do we then entertain petitions of moving Catholic churches away from the Oklahoma bombing site? I'm sure you're thinking it sounds ridiculous, but ask yourself, is it ridiculous because Catholicism is familiar to you, or, is your argument that what he did was different, or is your argument that Timothy McVeigh didn't kill in the name in Allah?\nActually, the comparison is ridiculous, because, as his own network acknowledged the morning after McVeigh's execution, that the murderer was \"baptized in the Catholic Church as a boy, but had stopped practicing and recently described himself as agnostic.\" Moreover, as the terrorist himself admitted, he bombed the Oklahoma City federal building as a \"retaliatory strike; a counter attack, for the cumulative raids (and subsequent violence and damage) that federal agents had participated in over the preceding years (including, but not limited to, Waco).\" McVeigh did not carry out the attack in the name of the Christian God or in the name of the Catholic Church. On the other hand, Al Qaeda issued a fatwa in 1998, which declared that killing \"Americans and their allies...is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it...in accordance with the words of Almighty God.\"\nVelshi concluded his commentary by stating that it didn't matter whether Americans were for or against the planned mosque: \"If you're an American citizen and choose to remain in this country, then whether you are against or you are for the Islamic center and mosque should be irrelevant. I say 'should be,' in an ideal world, because, as an American citizen- well, we should all be for the Constitution that so many have fought, lived, and died for, including the 2,976 souls who died on September 11th at Ground Zero, at the Pentagon, and in a field in western Pennsylvania.\"\nThe anchor wasn't the first CNN personality to bring in the Catholic Church into the mosque controversy.

There have been many variants of the original in literature, television, stage and films, ever since. The last to hit the theatre was director Christopher Gan's version which was released in 2014.\nThis one from the Disney stable, is a remake of its 1991 released, animated film of the same name. So while the film closely tracks the earlier version's plot, story beats and revamps all the old songs, there is enough of newness in this film that arouses curiosity to cine-goers. And rightly so.\nDirector Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast is an immaculately constructed live action musical that is almost overwhelmingly lavish, beautifully staged and performed. It is a very impressive production and pays a loving tribute to its classic source material.\nIn this edition, the film begins with how a proud, handsome Prince (Dan Stevens) is cursed and turned into a beast by a passing enchantress for rejecting her gift of a rose. So, dejected and depressed, with a rose-petalled deadline to become human again, the Prince leads a very lonely life in his castle that is long forgotten by his people.\nMeanwhile, Belle (Emma Watson), a genial and independent girl is considered a freakish outsider in her provincial French village because of her interest in books and her indifference to the local hunk, Gaston (Luke Evans) who tries his best to woo her.\nIt is when Belle's father Maurice (Kevin Kline), during a business trip stumbles upon the castle and is held captive by the Beast that Belle chances on meeting the Beast. How she falls in love with the Beast forms the crux of the tale.\nThough this is an adaptation from the various earlier editions, the script writers Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos add a few touches of their own. Prominent among the few are the backstory for the death of Belle's mother and revealing the gay traits in LeFou (Josh Gad), Gaston's buddy.\nOn the performance front, Emma Watson as Belle is ravishing, but a bit bland. Luke Evans is suitably boisterous as Gaston. Dan Stevens convincingly emotes through his eyes. Kevin Kline with some extremely powerful on screen moments, shines as Belle's lovable father.\nTechnically, the film is astutely crafted. The animation of the castle's enchanted staff which include Lumiere (Ewan McGregor), Cogsworth (Ian Mckellen), Mrs Potts (Emma Thompson) along with the 3D effects is of fine quality.\nProduction designer Sarah Greenwood along with costume designer Jacqueline Durran display a colourful canvas that is gorgeous and appealing.\nThere are a few new songs composed for the film, among them are a flashback song Aria sung by Audra McDonald and the song having the lyrics, Days in the Sun sung by the enchanted objects.\nOverall, the film is enchanting but not remarkably memorable."}

The New York Daily News reported the arrest on Wednesday was connected to the case.

They are, by rule, forbidden from attacking at the net, where the business end of most plays is transacted. And while occasionally heralded for making a spectacular dig, the libero's pass is typically forgotten as quickly as it is subsequently distributed by the setter, then pounded by a high-flying teammate for a kill.\nBut when it comes right down to it, the best liberos are basically the ultimate ball hogs. And any coach interested in winning consistently is eager to offer their whole-hearted endorsement.\nUC Irvine senior Kristen Winkler operates under this dichotomy, seldom getting much of the credit, despite accepting the majority of the workload in the back row.\n\"I expect every ball to come to me and I expect every ball to be my ball,\" said Winkler, who became the Anteaters' career digs leader on Sept. 7 and is now closing in on the Big West Conference career mark. \"I don't let people take balls in front of me. You just kind of have that mindset that you're the best defender and that you should be getting every ball and making a play on every single ball. Sometimes you have to push people out of your way.\"\nBut while brimming with extreme confidence, the 5-foot-10 Winkler, who played outside hitter most of her prep career at St. Francis High in Mountain View, Calif., is as humble as she is determined.\n\"Honestly, if I get an amazing dig and we don't get a point out of it, I totally forget it,\" said Winkler who has 271 digs in 15 matches this season heading into UCI's Big West road clash at No. 8-ranked Hawaii on Thursday. \"I'd rather get a dig and we get a point. That's a lot more memorable to me.\"\nWinkler, a four-year starter, has secured her unforgettable status in UCI annals.

Yet all these prophecies collide with a basic problem: The book, as it currently exists, is hard to improve upon. Cheap, highly portable and free of maddening formatting problems, the printed book has met most readers' needs pretty well. Sure, in recent years, technology has transformed the distribution of texts -- you can order any book online or tote around dozens of e-books in a lightweight reader -- but the vast majority of these books remain essentially the same: linear strings of words, with the occasional image.\nStill, the dream of interactive books lives on, despite a series of digital disappointments ranging from hypertext fiction to CD-ROMs to experimental Web novels to current ventures in social reading. Previously, I wrote about the inherent tensions between interactivity and narrative in enhanced fiction e-books. Indeed, there's little evidence that images, videos, sound effects or clickable doohickeys add anything of value in the eyes of most readers of prose fiction. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, the enhanced e-book of Stephen King's novel \"11/22/63\" contained a 13-minute film by King himself, yet only 45,000 readers were willing to shell out the extra $2 to get it, compared to 300,000 who bought the unadorned e-book ($14.99) or the 1 million purchasers of the print edition ($35). King's publisher expressed doubts that enhanced e-books were worth the extra trouble and expense.\nNonfiction, however, is another matter. While some developers labor in vain to improve upon the immersive storytelling of novelists like King, others are taking factual material that might have once been published between hard covers and turning it into strange and wondrous new creations. The most successfully enhanced e-book is the one you may not even recognize as a book.\nThe first among these were introductory science apps like \"The Elements\" (used to showcase the iPad's potential when the device was first released) and astronomy apps like \"Solar System for iPad\" and \"Solar Walk.\" A recent release, \"Back in Time,\" lets the user turn the hands of a cosmic clock and scroll through a series of images to explore a timeline of the history of the universe. All of these books -- for that's the category they're given in Apple's App Store -- use touch-responsive 3-D animation and other model-like features to help the reader visualize concepts well outside their everyday experience: vast distances in time or space, the motion of the planets and the relationship between molecular structure and palpable objects. Technically, I know that the earth's tilted axis as it orbits the sun determines the changing seasons, but \"Solar Walk\" allows me to see it happen.\nThe popularity of science apps like \"The Elements\" no doubt encouraged Apple to move aggressively into digital textbook publishing with its recent upgrade to iBooks. The iBookstore, with its too-broad categories and abysmal metadata, has failed to emerge as a contender among retailers of trade e-books. Apple now seems to be concentrating its energies on the education market.

Barring some unforeseen problems with the petitions this issue will be before North Dakota voters in the fall.\nThis humble observer hopes the state's voters cast their ballots for legal marijuana.\nFor one thing, legalizing recreational marijuana would likely render the efforts to implement the absurd medicinal marijuana statute approved by voters in 2016 moot.\nThat law, so poorly written by organizers of the measure that it had to be modified by lawmakers in their 2017 session so it was workable, is a testament to why legislating at the ballot box is a generally terrible idea. State officials are still working on unraveling the tangle bureaucracy that measure foisted on us. Once it's in effect, it's unlikely to help marijuana patients much. The product sold through that process will likely be so expensive, and so arduous to obtain, the black market will likely continue as the preferred option for many.\nFor another, I'm not at all certain what we're accomplishing with continued marijuana prohibition.\nOpposition to this ballot measure is already forming in legal circles, particularly among law enforcement officials, and I suspect they're going to make a public safety argument against it.\nThey'll talk about people driving stoned and the appeal of legal marijuana to criminal elements.\nYet what's appealing to criminals is law making a hugely popular product like marijuana illegal. Prohibition creates a lucrative market for criminals to serve.\nWhat will be unmentioned by those in the law enforcement community who oppose this measure is just how lucrative marijuana prohibition is for them.\nConsider that arrests for marijuana charges increased 119 percent from 2009 to 2016 according to data from the attorney general's office. More than 50 percent of all drug crime in North Dakota during that time was related to marijuana.\nEach of those arrests generates a lot of revenue for people in the law enforcement community. More arrests means more justification for bigger budgets, bigger police forces, and bigger equipment purchases. Then there's the revenues the government collects from the fines and asset forfeitures, not to mention the money paid to the rehabilitation industry by marijuana offenders ordered to seek treatment in sentencing.\nBut is any of that making our communities safer?\nHere's a sobering truth: If you want marijuana in North Dakota you can get marijuana. Just about every community in the state likely has a dealer who can sell you some pot. It's a product more ubiquitous than Starbucks or McDonald's.\nThere's no question that marijuana has some negative social side effects. But then, so does alcohol. We've decided that we'd rather deal with the problems legal alcohol creates than the much larger problems that come with alcohol prohibition.\nIt's time to make that same decision about marijuana."}

And you know that there are outlets that, even aside from any ideological motive, just aren\u2019t that good at getting facts right.\nBut creating a systematic way to make those distinctions \u2014 not to mention the many distinctions that lie within each phylum and genus \u2014 is a complicated task that leaves you open to critiques both honest and otherwise. \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d won\u2019t cut it. How, exactly, is Fox News different from MSNBC? What\u2019s the difference between The Telegraph and the Daily Mail, The New Republic and Occupy Democrats? Where do you draw the line between trustworthy and worth avoiding?\nThere are any number of efforts to make these sorts of distinctions, many of which we\u2019ve written about before. Some create a rules-based protocol publishers can choose to accept in order to receive a stamp of approval; others ask a team of journalists to systematically separate the wheat from the fake-news chaff. But their results can vary, and no matter what they say, it\u2019ll take a technology giant \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple \u2014 adopting one of them for these ratings to have any sort of mass impact.\nWe are also not starting yet another trust/quality/credibility project to compete with the many good efforts that already exist. To the contrary, we saw the need to aggregate the signals from all those efforts, making them more impactful by putting all this data in a form that will make it easier for technology and ad companies to ingest and use it. The more these signals are used by platforms and advertisers, the more benefit that can come to news organizations (through audience and revenue), and the more news organizations are motivated to ascribe to standards of quality being formulated by such efforts as the Trust Project and another from Reporters Without Borders. That is the virtuous circle we hope to help enable.\nThink of it as a Nate Silver-esque poll-of-polls. A meta-analysis rather than a single study.\nWhen it comes to such content, in our opinion, neutrality is no longer an option and every major player in these ecosystems is forced to make judgments about sources, because some small but impactful number of those sources is attempting to manipulate technology and ad companies and ultimately the public conversation.\nJust as thousands are being hired to grapple with the low end of the quality spectrum, the population of journalists continues to shrink. More resources and more support must be given to quality news. That is why, in our first phase, we are directing more of our attention to the higher end of the spectrum.\nAmong the sorts of signals they aim to aggregate: outside evaluations by experts; publisher-"}

It's your choice, of course, to prefer old USB type A ports over Apple's use of Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, or to prefer 1990's-style three button mice over Apple's Force Touch trackpads with multi-touch gesture support and position-sensitive (left-right) \"button\" support.

Beyond the shiny trains that ferry suburban commuters to downtown and Tech Center jobs, and sports fans to games, the core city itself still struggles with transit gaps.\nCommuters get on a bus along Colfax Ave. to head downtown, July 28, 2016. The RTD 15 and the 15L buses on Colfax run less than 10 minutes between buses.\nLargely rooted in a bus network that is spread too thin, those shortcomings make travel between some of Denver\u2019s most urban neighborhoods, job centers, recreation spots and nightlife districts cumbersome or downright unmanageable. Closer to the city limits, especially in east Denver neighborhoods that are miles from new and upcoming rail lines, transit access flickers.\nTransit advocates point to Cherry Creek, home to high-paying desk jobs and even more lower-paying restaurant, hotel and retail jobs, as a big missed opportunity for a transit hub. Instead, it\u2019s an area where several bus routes simply pass through. Many of those employees live in northeast Denver, notes Stuart Anderson of the nonprofit group Transportation Solutions.\nConnections between Cherry Creek and downtown\u2019s Union Station, where most of the rail lines go, similarly frustrate potential riders, despite years of pushing from Cherry Creek business leaders for a direct downtown shuttle.\nSeveral riders who contacted The Denver Post for this story also cited myriad transit frustrations extending to most parts of the city: the need for more frequent service; lower fares; more routes designed on a grid instead of being geared to feed into downtown or rail lines; and circulator buses connecting common destinations in neighborhoods.\nBut public transportation advocates and riders see promise in recent moves by Denver city officials to take the reins \u2014 or at least share the wheel with the Regional Transportation District \u2014 when it comes to the city\u2019s transit destiny, even if the question of how to pay for more expansions remains unanswered.\nThis summer, city officials kicked off a community effort to create the first citywide transit plan, which officials say will draw on traditional and innovative ideas. That follows on groundwork Denver has laid for its first project: the potential transformation of Colfax Avenue by 2022 into a bus rapid transit corridor, with more frequent and faster streetcarlike service in dedicated lanes during rush hour and fewer set stops.\nTechnological advances also give hope to some that Denver can improve transit access within the city. In some U.S. cities, especially those with cash-strapped transit agencies, partnerships with private companies are testing out dynamic routing. That technology relies on computer algorithms to build customized routes for smaller buses or vans based on where passengers need to go.\nSuch progress has been a long time coming, both for those who depend on transit to get around the city and a potential legion of would-be riders who want to ditch their cars more often. The latter group includes the transit-friendly millennials and some empty-nesters who have been flocking to the growing city, drawn by the appeal of an urban lifestyle.\nAfter Kathryn Cuddihee, 28, moved to Denver three years ago with her husband, she gave transit a go to get to her social work job in Centennial.

It's a concept known as the wage gap, and it's without a doubt a huge point of contention among female workers in a wide range of industries.\nBut while the wage gap has been prevalent for a long time among salaried workers, new data suggests that it extends to the world of self-employment as well. Among freelance men and women, males outearn females by an average of 28%, according to a study by FreshBooks, a Toronto-based accounting and invoicing company.\nNow, on the one hand, to see such a substantial gap between freelance men and women is surprising, especially since self-employed workers have the option to set their own rates. But doing so is easier said than done. In fact, 20% of self-employed females feel they have no choice but to charge less than their male equivalents to attract and retain clients, while 34% have experienced gender discrimination in the course of being self-employed.\nWhen we look at some specific numbers within the self-employment space, the problem becomes all the more clear. Among self-employed men and women with businesses serving at least 100 clients, the median revenue among females in information technology is $70,908. Median revenue for men who run IT businesses, however, is $139,969. The gap widens further among professionals in the marketing and communications field, with women-led businesses bringing in a median revenue of $163,875, versus $248,140 for those run by men.\nOf course, it's easy to blame this glaring disparity on public attitudes toward males versus females. And this isn't to say that a bias doesn't exist. However, if women really want to see better income equality in the freelance world, they'll need to change their own mind-set as well.\nIf you're tired of being shortchanged as a self-employed female, you'll need to take steps to make things fair. To start, do some research to see what the going rates are in your industry, and build up your business so that you're able to charge them. Clients will sometimes make every excuse in the book to pay you the lowest rate possible (regardless of whether you're male or female), so don't give them a reason to think their lowball offers will fly. Instead, market yourself, increase your client base, improve your offerings, and present a sound case for commanding a higher rate than what you've previously been charging.\nAlong these lines, don't be afraid to turn down a client who won't pay you what you're worth. Unless there's another compelling reason to take on that work (say, it's a big name in your industry that would give you better credibility as you're first building your business), save your precious hours for the clients who are willing to pay you fairly.\nAnother thing? Make a point of showcasing your best work, whether via an online business portfolio or an extensive list of published reviews from satisfied clients. The people who hire you will want assurance that they're getting their money's worth, so if you go in prepared, you're more likely to convey that point.\nFinally, have confidence in yourself.

Entertainers like Limbaugh make a living telling us that our senses and biases are real, while the dissonant evidence produced by scientific and empirical methods are fake. In a world rocked by the accelerating pace of scientific, technological and cultural change, this message is a soothing opiate. Data is challenging our understanding of the world in ways that leave many of us awash in mental strain. Limbaugh and his peers offer no cure, but they numb the discomfort.\nHuman beings are not wired for data. Informed only by experience and observation, the Earth appears to be flat. Only through more complex scientific techniques do we discover the reality that we live on a round planet. When first confronted that reality can be jarring, as it flies in the face of commonsense. With some education and exposure, we can come to recognize the evidence for a round planet and make peace with the notion. Every new piece of empirical or scientific data that contradicts our understanding of the world feeds an uncomfortable sense of cognitive dissonance.\nFigures like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter earn a fat living by soothing that dissonance. They tell their listeners that their biases are reality. They tell their listeners that science is a scam. Entertainers in that genre have grown so influential that they\u2019ve swallowed America\u2019s second political party, ultimately handing the White House to a reality TV star.

That gave the lineup a speedier look at the top, and the Red Sox it used to rattle Colorado starter Josh Fogg who, like so many opposing pitchers in the postseason, didn't get a whiff of the fifth inning.\nEllsbury and Pedroia combined for five hits in their first five at-bats, including three infield singles.

Once again, the Red Sox were on their way to wearing out another starting pitcher.\nFogg had already tossed 39 pitches when Ellsbury led off the third inning.

Ear and sinus infections are treated appropriately with antibiotics and over-the-counter medications. Those medications vary as needed per symptoms, but primarily target mucous and congestion, relief of pain and fever.\nUPMC Pinnacle's Heritage Pediatrics in Camp Hill reports that even though it is March and spring is around the corner, they are still seeing many cases of influenza and strep throat.\nHowever, as the trees are starting to bud, spring allergies started for many of their patients the past week. Allergic rhinitis causes runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, and sometimes an itchy or scratchy throat from the post nasal drainage. Allergies should never cause a fever. Although some people feel a bit tired from their allergy symptoms, they should still be able to go to school and be active throughout the day.\n\"If your child appears ill, feverish and complaining of a sore throat, decreased eating, and wet cough, this is not likely allergies and you should take them to their medical provider to see if it could be the flu or strep throat or some other infection,\" Dr. Kathleen Zimmerman said.\nMost allergic rhinitis responds well to over the counter antihistamines. Ask your doctor or medical provider which antihistamine would be best for your child.\nPenn Medicine Lancaster General Health Physicians Roseville Pediatrics continued to see a lot of flu this week, diagnosing 41 cases. All of those tested were the Influenza A strain. The current strains include one that is not covered by this year's flu vaccine, though vaccinated kids do typically have a lessened course of the flu.\nFevers increased this week and the majority were due to viral illnesses and ear infections.\nStrep throats were at about 45 percent of the sore throats seen. With the persistent surge in viral illnesses, they saw a lot of secondary ear infections and sinusitis.\n\"Sinusitis, sometimes called a 'sinus infection,' refers to a bacterial infection within the sinuses, which are spaces within the bones of the face that are lined with mucous-producing skin cells.\nWhen a person gets a cold, the viral process causes an increase in mucous, which leads to congestion and runny nose. Typically, the immune system kills off the virus in three to five days, after which we feel better, and the congestion lessens and drains over the following few days.\nThe difference between a 'cold' and a true sinus infection is the involvement of bacteria. If the mucous in the nasal passages does not drain efficiently, or if the viral infection is not killed off by the immune system quickly, this creates a prime breeding ground for bacteria. This is where a cold with congestion changes into a bacterial sinus infection.\nThis process, however, is not particularly fast-a true sinus infection requires at least 10 days of persistent nasal congestion to allow enough time for the bacterial colonies to multiply. While a cold will cause nasal and sinus pressure, a true sinus infection cannot be diagnosed until at least 10 days of congestion.\nWhen to take your child to their doctor for concern of sinusitis: persistent congestion at least 10"}

Reyes - Isn\u2019t it ironic that the chief architect of the Right of Reply Bill (RORB) should be opposition senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr.?\nBut isn\u2019t it more ironic that it was Malaca\u00f1ang that spurned the passage of the bill?\nFrankly, we cannot recall any instance in which media had \u201cvictimized\u201d Pimentel by depriving him the \u201cright\u201d to reply.\nIn fact, we cannot recall any instance where Pimentel was vilified in media. What we remember is that, for the most part, it was Pimentel who has used media to attack his political nemeses, the Palace in particular.\nAnd for the most part, those whom he accused were the ones who never got to reply.\nNot only ironic, but puzzling. It\u2019s a fact that that when Pimentel speaks, it almost always gets media mileage, especially when it is an attack on the President or the First Gentleman.\nSo, why is Pimentel moving heaven and earth to have a bill which tends to portray media reporting as innately biased, unfair and imbalanced into law?\nIt cannot be helped but for the question to be asked whether or not Pimentel is doing this for somebody else or for some interests unknown to all of us. He could not be doing this for his own protection since he has always been a media darling.\nFor the most part, our legislators have always been on the offense-side as far as media presence is concerned.\nOne of the rare instances where a lawmaker came under fire in media was that unfortunate episode in the life of former Senate President Manny Villar who was accused by fellow senators of double-insertion into the national budget which would have benefited his vast property holdings south of Manila.\nYet, we do not recall media depriving Villar of the chance to reply to accusations or to mount his own counter-offensive.\nSo, who needs a right to reply backed by threats of stiff sanctions against media?\nIf at all, it is the President who would have demanded for such right. In fairness to the chief executive, she had been mostly at the receiving end of brickbats and media criticism. Still, the President has opted to spurn the RORB.\nThe fact is that the ability to reply in media or the lack of it may have much to do with the approval ratings of the Palace. The ratings may have nothing to do with performance. It has more to do with the inability to engage her political nemeses in sustained and protracted media wars.\nAt the end of the day, Senator Pimentel and company may not be standing on solid ground in the effort to portray media as being unfair and biased against them. They must admit that when they speak, they land in print and broadcast media.\nSenator Pimentel made a name in national politics because of media.

The company had been founded in 1939, but had scarcely grown in 15 albeit difficult years. \"What is publishing?\" Per would ask - and would then supply the answer: \"Visiting Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield ... twice a year.\" This is what he did; he visited their medical schools for 20 years.\nPer was born in Slagelse, in Zealand, Denmark, and brought up in Copenhagen by parents from a long line of academic and professional high achievers. His father was director general of the Danish Army Medical Corps, and, at his suggestion, Per left school just after his 17th birthday to become an apprenticed bookseller. He continued his training in Switzerland, before moving to Britain in 1952 to work at George's bookshop, in Bristol (where he met his wife Patricia).\nAt his second attempt, Per got the job of sales manager at BSP that year, and took over as managing director the next. There was plenty of advice for someone with no real experience of publishing and annual sales of \u00a327,000. He would often quote Sir Basil Blackwell: \"If I'm in doubt about a book, I've said to myself would the world be poorer without this book, or would I be poorer with it.\" Or his colleague Henry Schollick, who ran Basil Blackwell Publishers, and had said: \"If you want a book, don't wait for it to come, ask someone to write it.\"\nPer took this advice and upset his competitors (a couple of whom complained to Sir Basil about this foreign upstart) by travelling the British university circuit commissioning titles. His colleague Keith Bowker (who later ran the journals division) made the sales calls. Over 20 years, Per built up a medical list of international status. When pressed on why he did not hire editors to sign up more books, he replied that there were only 50 good medical books to be published each year.\nHe knew what booksellers could sell, and was not too proud to consult them. His love of the book trade - and a good, well-published book - meant that the BSP culture was dominated by books rather than journals. Although Per created some fine journals, such as the British Journal of Haematology, launched in 1955, he could not relate to the explosion of new journal titles, largely in the physical sciences, from his rival Robert Maxwell at Pergamon.\nHe did, however, build a company with the efficiency, spirit, subject knowledge and low cost-base to move quickly into Pergamon territory, as the emphasis in research funding switched to life sciences and medicine. Many of the obvious titles had been started by societies, which meant they offered the best opportunities. Although BSP launched new journals, it also became a specialist in partnering with societies to grow existing journals, and developed the skills which later made Blackwell Publishing the world's leading publisher for societies.\nWhen Per retired in 1990 as BSP chairman (he had quit as managing director in 1987) annual sales had reached \u00a327m and the company had become truly international, with six overseas offices. He had published around 1,500 books and was able to claim, \"In all my years, I never made a budget.\"\nOutside BSP, Per worked closely with Richard Blackwell on the bookselling side, chairing Blackwell North America, three of the major UK Blackwell shops (H"}

David Fravor and Lt. Cmdr. Jim Slaight, who were in training over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at the time. They got a strange call from a radio operator. The military had been tracking strange aircraft in the region for about two weeks, the operator said. Sometimes, these flying objects made sudden maneuvers, dove tens of thousands of feet or even hovered, according to the reports.\nFraser descended, the object ascended to meet him and then it veered suddenly. \"It accelerated like nothing I've ever seen, he said an interview with the Times, adding that he was \"pretty weirded out.\" A few minutes later, the object disappeared, he said.\nFravor returned to his carrier ship, where people mocked him for what he saw, he told the Times. His superiors didn't look into the matter, and Fravor moved on to other things in his career, such as serving in the Persian Gulf as air support during the Iraq war.\nFravor's account includes a video \u2014 one of several recorded as a part of the program. The video shows a small object skirting from side to side and circling in view of the camera.

If Al Gore is taken at his word, his presidency will amass trillions of dollars in extra revenue and devote most of it to paying down the federal debt. That would represent a very conservative agenda\u2013and an ideological sea change for the Democrats\u2013but Gore and his economic advisers have persuaded themselves that the New Economy is real and changes everything. A conservative fiscal policy, they assert, is now the progressive thing to do. Skeptics, myself included, would say more darkly: Goodbye Keynes, hello Coolidge.\nSome Gore supporters, including some liberals, wave off any criticism of Gore\u2019s strategy because they essentially don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real. They figure that either the $3.4 trillion in federal operating surpluses projected for the next decade will never materialize or the Vice President\u2019s devotion to debt reduction is simply clever positioning for the campaign. The stratagem was originated by Bill Clinton in early 1999 to stymie Republican demands for huge tax cuts, and Gore uses the issue in the same way. It also gives him protection against the \u201cliberal big spender\u201d label. The political benefits are real enough, but the evidence suggests that Gore is also a true believer. His advisers insist we have entered a new era, in which fueling financial markets with abundant investment capital takes precedence over major government spending programs. If the insights of John Maynard Keynes are still relevant to fiscal policy, Gore\u2019s pay-down-the-debt program could do great damage to economic prosperity.\nFor better or worse, Gore is the inheritor. As a candidate, he is still operating with both Clinton\u2019s people and Clinton\u2019s old strategy. The economic advisers are all veterans of Clinton\u2019s New Democrat regime, led by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling at the White House, plus former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who\u2019s now at Citigroup; former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder at the Brookings Institution; and former Council of Economic Advisers chair Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, who is back at the University of California, Berkeley, as dean of the business school. One ought to add the name of Alan Greenspan, the Republican Chairman of the Federal Reserve, because Gore, like Clinton, is expected to rely on his very conservative counsel and never\u2013ever\u2013challenge the Fed\u2019s management of the economy.\nThe first problem is that economic circumstances have changed dramatically since Clinton first deployed the debt-liquidation strategy, but Gore\u2019s thinking has not. The nineties are over and the deficits are gone. Fiscal balance has been achieved, even overachieved. But Gore intends to keep on fighting the last war, establishing Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, and he has a new theory to justify his commitment. Eighteen months ago, the federal budget was still in deficit but heading toward major surpluses, estimated at nearly $1 trillion during the next decade. Now the projections are for $3.4 trillion in surpluses (not including $2.4 trillion in Social Security surpluses), a perennial stream of excess revenue that every year would take a bigger bite out of the private economy than the government needs.

Gary Peters' bill would allow as many as 80,000 self-driving cars exempt from safety standards to be sold in three years' time.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 On a unanimous voice vote, a Senate committee approved legislation today that authorizes self-driving car makers to sell as many as 80,000 vehicles a year within three years that would be exempt from current safety standards as manufacturers develop technology for autonomous vehicles.\nThe overall legislation, proposed by Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., and U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., moved forward with the vote in committee and ultimately could set timelines for federal regulators to collect data and come up with standards for self-driving cars within the next few years.\n\u201cThe most important part of this legislation is it allows for innovation,\u201d said Peters, who said regulations must allow room for automakers and technology companies to develop the artificial intelligence and components needed to process huge amounts of data necessary to make autonomous cars function.\n\u201cThis is cutting-edge technology that is advancing extremely fast,\u201d added Peters. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen a lot sooner than people realize. This is not decades \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of a few years.\u201d He said Congress needs to act quickly so that American manufacturers know what is \u2014 and is not \u2014 expected of them as they try to win what has become a global competition while at the same time balancing safety concerns.\nU.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who is a cosponsor of the bill, said it could go a long way to help Michigan, which she said \"has the workforce, the partnerships and innovative spirit to be the national and global leader in autonomous and connected vehicles.\"\nIt's not just Detroit automakers who are working on autonomous vehicles, however, with international car makers and technology companies like Google also deeply invested into the effort.\nThe legislation, like its companion measure passed in the U.S. House, would prohibit states from passing safety or design standards for autonomous vehicles and their components, leaving that to the federal government; require automakers to submit safety reports regarding testing and crash-worthiness to the U.S. Transportation Department, and increase cybersecurity efforts to protect data.\nSelf-driving cars, which some automakers say could be on American highways in the next three or four years, are being widely touted as the wave of the future, transforming commuting and driving habits, reducing congestion and, perhaps most important, cutting the some 35,000 auto-related deaths each year.\nMost of those deaths are believed to be due to driver error.\nSome consumer groups have argued that the legislation being considered in Congress gives carmakers too much leeway and takes away too much control from the states to set their own safety standards, but proponents say the trade-off is necessary.\nThe provision allowing 80,000 vehicles to be exempted from current safety standards \u2014 which was proposed by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \u2014 is a reduction from the 100,000 vehicles that would have been exempted under the original version of the bill and that already passed the U.S. House, setting up a potential conflict to be resolved.\nThe measure also reduced the number of exempted cars seen in the initial bill and in the House bill in the first year after enactment from 50,000 to 15,000 and in the second year from 75,000 to 40,0"}

What the sneaker lacks in Boost technology, it makes up for in aesthetic appeal. The \"Away\" colorway features a red upper on top of a white speckled midsole. The real star of the shoe though is the gum outsole which gives the \"Away\" colorway a bit of a different feel from other J Wall 1 releases.\nWhen it came to clutch time, there was no one more lights out than Michael Jordan. So it makes sense that his signature silhouette would get a \"Blackout\" colorway. The shoe features an all black upper on top of a black midsole with the same elephant print as the \"Legend Blue\" version of the XX9.\nThe Nike Chuckposite \"Cave Purple\" looks more like something that Charles Barkley&apos;s Monstar equivalent would wear than the Round Mound of Rebound himself.

Using personal descriptions written for Internet dating profiles, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Cornell University have identified reliable clues as to whether the author was being deceptive.\nThe researchers compared the actual height, weight and age of 78 online daters to their profile information and photos on four matchmaking websites. A linguistic analysis of the group's written self-descriptions revealed patterns in the liars' writing.\nThe more deceptive a dater's profile, the less likely they were to use the first-person pronoun \"I.\" Liars do this because they want to distance themselves from their deceptive statements.\nThe liars often used negation, a flip of the language that would restate \"happy\" as \"not sad\" or \"exciting\" as \"not boring.\"\nLiars tended to write shorter self-descriptions in their profiles \u2014 a hedge against weaving a more tangled web of deception. The less they write, the fewer untrue things they have to remember and explain later.\nDaters who had lied about their age, height or weight or had included a photo the researchers found to be inaccurate, were likely to avoid discussing their appearance in their written descriptions, choosing instead to talk about work or life achievements.\nUsing indicators like those above allowed the researchers to correctly identify liars 65% of the time \u2013 a significantly higher percentage than what the typical person is capable of, which according to previous studies is usually well below 50%.\nWhat research like this is leading to are programs that analyze verbiage online in a variety of scenarios to determine who is lying (or, in the case of dating sites, who is lying the most, since about 80% of participants lie to some degree).\nBy the way, if you're wondering what people lied about the most, it was their weight.

He and Lynch were the sole writers on the new episodes, collaborating via Skype from their respective houses.\nJust how the two divide the work remains almost as much of a mystery as figuring out who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch, who directed all of the new episodes, hasn\u2019t been much help.\nAlan Sepinwall, author of \u201cThe Revolution Was Televised: The Cops, Crooks, Slingers and Slayers Who Changed TV Drama Forever,\u201d has a more illuminating answer.

After the release last week of a trio of studies examining the economic effects of those proposals, county Supervisors Sheila Kuehl and Hilda Solis plan to ask their colleagues to commission a study of similar wage increases in the county.\nThe analysis would look at raising the base wage for all businesses in county unincorporated areas, where about 1 million people live, as well as for county employees and contractors.\nSome analysts have said that the city's proposed increase would lead to business flight unless surrounding communities approve similar increases. Several other neighboring cities, including West Hollywood and Santa Monica, are considering following Los Angeles' lead.\nKuehl's proposal, which will probably be considered by her colleagues next week, would commission the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. to analyze the city's minimum wage studies and examine how the findings might apply to the county.\nKuehl said she thinks the county needs to increase pay for low-wage workers, but that more study is needed to determine the right amount.\n\"If you simply grab a number and enact something, you could hurt the city, and that hurts the workers, or you could hurt the county, and that hurts the workers,\" she said. \"The number has to work for the county, period. But if we were part of the movement to raise the minimum wage, that covers almost half the people who live in the county.... It could be a real signal to the rest of the state that we are serious in this county about the benefits of raising the minimum wage.\"\nSupervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas said he would also support the proposal. Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich declined to comment Monday and Don Knabe could not be reached for comment.\nSolis and Kuehl were elected last year with strong union support. But Solis said in a statement, \"The key question for me is how a minimum wage increase would impact small businesses in my district.\"\nIt was not immediately clear how many people working for businesses in unincorporated areas might be affected.\nAs for county employees, only about 5,000 of the county's nearly 100,000 employees \u2014 including student workers, library and animal shelter aides and laundry workers \u2014 make less than $15.25 an hour now, but there could be a ripple effect of increased wages for higher-paid county workers if the bottom wages are increased, Kuehl said.\nThree studies of the city wage proposal released last week reached divergent conclusions. A study by Beacon Economics commissioned by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce concluded that an increase to $13.25 would dramatically slow job growth and provide \"at best, modest benefits\" to low-income residents. Another report commissioned by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and completed by the nonprofit Economic Roundtable concluded that the increased wage would create tens of thousands of new jobs across the region, increase tax revenue and reduce spending on public assistance.\nA third study completed by UC Berkeley researchers at the behest of the city found that the move would slow job growth, but that the overall economic benefits to the region would exceed the costs.\nGary Toebben, president of the chamber, said the county's decision would have a significant effect on the region's economy.\n\"What we're"}

Time to start that new diet and gym membership to shed those holiday pounds. Here are a few tips for Success in 2019.\nEvery New Year\u2019s rings in a new exercise machine and a new diet in our family. For the first three weeks of the year, Mom, Dad and Junior follow a strict, healthy diet while they huff and puff on the latest version of a hamster\u2019s wheel. Predictably, after a few months, I get fed all the salmon and kale under the dinner table and the new exercise machine joins the retired treadmills, ellipticals and stationary bicycles lined up in the basement corner near the washer.\nSo, here are a few ideas for better success with your healthy resolutions.\nIf you haven\u2019t exercised in a while, start with five minutes a day. If you have a pet, add five minutes a day to walking or playing \u2013 your pet will love you!\nNobody gets excited about slugging along on a treadmill. However, a challenging game of table tennis, dancing to a favorite tune or a walk in a dog park can be great fun!\nSeek Healthy Foods you Like.\nUnless you truly love salmon and kale, don\u2019t eat it. Find other nutritious foods and spice them up with a little pizazz. A plain, broiled chicken breast offers little to satisfy the taste buds, but add a little low-fat butter and lemon juice, and you have a favorite delicacy \u2013 chicken limone, which can be served over a bed of riced cauliflower.\nWhen faced with a dreaded task, like looking at recipes or going for a wintery walk, resolve to pursue the task for only five minutes. If you can\u2019t handle it after five minutes, then stop. However, you will often be motivated to complete the task after five minutes. Resolve each day to pursue a resolution task for five minutes.\nKeep your pantry stocked with healthy treats and have your gym bag packed at all times.\nWe have all heard the old adage if you do what you have always done, you will get what you always got. Review your past failed resolutions and try a new approach. If cutting calories too low or following too strict of a diet didn\u2019t result in sustained behavior change, modify your approach to cutting back on desserts or sodas.\nIf you have been indulging in too many sweets and chips this holiday season, your body will need to adjust to the reduction in sugars and refined carbs. Drink plenty of water, flavored with a little lemon or lime juice, eat healthy fats like nuts, avacados, olive or coconut oil.\nEngage in a Friendly Competition.\nFind a health buddy to join in your resolutions. However, focus more on positive behaviors (number of times to gym, number of times temptation was resisted) than weight loss.\nWeigh Yourself Once a Month.\nGive yourself enough time to notice weight changes without the daily or weekly fluctuations. The best way to know if you\u2019re slimming down is how your clothes feel \u2013 especially after a trip to the cleaners.\nPlace an inspirational photo on your phone or computer wallpaper. Use your phone for reminders. Download cool apps to keep you motivated.\nStress will knock your resolve quicker than a speeding bullet. Notice your rising stress levels early and use your best techniques to resolve them. See my blog posts on general stress relief and easing stress at work.\n"}

Wherever he went in Winston-Salem -- to church, to the supermarket -- the snide comments seemed to follow.\nEarlier this year, Dr. Howard published another study, this one concluding that 30,000 to 60,000 deaths a year nationwide can be attributed to secondhand smoke. This time, his phone has been silent. Of the comments he has heard from acquaintances at church and the supermarket, 98 percent, he estimates, have been supportive.\nJust as there has been a profound shift in the politics of tobacco in Washington, so has there been a marked change in the civic culture of Winston-Salem, a city identified more than any other with the American tobacco industry.\nNot so long ago, smoking conveyed sophistication, even glamour, and Winston-Salem's sense of itself benefited from its association with tobacco. The towns that consolidated into Winston-Salem in 1913 were, after all, the namesakes of two of America's most popular brands of cigarettes.\nPerhaps most demoralizing is the sense that outsiders, for nearly a decade, have controlled the fate of a proudly homegrown industry. First it was the corporate raiders from New York who bought Reynolds in 1989. Now it is the anti-smoking politicians from Washington and faraway state capitals.\n''When you're sitting in Winston-Salem, N. C., where all of R. J. Reynolds's domestic production is based, it's like holding the end of a rope with the rest of the country pulling on it,'' said Bryce A. Stuart, who has been city manager here since 1980.\nMartha Wood, who served two terms as Mayor before losing re-election last year, said she detected a subterranean anxiety that had become numbing in its constancy.\nDespite the shift in public attitudes toward the tobacco industry, most residents of Winston-Salem continue to view Reynolds as an utterly benevolent force, both to its highly paid workers and to its neighbors.\nNearly all of the dozens of people interviewed here in the last two weeks, smokers and nonsmokers alike, remain intensely loyal to the industry and to the company. All said they were proud that Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Reynolds Tobacco, had recently pulled out of a $368.5 billion settlement with state attorneys general after Congress and the White House sought to raise the price tag.\nBut over the last decade, a confluence of changes, some corporate and some cultural, has transformed this city from a bottle-fed company town into a far hungrier place. Strapped by debt, controlled by strangers and battered by both political and market forces, Reynolds is no longer the dominant force it once was in the city's economic, governmental and cultural life. Economic diversification has been forced upon a town that never previously saw the need.\nIt is hard to overstate the historical bond between the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and the city of Winston-Salem.\nThe statue outside City Hall is not of a Confederate soldier or a 19th-century mayor, but of Richard Joshua Reynolds, the son of a Virginia chewing tobacco magnate, riding into town on horseback in 1874.

Predictably enough, Hartford botched the construction job \u2014 the stadium is still not completed and its final cost, including litigation, may reach $100 million \u2014 and now the city projects a budget deficit next year that matches the stadium\u2019s original cost estimate.\nSo Hartford has raised up a new mayor, Luke Bronin, who is pitching \u201cregionalism\u201d to the suburbs in the hope that they will agree to tax themselves more to rescue Hartford financially and forget both the city\u2019s attack on New Britain as well as Hartford city government\u2019s rampant incompetence and corruption, which frequently manifest themselves in the news.\nMeanwhile, facing its own huge budget deficit, state government is even more insolvent than Hartford city government and thus not in a good position to help.\nPerhaps sensing a lack of sympathy for the city, Bronin increasingly is musing about filing for municipal bankruptcy. He cautions that bankruptcy would be embarrassing, as if the city\u2019s incompetence and corruption haven\u2019t been embarrassing too and as if they haven\u2019t been facilitated by an excess of money, not a shortage.\n\u2014 The city needs to be held accountable for the costs of its attack on New Britain. Yes, Mayor Bronin is new, but his predecessors were chosen by the same voters, few of whom objected to the attack on New Britain or to city government\u2019s incompetence and corruption. Hartford should pay for its own mistakes, especially its malicious ones. Bankruptcy will curtail city services and patronage and thus give city residents a stake in responsible administration.\n\u2014 Any bailout by \u201cregionalism\u201d or state government will only enable more incompetence and corruption. City government has been so incompetent and corrupt precisely because it already enjoys a huge amount of regionalism \u2014 50 percent reimbursement of its budget by state government \u2014 and has been confident that state government will always rescue the city in a pinch. Hartford residents won\u2019t care much about incompetence and corruption in city government as long as state government finances half of it.\n\u2014 Whatever made Hartford think it could afford $50 million for a stadium should persuade the city that it can squeeze that much more money out of its current operations. Recent events suggest plenty of room for economizing. The city\u2019s school system spent $61,000 to send three dozen employees on a junket to Florida. A patronage scandal with city insurance payments cost $900,000. And a city police officer was earning more than $200,000 a year in salary and overtime before he got caught on video stomping on the head of a prone, handcuffed, and unresisting criminal suspect, so he retired to an annual pension of $120,000.\n\u2014 The city\u2019s employee unions and lenders have profited from irresponsible administration. Bankruptcy will remove that profit and replace it with a stake in responsible administration.\nYes, Hartford\u2019s demographics are awful. There is too much poverty. Little competence in government or society generally can be expected when most people are living on welfare or Social Security, functionally illiterate, fatherless, facing criminal charges or on probation or parole, or employed by government itself.\nBut the problem goes far beyond that. Hartford lacks the self-sufficient, independent middle class necessary to operate government in the public"}

But whilst virtualisation can be hugely powerful, it still requires a large amount of technical know-how to configure and maintain. IBM PureSystems provides a fully integrated solution that aims to take the full benefit of virtualisation, and package it in a form that can be operated by a much wider cross-section of company employees.\nPureSystems starts with the hardware, which has been specifically designed to maximise flexibility. The hardware comes in four main types, two for general-purpose usage, and two for workload-optimised deployment. The general-purpose options are PureFlex and Flex Systems.\nThe former is a full rack which can contain a host of integrated services, whilst the latter is a smaller chassis designed to provide everything you need in one box, although still with plenty of flexibility over components. Both can contain either X86- or POWER-based processing modules, or even a mixture of the two should you require this. For more details, and a full walkthrough of what the PureFlex and Flex Systems hardware has to offer, watch our video presentation with IBM Technical Product Manager Dave Ridley.\nMoving on to the workload-optimised hardware, we have PureApplication and PureData. The former is focused on accelerating deployment of your choice of applications, whilst the latter is specifically aimed at data services, such as transactional and analytical provisions, including online transaction processing and data warehousing respectively. Unit options range from a 32-core \u201cMini\u201d chassis to Large systems with up to 604 cores. For a more detailed overview of the various members of the PureSystems family, watch our overview with Chief Strategy Officer for PureSystems, John Warnants.\nWhichever of these platforms fits your company's needs, however, the principal behind the system is the same, and revolves around the concept of Patterns. The traditional installation system involves a linear process of installing an operating system, then the necessary drivers, then the applications and other software you wish to use, followed by any data assets that will be required. Finally, there will probably be some further configuration required before the system can be used. This is clearly a rather involved process, and will take some time.\nWe haven't even mentioned the procurement process that will precede all this, both for the hardware platform required and the software that will run on it. It is possible to streamline this process somewhat using a standard disk image, and this is an effective strategy if you are rolling out multiple identical desktop workstations for end users. But if you need any new drivers or bespoke applications, you will be back in the realm of individual customised installation. Even in a virtualised server environment, a disk image can only ever be a generic collection of the key software, which may be fine for some uses, such as deploying a standard webserver, but it has very little flexibility.\nThe PureSystems Patterns concept provides the same sort of one-click installation as a disk image, but with a far greater level of flexibility. You can install a preconfigured Pattern from a growing library of presets. Depending on the utilisation of the underlying hardware, this can take a matter of minutes to complete, and only a few clicks will be required. There will be a few configuration options"}

Eye doctors were among the highest compensated, including one Florida ophthalmologist paid $21 million in 2012.\nThe disclosures were gleaned from a trove of $77 billion in payment data released by the government Wednesday morning that provides the first look at Medicare payments to physicians in more than three decades.\nThe massive data file covering 880,000 providers showed concentration at the top, with the doctors over $1 million receiving at least 13 times the $77,000 average paid by the program.\nThe data showed that cancer doctors specializing in blood work and radiation are those best compensated by Medicare, each averaging over $360,000 in annual payments from the program for the elderly and disabled, which is the largest healthcare payer in the U.S.\nWhile drug and hospital costs have been scrutinized, less attention has been paid to doctors\u2019 fees, which accounted for about 12 percent of Medicare\u2019s budget in 2012. Making the data available may allow the public and researchers to better identify fraud and waste by doctors in the $604 billion Medicare system.\nThe data could also put more heat on doctors who engage in self-referral \u2014 ordering up tests and procedures that are performed in their own clinics or in those in which they have a financial interest.\nThe data release has been lauded by consumer groups seeking to spotlight possible fraud or overuse and criticized by physicians, including the American Medical Association, whose head has said misinterpretation could ruin doctors\u2019 careers.\nMedicare payments to doctors were kept from the public after medical associations argued in the early 1980s that their release would violate physicians\u2019 privacy. Last May, a federal judge lifted a 33-year-old injunction on the data following a lawsuit by Dow Jones & Co.\nThe Obama administration decided last week to make all payment information public, excluding for privacy purposes cases in which doctors performed procedures on fewer than 11 patients.\nConsumers can now see aggregate sums paid to a doctor, how that amount compares to their peers and which doctors made the most from the program. They can also see the type and how many procedures a doctor billed Medicare for.\n\u201cIt will benefit not just consumers and the taxpayers but ultimately the healthcare sector because it will shine some light in some dark corners where, frankly, healthcare providers should improve the way they practice,\u201d said Joe Antos a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe AMA, which fought to keep the information private said the data lacked context.\nSome doctors may be making more than the average from Medicare because they see a disproportionately high number of elderly, not because they are improperly billing the agency, according to Ardis Dee Hoven, president of the AMA.

Pat McCrory and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Aldona Wos met with all of the employees in North Carolina's Medicaid agency to remind us about the importance of our work and the responsibility we have to the people of North Carolina.\n\"There is no issue more important and consequential than Medicaid and Medicaid reform for the long-term health of our state,\" the governor told us.\nEach year in North Carolina we spend more than $13 billion on Medicaid. That's $36 million each day to provide critical services to more than 1.5 million of our state's most vulnerable residents. But over the last few years, it seems that we in the Medicaid agency lost sight of the impact we have on our state and our people - both negative and positive.\nUnfortunately, there has been a pattern of cost overruns - hundreds of millions of dollars that our legislature had to appropriate at the last minute to cover unexpected expenditures. During his visit, the governor reminded us about this \"huge responsibility,\" and that our work \"is critical to the entire government,\" having an impact on services beyond just Medicaid. Because of the unexpected expenditures, he explained, our legislature has a more difficult time budgeting for our state's other priorities, such as education, transportation and even merit raises for state employees.\nIt was a message warmly received by all in the state's Medicaid agency. After all, the accuracy, precision and credibility of the information and data we produce are critical, because if we make a small mistake in Medicaid, there can be dire consequences for other services in the state's budget. The governor and secretary reminded us that we are all a part of a larger team - from the newest hire to the person who has been at the department for 30 years, from the administrative assistants, program analysts and managers to the governor. The people of North Carolina are counting on us to get this right.\nTo meet the governor's challenge, we are rapidly changing the culture of government within the state's Medicaid agency. Where before mistakes and inaccuracies were the norm, we are challenging and empowering employees to work collaboratively and to communicate with each other to improve the quality of our data and reports we produce. If employees spot an issue, they are expected and encouraged to take action and let someone know who can evaluate the issue and correct it. Secretary Wos and I have an open-door policy and welcome employees to bring such issues to us for evaluation and action if necessary.\nWe are inviting employees to bring new ideas to the table in a way they have never been asked to do before. Where before, creativity was discouraged, it is now encouraged. We expect employees to think outside the box to help improve the system. Most important, we expect employees to question every decision they make, and think about how it affects the bigger picture. We expect our team members to be engaged and focused on doing what is right, and not what \"has always been done,\" to best serve the residents of North Carolina.\nAs North Carolina's Medicaid director, improving the way we administer the Medicaid program is more than a priority for me; it is my mission. I take seriously our program's responsibilities to the taxpayers and to the residents we serve. I, and the other employees at Medicaid, are blessed to have jobs where we know that because of the work we do, someone's life is improved. It is that belief that encourages us to continue to push for the much-needed culture change in the Medicaid Division.

In fact, experts are so convinced of the benefits of the omega-3s in fish that health officials recently recommended Americans eat more of it \u2014 about 8 ounces, or two to three servings, of fish a week \u2014 in its latest revision of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nBut what about fish oil capsules? Doctors have also believed that taking omega-3s as supplements can offer a similar protective benefit to the heart. But a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine throws the theory into doubt: according to the analysis of 14 controlled trials in which nearly 20,500 patients with a history of heart disease were randomly assigned to take omega-3 supplements or placebo, those taking the fatty acid pills had about the same rates of heart disease, death from heart attacks, congestive heart failure and stroke as those on placebo.\nTo date, the studies on omega-3 fatty acids and recurrent heart problems have been contradictory: some have shown that heart patients taking omega-3 supplements had a lower risk of heart attack and heart-related death than those not taking them, but others have shown no such benefit. The difference may have to do with how some of the earlier studies were set up, says one of the current study\u2019s co-authors, Seung-Kwon Myung from Seoul National University. In some trials, the participants knew they were taking omega-3 supplements, and they might have had a bias toward seeing a benefit because of this knowledge. (Myung did not include these types of unblinded trials in his analysis.) \u201cI think the beneficial effects of omega-3 supplementation shown in those trials are not reliable,\u201d says Myung.\nStill, Myung\u2019s findings don\u2019t necessarily mean that omega-3s \u2014 the study looked at the fatty acids EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) \u2014 are useless when it comes to preventive health. Indeed, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that both heart patients and those who don\u2019t yet have heart disease eat fatty fish at least two times a week, and if they can\u2019t consume that much fish, then to boost their omega-3 intake with supplements. According to the AHA, studies show that omega-3 fatty acids can decrease the risk of abnormal heartbeats, keep triglyceride levels down and inhibit the build up of atherosclerotic plaques in the heart\u2019s blood vessels.\nIt\u2019s also possible that Myung and his colleagues failed to see a strong positive effect from omega-3 supplements among people with pre-existing heart disease because these patients may need a higher level of omega-3s to see benefit. The researchers looked at a range of doses of EPA and DHA, but perhaps a scarred, damaged heart that has survived a heart attack or angina is affected differently by omega-3 fatty acids than an intact and healthy heart.\nAs Harvard researchers Drs. Frank Hu and JoAnn Manson also point out in a commentary accompanying the new study, it\u2019s possible too that drugs like statins may mask the benefit from fish oils because"}

He had no idea she was facing a heart-wrenching choice: stay with him and the family that was holding her hostage, or leave him behind and be free.\nSix years earlier, Marip Lu said, she had been drugged, kidnapped and trafficked to this place far from her native Myanmar. She had been beaten, forced to \"marry\" a mentally disabled man, and repeatedly raped, she said \u2014 allegations her captors staunchly deny.\nMarip Lu is among dozens of women from her state alone in Myanmar to be trafficked to China. The Myu Shayi women's group says the average number of known victims from Kachin state has jumped from about 35 annually to 50 last year. Myanmar's government has reported over 1,100 cases in the country since 2010.\nHuman rights workers say the phenomenon, known as \"bride-trafficking,\" is a direct consequence of the country's former one-child policy, which skewed the nation's gender balance for decades. Today, there are over 30 million more men than women.\nThe Associated Press pieced together Marip Lu's story through interviews with her, family members, the group that orchestrated her rescue, and the couple accused of holding her. While the couple insisted she was neither abused nor raped, they were unable to explain how she ended up in their home, or how she allegedly met and \"married\" their mentally disabled son.\n\"It's sad to talk about family affairs, and we don't bring it up,\" said the father, Li Qinggong, explaining his reluctance to talk.\nMarip Lu said she was lured into China from the Myanmar town of Laiza after friends said she could get a job at a restaurant in nearby Yingjiang. She was drugged while eating breakfast one morning, and when she regained consciousness, she was racing down a highway slumped on the back of a motorcycle.\nShe was put on a bus, then a taxi deposited her at a house where a middle-aged couple greeted her excitedly. The couple, Li Qinggong and his wife, Xu Ying, sat beside their son, a man in his 30s named Li Mingming.\nThe couple instructed her to sleep in his room. That night, Li Mingming began heaving his naked body against her. But unexpectedly, he stopped. Later, she understood why: he was mentally disabled in some way.\nFor months, Marip Lu said, her captors never left her alone. They beat her and cursed her and forced her to do housework. Then one winter evening, they dragged her into their room. There, Li Qinggong raped her, according to Marip Lu.\nShe had never felt so isolated, or alone.\nWeeks turned into months, then years. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Marip Lu gave birth to a boy.\nAlthough she insists Li Qinggong was the father, the couple referred to the newborn as their \"grandson.\" In conversations with the AP, Li Qinggong never answered the question of whether he was the father.\nMarip Lu loved the boy more than she ever thought possible. But she was also desperate to escape."}

Shinola's slogan attempted to avoid this FTC requirement, and the company is not secretive about using foreign parts for the products assembled in the Motor City while listing all part sources on its website.\nThe company has been criticized for touting American manufacturing while using mainly foreign parts to assemble. Notably, the company uses a Swiss- or Thai-manufactured movement for most of its watches, and in some cases, the parts used to assemble the watches were 100% from foreign sources.\nThe FTC saw a potentially misleading difference between a \"made in the US\" claim, which the FTC polices, and Shinola's \"Built in Detroit.\"\nThe letter details the actions Shinola must implement and has implemented to remedy the situation, including: clarifying \"Built in Detroit\" in its website and all marketing and advertising materials; adding tags and materials detailing the sources of the parts used in products; redesigning watch-case backs to add \"from Swiss and imported parts\"; updating employee training manuals; and developing \"enhanced policies and procedures, including additional legal review, to avoid future deception or mislabeling.\"\nThe company must also stop using its \"Where American is Made\" slogan to describe itself, the FTC says.\nIt's notable that the \"made in the US\" requirement is stricter than manufacturing claims in other countries. Switzerland, which is still arguably the watchmaking capital of the world, requires only that a watch's movement be Swiss-made and the watch cased and inspected in Switzerland to be called \"Swiss made.\" For a movement to be Swiss, it needs to be made with 60% of its component's value from Switzerland.\nWe have always believed that \"Built in Detroit\" most accurately describes the watches (and jobs) that are being created in Detroit and will continue to mark our watches as \"Built in Detroit.\" While the FTC did show us some flaws in our communication, we believe that we have genuinely tried to be completely transparent as to the origin (and mission) of our products from the outset. We are thankful to the FTC for helping us identify some areas of improvement within some of our communication, which we began adopting over the last year.\nKartsotis criticized the inflexibility of the \"made in the US\" designation, saying that \"the truth is that Shinola is and has been a leader in bringing as much of the manufacturing process back to the US as it can possibly achieve.\"\n\"Many of the components and raw materials are"}

They all try to put the most positive spin on things. They all are prone to hyperbole.\nBut this is another thing altogether. It is separate, distinct and unique. We have never seen an occupant of the Oval Office who is actually allergic to the truth.

After seeing the video of the burglary unfolding, Armah did what police said you should never do. He took the suspect down on his own and restrained him with an \"arm bar\" wrestling move until officers arrived.\n\"A football player is a little bit different, of course, due to the fact that he&apos;s used to physical activity and tackling someone,\" said Master Sergeant Allan Kolak with the Cape Coral Police Department. \"We suggest calling the Cape Coral Police Department or your local law enforcement agency, letting us handle that portion due to the fact that there are possible dangers.

Any type of burglary, vehicle burglary is topping that list.

Most are at the final stage of processing, awaiting a decision from the three justices on El Paso's court.\nNone of the cases in question originated in the El Paso court, but they were transferred there from other, busier courts of appeals in the state as part of a routine practice that ensures each court has a similar workload.\nBut instead of improving efficiency in the court system, many of the cases transferred to El Paso remained unresolved and only contributed to the logjam in the court's docket, which also slowed down El Paso cases.\nThe 8th Court of Appeals has taken longer than any other court of appeals to resolve its cases over the past 10 years, according to statistics from the Office of Court Administration.\nBetween 2007 and 2017, it took the court an average of 12.7 months for cases to be resolved after they were filed. The statewide average for courts of appeals during the same time period was 8.5 months.\n\"The Supreme Court, for the first time for these reasons, has transferred cases back from the El Paso court to the transferring courts \u2014 cases that were not close to decision by the El Paso court,\" said Osler McCarthy, a staff attorney and spokesman at the Texas Supreme Court.\n\"The effort is to get those cases moving as they were not close to resolution by the El Paso Court,\" he said.\nThe 82 cases, some of which were submitted in 2015, were transferred back to the courts where they originated, including courts of appeals in Dallas, Austin, Waco, Beaumont and Fort Worth.\nMcCarthy said this is the first time the Texas Supreme Court has opted to transfer cases in this manner with the intention of providing relief to a particular court. He said cases in the past have been sent back to their original court of appeals after being transferred, but only if they were initially moved by mistake.\nBut the backlog of cases in El Paso made the move necessary, he said.\nWhile the cases at issue were transferred from other courts, cases filed in the El Paso court also are impacted by the backlog. In many instances, appellants have been waiting more than a year for a decision in their cases and, in the meantime, some have been serving the very prison sentences they're hoping to get overturned, court records show.\nMoving forward, McCarthy said the Texas Supreme Court will stop transferring cases to El Paso until the backlog is under control, so the justices will only consider pending cases and those filed directly at the court.\nDallas attorney Lawrence Mitchell has been waiting for the 8th Court of Appeals to rule on his client's case for two years, a wait so long he contacted the court to see what the problem was.\nMitchell represents Albert Lee Diaz, who was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison over several charges relating to the possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.

The remnants were found far from the area investigators were searching, indicating either that the plane was far from the route investigators were searching or it had been pulled a long way by currents.\n\u201cGoing by how the earth rotates, it's highly possible that the piece of debris could have floated (over a long distance) because the ocean current can be really powerful,\" he said.\nOther sightings of debris have been reported, including in the Maldives, which joined the search for the missing Malaysia airliner last weekend, but so far none of the findings have been authenticated.\nWas Maldives 'MH370 Wreckage' Just A Surfboard?"}

Currently, the repair and disposal of electronic equipment is conducted at inappropriate facilities resulting not only in lower recovery rates, but also in dangerous exposure to environmental and health risks. Since the country has limited technological capacities and industry experience in environmentally sound e-waste management and repair services to significantly reduce the quantity of obsolete electronics products, UNIDO and Samsung Electronics \u2013 supported through additional funding from the Republic of Korea through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) \u2013 jointly design and implement this project. It focuses on two inter-related components.\nFirst, it provides capacity building measures and improves the skills of youth in handling electronic products and upgrading repair services and e-waste management. Second, the project supports the local economy and reduces its environmental impact by promoting e-waste management practices and providing relevant market information on e-products repair services and e-waste management businesses to MSMEs. This initiative further assists the Cambodian government in advocating and formulating relevant e-waste policies that ensure the mainstreaming of effective environmental management in the local economy. Hence, the project leverages the partner\u2019s complementary resources to tackle the central barriers to a flourishing and sustainable electronics industry in Cambodia, i.e. the lack in adequate training, technology, and regulatory frameworks.\nAs a leader in consumer electronics and ICT products in Cambodia, the partnership with UNIDO not only aligns with Samsung\u2019s CSR plan and commitment to invest in the communities where it operates, but also fosters the development of strong local supply chains. Hence, Samsung Electronics contributes financial resources as well as technical know-how and equipment which are essential inputs for the hands-on training offered to allow the transfer of skills to youth \u2013 the main target beneficiaries. In order to build the required institutional capacity, local trainers and experts from the private and public sector are also participating.\nFor UNIDO, promoting employment creation and business opportunities in the electronics industry as well as improving e-waste management practices and policies is part of its mandate to advance inclusive and sustainable industrial development. Bringing its expertise on the responsible reduction, reuse, and recycling of electronic hardware and specific industry experience to the fore, UNIDO supports the Government of Cambodia in achieving the National Strategy and National Green Growth Roadmap of the country. Together with its public and private partners, it also raises attention to the issues of environmental sustainability in the context of job creation and economic growth.\nFor information about the project, please contact: Ms. Gloria Adapon, UNIDO Regional Field Office, Thailand."}

The board\u2019s budget included $50 million in cuts from its initial proposed budget.\nFairfax County has the third highest median income among all counties in the United States. Nevertheless, the cuts in the county, just outside of Washington, DC, underscore the fact that even relatively better-off areas are struggling to provide inadequate funding for basic social services.\nDue to the cuts, Fairfax County will hire fewer teachers than expected, with a resultant increase in class sizes for the upcoming school year. In addition, the school system will charge students a $50 fee for participating in after-school activities.\nThe 2017-2018 budget reductions come on the heels of steep cuts in the previous school year when the district faced a $70 million deficit. In fact, the school system has made cuts every year since 2008. Due to the budget issues, Fairfax County has struggled to offer competitive salaries to teachers, resulting in a 50 percent turnover rate in the first five years of employment. At the start of the 2015-16 school year, there were 200 vacant teacher positions.\nPrior to the cuts, class sizes in Fairfax County were already among the highest in the DC region. In 2016-2017, the average elementary school class size was 22.4 students per classroom teacher. Middle and high school class sizes were 24.6 and 25.8 respectively. With the cuts, the board says average class sizes will grow by about half a student.\nIn addition to school cuts, due to budget woes, Fairfax County cancelled a 1.65 percent \u201cmarket rate adjustment\u201d salary increase for county employees, deferred facility upgrades, sidewalk/trail maintenance, eliminated a program that allowed people with mental health issues to get treatment instead of jail time, and underfunded by $6.7 million a program for employment and day services used by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nSeventy-two percent of the school system\u2019s funding comes from county tax revenues, with most of that from real estate taxes. The county has faced a declining real estate tax base in recent years, with average home values flat and office real estate values declining in 2016. The county also has a high office vacancy rate, with more than 20 million square feet empty out of the available 116.4 million square feet.\nTo raise additional revenues, instead of raising taxes on the wealthy or corporations, Fairfax County proposed a regressive meals tax, which was put up for referendum in the November 2016 election. The proposal called for an additional four percent tax on prepared food and beverages. The measure was defeated.\nA large part of the decade-long revenue shortfall for the school system is due to substantial reductions in state funding for Virginia schools. Since 2010 the state government has cut $6 billion in funding for K-12 education.\nOn the federal level, Trump\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget proposal calls for $9.2 billion in spending cuts for education, a 13.5 percent reduction from 2017.

On one hand, they are missing the point and beauty of Madrid Fusion\u2019s being held in Manila. On the other hand, this is a valid sentiment that has resonated and in fact echoed in the past three events.\nAs high brow and condescending as it might appear to be, Madrid Fusion Manila played a great role in three things: (1) Putting the Philippines on the world map of culinary players; (2) putting a handful\u2014it may just be one hand but it\u2019s full\u2014of Filipino chefs on the map; and (3) inspiring aspiring chefs by having their idols talk here.\nMadrid Fusion Manila made so much noise that it was impossible for the world to ignore.

Freestyle BMX bikes are for future park rats; they\u2019re strong and sturdy and should take a fair amount of throwing around. Downhill BMX bikes are much lighter and more agile, ideal for drifting and gaining speed fast.\nChoosing the best BMX bike is a bit of minefield but the most important feature to look out for is the material of the frame. If the park is calling your name, there\u2019s some leeway around the material. First time youngsters will probably get away with the cheaper Hi-ten steel frame of the Haro Downtown 18 2018 but if you\u2019re late to the rat race, check out 20\u201d frames made from Chromoly or \u2018CroMo\u2019 \u2013 Mongoose Legion L80 2018 will fit the bill nicely.\nIf you want to head to the hills, Chromoly is probably fine if you\u2019re a beginner but anyone who can build up decent speed should really be looking for aluminium. Evans has a decent range of BMX racing bikes; beginners should take note of the GT Pro Series Expert 2017 Race BMX Bike, a solid downhill option.\nIf they\u2019re gawking at the trixters every time you walk past the local skatepark, it\u2019s time you bought them the best Christmas present ever. While you may want to start them off hopping off curbs and building mini ramps out of spare wood, once they\u2019re ready and raring for the park, this sturdy 18\u201d wheeler makes the perfect inbetweeny until they\u2019re ready for the adult 20\u201d BMX. It comes with a front and back break so it\u2019s road legal and a padded adjustable seat for riding to and from the park.\nWith its Chromoly steel frame, this bike balances studiness with lightweightedness, making it an ideal first BMX bike for future park, street and dirt riders. The wheel size is 20\u201d, ideal for leggy teens and beginner adults, while the friendly price makes it perfectly accessible to the wider market. Although the fork is made from the slightly heavier Hi-ten steel, it keeps the price of the bike down but still offers you a fair amount of leeway for wiping out.\nAlongside the light, strong aluminium frames and crmo fork, there\u2019s integrated head tubes, butted down tubes and tempered chainstays that make it a reliable junior racing bike. This isn\u2019t a cheap junior racing bike but compared to the wider market, it is affordable. Its specs suggest its up for some serious business, so make sure you\u2019re in for the long haul before you buy.\nCosting significantly less than any of the other BMX bikes on the list, this BMX bike from Mafiabikes is a great option if you\u2019re looking to trial out the park. Because of its price, you\u2019re only gonna get a Hi-ten frame, which isn\u2019t as light or as strong as Chromoly, but when you\u2019re not gaining the height or the movement of experienced riders, this is perfectly fine for a first timer, leggy teenager or adult.\nFor first time freestylers, this BMX bike from DiamondBack is ideal.

It\u2019s not even an endangered species,\u201d said Rick Bailey, who runs an oil and gas lease brokerage, Nevada Leasing Services. He said he\u2019s had hundreds of thousands of acres of potential leases put on hold.\nThose parcels are among 5 million acres the BLM has deferred in Nevada. Since 2008, millions more acres have been put on hold across Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas, according to data compiled by the AP from BLM records and agency offices including in the West and Plains.\nBy comparison, about 26.6 million federal acres were under active oil and gas leases at the end of fiscal year 2013 in the seven states with deferrals. That figure is down more than 20 percent since 2008.\nWhile some in the industry are concerned that the BLM\u2019s deferrals are going to dampen or curtail energy development, other developers are launching their own efforts to preserve sage grouse. Whether that\u2019s enough to avoid protections remains to be seen.\nSage grouse receive frequent comparisons to the Northern spotted owl, another imperiled bird that stirred a fight over logging in the Pacific Northwest. The sage grouse is more a hapless wild chicken, ducking futilely behind fence-posts as political and economic forces bear down upon its sagebrush range.\nCroplands, home development, wildfires and oil and gas drilling consumed more than half that expansive habitat over the past century. Grouse numbers are down at least 30 percent to no more than 500,000 since 1985.\nIn 2010, federal biologists said protections were warranted, but didn\u2019t impose them citing other priorities and a shortage of funds.\nThe September 2015 deadline to either offer protections or decide they\u2019re no longer needed resulted from settlements of lawsuits brought by environmentalists. Whether the sales of leases on the deferred parcels will proceed and drilling will occur could hinge on that decision.\nAlready the administration\u2019s timeline to craft conservation plans for the bird is slipping. Federal officials want the 11 sage-grouse states and multiple federal agencies to agree to long-term steps to protect the birds.

Per Allah\u2019s command, Prophet Ibrahim took his wife and their young son, Ismail, to Makkah, a desolate place, and settled them there. Hajjar and Ismail were left with a few dates and some water but when the supplies ran out, the child began to cry inconsolably.\nHajjar began running up and down the two hillocks, Safa and Marwa, in search of water.

When she was overwhelmed by fear, God asked her to throw her son into the river.\nHer unwavering faith was rewarded by God who ensured that the child was raised by the Pharaoh\u2019s wife and went on to become a prophet.\nThese examples show that mothers have the most honourable position as primary caregivers.

In addition, telecom operators also have to abide by stringent service quality benchmarks and invest in networks and infrastructure.\nHowever, OTTs argue that a regulatory regime for them would stifle innovation.\n\"The objective of this consultation paper is to analyse and discuss the implications of the growth of OTTs; the relationship between OTT players and TSPs; the similarity, if any, between services provided by the TSPs and OTT players...,\" TRAI said.\nWhen contacted, industry body COAI said that it is in the process of examining the consultation paper.

{"idx": "26251", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Earlier this week, we examined the role investor sentiment played in Facebook's early days of trading and the effect it had on funds holding the stock. It begs the question: Does investor sentiment (the psychology of crowds) affect stock prices, leading to mispricings? The argument against this belief is that any effects caused by sentiment should, in theory, be eliminated by rational traders seeking to exploit the profit opportunities created by mispricings. However, if there are limits to arbitrage, rational traders can't fully exploit such opportunities -- and sentiment effects become more likely.\nInvestor sentiment contains a market-wide component with the potential to influence prices on many securities in the same direction at the same time.\nImpediments to short selling play a significant role in limiting the ability of rational traders to exploit overpricing.\nWhen averaged across anomalies, 70 percent of the benchmark-adjusted profits from a long-short strategy occurred in months following levels of investor sentiment above its median value.\nWhen averaged across anomalies, 78 percent of the benchmark-adjusted profits from shorting that leg occur in months following high sentiment.\nAs expected, there was little evidence of overpricing in the long leg of the portfolio. The reason is that when market-wide sentiment is high, the stocks in the long leg could be overpriced, but the long leg should contain the least degree of overpricing. None of the 11 long legs exhibited a significant difference (an average of just 0.04 percent per month) between high- and low-sentiment periods.\nThe 2006 study \"Investor Sentiment and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns\" found that market-wide sentiment exerted stronger impacts on stocks that are difficult to value and hard to arbitrage.\nThe 2011 study \"Investor Sentiment and the Mean-Variance Relation\" found that the correlation between the market's expected return and its conditional volatility is positive during low-sentiment periods and nearly flat during high-sentiment periods -- the market is less rational during high-sentiment periods, due to higher participation by \"noise\" traders in such periods.\nGiven that the anomalies are well known -- they're challenges to the efficient market hypothesis -- why do they persist?\nMany institutional investors -- such as pension plans, endowments and mutual funds -- are prohibited by their charters from taking short positions.\nShorting can be expensive -- you have to borrow a stock to go short, and many stocks are costly to borrow because there are low supplies of available stock from institutional investors.\nInvestors are unwilling to accept the risks of shorting because of the potential for unlimited losses. Even traders who believe that a stock's price is too high know that they can be correct (the price may eventually fall), but face the risk that the price will go up before it goes down. Such a price move, requiring additional capital, can force the traders to liquidate at a loss. Long-only investors don't face this risk. The risk aversion is so high that the study \"All That Glitters: The Effect of Attention and News on the Buying Behavior of Individual and Institutional Investors\" found that only 0.29 percent of positions of individual investors are short positions.\nThe bottom line is that because of these impediments to short selling, overpricing becomes more difficult to eliminate. The authors concluded that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing given these short-sale impediments: \"Investors with the most optimistic views about a stock, relative to the views of other investors"}

{"idx": "26262", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: And that's why the United States can't win.\nIn announcing last week that more U.S. forces were headed to Afghanistan, President Donald Trump remarked that \u201cthe American people are weary of war without victory.\u201d He\u2019s right about the weariness. But that very weariness is encouraged by the widespread belief that Afghanistan is the kind of war in which there is going to be a moment of victory, if only the American people support the war a little longer. And that is to misunderstand the nature of the conflict in Afghanistan.\nEver since the Taliban government was toppled in late 2001, the heart of the strategic problem that has confronted the United States and its allies in Afghanistan has been the definition of victory: How does this end? We would all be better off if we first asked what \u201cthis\u201d is. While Afghanistan is a war of sorts, it is not the sort of war in which there is likely to be a decisive moment of victory. Rather, Afghanistan is best described as an armed policing operation.\nHence in Afghanistan, security forces regularly collect evidence from the battlefield: weapons, spent bullet cases, parts from improvised explosive devices, documents, cell phones, swab tests for explosive residue, and so on. Why? Because without evidence there will be no conviction in an Afghan court, and the alleged insurgent will walk away (assuming he doesn\u2019t bribe his way out after capture, as happens all too often).\nThis summarizes a categorical difference between internal law enforcement operations and interstate \u201cconventional\u201d war. The idea of impounding enemy tanks for use at trial or scouring enemy bunkers for spent bullet cases to put in evidence bags during, say, the Persian Gulf War would be ridiculous because, in that context, the enemy is not a criminal.\nThe categorical distinction between internal and interstate war is straightforward. What is surprising, therefore, is how far the distinction is ignored in the expectation that decisive victory is nonetheless available in internal conflict.\nIn a domestic context, everyone understands that policing is a continual activity. The idea is constantly to maintain order. There is no moment of victory as such but, rather, an ambition to achieve and maintain relative \u201cstability,\u201d which is only ever a provisional state.\nTo think about the conflict in Afghanistan as an armed policing operation (in my book I call it \u201carmed politics,\u201d but it\u2019s the same business of enforcing the writ of a government over its own state) makes sense historically. Take for example the British experience of policing the other side of the lawless \u201cNorth-West Frontier\u201d between what is today Pakistan and Afghanistan against rebellious Pashtun (then called Pathan) tribes. Virtually not a single year passed between 1849 and 1947 without some kind of large military expedition to quell unrest.\nBefore 1900 alone, there were 60 such campaigns. In 1897-1898, a general rebellion of the Pathan tribes required the deployment of a 44,000-strong British force to put it down \u2014 the largest British field force ever deployed in Asia to that point. But this operation is not remembered within the chronology of any war. Rather, the action of that year is known simply as the Tirah campaign. The key point is that there was no end point to this century of continual armed policing activity. 1947 was merely the date the British left. Thousands of Pakistani troops remain engaged in policing the same tribal regions today.\nIn sum, the notion of \u201cvictory\u201d in Afghanistan tends to mislead because"}

{"idx": "26271", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A certain mystique surrounds the 8,000-year-old art of beekeeping, but apiarist Steven Sparks says you really only need to do two things to be successful: control the swarm and control the mites.\nSparks, a biology professor at Ohlone College and owner of Bay Area Beekeeping, spoke at this week\u2019s Our Garden class, bringing with him samples of his honey, honeycomb and the makings of a beehive.\nAlthough there is plenty to learn about and do when it comes to raising bees, the two primary factors for success, Sparks says, are to keep the bees from swarming, as they naturally do, and to keep the colony protected from varroa mites, a tiny bug that can empty entire hives.\nEach year, the queen in a colony will produce a new queen. Then she will take half of the bees with her to start a new colony, leaving the old hive for the new queen. But if you make sure the colony has plenty of room to grow, the queen may not produce her replacement and the colony will stay put, at least for a while, Sparks says.\nOtherwise, you need to kill the unborn queen and check back every 10 days to destroy new future queens.\nKeeping the bees in their hive allows beekeepers to increase the size of their colonies, which in turn means more honey production.\nThe other half of the beekeeper\u2019s must-do list is controlling mites. The varroa mite, which appeared in this country in 1986, is a serious threat to bees and is believed to be at least partially responsible for colony collapse, a phenomenon first noted in 2005.\nThe mites attach themselves to bees and feed on their blood. In doing so, they pass along a disease so deadly it can wipe out an entire colony.\nControlling the mites can be difficult and dangerous to the colony as well. But Sparks says it\u2019s a matter of weighing risk and gains. The use of formic acid is one of the common treatments.\nIt costs about $1,000 to get started in beekeeping, Sparks says. That includes the purchase of protective gear, frames, hives and bees. If you can keep your colony alive and growing, he says, you should have good honey production by the third or fourth year.\nThe most important thing bees do is pollinate crops, Sparks says.\nWhen bees return to the hive with nectar, it\u2019s about 20 percent sugar. If simply stored, the honey would ferment. So bees dry the nectar out by fanning the hive, reducing the water content until only about 17 percent remains. At that point, the nectar, now honey, is about 80 percent sugar. The honeycomb cells holding the precious honey are then capped with wax to preserve it.\nBeekeepers breed bees to be great honey producers. These days, honey bees make way more honey than they will need, leaving the surplus to beekeepers.\nMost of the honey production takes place during a two-week to one-month period in May when flowers are blooming and bees are busy.\nWe delivered our first harvest of produce this week to the Monument Crisis Center in Concord. Despite some damage from ground squirrels, we sent four grocery bags of cucumbers, squash and basil.\nKathy Echols teaches us how to grow berries at the next Our Garden class.

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner quickly vetoed the spending plan.\nDemocrats in the Illinois legislature started the process of overriding Rauner's veto with a vote in the state Senate. It's unclear whether the House will have enough votes when it convenes later this week.\nIllinois Democrats say the huge tax increases are necessary to prevent credit rating agencies from downgrading the state's rating to junk status.\nWalker said, if Illinois implements the tax hikes, it would be Wisconsin's gain. He predicted that companies and people will flee Illinois.\n\"With the concerns they're seeing in Illinois right now, that makes Wisconsin -- whether it's Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee, Walworth, Rock County -- all those areas will benefit from that,\" said Walker.\nIn his own state's budget impasse, Walker said he is willing to cut his initial proposal to borrow $500 million over the two-year budget for roads down to $300 million.

Nearby are Ascot race course and Wentworth golf club.\nMany of the houses have security gates and electronic surveillance cameras to scan visitors. Tradespeople are instructed to \"use other gate\" and, behind the brick walls and thick rhododendron hedges, the passing traveller can glimpse large houses with pillared porticoes, monuments more to conspicuous affluence than architectural taste.\nBut, high on a rise, set back from the road as you take the B383 north towards Windsor Great Park, one modern mansion remains shuttered and barred, like the dark, crumbling house in an updated gothic novel \u2013 something by Stephen King, perhaps.\nIt was not always like this. Sunninghill Park was the home built for the Duke and Duchess of York on their marriage 23 years ago.\nIt has always been known as South York - a name bestowed by the tabloids because of its supposed resemblance to the sort of Texas-style ranch popularised by the soap opera Dallas.\nNow, however, it is just fading away. Uninhabited since the duchess and her daughters moved out seven years ago and sold, apparently to a Kazakh billionaire, two years ago (for a price well over the market rate even at the height of the property boom), it lies abandoned, its present ownership unclear.\nEarlier this week, an enterprising freelance photographer discovered doors hanging open, weeds sprouting through the terrace paving, windows broken, grass growing through the cover over the empty swimming pool, peeling paintwork and a general air of dereliction.\nAccording to land registry records, the property was sold for \u00a315m in September 2007.\nPrince Andrew must have thought his lucky day had come after the mansion had been on the market for five years. The sum paid was \u00a33m more than the asking price and even more than the \u00a310m he had been advised it would fetch.\n\"It would be worth a good deal less today, especially in its current condition, of course,\" a local estate agent said.\nEven with the present state of the market, agencies in Sunningdale are advertising smaller (though evidently rather better-maintained) mansions to let at \u00a322,500 a month.\nIf whoever owns it is hoping for the market in 665-acre (269-hectare) estates and attached modern mansions with six reception rooms, 12 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms to pick up, they may have a bit of a wait. Equally, if there are other plans for the house, designed by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, professor of architecture at Heriot-Watt University, in 1988, they have not yet been communicated to Bracknell Forest district council, the local planning authority, which this week confirmed that no applications were pending.\nReports that the owners have been pursued for unpaid water and electricity bills could not be confirmed by the crown estate or the power company Eon because of privacy legislation.\nThe man who negotiated the purchase of the house from the prince is understood to have been Kenes Rakishev, a Kazakh businessman in his late 20s whose father-in-law is Imangali Tasmagambetov, the mayor of the capital, Astana.\nBoth deny ownership of the property, however, and speculation has centred"}

(advancedsolarproducts.com) of Flemington, helped keep the power on at Midtown Community School, where 50 to 75 grateful residents of this historic Hudson Riverfront city spent the night sleeping on cots in the warm, dry and well-lighted community room.\nPower from the grid was lost to all of Bayonne, including Midtown Community School, which also serves as a community emergency evacuation center, about 9 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 29. The lights at the school stayed on, however, because of its unique solar backup system.\nThe large commercial-scale solar system, at the time part of the largest solar power project on the east coast, was designed and built with assistance from Advanced Solar Products (ASP) and installed in 2004. \"The system was never intended to replace the diesel generator,\" explains Lyle Rawlings, a solar pioneer and President of ASP since 1991. \"Using solar photovoltaic arrays designed to operate in conjunction with an uninterruptible power supply such as a diesel generator is just one of many ways solar can be deployed to reduce emissions and increase reliability.\"\nThe generator is large enough to meet the electricity needs of the school during a power failure, but gulps huge quantities of expensive diesel fuel, which must be delivered by truck if supplies can be located at all during and after an emergency such as Sandy. \"We knew it was going to be bad, so we had the diesel fuel tank topped off Sunday night,\" said Schaefer. \"Our supplier came back and filled us up with about 150 gallons on Tuesday afternoon and another 246 gallons a couple of days later. Without our solar system on the roof of the school, we would have needed even more fuel, which would have been difficult to find because it was needed for all the repair trucks operating around the state.\"\nIn order to provide this capability, the school's solar power system was specially modified with new controls, sensors and innovative software to enable it to automatically detect a power outage. When it does, it immediately shifts its output from circuitry powering the school\u2019s ordinary heating, cooling and lighting systems to the building's emergency circuits, keeping the generator running at a steady, low level.\nASP has built over 45 megawatts of solar projects throughout New Jersey and several other states in the Northeast, enough energy to meet the needs of more than 6,000 New Jersey homes.

We Washingtonians are passionate about our teams and appreciate sports for its diversity and commitment to excellence.\nThe headlines may focus on Washington\u2019s partisan battles, but our communities embody the best of sport and its impact on society. We have built arenas that have revitalized our neighborhoods. We have a long-standing commitment to youth programs, which help accelerate children\u2019s educational achievements and produce many exceptional homegrown athletes.\nOur region has produced extraordinary sports leaders and barrier-breakers. At Georgetown University, where I am chairman of the board of directors, we are proud of our D.C. native and legendary men\u2019s basketball coach, John Thompson Jr., who participated in several Olympic competitions as a coach. We are proud of Olympians who developed and excelled in this region, including Georgetown\u2019s basketball standout Alonzo Mourning, a gold medalist in 2000, and Katie Ledecky, a world-record-holder in swimming and a gold medalist in London\u2019s 2012 Olympics. Maryland\u2019s Jessica Long won multiple gold medals in swimming in the Paralympic Games in Athens, Beijing and London and was honored as the U.S. Olympic Committee\u2019s 2006 Paralympian of the Year. Our region is a hotbed of Olympic swimming talent.\nWhether it is a sporting event or a presidential inauguration, the District loves playing the excited and masterful host. I can think of no region more suitable or prepared to welcome the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2024 than the District.\nThe Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in the United States every year. The National Football League, of which I was commissioner, has a painstaking process for evaluating potential sites for hosting its championship game. We placed high value on a community\u2019s capacity, infrastructure and ability to provide a safe experience for the players and thousands of fans. Similar criteria are used to select Olympic host cities.\nOur region has the capacity to accommodate the Summer Games while continuing to meet the daily needs of local residents. We can offer premier athletic venues, from Verizon Center and Nationals Park to the stadiums, arenas and Olympic-size swimming pools at the University of Maryland and George Mason University to the equestrian facilities in northern Virginia. The region has exceptional hotels and other accommodations and some 850,000 daily commuters on the Metrorail. For the 2009 presidential inauguration, Metro helped ferry 1.8 million spectators, and the region has the advantage of being served by three major airports.\nThe Olympics would deliver enormous value to the District, particularly to our young people. Former senator Bill Bradley, an Olympic gold medalist in men\u2019s basketball, described the values of sports as including discipline, selflessness, respect, courage, leadership, responsibility and resilience, linking these values to the demands of life.\nThe Games bring the potential for Olympic partners to invest in our local youth sports programs. Access to sport is shrinking in our urban neighborhoods, especially for girls. The Women\u2019s Sports Foundation found that high schools in the District had positions on teams for only 22 percent of girls and 33 percent of boys. Hosting the Olympics could help reverse this.\nUSA Swimming saw youth participation sharply increase after the 2008 Beijing Games.

After a bit of research, he found out the ads go back as far as 1981, potentially further. It's still going on today, and you can see the 2016 May Day ad here. The theory is that the ads are communication between a group of intellectuals, and Hance believes the ads contain meeting dates, past and future, for a secret society that is planning for an economic and political revolution. Hance tracked the ads for the last 10 years to a lawyer, Robert Hungerford, who claims to have no involvement with the creation of the ads, but says he is just asked to send them to publish.\nAny proof? Most ads feature incredibly obscure historical references, symbology, and mathematical calculations, so it's likely they aren\u2019t just nonsensical ramblings but are the result of a deliberate, careful effort. Hance and a friend working with him were contacted in 1999 by a member of a group called The Orphanage, saying that the adverts are part of a larger cause, and the group have supposedly sent him clues and donations over the years. A letter to Hance from The Orphanage ends with the sentence, \"The day you can see the door, you will be welcomed inside.\"\nThe theory: Roman Emperor Otto III misdated the Western calendar 297 years because he liked the idea of ruling in the year 1000 AD. Otto, the Pope, and others filled in this \"phantom time\" with some completely made-up history: the Early Middle Ages. If this is true, the current year is actually 1719.\nAny proof? Surprisingly, yep. There are literally thousands of recognised forgeries of documents from the early Middle Ages that claimed to be written hundreds of years before they were, and describe events in detail, centuries before they happened. A huge majority of these were made by the Church. There is also hardly any literature, art, records, or cultural artefacts from Western Europe in this period, nor any real progress in agriculture or technology \u2013 hence the term \"the Dark Ages\". Read a paper about it here.\nThe theory: Internationally recognised food standards and dietary guidelines, called Codex Alimentarius, are actually a method of \"soft-kill eugenics\" designed to kill a bunch of us off to reduce the planet's population down to a more manageable level.\nAny proof? Well, the first warning sign is the dodgy name: Codex Alimentarius sounds pretty sinister (though it's just Latin for \"food code\"). Believers claim the codex tries to hide the benefits of herbal medicines and will restrict access to vitamin and mineral tablets. They also say the codex has renamed over 300 known poisons as safe food additives.\nThe theory: Since about the mid-'90s, some people, including some more famous believers, believe the cloud-like vapour trails emitted from planes \u2013 contrails \u2013 are actually chemtrails.

Punjab officials said more than 200 people in the province have been arrested.\nThe confrontation between the country's two main political parties has been brewing for nearly a year and stems mainly from President Asif Zardari's refusal to reinstate the former Supreme Court chief justice, who was deposed by former president Pervez Musharraf. Political analysts say former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry could reopen corruption and criminal cases against Asif Zardari.\nFormer Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has long championed Chaudhry's reinstatement, but he stepped up his campaign late last month after the current supreme court, largely seen as sympathetic to Mr. Zardari, banned Sharif and his brother from holding elected office.\nSince then, the two brothers have held large rallies in their political stronghold in Punjab, where they have urged supporters and even police officers not to obey the country's rulers. Pakistan's interior minister warned Sharif earlier this week that his actions come close to committing treason and he could be arrested if the rallies turn violent.\nSharif dismissed the warning in a demonstration outside Islamabad and urged his supporters to converge on the capital next week.\nHe says they are threatening me with treason, but he says that is ridiculous because they themselves are rebels who are destroying the country with their policies.\nPakistan's government is struggling to contain worsening violence by al-Qaida and the Taliban and is trying to revive its deteriorating economy.\nMeanwhile, gunmen in Peshawar targeted a senior politician of the Awami National Party.

I think that the 13 games played on Sunday validate that statement.\nThree teams -- San Diego, Cleveland and Buffalo -- rallied in the fourth quarter to produce come-from-behind road victories. The Chargers scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to defeat Oakland. The Browns scored 17 to beat Cincinnati. The Bills scored 18 to beat St. Louis.\nPhiladelphia lost to the Bears by a matter inches, when Alex Brown stopped Correll Buckhalter at the goal line to preserve a win for Chicago. With 6:58 to play, Dallas stopped Washington on third-and-2 from 31, seemingly forcing a 48-yard field goal try. But the Cowboys, coming out of a timeout, were flagged for 12 men on the field. The Redskins then held the ball for another 3:22 before kicking a 29-yard field goal that gave them a 9-point lead and left Dallas with less time for a comeback.\nKansas City won a regular-season game for the first time since Oct. 21 of last year. And while the focus was on Larry Johnson's big day, the other story was how a Chiefs defense that ranked 25th in the league after three weeks held the Denver offense, which led the NFL in scoring, to 19 points. Kansas City had been allowing 357 yards per game and have been playing two rookies at cornerback.\nLast week we wrote that a key matchup would be rookie CB Brandon Flowers against Denver WR Brandon Marshall. It turned out to be the other rookie, Brandon Carr, who got the assignment. Carr had an interception, and Marshall was held to seven catches for 77 yards -- after averaging 12 catches for 160 in the previous two games.\nAs for Johnson, he claimed he was being phased out of the team's plans. In Week 2, he had 12 carries for 22 yards. This week, he ran for a career-long 65 yards on his second carry of the day, and the crowd loved it. Several plays later, he was stopped for a 1-yard loss, and the crowd booed. For the day, however, they were pleased: Johnson rushed for 198 yards and two TDs. As we said, Chiefs coach Herm Edwards has a knack for creating favorable matchups with his defensive backs. If Damon Huard can manage the game for them at quarterback and Johnson continues to run the ball well, the Chiefs have a chance to be an ascending team.\nAfter Washington's season opener against the Giants, Redskins fans were ready to bench quarterback Jason Campbell and take play-calling duties away from new head coach Jim Zorn. They are probably feeling better about things after a 26-24 win in Dallas.\nThe Redskins held the ball for 38:09. There's no better way than that to stop the NFL's top-ranked offense (Dallas had been averaging 440 yards per game in total offense, averaging 150 yards and and 2 TDs per game on the ground).

There, customers will also be given a 'Customize' option, allowing them to easily switch DNT off if they'd like.\"\nTurning DNT on by default in Internet Explorer 10 means that for the first time a significant number of users will be opting out of ad tracking.\nPrivacy advocates at Mozilla created DNT as a way for users to tell advertisers to stop the tracking. The W3C is in the process of turning DNT into a web standard.\nOf course for DNT to work it requires advertisers to respect it. Despite the fact that DNT is counter to their interests, several of the major ad groups on the web have pledged to respect it. But thus far, because DNT is off by default in all the web browsers that support it, use is not widespread. Advertisers know that very few users change the default settings, so most people are unlikely to ever enable DNT, making support a less threatening proposition for advertisers.\nIE 10 will be the first real test of whether or not ad groups will continue to support DNT. Microsoft took quite a bit of heat from ad groups back when it first announced that DNT would be on by default. Microsoft has defended its choice, arguing that DNT is good for users.

Skolnick thought it worked both thematically and narratively, but the playability and allowance for fusion was also a big factor in the decision. Lastly, he included, Penance just looks cool.\nTorres pointed out that in publication, Civil War spanned a great many books, and so he asked how the team made the decisions they did in paring the story down.\nSkolnick really wanted to focus on the key themes and signature scenes of the comics, but stressed that it all needed to work within the context of a 4 player co-op RPG.

This is a gorgeous device that has no real purpose yet. Coupled with the fact that it tries to satisfy everything at once I got a clear sense that Apple is trying a little too hard. They've lost the steam to really innovate so instead create a one-device-fits-all smartwatch. But again, you are forced to conform to using the Apple ecosystem in order for it to work.

The $35.8 million dividend was 60 per cent of its net income.\nSGI Canada\u2019s combined ratio was 98.5 per cent. A number below 100 per cent indicates an underwriting profit.

The Democrat, Jay Inslee, is a longtime, outspoken crusader for climate action and clean energy. The Republican, Rob McKenna, is one of a vanishing breed of Republicans who not only acknowledge that climate change is happening but support government action to fight it.\nAnd they\u2019re locked in one of the most competitive gubernatorial races of the year, vying to replace retiring Democrat Chris Gregoire.\nGreens are positively swooning for Inslee. During more than a decade in the U.S. House representing areas north and west of Seattle, he pushed aggressively for climate legislation, environmental protections, federal support for cleantech, and a wholesale shift to a green economy. For Inslee, clean energy is not just another issue; it\u2019s his motivating passion. He coauthored a book on the subject in 2007: Apollo\u2019s Fire: Igniting America\u2019s Clean Energy Economy.

His cleantech plan \u2014 part of his larger jobs plan [PDF] \u2014 calls for three years of tax breaks for clean-energy startups, among other new companies, and extension of existing tax breaks for renewables. Other strategies include encouraging energy efficiency, developing the state\u2019s advanced biofuels industry, and investing in light rail and electric-vehicle infrastructure.\nEnviros and clean-energy entrepreneurs in Washington are pulling out all the stops to get Inslee into the governor\u2019s mansion. Cleantech business leaders have praised and endorsed him. The Sierra Club\u2019s state chapter is rallying its troops. Washington Conservation Voters (WCV) has raised about $750,000 for its PAC this year, and intends to spend the \u201cvast majority\u201d advocating for Inslee, says Executive Director Brendon Cechovic. The group has launched a pro-Inslee, anti-McKenna website and will do a big old-school push to directly hit up voters via snail mail, door knocks, and phone calls. \u201cWe view this as our highest priority in 30 years as an organization \u2026 a once-in-a-generation opportunity,\u201d said Cechovic.\nThe national green community sees big stakes too. The D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters gave Inslee a full-throated endorsement, breaking its long-standing policy of not endorsing gubernatorial candidates.

Keep those rankings in mind as we take a look at each division\u2019s players on the rise, on the decline and ones to watch for all 32 teams. Here\u2019s a look at the NFC South.\nMatt Ryan, QB\u2014He regressed last season, as I predicted, but a second year with his offensive coordinator should help Ryan and the Falcons improve on offense. Ryan threw a touchdown pass on 3.8 percent of his throws last year. That was a big drop from 7.1 in 2016. His career average is 4.6 percent, so I expect him to get closer to that number this year. Ryan is getting drafted after the likes of Kirk Cousins, Jimmy Garoppolo and Matthew Stafford. He looks like a value pick in the ninth round.\nMohamed Sanu, WR\u2014Taylor Gabriel is no longer a Falcon, but Atlanta drafted a solid wide receiver in Calvin Ridley. That could affect Sanu\u2019s value. He should still be the second best receiver for the Falcons, but his value depends on how much the rookie can take from the veteran. I don\u2019t think 700 yards and five scores would make me happy if he was my second WR.\nCalvin Ridley, WR\u2014Though I think Ridley probably ends up better than Sanu, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a candidate to be your WR2. I think the two receivers combine to make for a good season for Ryan, but it\u2019s hard to say if one is worthy of a start on your team. Ridley is being drafted in the 10th so you might be able to take him after you\u2019ve solidified your starters.\nRonald Jones II, RB\u2014Jones is the sixth rookie running back getting drafted, which is a bit surprising to me given that he\u2019s virtually guaranteed to start for the Bucs. His fifth-round price might be a little high for an unproven commodity, but he\u2019s got every opportunity to make an impact. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about Doug Martin, who left for Oakland, and he should beat out Peyton Barber for touches.\nJameis Winston, QB\u2014Winston will miss the first three games of the season and probably wasn\u2019t going to be a QB1 anyway. His play has somewhat regressed recently. Winston only threw 19 touchdowns last season and has thrown no less than 11 interceptions in each of his first three years.\nO.J. Howard, TE\u2014The second-year tight end is still getting drafted behind teammate Cameron Brate, but it will be interesting to see how he performs in the first three weeks with Ryan Fitzpatrick calling signals. The veteran QB is good at connecting with tight ends. Howard will be cheap in drafts so he may be worth taking a flier on late.\nChristian McCaffrey, RB\u2014McCaffrey should be a solid RB1 this season if he at least matches his first season production. He gained 1,086 yards from scrimmage and caught a whopping 80 passes. McCaffrey rushed just 117 times last year so it\u2019s likely that number increases with Jonathan Stewart now with the Giants.\nC.J.

Need more convincing proof of just how far we've come? Take a peek at the new home of architect Ken Radtkey and landscape architect Susan Van Atta.\nThe husband and wife's three-bedroom house nestled into a Montecito hillside is dubbed the Coyote House, partly after the name of the couple's street, partly after the howling critters in the area. Beyond its abundance of energy- and water-saving features, however, the house is notable for its utter normality: On the most basic level, it is simply a comfortable and beautiful family home.\nTo that end, the house starts with a modern take on the veranda, right. A covered room overlooking the front garden has a sliding screen and front and back sets of glass pocket doors that can open to the outdoors or seal it off in various ways, depending on the season and weather.\nA dozen highly flammable eucalyptus trees \u2014 by coincidence, cut down just months before the November 2008 Tea fire that swept through the region \u2014 were used to build the front door, kitchen table, bookcases, stairs and banister. Other materials used for interior appointments were sustainable too: Cabinets are bamboo, the floors are cork or salvaged stone, most of the walls unpainted plaster.\nOn the \u201cmirador\u201d above a second-floor bedroom, for example, solar panels configured as a pergola not only generate nearly all of the house's electricity but also create a shady viewing deck. \u201cWe like to go up and sit on our porch swing and have drinks there,\u201d Radtkey says.\nThe mirador looks out onto the second floor's green roof, right, which Van Atta planted with sedum and dudleya. \u201cInstead of looking out across a hot roof, we have a lovely green area to entertain friends,\u201d she says. Combined with rooms that are partially bermed into the hillside, the green roof further merges the house into the landscape.\nThe main green roof is arced, so rainwater gently flows down to a lower rooftop meadow atop the garage, and from there to a gutter feeding a sophisticated series of cisterns. About 10,000 gallons of rainwater can be stored to irrigate the terraced garden, vegetable beds, fruit trees and a large lawn where the couple's two sons play.\nThe water-wise lawn consists of native grass seeded into a 14-inch-deep pan of sand. When it needs watering, irrigation flows across the surface of the underground pan, reaching roots through a wicking effect and minimizing evaporation.\nAlso on the playful side: five chickens in the side yard next to the kitchen.

WCIX filed a protest shortly thereafter.\nCBS, which announced its purchase of Channel 6 in August and takes formal control on Jan. 3, is continuing the original protest. No date has been set for an FCC decision.\nSteve Salo, an adult student in the nighttime radio class at Piper, said those involved in the station \"see this as the big guy coming down on the little guy.\"\nAllen Shacklan, vice president for programming for CBS television stations, said the radio station should not have been allowed on the air in the first place.\n\"It looks like the FCC made a terrible mistake in ever granting that permit,\" he said.\nAt the time the radio station got its construction permit, Shacklan said, the FCC was in the midst of a proceeding to bar licenses to radio stations at the low end of the FM band in any area where there is a Channel 6 television station.\n\"Somebody just didn't do something right at the FCC,\" Shacklan said.\nHe said CBS filed papers on Tuesday in support of its position that the permit should never have been granted. Meanwhile, he said, CBS has offered a proposal to WKPX that would allow the station to stay on the air. He would not give details.\nOfficials of the radio station also refused to discuss details, but they did say the CBS proposal was not acceptable.\nPeter Gutman, a Washington, D.C., attorney who represents WKPX, said he thinks the high school station will eventually get its license.\n\"The commission will not pull the plug on a station that has been operating in the public interest for this length of time,\" he said. \"It would need an overwhelmingly powerful reason to do that.\"\nWarren Exmore, the chief engineer for WKPX, said Channel 6 has never documented that the radio station actually interferes with its signal.\n\"It's a smoke-screen thing. They say, 'You could be damaging our reception.' They have to face it: Channel 6 has a weak signal in north Broward. They are talking about potential interference, not any actual interference,\" Exmore said. \"I will not reduce the power.\"\nThe crisis began last spring, when WKPX officials, assuming that the longstanding Channel 6 protest had been resolved, asked the FCC to issue its license. They then discovered the issue had not been settled.\n\"I don't think they understand that this isn't just a bunch of kids running around playing records,\" Gutman said. \"This is one of the few training facilities in the country for high school students to get experience.\"\nMany former students are working at college radio stations, and some have jobs in radio.

{"idx": "26351", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Americans are used to protecting their hearing before shooting a gun at a firing range. Now that a new study shows the portion of U.S. teenagers with hearing loss has jumped 31% in the last 20 years, will the same message about loud and sustained high decibels reach the generation that proudly sports ear buds and listens for hours to personal music players like the iPod?\nAbout one in five teenagers had some kind of hearing loss in 2005-2006, up from 15% of teenagers in the late 1980s and early 90s, according to a study of nearly 5,000 people age 12 to 19 published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Kids from poor families were significantly more likely to have hearing loss than those living above the federal poverty level, the study found. The hearing tests used in the study were conducted the same way using the same basic technology between the two time periods.\nThe cause of teens\u2019 increased hearing loss is unclear. Researchers say factors such as nutrition, medication side effects and exposure to toxins need more study, as does noise from things like portable music players and the environment. Even though noise didn\u2019t prove to be the smoking gun in this study, many other studies show noise exposure does play a role in hearing loss and it needs closer scrutiny, said Dr. Joseph Shargorodsky, lead author of the new JAMA study and a resident in head and neck surgery in the Harvard combined program in Boston.\nMost teenagers in the study only had a slight hearing loss, but even a small hearing impairment can lead to big changes in academic achievement and quality of life if left unchecked.\n\u201cKids might not even notice\u201d if they have slight hearing loss, Shargorodsky said.\nThe study did show progress in vaccinating children against common causes of ear infections and in detecting and treating ear infections effectively when they did happen, Shargorodsky said. Kids who had sustained multiple ear infections weren\u2019t more prone to hearing loss in the latter 2005-06 group whereas those in the late 1980s and early 90s were.\nWhile noise is an important contributing factor to pursue, other risks need further study as well. A recent study in the March 2010 issue of the American Journal of Medicine showed that adult men who regularly took common pain relievers such as acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen were at increased risk of hearing loss. But such a study hasn\u2019t been performed in kids yet, Shargorodsky said.\nNoise, and especially that from personal music players, is a likely culprit for the rise in teens\u2019 hearing loss, said Laurie Hanin, an audiologist and executive director of the Center for Hearing and Communication, a rehabilitation center for people with hearing loss in New York.\nNormal aging is a risk factor for hearing loss, but the association between the two is unclear. Studies in developing countries that have less environmental noise than the U.S. raise the question of whether hearing loss is as inevitable as people here may think, Hanin said.\nIn the 1980s, when bulky, tape-playing Walkmans were all the rage, it wasn\u2019t as easy for people to sustain hearing damage from personal music players as it is now, Hanin said. Walkmans would run out of batteries and require listeners to carry around multiple cassettes if they wanted to hear more than an hour\u2019s worth of music at a time.\n\u201cImprovements in personal technology allow someone to listen to music much louder"}

{"idx": "26358", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: While the armpits may not seem like a common trouble spot, excess fat in the area can lead to embarrassment and self-consciousness -- especially during the months when little bitty tops are popular. Like excess fat anywhere else in the body, armpit fat is neither necessary or permanent. While it's not possible to specifically target your armpit fat, you can engage in a total body weight loss plan to shed fat throughout your body. With a little hard work, good nutrition and fat burning and muscle toning exercises, you can make your armpits a little less flabby.\nCardiovascular exercise is not only great for the heart but also for burning calories and fat. Exercises that require large muscle movements such as running, cycling, rowing, swimming and elliptical training are the most efficient for creating a calorie deficit. Increase the intensity and the fat burn of your cardio workouts by adding resistance, intervals or hills to your routine. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that overweight adults get at least 45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per day to facilitate weight loss and prevent weight regain.\nThe bench press is an effective exercise for strengthening and toning the pectoral muscles of the chest that just so happen to run all the way across your armpit. Toning these muscles will help your armpits to appear less flabby. Lie horizontally on an exercise bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Begin with your arms extended vertically above your chest and then inhale as you slowly lower the weights to your chest by bending your elbows. Exhale and press the weights back up to the starting position. Aim for two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions using a challenging weight.\nPushups are always a great option whether you're trying to tone muscle in the arms and chest or build upper body strength. They are very easy to perform and require no extra equipment, so even on vacation you can work on trimming up your armpit area. Begin in pushup position with your arms extended, hands wider than shoulder-width apart and legs straight. Contract your abdomen, stabilize your hips and inhale as you lower your chest to the floor. Extend your arms as you exhale and return to the starting position. Keep your body in a straight line throughout the movement. Perform two to three sets of 10 to 20 repetitions.\nDumbbell flyes offer an excellent means to stretching and strengthening the muscles around the armpit area. This exercise should be performed at the end of the workout, after the heavier lifts. To avoid injury, never use heavy weights when performing this exercise. Lie face up on a horizontal exercise bench and hold the weights with your arms extended vertically above your chest. Inhale and slowly lower the weights out and down until your arms reach a horizontal position. Squeeze your chest muscles as you exhale and bring your arms back up to the starting position. Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement to keep excess strain off the joint. Complete two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions of the exercise."}

I think you want to be thoughtful about how you develop powerful technologies. And I think it's important that more people than engineers are able to weigh in on these things.\"\nLike Apple CEO Tim Cook in an \"Axios on HBO\" interview, Pichai made it clear that tech accepts that new regulation is inevitable and will now try to work with Washington to get the balance right.\nPichai spoke with Axios after lawmakers grilled him on perceived search bias and consumer data abuses. In the interview, Pichai said he recognized that more conversations need to happen between Mountain View and Washington. \"There needs to be deeper, different engagement than what happens today,\" he said.\nPichai said that he views these sorts of cultural backlashes as moving in cycles, so Big Tech's troubles may abate one day. Meanwhile, he said he hopes that \"we don't lose that sense of optimism we have about technology.\"\n\"But I think a broader scrutiny of technology at a high level, I think, is actually important,\" he said. \"I personally have always felt so.\"\nPichai reiterated Google's support for \"thoughtful\" privacy regulation and said the company is exploring instances in which certain user settings would default away from collecting the data that fuels the company's ad-targeting machine. Instead, consumers would have to opt in to that data collection in some instances.\n\"I think privacy is an area where you have constantly evolving user expectations,\" he said. \"I think, as a company, we have grown a lot. \u2026 I think people may legitimately have questions saying, 'I do want a different construct.'\"\nHe declined to say which default settings the company might change.

Location data, for instance, is how Google knows what language to translate when you travel to another country. When Google gets it wrong, \"people are very upset at us,\" he said. \"We are trying to respond to user needs.\"\nConcerns about AI's power and potentially negative consequences are legitimate, he said.

{"idx": "26363", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Boxwoods are useful plants for creating borders and hedges.\n1 Can Boxwood Grow in the Shade?\n4 What Are Some Varieties of Boxwood Hedges?\nAlthough boxwood (Buxus sempervirens) is not the showiest of plants, lacking interesting flowers or fall foliage, it performs a variety of uses in the garden. Perhaps best known for its extreme tolerance of severe pruning, boxwood is amenable to hedges and topiary. Although it grows quite slowly, it keeps its shape well.\nNative to southern Europe, western Asia and northern Africa, the boxwood is a broadleaf evergreen. It is winter-hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 5 through 8 and has small, glossy green leaves that are usually between 1 and 1 1/2 inches long. Small flowers of a greenish-white color appear in April or May but are not showy and usually go unnoticed. Boxwood (Buxus spp.) is an incredibly versatile group, in which there are more than 200 named species.\nThe boxwood\u2019s growth rate is slow, gaining no more than 12 inches of new growth per year, but in some ways this makes it easier to train as a landscape plant. If left untended it will grow to a broad shrub or small tree formation and can reach heights of 5 to 15 feet and an equal spread. Sometimes it can even reach 20 feet tall, but it generally grows in a round-mounding formation. Growth is dense, and plants appreciate removal of dead branches to increase air circulation within.\nAlthough boxwood does tolerate relatively severe pruning, it is not necessarily a low-maintenance plant. For one thing, pruning too early in springtime can lead to frost damage later, as shearing can promote new growth before it is warm enough. Accordingly, you should wait until after the last frost date to prune. It prefers protection from cold or drying winds, and although it will grow in both full sun and full shade, it appreciates neither extreme. Instead, site boxwood where it can receive several hours of full or dappled sunlight in the morning or afternoon, and plant it in well-drained, slightly acidic or slightly alkaline soil. Keep soil evenly moist.\nAlthough boxwood lends itself quite well to all plant formations that require shearing -- foundation plantings, formal garden accents, topiary, hedges -- it also works as a less formal massed shrub or specimen plant. If you have a low-water garden, boxwoods are a good choice, as they are drought-tolerant. They also transplant well, which recommends them to gardens in progress.\nMoore, Sarah. \"Growth Rate of Buxus Sempervirens.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/growth-rate-buxus-sempervirens-77512.html.

However, Microsoft doesn't appear to have any plans to extend that support to Apple's iPad tablet computer.\nStarting late last week Microsoft made Office Mobile for iPhone available through Apple's app store. A subscription costs $100 per year and gives users access to the cloud-focused Office 365.\nUsing the new Office 365 app, iPhone users can create, read, and edit Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. They can also create slide presentations using PowerPoint.\nMany analysts believe this marks an important event. For one, it will allow Microsoft to sell its product to the massive iPhone user base. Apple will also benefit because Office remains an extremely popular app, particularly in the business community.\nHowever, experts are also disappointed that Microsoft stopped short of extending access to Office to iPad users.\nThe reason you won't find Office on an iPad is tied to Microsoft's ongoing attempt to make its Surface tablet computer more attractive to consumers.\nWith Office still not available for iPad, the Surface certainly has some appeal.\nOlson says it's highly unlikely we'll see Microsoft release a version of Office for the iPad until Surface gains a foothold in the increasingly competitive tablet market.\nIn an attempt to give iPad users a viable alternative to Office, Apple is reportedly overhauling iWork, which provides many of the same types of tools found in Microsoft's software package.\nWhile Office Mobile for iPhone is available right now in the U.S., residents of other countries may have to wait a few days or weeks to gain access to the download."}
{"idx": "26367", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Deutsche Bank\u2019s latest strategy for boosting its appeal may be its most effective yet: the German lender headed by Christian Sewing has banned staff from Dorchester Collection hotels after its owner, the government of Brunei, implemented homophobic laws. Shareholders will welcome the fact that employees of a bank whose costs ate up 93 percent of revenue last year will no longer frequent a chain which charges nearly 400 pounds a night for a standard room in London. However, the decision raises the moral bar.\nBrunei\u2019s state-owned investment agency owns the Dorchester Collection hotel group, which includes luxury venues such as The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Oscar-winning actor George Clooney called for a boycott after the government implemented Islamic laws which would impose the death penalty for homosexuality or adultery. Celebrities including singer Elton John have joined in.\nShunning the sultanate is relatively painless for Deutsche, which has limited business in Brunei. Yet like many of its global peers the bank continues to operate in Saudi Arabia, which also has stringent anti-homosexuality laws. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon recently met government-linked clients in the desert kingdom.\nBanks and other big multinationals long argued that they had to accept the laws of countries where they do business. But pressure from customers and shareholders is forcing them to set out moral positions. Employers\u2019 efforts to attract and retain a diverse workforce in the West is also increasingly hard to square with maintaining links with repressive regimes.\nBig companies generally muster two defences. The first is that if the government is moving in the right direction, a boycott would be counter-productive. This is how companies justified their presence in Saudi Arabia \u2013 which recently allowed women to drive \u2013 at least until the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year. The second defence is that companies have an obligation to their shareholders to weigh the costs of boycotting certain countries against the reputational damage of working with them.\nIncreased investor demand for companies to meet a range of social and environmental criteria means banks especially will face more awkward questions about business in illiberal countries. So while Deutsche\u2019s Brunei boycott may be relatively cost-free, it will face bigger financial tests in the future."}

But more importantly, the new images are creating scientific puzzles about how such an object could even be formed. We've never seen something like this orbiting the Sun,\" he said.\nThe departure images were taken from a different angle than the approach photos and reveal complementary information on Ultima Thule's shape.\nThe object's illuminated crescent is blurred in the individual frames because a relatively long exposure time was used during this rapid scan to boost the camera's signal level, but the team combined and processed the images to remove the blurring and sharpen the thin crescent.\nMany background stars are also seen in the individual images; watching which stars \"blinked out\" as the object passed in front them allowed scientists to outline the shape of both lobes, which could then be compared to a model assembled from analysing pre-flyby images and ground-based telescope observations.\n\"The shape model we have derived from all of the existing Ultima Thule imagery is remarkably consistent with what we have learned from the new crescent images,\" said Simon Porter, a New Horizons co-investigator from the Southwest Research Institute.\n\"While the very nature of a fast flyby in some ways limits how well we can determine the true shape of Ultima Thule, the new results clearly show that Ultima and Thule are much flatter than originally believed, and much flatter than expected,\" said Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory."}

Jennings focused on using Christianity to relieve racial tensions in America.\nJennings believed that mistakes made in interpreting God\u2019s word is the root of many social rifts, such as poor race relations and border debates. For example, Jennings argued that white settlers first engaged in grouping distinct tribes and clans into reductive categories called \u201craces.\u201d In addition, they introduced the concept of private property\u2014humans possessed land rather than living with the land as the Natives believed.\nAccording to him, Christians saw themselves as entitled to these actions because they read the Word of God as primary readers, rather than as secondary readers they really were, exposed to the Word by Judaism.\nJennings also said that Christians treated everyone else as if they did not know the Word of God, which allowed them to engage in colonization and racial discrimination without considering the moral or theological implications of doing so. Christians acted as if they were the ones who God reached out to first, rejecting the notion of inclusion that allowed them to become believers in the first place.\nAs a result of this mistake in faith, Jennings argued that the white settlers treated the indigenous peoples they encountered as demonically possessed because they viewed Nature as alive and constantly interacting with them. Jennings pointed to the white settlers\u2019 view of the land as a tool for use and enjoyment\u2014as opposed to the Natives\u2019 view\u2014as a driving factor behind this treatment. In other words, the white settlers were imposing their way of life onto the Natives.\nJennings traced current racial tensions and environmental misuse to this Colonialist influence. He argued that today, we still see the world as a possession, our goal being to realize its full potential. He extended this argument to nationalism, further explaining that it was founded from the concept of being attached to the land by owning it. People see borders because they see land as possession, rather than a shared resource given by God.\nTo rethink how we view the land, Jennings called for Christians to stop viewing land as a possession. To achieve this, he called for Christians to see what is not preached at the pulpit and to tend to Nature, rather than merely control it. Jennings noted that Nature served as a backdrop in sermons, something that had to be changed.\nThis new view on Christian teachings can give us a deeper sense of our lives, allowing us to live more meaningful lives as Christians. By finding new lines of connection\u2014which transcend class, racial, and property lines\u2014Jennings hopes that we can engage in \u201cgestures of openness\u201d rather than exclusiveness, allowing us to welcome everyone and preach the good news and faith."}

Adam Frank finds some answers in the re-reading of a Gary Snyder book.\nOn my way back from the woods in New Hampshire, I stopped at a strip mall marking my crossing into more densely inhabited landscapes.\nThe sky above the strip mall hung low and grey, which didn't help the look of things. With the snow melting, the parking lot was filled with dirty cars and wet trash. People spilled into and out of the stores: a Subway; a Starbucks; a supermarket whose name I forget.\nAs I stood there, I was struck by how we humans are a strange lot, trading prairie, forest, fields and wetlands for these terrains of tar and concrete. It left me with a question. Why exactly is the contrast between these worlds so sad? What, specifically, is it that makes the parking lot seem so lost compared with the forest of trees or the field it used to be?\nTo answer these questions (and more), I've been re-reading Gary Snyder's The Practice of the Wild. If you don't know Snyder, it is my great pleasure today to introduce him to you. I am also relatively new to his writing. He is one of America's greatest poets. He's also lived a great American story.\nIn the 1950s, Snyder hung out with Beats serving as inspiration for the main character in Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums. Later in that decade, Snyder made his way to Japan to begin years of Zen training. Still later, he became a founding voice for what's called \"Deep Ecology.\" A scholar with a poet's ear and a poet with a scholar's curiosity, his whole life has been lived as a search for our roots embodied in the land.\nThere are many tasks The Practice of the Wild takes on. At its heart, it is a book about what happened to us \u2014 meaning how we pulled ourselves so far from a lived connection to lived landscapes. In that way, it's a kind of history of human beings and their relationship to land and life. But before he begins that history, Snyder also lays out distinctions between nature, wild and wilderness. In that distinction, I found an answer to my question.\nAs Snyder tells us: \"Science and some sorts of mysticism rightly propose that everything is natural. By these lights there is nothing unnatural about New York City, or toxic wastes, or atomic energy...\"\n\"So we can say that New York City and Tokyo are 'natural' but not 'wild.' They do not deviate from the laws of nature, but they are habitat so exclusive in the matter of who and what they give shelter to, and so intolerant of other creatures, as to be truly odd. Wilderness is a place where the wild potential is fully expressed, a diversity of living and nonliving beings flourishing according to their own sorts of order.\"\nThus, for Snyder, the wild is not about pristine landscapes. Instead, it's about landscapes that are rich and diverse enough to be interesting for everybody, human and non-human alike. He writes: \"When an ecosystem is fully functioning, all the members are present at the assembly. To speak of wilderness is to speak of wholeness.\"\nThis, I think, explains the hollow sense of otherness you"}

There's a real dollar to be made\" in space tourism.\nExhibit A for Diamandis' investment pitch: Virgin CEO Richard Branson's deal with Allen's American Mojave Aerospace Ventures to build as many as five spaceplanes for suborbital tourist flights carrying five passengers. Flights could start as early as 2007. Branson said the deal to license the Mojave technology could be worth $20 million, on top of the $100 million it might take to build the spaceplanes.\nBut the problem for the immediate future of those who want to take people to space, as well as those eager to go, is that there's not much of an Exhibit B to go with Exhibit A.\nSo far, the world doesn't appear to be full of Allen-style billionaires willing to dump cash into experimental spaceships. More traditional investors, focused on getting a return on their money, say they want to see more results before taking a plunge.\n\"Money, financing, is what stops us from doing a lot of stuff,\" said Phillip Storm, whose two-man venture, Washington state-based Space Transport, is trying to develop a suborbital rocket ship on a budget of just $420,000. So far, Storm and partner Eric Meier have raised a little more than half that amount.\n\"If we had $25 million, we could launch hundreds of the X Prize-type vehicles we planned,\" said Storm earlier this month. That's the amount Allen reportedly put into development of SpaceShipOne. \"We could prove out our concept,\" he added.\nTiny, hardworking fringe efforts like Space Transport aren't the only ones having a hard time raising money. Some companies that have spent years in the business and are credible enough to attract government rocket technology contracts are also struggling for investment dollars.\n\"There was no visible change in interest after the June SpaceShipOne flight,\" said Jeff Greason, president of Xcor Aerospace, headquartered just down the flight line from Rutan's Scaled Composites in Mojave, Calif.\nXcor is working on a suborbital spacecraft called the Xerus, designed to take off like a conventional aircraft, blast out of the atmosphere, then fly back to the runway. Greason says Xerus could fly 18 to 24 months after the project is fully funded, a figure he puts at $10 million. Xcor has already signed a deal with Virginia's Space Adventures to carry tourists on suborbital flights for $98,000 apiece.\n\"One by one, all the things that have been holding us back have been making a lot of progress,\" Greason said. \"The fundamental barrier that's still left is, 'Can you get the money?'\"\nWhy have space-tour entrepreneurs found it so tough to crack the money barrier?

This story was edited April 4 to clarify the account of events at the subject's request.\nWinslow Umberger knew something was wrong when the horizon disappeared.\nUmberger, 66, and her husband Charles were enjoying a leisurely lunch onboard the Viking Sky, a luxury cruiseliner making its way south along the Norweigan coast. There had been some turbulence, sure, but as a ship captain's daughter, Umberger didn't think much of it until an enormous wave sent the contents of the kitchen flying in a thunderous crash.\nThe waitstaff scurried around \"like sandpipers\" trying to collect the debris, Umberger said. It was almost comical until the captain's first \"mayday\" sounded over the intercom. The ship rose and fell on swells so high that Umberger couldn't see the horizon.\n\"It's kind of surreal \u2014 you take these drills on boats, but you don't ever expect to put those life jackets back on.\"\nThree Asheville couples \u2014 Winslow and Charles Umberger, Elaine and Buster Barkus and another local couple \u2014 were all aboard the cruiseliner the Viking Sky when its engines failed and most passengers were forced to evacuate on March 23.\nUmberger said nearly a thousand passengers, many of them quite elderly, worked to make their way to their assigned emergency muster stations as the ship rocked with violent waves. \"Everything is flying. There's glass flying, there's furniture upended, (passengers) trying to weave their way back.\"\nThe Umbergers reported to their muster station \u2014 a windowless theater on the second deck of the ship. Winslow found this disquieting, especially when the captain announced that the water doors had been sealed. There had been a breach.\nBut the Umbergers and their muster mates were the lucky ones, she said \u2014 another Asheville couple, Elaine and Bruce Barkus, had been assigned to the other major muster point in the ship's dining facility \u2014 where the breach occurred.\nBruce Barkus said the couple isn't yet ready to discuss their harrowing experience \u2014 \"It's all still too raw,\" Barkus said over the phone. But he gave permission to cruise companion Winslow Umberger to provide an outline of what the Barkuses lived through, according to conversations they shared about the experience.\nThe ship was battered by 19-25 foot swells, which the passengers in the restaurant muster could see all too clearly through the panoramic plexiglass windows. Between the torque of the ship attempting to steer, the waves, and brutal 40-50 mile-per-hour winds, three window panels popped out of place and a door was wrenched open at a severe angle.\nA wall of Arctic water washed in, and Elaine Barkus was thrown about 20 feet and pinned to the floor by the sheer force of the water, Umberger said, but Bruce was able to drag his wife up to the surface for air.

It\u2019s the dining trend that doesn\u2019t seem to fade, and if anything, has seen a resurgence in Music City.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an accessibility to steakhouses that people feel that will always keep people coming to them,\u201d said San Francisco-based celebrity chef Michael Mina, who in September opened the upscale Bourbon Steak on the 34th floor of the JW Marriott.\nMina doesn\u2019t mean accessible in terms of price \u2014 a black angus filet mignon will cost you $44, and the hickory-smoked and pastrami-spiced beef short rib clocks in at $65. Rather, Mina believes if a group of 10 people visit a steakhouse, every one of them should be able to find something to order.\n\u201cI think that people will look at a steakhouse and say, \u2018Well, hey, that\u2019s a pretty safe bet,\u2019\u201d Mina said.\nPerhaps no one in Nashville understands the enduring quality of a steakhouse more than Mike Kelly, whose grandfather started Jimmy Kelly\u2019s in 1934 in downtown Nashville. The Nashville staple continues to draw a crowd, and regular patrons include some of the city\u2019s most powerful movers and shakers.\nAsk Mike Kelly how the restaurant has weathered 84 years in a highly competitive industry, and he laughs.\n\u201cI have no idea. We\u2019re just kind of focused on what we do. We\u2019ve changed a few things over the years, but just focus on the highest quality product and great service. That\u2019s what it takes in the restaurant business,\u201d he said.\nRestaurant competition has grown exponentially in Nashville, including in the steakhouse segment, and the city is now home to Morton\u2019s, Ruth\u2019s Chris, Jeff Ruby\u2019s, Char, Oak, Bourbon Steak, Kayne Prime, Sperry\u2019s, Bob\u2019s Steak & Chop House, The Southern Steak & Oyster, Capitol Grille and more.\nA recent surge in new steakhouses in part reflects national consumption trends; Americans are eating more beef thanks to lower prices, more disposable income and the backing of popular diets such as paleo.\nAmericans ate an average of 54 pounds of beef in 2015, 55.6 pounds in 2016 and 57 pounds in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Deviating from the subsidy-oriented approach to growth promotion, the Mission focussed on hands on capacity building \u2013 injecting scientific knowhow into the existing beekeeping (also known as apiculture) industry for enhancing production while working on market linkage and building a brand.\nAn apiary at Old Jalukie.\nAccording to the NBHM personnel, people, who were once part-time honey gatherers has today turned to beekeeping with a steady source of income.\n\u201cThere are beekeepers, who are earning Rs.3-4 lakhs a year,\u201d said NBHM team member Bokali A. Chikhe. She recounted a story of how a beekeeper in Lizutomi village, Zunheboto became the first to own a washing machine in the village with earnings from beekeeping. She said that the beekeeper (in his mid 30s) used to gather honey from the wild as a hobby before he took to beekeeping through the intervention of the NBHM.\nHer NBHM colleague Nzanbemo K. Lotha shared an inspiring story from Chendang village in Tuensang. \u201cBack in 2008, there was only one bee colony in the village run by one individual. It has now grown to 400 colonies producing over 2 metric tonnes a year,\u201d said Lotha. He added that the beekeeping in the village has diversified into \u201callied-farming\u201d engaging some 70 percent of the villagers.\nA combination of natural factors is believed to give distinctive flavours to the different kinds honey produced in Nagaland.\n\u201cNagaland Honey is a natural \u2018multi-floral\u2019 honey,\u201d responded Lotha when posed with the question. He claimed that the uniqueness of Nagaland Honey is acquired from the state\u2019s varied flora, which acts as a rich source of nutrition for honeybees producing a one of its kind taste.\nHe continued that other varieties of honey produced beyond the north-east are harvested from colonies with a high concentration of agricultural mono-plantations.\nFurther, it is regarded as \u201corganic by default.\u201d Without much farmland, vegetation untainted by artificial fertilizers act as the primary source of nutrition for honeybees, added Lotha.\nBut officially getting the \u201corganic\u201d tag requires money as it involves frequent certification in the form of demarcating certain honey producing areas as artificial fertilizer free zones.\nThe story has been so far so good yet there is room for more. According to the NBHM personnel, there is great potential for export but there is a wide demand-supply gap. The current production cannot even meet domestic requirement with the demand within the state tipped at over 500 metric tonnes per annum.\nThe NBHM has set an annual production target of 2000 metric tonnes by 2030. As pointed out by the NBHM personnel, there are many challenges and needs to meeting the target.\nThe challenges include de"}

Lots of Them.\nThe Indian government\u2019s failure to create millions of new jobs for its young population may be its undoing in elections.\nAashique Ahmed Iqbal had no reason to think he wouldn\u2019t find a job. Although from a modest background, he\u2019d studied at one of India\u2019s top schools, attended one of its best universities, and completed a doctorate in history at Oxford University after being awarded a highly competitive scholarship.\nWhen he returned to India, in 2017, he was optimistic that he could find work as an academic. Over the past decade, India\u2019s education sector has opened up. Well-regarded private universities have joined some of the country\u2019s elite, state-run institutions to offer a quality education for not only India\u2019s top students, but also its wealthiest. These schools actively sought out people like Iqbal\u2014those educated abroad\u2014and paid them relatively well.\nHis travails embody the experiences of tens of millions of young Indians\u2014and that could have consequences for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he prepares his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for parliamentary elections, which begin this month. Stories like Iqbal\u2019s are found all over the country. Last year, for instance, 19 million people applied for 63,000 vacancies in India\u2019s national railway authority. This year, there were more than 20,000 applicants, at least one of whom held an M.B.A., for five jobs with the literal title of \u201cpeons\u201d; duties included making tea and photocopying. Similarly, 200,000 people, including those with advanced degrees, vied for 1,137 open slots for police constables in Mumbai, a job that officially only requires a high-school diploma.\nThese startling stories, coupled with hard economic data, pose perhaps the most serious threat to Modi\u2019s narrative of reform. They raise questions about his pledge to create 10 million jobs annually and belie India\u2019s robust economic-growth rate, which has hovered at about 7 percent over the past decade. In isolation, these accounts might seem like cherry-picked anecdotes designed to poke holes in India\u2019s economic success story. Taken together, however, they call attention to the systemic unemployment that Modi\u2014and indeed any future Indian leader\u2014will struggle to fix in a country of 1.3 billion people, where half the population is under the age of 27.\nBetween 2005 and 2012, before the BJP was elected, India\u2019s economic growth generated about 3 million jobs a year, according to World Bank data. But the country\u2019s demographics ensured that 13 million people entered the working-age population each year during that time.\nIn 2014, a wave of support, especially from young Indians, propelled Modi to power. Their demand: Fix everything. The newly elected prime minister promised to overhaul India\u2019s economy, remake its creaking infrastructure, and clean up its pervasive corruption. But though the current government has made some changes, significant ones, its solutions to India\u2019s deep-rooted economic problems are the same as the last one\u2019s. Modi not only has continued the previous Congress Party\u2013led government\u2019s populist economic policies, but also has presided over two spectacular self-inflicted crises: a surprise demonetization program that the government said was designed to root out corruption"}

{"idx": "26434", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For 30 years, people from all over the world have traveled to Manhattan, Kansas to train with and tour the International Grains Program (IGP). Since its beginning, IGP has continued to increase its capacity to educate and train international buyers of Kansas commodities.\nThe Kansas Corn Commission has a long-standing partnership with IGP and supports the program's mission of marketing and promoting export markets for corn and other feed grains. IGP and the K-State Department of Grain Science act as ambassadors for Kansas commodities and serve as a primary source of expertise when it comes to the use of Kansas feed ingredients. Through its short courses and technical overseas assistance, IGP offers education on topics ranging from grain purchasing, transportation storage and handling to milling, marketing and processing. For example, next month IGP will offer an annual grain purchasing short course for international grain buyers from four countries. In addition, a short course on advanced risk management and merchandising will be held in May in conjunction with NCI of Fargo, ND. \"Foreign market development is an important part of the corn commission's program,\" according to Kansas Corn Commission Chairman Mike Brzon, Courtland. \"IGP is considered to be a valuable resource to grain buyers throughout the world and we are lucky to have the program operating in our state. We've also had opportunities to host IGP classes on our Kansas farms, giving international buyers an understanding of the quality of grain we produce in the U.S.\" Jay O'Neil, senior agricultural economist at IGP, said the first question many people have is about the purpose and mission of the program. Due to its location in Manhattan and affiliation with KansasStateUniversity, IGP is often assumed as a program for undergraduate education. However, this is not the case. Though there is an interest in working with and teaching young people about the global grains industry, IGP's primary focus and efforts are centered on the promotion of Kansas commodities with foreign buyers. \"Our entire purpose and focus is to promote and educate foreign buyers on the use of Kansas and U.S. corn, wheat, soybeans and related products,\" O'Neil said. \"We provide innovative and relevant technical programs to encourage market preference, consumption and utilization of corn for the benefit of Kansas corn producers.\" Although IGP may not be a household name, the program enjoys global recognition among flour millers, feed manufacturers, grain buyers and governmental buying entities. This year IGP will conduct more than 25 short courses and customized training sessions to help familiarize international customers with U.S. corn and to promote its quality characteristics and best uses. O'Neil said IGP activities also include education on risk management and price control. In addition, IGP also works with trade teams and visitors and facilitates overseas technical assistance. \"Training is a part of the promotional element of marketing U.S. grains,\" he said. \"A foreign buyer may not understand the U.S. grading and quality system or how best to utilize corn or feed ingredients. Having that familiarity and knowledge gives them power and motivation to buy our products to use in the best way.

Nearly every district in B.C. has dealt with the situation by doing something no one ever likes doing \u2013 closing schools and consolidating kids. In the past 15 years, 300 schools around the province have been padlocked for good, in almost every instance because of reduced numbers.\nA sample: Victoria has locked the doors on nine; the Kootenays, 12; Prince Rupert, five; Coquitlam, 10; Cariboo-Chilcotin, 11; Richmond, six; Quesnel, five. It goes on. It's difficult to find a district anywhere that hasn't confronted the enrolment crisis by combining students in fewer buildings, saving millions in operating costs in the process. There has, however, been one glaring exception: Vancouver. Despite a registration plunge of 6,500 students (the population of Kimberley) since 2001, the district has only boarded up one small annex to an elementary school.\nRather than make the hard decisions other districts have, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) has chosen instead to whine about underfunding.\nNow because of years of inaction, they have been forced into a cash corner and have announced a list of 10 elementary schools and two high schools that could be closed. I suspect the board is hoping that the howls of protest will be so great that the provincial government, less than a year away from an election, will back off and cough up the money to keep the schools open.\nThe issue here is a very simple one. The VSB seems to believe it should be treated differently than other districts. One can only surmise this is because Vancouver is special, that its students and parents shouldn't be inconvenienced in the same way others around the province have been.\nThink about this. To deal with funding issues it has faced, Prince George has closed 21 schools in 15 years \u2013 21. And it's a much, much smaller city than Vancouver.\nThe Vancouver board is facing a $24.38-million budget shortfall. An audit by Ernst & Young last year identified $37-million in savings by closing as many as 19 schools to address the more than 10,000 empty seats that currently exist. The board has been aware of gains that could be made by merging students for some time but it chose to do nothing.\nFor the past eight years, the VSB has been controlled by Vision Vancouver politicians that have chosen to go to war with a provincial government they despise rather than behave like adults responsible for making the kind of unpopular decisions that go with the job. Instead, all we get are the same tiresome polemics about underfunding, a tedious and misinformed trope if there ever was one.\nEducation funding has increased more than $1-billion since 2001, despite a precipitous fall in enrolment numbers. The total operating grant for Vancouver has risen 23 per cent over that period, to $439-million from $365-million. Of course, there could always be more funding for education. But the fact is, the public doesn't want to pay additional taxes to finance the wish list of groups like the VSB. Instead, the provincial government has to make difficult decisions. Decisions, I"}

Here's what you need to know about these hackers.\nThe Lizard Squad began showing up more on the online hacking radar this year, largely by attacking gaming networks. This wasn't the first time the group targeted Sony and Microsoft's gaming networks. It claimed to have hit the PlayStation network in August and Xbox in early December, as well as several others such as RiotGames' League of Legends and Blizzard's Battle.net.\nApparently in conjunction with those hacks, the group pulled off some fairly serious pranks. In August, while Lizard Squad was hacking the PlayStation network, the Twitter account associated with the group tweeted out a bomb scare, forcing an American Airlines flight to make an emergency landing. On board was Sony Online Entertainment President John Smedley. The incident put Lizard Squad squarely in the sights of the FBI, several news organizations have reported.\nAround the same time, that Twitter account (which has since been suspended) also claimed to have \"planted the ISIS flag\" on Sony's servers.\nTweeting a bomb threat is a pretty serious federal crime. But for the most part, Lizard Squad's tactics have amounted to pranks rather than public safety threats. Most hacking analysts doubt the group has anything to do with ISIS.\nLizard Squad\u2019s apparent weapon of choice is Distributed Denial of Service attacks, or DDoS attacks, which overwhelm servers with massive amounts of fake traffic, rendering them inoperable.\nBut as the bomb scare and ISIS flag incidents show, the group appears to have greater ambitions than just carrying out a bunch of DDoS hacks. But as with everything in the hacking world, it's hard to know whether Lizard Squad is responsible for these hijinks or whether they are just taking credit for the work of others.\nSo why are they doing this?\nAs with many hacking organizations, Lizard Squad\u2019s motivations are often described as \u201cfor the lulz\u201d \u2014 hacker-speak for \u201cbecause it\u2019s fun, or funny.\u201d Over time, its strategy has evolved a little. The group now targets gaming companies, specifically to expose lax security practices, members claimed in an apparent interview with tech news site WinBeta. By disrupting networks like Xbox Live, its members say, they force companies to improve user protections.\nBut there is also evidence of pure self interest: Lizard Squad agreed to withdraw their Christmas Day attack on gaming systems in exchange for an offer of lifetime accounts to the online encrypted file hosting service Mega which was created by founder Kim DotCom, according to reports.\nAnother group, calling itself \u201cFinest Squad\u201d claims to be playing interference, DDoS-ing Lizard Squad servers in an attempt help the gaming networks return to normal service. The group has also posted a site featuring alleged information on the digital footprint and identities of Lizard Squad members.\nOK, when can I get back to playing my XBox?\nOn Christmas morning, Microsoft and Sony customers began reporting connection issues as many with new Xboxes and PlayStations struggled to get online. That trouble continued on Friday morning.\nBoth companies acknowledged the disruption in service, but did not confirm whether the outages were the result of an outside attack.\nOur engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today.

The brain is protected by a membrane called the blood-brain barrier that protects it and the central nervous system.\nOne emerging area, immunotherapy, includes therapies that prod the body\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor. This type of therapy has been used to fight other types of cancer, and researchers are testing whether it would work in the brain.\nA type of immunotherapy is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells that are genetically engineered to attack glioblastoma. Duarte, Calif.-based City of Hope last December reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that doctors used this therapy on a 50-year-old man with glioblastoma.\nThe man's brain cancer had returned six months after being halted by an initial round of surgery, radiation and the chemotherapy drug temozolomide.\n\"When he came to us, he had many tumors on his brain,\" said Behnam Badie, City of Hope's chief of neurosurgery and director of its brain tumor program. \"Survivability was really, really dim. You are talking weeks.\"\nDoctors injected genetically engineered CAR T-cells into the patient's brain, and his tumors regressed for nearly eight months. However, tumors later spread and the patient died this spring.\nCity of Hope, which is affiliated with the Phoenix-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, or TGen, has enrolled about 20 patients in the study, Badie said.\n\"It's not curative,\" Badie said. But, he added, \"We are definitely seeing changes in the biology and extending lives.\"\nOther approaches that have received widespread attention include Duke University's \"poliovirus\" study that uses a modified version of the polio virus"}

A Nazi soldier picked them up, slammed them against the truck until they bled, picked them up, threw them back on the truck, and sent the truck on its way.\nThat was the day, this woman said, that she stopped praying to God.\nWas this woman justified in her decision? Is it not fair to ask how a loving, all-powerful God could allow such horrific suffering?\nHow could this be God\u2019s world?\nThink of the billions whose lives have been tragically cut short by war, violence, disease epidemics, starvation and malnutrition. Think of the billions who have lived unfulfilled, unhappy lives. How could God allow such things to go on? Why doesn\u2019t He put a stop to it?\nOf all fields of human knowledge, religion should best be able to answer such difficult questions. But when we examine the answers religion offers, we are left even more confused.\nConsider: Most religion teaches that this is God\u2019s world!\nReligion tells us that God is trying to convert the world today. What else would motivate the efforts of missionaries and evangelists? Religious youth movements and church drives? Crusades, inquisitions and \u201choly\u201d wars\u2014past and present? The zeal to gain converts for God would all but disappear if not for the idea that heaven comes only to those who profess a particular religion or belief before they die.\nBut think of the billions, over the past 6,000 years, who have lived and died never knowing Christ. If God is trying to save the world now, He must be failing miserably. How could a just God allow so many to fall by the wayside, never having a chance for salvation? Yet, that is what mainstream Christianity would have you believe\u2014that the billions who have died not knowing Christ will never have a chance for salvation.\nIf God is struggling against Satan to save this world now, these many verses reveal God to be losing the battle. Is that what is happening today?\nTo get real answers to these questions, we must set aside preconceived ideas and prejudices. We must put on hold any ideas we have invented.\nWe must let God speak for Himself!\nGod has not left us without answers.

When Vinny Zaleski \u2014 played by Jesse Eisenberg, doing his trademark neurotic shtick \u2014 and his balding, bespectacled computer-whiz cousin, Anton (Alexander Skarsgard, geeked out to the point of unrecognizability), start bandying about terms like \u201cneutrino messaging\u201d and \u201cpulse-shaping microwave towers\u201d in their pursuit of a better way to game the New York Stock Exchange, it will sound, to most listeners, just as comprehensible as any conversation on the bridge of the starship Enterprise.\nBut the fact that Vinny and Anton plan to make a killing in a way that\u2019s been done before, by building a fiber-optic tunnel hundreds of miles long \u2014 thereby shaving off one millisecond in the speed of electronic transactions on the exchange \u2014 grounds the story in a world that feels real-ish, even though the larger-than-life characters that populate it are entirely fictional.\nIt\u2019s a world of ones and zeros in which the battle lines are starkly drawn. On the one side are the Zaleskis, who simultaneously quit their Wall Street day jobs to build that tunnel, courtesy of a rich venture capitalist (Frank Schorpion). On the other side is the cousins\u2019 old boss, Eva Torres (Salma Hayek, in a fun, scenery-chewing turn as an entrepreneur who acts as if she owns her employees). Vinny at one point characterizes the conflict between the two sides as a clash between a modern-day David and Goliath, and in some ways it is.\nMuch of the film revolves around the minutiae of the Zaleskis\u2019 enterprise: negotiating land rights; troubleshooting drilling headaches; and coding, coding, coding (with Anton furiously crunching the numbers in an effort to figure out a way to find that one millisecond). This part of the story is about as interesting as you might expect: watching someone at a computer screen, someone in a hard hat and muddy boots, and someone else arguing with an Amish farmer who doesn\u2019t want a high-speed cable laid under his land. It\u2019s mildly dramatic, but also a little bit drab.\nMore interesting is the question of why Vinny and Anton are doing this in the first place, despite their terrible odds of success. Vinny, at times, seems less motivated by the love of money than by his love for Anton, a kind of childlike savant who dreams of a house in the country with hummingbirds in the yard. (The title also refers to the speed at which a hummingbird beats its wings.) At other times, Vinny seems driven by his hatred of Eva, which isn\u2019t really supported by anything else in the story.\nIn the end, the most intriguing thing about \u201cThe Hummingbird Project\u201d \u2014 and it isn\u2019t all that intriguing, considering how much of it is about cash, not character \u2014 is the realization that the movie isn\u2019t a David-vs.-Goliath tale after all, but one about two Goliaths.\nR.\u2009At area theaters.

Trump has criticized the Iran deal as weakand counterproductive to U.S. interests.\nHe and his advisers have argued that world leaders need to force Iran back to the table and press the country's leadership to end their ballistic missile program and their support for terrorism around the globe.\nBut some say the Trump administration's hard line \u2013 and its unwillingness to compromise on the nuclear deal \u2013 has alienated allies who otherwise agree that those Iranian activities pose a threat.\n\"I think the world is really concerned about the Iran issue and is trying to find ways to maybe shape U.S. behavior,\" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank.\nBrian Hook, the administration\u2019s special representative on Iran, rejected the idea that the U.S. had isolated itself from Europe and other allies by pursuing tough economic pressure on Iran. Hook said the U.S. and the European Union agree on the threat posed by Iran, if not the approach on how to address it.\nHook noted that the sanctions pressure the U.S. has applied so far has been targeted at the private sector, and he said that most companies have made a business decision that they\u2019d rather stop doing business with Iran than risk losing access to the U.S. market.\nBut after two days of meetings here, it was unclear whether the U.S. had made any progress in convincing the other five countries that negotiated the agreement with Iran, despite the aggressive rhetoric and several one-on-one meetings between the president and the leaders of Europe.\nWhite House aides said the Iran nuclear agreement had come up in most of those private meetings, but neither senior officials in the administration nor Trump pointed to specific progress.

Moreover, experiments with lab-grown cancer cells cannot precisely predict a drug's cell-killing ability since they do not accurately mimic the complex tumor environment within a human body.\nTo improve predictions of the cancer cell-killing ability of chemotherapy, Eleni Kolokotroni of the Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical University of Athens, Greece, and colleagues built a model that simulates the growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. They focused on tumors that can be removed by surgery; doctors often use combinations of chemotherapy drugs to shrink these tumors before removing them.\nThe new model incorporates a variety of existing knowledge on how NSCLC tumor cells proliferate in the body and how different drugs affect their growth. Given information about a patient's specific tumor, such as histological type, cancer stage and proliferation index, the model can estimate the cell-killing ability of different combinations of chemotherapy drugs.\nThe researchers applied the model to data from 12 NSCLC patients who received chemotherapy before tumor-removal surgery. For most patients, the model successfully predicted the observed amount of tumor shrinkage after chemotherapy treatment.\nWith further research, the new model could help reveal links between cell kill rates and specific tumor characteristics, such as genetic mutations, according to study co-author and team leader Georgios Stamatakos. This could ultimately help doctors select the best treatment options for other patients with similar tumor features.\nArticle: In Silico Oncology: Quantification of the In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy of Cisplatin-Based Doublet Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) through a Multiscale Mechanistic Model, Kolokotroni E, Dionysiou D, Veith C, Kim YJ, Sabczynski J, Franz A, Grgic A, Palm J, Bohle R and Stamatakos G, PLOS Computational Biology, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005093, published 22 September 2016.\nBiology, PLOS Computational. \"Cancer growth model simulates cell-killing ability of combos.\" Medical News Today.

That's a crucial debate but not the only one; there's also a need for a cool strategic assessment; who is winning, who is losing?\nHillel Frisch argues that Hamas (which he calls \"a small isolated movement that controls a small strip\") has \"grossly miscalculated\" by antagonizing the Egyptian government and making war on Israel. He concludes Hamas has embarked on \"strategic suicide.\"\nPerhaps, but scenarios exist in which Hamas gains. Khaled Abu Toameh notes the powerful and growing support for Hamas around the Middle East. Caroline Glick offers two ways for Hamas to win: a return to the status quo ante, with Hamas still in charge of Gaza, or a ceasefire agreement whereby foreign powers form an international monitoring regime to oversee Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt.\nAs this suggests, an assessment of Hamas' war record depends primarily on decisions made in Jerusalem. Those decisions being the real issue, how well has Israel's leadership performed?\nDisastrously. Jerusalem's profound strategic incompetence continues and heightens the failed policies since 1993 that have eroded Israel's reputation, strategic advantage, and security. Four main reasons lead me to this negative conclusion.\nFirst, the team in charge in Jerusalem created the Gaza problem. Its leader, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert immortally explained in 2005 the forthcoming unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza: \"We [Israelis] are tired of fighting, we are tired of being courageous, we are tired of winning, we are tired of defeating our enemies.\"\nOlmert had a vital role in (1) initiating the Gaza withdrawal, which ended the Israel Defense Forces' close control of the territory, and (2) giving up Israeli control over the Gaza-Egypt border. This latter, little noted decision, enabled Hamas to build tunnels to Egypt, smuggle in mat\u00e9riel, and launch missiles into Israel.\nSecondly, Olmert and his colleagues failed to respond to the barrage of rockets and mortar shells. From the Israeli withdrawal in 2005 until now, Hamas has launched over 6,500 missiles into Israel. Incredibly, Israelis endured nearly eight attacks a day for three years; why? A responsible government would have responded to the first rocket as a casus belli and immediately responded.\nThirdly, a committee of the French parliament published an important technical report in mid-December, establishing that \"there is no longer doubt\" about the military purposes of the Iranian nuclear program, and that it will be up and running in 2-3 years.\nThe waning days of the Bush administration, with the current president nearly out the door and the president-elect yet in the wings, offers a unique moment to take care of business. Why did Olmert squander this opportunity to confront the relatively trivial danger Hamas presents rather than the existential threat of Iran's nuclear program? This negligence has potentially dire repercussions.\nFinally, from what one can discern of the Olmert government's goal in its war on Hamas, it seems to be to weaken Hamas and strengthen Fatah so that Mahmoud Abbas can re-take control of Gaza and re-start diplomacy with Israel. Michael B. Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi captured this idea in a recent article title: \"Palestinians need Israel"}

Its recent deal with IBM to get iPads into the corporate world is suited to the iPad Air 2 and iPhone 6 Plus far more than the iPad mini 2 or 3. Smartphones are a natural fit in the enterprise, and if tablets are deployed to employees they would much more likely be larger than the little iPads.\nOf course, Apple is unpredictable and may do something unexpected with the iPad mini. Given so little attention to the refresh of the iPad mini 3, the lack of stage time at the iPad press event, and the high price for such a little change, it seems the iPad mini has become a secondary product to the folks in Cupertino."}

He also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, while eliminating corporate loopholes. He would keep popular mortgage and charitable deductions for families making less than $500,000 a year, and would eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.\nWhat strikes us, however, is how much Perry seems to be taking his talking points on taxes from Herman Cain. Perry\u2019s plan is more nuanced than Cain\u2019s 999 plan, but like Cain, Perry is proposing to dramatically overhaul the current tax code and replace it with something simple \u2013 something that voters seem especially hungry to do, as evidenced by Cain\u2019s success.\n\u201cCentral to my plan is giving every American the option of throwing out the three million words of the current tax code, and the costs of complying with that code, in order to pay a 20 percent flat tax on their income.\nThe size of the current code, which is more than 72,000 pages, is represented by this pallet and its many reams of paper.\nThe reason that my plan \u2014 the reason that our plan is being attacked so much is because lobbyists, accountants, politicians, they don\u2019t want to throw out the current tax code and put in something that\u2019s simple and fair. They want to continue to be able to manipulate the American people with a 10-million-word mess. Let\u2019s throw out the 10-million-word mess and put in our plan, which will liberate the American workers and liberate American businesses.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need some mild fuel in this engine, we need some bold fuel.\nAnd I call it my 999 plan. Why?\nIt starts with \u2013 watch this, y\u2019all \u2013 throw out the current tax code! [THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, CHEERING] Get rid of it!\nThrow it out, because how many years, most of you all your life, have been complaining about the tax code. We know it\u2019s messed up.

Podesta is Catholic.\nThis is the second Catholic Church-related bombshell to emerge from the WikiLeaks documents in as many days. On Tuesday, emails by John Halpin, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, were released that mocked Rupert Murdoch for raising his children Catholic, and also said the Church had \"severely backwards\" views on gender relations.\nClinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri responded to that email saying that high-profile conservative Catholic converts probably only converted because the religion is \"socially acceptable.\" Catholic Vote and The Catholic League have both called on Palmieri to resign from the Clinton campaign.\nFirstly, any attempt to trigger a \"Catholic Spring\" would probably fall flat on its face, and this truly speaks of the arrogance of American progressive Catholics. The Church has not changed her teachings in 2,000 years, and it's going to take more than a small group of progressives to do that. Secondly, people convert to the Catholic Church for a multitude of reasons--not because it's somehow \"socially acceptable\" or because the practices are \"backwards.\" That's ridiculous."}

His ability to spread the floor \u2013 and take some of the heat off JJ Redick \u2013 is already paying dividends, Brown said. He has the ability to make the players around him better, and when those players are the likes of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, it makes the 76ers a uniquely intimidating team. Granted, the sample size is small. Harris entered Wednesday averaging 20.7 points and 7.8 rebounds. He scored 25 points with six rebounds and three assists to help lead a 126-111 victory over the Knicks.\nHarris, for his part, said the transition has gone well, and he\u2019s excited to see how far the 76ers can go with their increasingly formidable lineup.\nAnd sure, he said, it\u2019s kind of nice being so close to home after being gone for so long."}

One major inquiry is regarding the viewable impression: not whether it should be important, but whether it should be the currency of buying. Two intelligent gentlemen had a thorough discussion on it this week, so we don\u2019t need to rehash that. We also discussed it here six months ago.\nThe second element of the trend has to do with RTB and how all websites deal with that aspect of programmatic buying.\n1) Don\u2019t put anything with tangible value in an exchange in the hands of a professional salesperson.\n2) Define ROS for your offer as something of value other than what will go into an exchange (if you use your own private exchange or an external one).\n3) Keep your ideas and unique selling value (e.g., sponsorships, tie\u2013ins, research, exclusives, etc.) at the forefront of your sales team's offers to advertisers.\nIt\u2019s very important that publishers have very distinct buckets of inventory that advertisers will unequivocally understand when it comes time to sell. Know your value proposition -- or you\u2019ll be drinking Heinekens next to NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, wondering where all of your customers went.\nAmy says: Clearly this buyer does not see the value of ROS anymore. It almost seems like an archaic version of audience buying. \u201cThat\u2019s ROS\u201d is what we said in the Ice Age of digital advertising, which was about five years ago.\nBut what about those extra impressions? Most premium publishers claim that they don\u2019t release any inventory to DSPs. Some have their own ad networks that aggregate impressions across various content sites. I\u2019m not sure how much value exists in that type of inventory. It just seems like a mishmash without a strategic reason for being. Adding data targeting to the mix brings the impressions into the consideration set, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a price advantage with a premium publisher.\nWith viewable impressions and real-time-bidding converging, it may create a perfect storm to reset the display advertising economy. The excess inventory that runs through DSPs and RTB platforms is what needs to go away for viewable impression to prosper. That new scarcity in premium content may increase CPMs and make up for the revenue lost due to the removal of non-viewable impressions. And with fewer impressions going into the DSPs, there will be reduced abundance and potential CPM increases.\nIdeas and innovation are what publishers need to focus on. It takes a lot to get noticed, and what buyers are looking for \u201cexclusives\u201d and \u201cnever been done before\u201d deals. Smartphone and tablet advertising challenges are going to quickly replace our desktop display issues, whether we solve them or not. The improvements we make now will ensure that websites will continue to be a mass platform -- and that the direct sales channel remain the best way to buy media."}

Ainsworth is affiliated with 600 Mile Challenge Fund, which led the investment. Also joining the board is Anthony Sun, M.D., MBA. He has extensive venture capital experience and board of director roles in multiple successful biotechnology companies.\nImmusoft founder and outgoing CEO, Matthew Scholz, says the interest from investors and Ainsworth bodes very well for the company he founded in 2009.\nPreviously, Ainsworth brought a gene therapy company, RetroSense Therapeutics, into human trials. Allergan bought RetroSense Therapeutics in 2016.\nAinsworth says he looks forward to leading Immusoft and helping give its modified cell therapy solutions the best chance possible of eventually treating patients.\nImmusoft has developed a methodology designed to use a patient\u2019s immune cells to treat disease. Its ISP technology reprograms B cells with the goal of treating diseases, including MPS I, a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease that is expected to be Immusoft\u2019s first clinical application.\nISP is an ex vivo cell culture system that uses a non-viral system to genetically modify B cells. ISP has its origins in a B cell culture system invented by Nobel laureate David Baltimore, Ph.D., which Immusoft has extensively improved upon.\nImmusoft has worked with major medical and research center partners and received support from prominent investors including Peter Thiel through FF Science, an early stage investment vehicle of Founders Fund, Tim Draper, Technium Partners, and others. Breakout Labs, a Thiel founded and led initiative supported Immusoft with one of its first grants in 2012.

Patrushev said that China was an irritant for certain political forces in the US, but these same circles still had plans to break up Russia and get hold of the mineral resources of Siberia and Russian Far East. The Russian security official also said that the plans included capturing the Caspian region and transport corridors of Central Asia.\nThe head of the Security Council also answered questions about the internal situation in the country, saying that the growing political activity of the population demonstrated that free civil society was developing, and this is ultimately good for the people. He also said that certain political figures were unhappy with the fact that all recent protests in Russia were absolutely peaceful and thus offered no excuse to accuse the authorities of repressions against the political opposition.\n\u201cI would like those who are used to getting payment for their political services from abroad to understand the mood of the majority of Russian citizens, and to understand that their own attempts to destabilize the situation in Russia have no prospects.

Council seat currently occupied by well-respected five-year incumbent Anita Bonds.\nThe 28-year-old is a first time Council candidate and an executive at development company Four Points, where he works on acquisition, valuing and underwriting purchases for apartments and condos in Washington D.C., New York, Carolina and beyond.\nThe Washingtonian prides himself on knowing his hometown\u2019s neighborhoods inside out.\nAfter having focused on urban studies at the University of Pennsylvania and real estate at Harvard, Goodwin worked in investment banking in New York before returning to D.C.; and with that finance knowledge, he is proving highly adept at fundraising for his Council seat run, aiming for $100,000 in funds by the end of January, which eclipses those of the other candidates. Goodwin says he has raised funds through that good old real estate staple \u2014 yard signs.\nGoodwin name some influential D.C. Realtors in his sphere, starting with his own personal agent, Boucie Addison of Washington Fine Properties, who has contributed to his campaign fund. The political aspirant also moves in the same circles as Keller Williams D.C. powerhouse Bo Menkiti of the Menkiti Group; and David Cox of the Cox & Cox Group at Keller Williams Capital Properties is a neighbor and supporter of the issues Goodwin will be campaigning on.\nGoodwin also belongs to a networking group of ambitious, young African American real estate professionals under 40 called The Young Real Estate Council.\nAddison is not surprised by Goodwin\u2019s political ambitions. Her son and Goodwin have been friends for years, and when he was in seventh grade he had \u201cmore people in his Rolodex\u201d than she had from all her years in real estate.\n\u201cI am extraordinarily proud of Marcus and what he has accomplished,\u201d said the agent of 40 years. \u201cHe would be a great asset on the Council. He works really hard, he is not just a one-issue person, he is very passionate about different things,\u201d she said.\nGoodwin\u2019s platform is highly influenced by his grasp of real estate issues and his background as the fifth of eight children. If elected, one of his big focuses will be to push for more renters to become homeowners. Having purchased a home in Sixteenth Street Heights a couple years ago, homeownership has been a revelation for him.\n\u201cBuying a home has been the \u201cbiggest marker of my maturity and growth,\u201d he said. And he would like to buy more homes to create generational wealth.\nGoodwin has accumulated student debt, but that didn\u2019t stop him from investing in a home, and he plans to promote homeownership and financial support to more young professionals. He would also like to see a high school curriculum that promotes financial literacy.\nAnother concern of Goodwin\u2019s is gentrification, which he believes should be faced head on. Gentrification gets a bad rap sometimes, but it creates opportunities and jobs in communities that lacked them, and it enriches people in the process, he says.\nAs the son of an elementary school teacher, Goodwin sees a strong need for affordable housing for service providers in new housing developments.\n\u201cIt matters to live and work in communities you serve,\u201d he said. Around 55 percent of people who work in the D.C. district aren\u2019t residents there.\nOne of the downsides of affordable housing units is the government-calculated cap on price.

You usually save a ton of money, but it\u2019s at the expense of functionality or looks. There might be a dent in the case or just some general wear and tear, but you can buy it at a discount compared to the price tag of a brand-new one.\nThere are different levels of \u201cused\u201d though. There\u2019s the traditional meaning of the word \u201cused\u201d in which an owner sells a product that he/she has been using for a certain amount of time, and then there\u2019s \u201crefurbished\u201d, which is when a company takes broken products of theirs and fixes them up to achieve a status that\u2019s close to being new.\nApple has its own online refurbished store where it sells Macs, iPads, iPods, etc. that were once returned by customers in the past because they were at one point defective. However, the company fixes them up and puts a new coat of paint on them before re-selling them at a discounted price.\nArguably, Apple offers some of the best refurbished products around. Most of the Apple products that I\u2019ve bought over the years have been refurbished, including gifts to other people for Christmas or their birthday, and guess what? They never know the difference between refurbished and brand new.\nThat\u2019s because when Apple receives a defective item, they fix what\u2019s wrong with it, and then replace the battery with a brand new one, as well as replace the entire aluminum shell with a brand new one. This means that you\u2019re pretty much getting a brand-new product from Apple at a decent discount. Granted, the hardware at one point was defective in some way, but Apple fixes that, so you\u2019re left with a fully functional, good-as-new device.\nMy first Mac was a 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro that I bought from Apple\u2019s online refurbished store, and it was also my first Apple refurbished product ever. It was around $200 off from what a brand-new model would cost me, and since I had never bought refurbished before, I was expecting to open up the box and see a slightly banged-up MacBook Pro, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\nI opened it up and was convinced it was a brand new model that Apple mistakingly shipped me. However, I noticed that it didn\u2019t come in a shiny new box wound in shrink-wrap. While the MacBook itself was in pristine condition, the company sends you the barebones when it comes to packaging, so I wasn\u2019t able to experience the art form that I\u2019ve heard many Apple product owners drool over.\nIn the end, I saved $200 by opting for mediocre packaging, which is totally okay with me, but you also need to have patience when buying refurbished, because it takes a few months for newly-released Apple products to show up in the refurbished store, and even then, different models come and go, so there are times where you\u2019ll be waiting for a specific model to become available. Patience is definitely a good virtue to have when you want to save money.\nPreach! Apple\u2019s refurb experience is the benchmark for purchasing pre-owned consumer electronics. They even give you the same 1 year warranty on parts."}

And our team here in Silicon Valley got two of those devices the P20, the P20 Pro and boy, they are amazing entering smartphones and I mean they are actually so good that we think that they are the best of 2018 better than the Galaxy S9. In terms of camera, they have three cameras instead of two, a better battery life and even they have a better AI performance. I mean I think Huawei did a great job with that. The launch was in Paris were you at the launch there?\nEL: I was invited but I was not able to attend I went to Rome instead, for the launch of Qwant and Qwant Junior but I have seen the product.

Other elements could include more parking for McCormick Place, restaurants and other businesses.\nThis bold but risk-laden project would be in addition to the planned 600-room expansion of the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, an 800-room property owned by the authority, which is known as McPier. The agency is expected to request development proposals for the Hyatt expansion shortly, with a contract likely to be awarded late this year or early next.\n\"Our big customers want big blocks of hotel rooms, some of which need to be at the convention facility,\" Tetzlaff said after ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the West Building.

No one has ever seen anything like it: the ridiculous smears, the nightly barrage of television \u201ccomedy,\u201d over-the-top attacks by former government officials like John Brennan and James Comey, endless investigations into nothing in particular, calls for impeachment (grounds? who needs grounds?), absurd accusations of \u201ctreason,\u201d and so on. It is unprecedented in American history, and maybe voters are starting to think the Democrats have gone too far.\nNo doubt the Democrats\u2019 constant attacks, amplified every day by the press, have an effect. But at a minimum, diminishing returns seem to have set in. Today\u2019s Rasmussen survey, the only daily presidential approval poll now functioning and the only one, to my knowledge, that currently surveys likely voters, finds President Trump with 50% approval and 49% disapproval. His approval numbers this far in 2018 are essentially identical to President Obama\u2019s ratings at the same point in his administration, notwithstanding Obama\u2019s fawning press coverage.\nEqually interesting is that Trump\u2019s \u201cApproval Index\u201d is narrowing. Rasmussen\u2019s Approval Index, which we wrote about a number of times during the Obama administration, is the difference between the number who strongly approve of the president\u2019s performance, and the number that strongly disapprove. Obama\u2019s Approval Index was often very low, -20 or worse.\nPresident Trump\u2019s Approval Index has been dismal at times, too. Currently, however, Trump\u2019s Approval Index stands at -6, and improving.\nThe number of voters who strongly approve of the president is rising, while the number who strongly disapprove is falling. This seems paradoxical in light of the insane hatred that is unleashed against President Trump on a daily basis. I suspect that part of the explanation, at least, is that some voters have figured out that the Democrats are crazed and are reacting negatively to their extreme tactics."}

Leading supermarkets warned this week that a no-deal Brexit could leave shelves empty because they can\u2019t stockpile fresh food.\nBut this would presumably be a temporary issue. The fruit and veg study, led by Christopher Millett of Imperial College London, is about the long-term impact of Brexit and how it will affect diets.\nThe UK imported 84 per cent of its fruit and 43 per cent of vegetables in 2017. This high reliance on imports will lead to price hikes in all five scenarios the team considered, from a free trade agreement with the EU to a no-deal Brexit.\nRecords of purchases show people buy less fruit and vegetables when they cost more. The team used this data to forecast the effect of the price rises on consumption, and therefore on health. Higher prices will lead to between 3000 and 12,000 extra deaths between 2021 and 2030 under a free trade deal, and 7000 to 23,000 deaths if there\u2019s no deal, the study concludes.\n\u201cThis is a look at an important but narrow part of how Brexit will impact the British people,\u201d says Millett.\nThe team focused on fruit and vegetables because they are most important in terms of health, he says. Is it possible that Brexit will change people\u2019s diets in other ways, such as eating less Danish bacon, that will be good for us? Maybe, but since the team did not attempt to model the overall changes to diet, we just don\u2019t know.\nThe team\u2019s warning has been greeted with scepticism by some Brexit supporters, with suggestions that people could simply grow their own fruit and vegetables as the British people supposedly did in the second world war.\nSuch comparisons ignore the fact that rationing was widespread during the war, and that the UK government at the time spent several years preparing the population for a limited diet \u2013 something the current government has not done \u2013 but they touch on a valid question: won\u2019t farmers in the UK grow more fruit and vegetables to take advantage of higher prices, limiting any prices rises?\nPerhaps, but Millett points out that many popular fruits like bananas cannot be grown commercially in the UK. The team did look at the effect of a 2 per cent increase in local produce each year. It made little difference to prices \u2013 and it is unlikely this could achieved, says Millett.\nOne reason is that the UK currently relies on 80,000 seasonal workers, mostly from the EU, to pick its fruit and vegetables. Prices won\u2019t come down if farmers can\u2019t hire enough workers or have to pay them more.\nWhat\u2019s more, most UK farmers earn far more from subsidies than from selling their produce. Most of those subsidies come from the EU as part of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the UK plans to phase them out post-Brexit. That has led to warnings that many farms will go bankrupt, especially if farmers face more trade barriers as well. So food production in the UK could"}

{"idx": "26501", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The question: Is fanaticism always wrong?\nWords can be used as bridges to understanding or as barriers to prevent understanding. In the case of John Brown, who was hanged on 2 December, 1859, after violently attempting to end slavery by attacking a United States arsenal, words have often been used as barriers. By defining him as a \"fanatic,\" those with the power to label him were able to avoid discussing the morality and violence of slavery.\nThey charged Brown with murder, insurrection, and treason for leading his tiny \"army\" in the attack on the arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia: an attack he hoped would provide weapons for slaves, but which was defeated by the local militia and a force of 100 US marines commanded by Robert E Lee, an aristocrat and future commander of the pro-slavery confederate army.\nAt the time, slavery was the most powerful political and economic force in the United States. Eleven of the first 16 US presidents were slaveowners, as were a majority of other US leaders. When 19-year-old George Washington was commissioned a major in the Virginia militia, one of his duties was to search slaves for hidden weapons they could use to fight for freedom. The laws Washington helped enforce included one that said \"any slave caught off his master's plantation without a pass after dark shall be dismembered.\"\nThe fugitive slave law was passed while Washington was president, and made it a crime to harbour any man, woman, or child seeking freedom from slavery. Though the actions of Washington, both as an officer and as president of the United States, and the actions of those responsible for passing the fugitive slave law could have been called \"fanaticism\", there is no record that anyone used that word. In fact, most white Americans seemed to approve of such actions, or kept silent about them and reserved the words \"fanatic\" and \"fanaticism\" for John Brown and others opposed to slavery.\nHistorians have described Washington and other presidents who supported slavery as \"founding fathers.\" Yet John Brown who fought to end slavery is called a \"fanatic\". Why?\nI think the answer is this: the way people see the world and the words they use to describe their feelings about what they see \u2013 especially if their economic and political interests are threatened \u2013 largely depends on the perceptual filter they use. And that filter is formed, for most of us, by what we're taught about ourselves and the society we live in. People want to believe they're good and that the society they live in is good, even if it practices and condones slavery. And especially if the racism stemming from that slavery continues in the present.\nUsing the words \"fanatic\" and \"fanaticism\" to define John Brown means people don't have to confront the issues he raised. It means they would not have to admit that the US government was complicit in protecting slavery or that revered figures such as Washington were part of that complicity. Very few people in the US even know that Washington and other presidents were slaveowners or defended slavery. The vast majority seem to have what I would call \"intentional ignorance\" when it comes to history.\nFew know that US supreme court justice Roger Taney was a slaveowner and fanatically protected the economic and political interests of himself and other slaveowners. In 1857 he ruled that neither Dred Scott \u2013 who had sued to win his freedom through the courts \u2013 nor any other African American man, woman, or child could ever be a citizen of the US or have any rights \"which the white man was bound to respect.\" Four other members of the supreme court"}

These issues include products that aren't easily visible, ticketing issues, and out of stocks.\nAs late as the 1990s, grocery stores carried 7,000 items. Today, that number has ballooned to an average of 40,000. With that number of items, even if 99% of a supermarket is perfect, that leaves 400 potential problems for a store manager to deal with.\nIt's impossible to fix every one of those problems. By accurately projecting how much sales will increase after fixing an issue, CB4 helps store managers identify the exact SKUs in their stores that need the most attention and guides them on how to fix potential issues. Because the software requires no in-store hardware or external data sources, implementation and onboarding can be done in a few days.\nAFS was founded in 1940 by Donald P. Lloyd and 34 independent grocers determined to thrive in the face of stiff competition from national chains, low margins, and rising wholesale prices. During an era of consolidation, where regional chains and independents have been swallowed up by national chains, AFS grew to 400 strong. They did this by emphasizing exceptional, personal service and high-quality products.\n\"What really caught my attention was the ease of implementation,\" said Wade Judd, CIO of AFS. \"We were able to roll out some pretty sophisticated technology, train our store managers, and start reaping the benefits in weeks rather than months. It was one of the simplest implementations that our team has been involved with.\"\n\"The founding members of AFS were faced with a tough situation and responded by creating an innovative business model centered on cooperation and strength in numbers,\" said Yoni Benshaul, CEO of CB4. \"We're happy to join forces with them and continuing to build on their established foundation of customer-focused excellence.\"\nCB4 provides a patented software solution for brick and mortar retailers that improves customer experience and net new sales by up to 2% using simple sales data.

I'd gone there to play games and they had a player injured, Gary, who got fitter than expected..\n\"He was Paul's star player so I didn't get much time. His style of football would have suited me down to the ground but it wasn't meant to be.\"\nThree years on from that frustrating experience and two since arriving at Bramall Lane, Duffy is set to renew Cook's acquaintance when his Wigan Athletic side visit United on Saturday.\nThe match, which brings together two of the Championship's most attack-minded teams, provides Duffy with another opportunity to showcase the talents which, after harnessed by Chris Wilder, have seen him become a key figure in the hosts' push for the Premier League.\n\"There won't be anything personal going on,\" he continued.\n\"Gary was Paul's man and that was fair enough, so you'd expect him to go with him.\n\"I only worked under Paul for a short time but it was long enough to know how he likes to go about things; playing 4-2-3-1, playing through the lines and getting the ball into the 'Number 10' areas.\"\nCook was not the first manager to miss Duffy's potential. Lee Clark and Gary Rowett both used him sparingly during two difficult years with Birmingham City.\nBut, after signing him on a free transfer following his release from St Andrews, Wilder has made Duffy an integral part of a squad which lifted the League One title two seasons ago and challenged for the play-offs last term.\n\"They play a good brand of football, the like to pass it and you always have that momentum when you come up because everyone has that feelgood factor.\n\u201cWe did last time but now, hopefully, we've taken it on another stage.\n\"We know what they will bring but we will attack every game how we want to play. We won't change for nobody.\"\nUnited have prepared for the contest ranked third in the table, following Tuesday's draw with Stoke City.\nDespite the expensive array of talent at the Staffordshire club's disposal, Wilder's men dominated for long periods and took the lead through Leon Clarke.\nBut, after failing to press home their superiority, conceded a late equaliser.\nDuffy, speaking at the Steelphalt Academy on Thursday, admitted the fixture had revealed both United's strengths and areas where they must improve.\n\"The gaffer says \u2018the names on the back of the shirts aren\u2019t going to win games\u2019, it\u2019s the work you put in on the training ground,\" he said.\n\"It is a tough division, and you put on a run of good games and you can shoot up the table.\n\"It shows how far the team has come that we are disappointed with drawing with someone like Stoke, who have just come down (from the Premier League). They were jumping for joy, delighted with a point, but it felt like a loss for us.\n\"We were all disappointed, none more so than the manager, he sees the hard work that we have put in.\n\"He just wants us to get the rewards we deserve, it\u2019s about being more clinical in both boxes.\n\u201cIf we get that right, it will be a good season.\""}
{"idx": "26524", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What will happen to a living organism placed in a state of quantum superposition?\nSeptember 22, 2015, 3:24 p.m.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat was merely a thought experiment. But now it's going to be tested in real life for the first time.\nYou've probably heard of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, a famous thought experiment posited by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that suggested putting a cat in a suspended quantum state where it is simultaneously alive and dead. Schr\u00f6dinger merely meant it as a thought experiment \u2014 he didn't intend to toy with the life of a real, living cat. But now researchers want to test the idea by attempting to put a microbe in two places at once, reports The Guardian.\nWhen Schr\u00f6dinger first envisioned his experiment, he meant it in jest, believing that it highlighted an absurdity in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation was imagined as one way to try and understand the weird probabilistic nature of the quantum world. It essentially proposes that particles in a state of so-called \"quantum superposition\" do not get realized as being in one state or the other until they are observed or measured.\nSchr\u00f6dinger therefore proposed putting a cat in a box with a vial of poison that was triggered and released when a radioactive material decayed. Since the radioactive material had only a 50/50 chance of decaying over the course of the experiment, and since (according to the Copenhagen interpretation) the state of the radioactive material was not realized until the box was opened and observed, then the cat ought to be both alive and dead at the same time.\nThough it sounds crazy (as Schr\u00f6dinger intended), many quantum theorists still trust in the real superposition of the cat in the experiment. It really is both alive and dead, they believe. Now physicists have a chance to put it to the test.\nRather than using a cat, the scientists \u2014 led by Tongcang Li of Purdue University \u2014 plan to use a microbe.\n\"Although it has attracted enormous interest, no quantum superposition state of an organism has been realized. So we propose a straightforward approach to put a microbe into a superposition of two spatial states, that is, the microbe will be at two different positions at the same time,\" explained Li.\nPrevious research by scientists at the University of Colorado has shown how to place a tiny, vibrating aluminum membrane in a state of superposition. So Li and his team intend to duplicate that experiment but add a twist by placing a microbe on the surface of the membrane. This ought to tether the microbe to the suspended state of the membrane, essentially putting it in two places at once.\nTo take it a step further, the researchers also want to do a secondary experiment that would entangle the position of the microbe with the spin of an electron inside it. Other than twiddle with the hapless existence of the microbe, the experiment could lead to some major technological advancements, such as powerful quantum computers capable of solving multiple problems simultaneously.\nFor now though, scientists remain giddy at what they might discover. \"It is cool to put an organism in two different locations at the same time,\" declared Li.\n\"In many fairy tales, a fairy could be at two different locations or change locations instantly. This will be similar to that. Although it will be a microbe instead of a fairy,\" he added.\nWhat will happen to a living organism that is placed in a state of quantum superposition? We'"}

It accused the NDP of using tax dollars to micromanage the economy.\n\u201cRather than trying to pick winners and losers, the government should cease its harmful policies and let our industry prosper,\u201d the party said in a statement.\nNotley\u2019s plan is set against the backdrop of uncertainty over expanding pipeline access to get products to the B.C. coast and from there to foreign markets.\nLast week, B.C. Premier John Horgan backed down on a promise to restrict additional oil shipments from Alberta for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion while the province asks the courts for an opinion on whether it can protect its environment from potential spills.\nThe move caused Notley to lift a short-lived ban on B.C. wine. But Notley said she is still working with the federal government to make sure the Trans Mountain project, which has federal approval, goes forward."}

Not only does it help those who need it, but it also connects people and helps to build a support network and a community.\nWakefield Council has more than 1,700 volunteers who offer their time to support us and our services. This ranges from school governors, sports coaches and library volunteers to snow wardens and stewards at major events. We also have volunteers who arrange litter picks, do youth work and support vulnerable young people and adults.\nOne of our new projects is the Care Home Vanguard, a project aimed at tackling loneliness by joining up services for older people in supported living schemes and care homes. This is a pioneering project, which will see the council, health providers and the voluntary sector work together to help people live longer, healthier lives at home and within their own communities.\nWe also have developed great relationships with friends groups who we work with to look after our parks and green spaces. These groups play a huge role in their local community, planting trees and flowers, working with schools, organising events and protecting wildlife and the local ecology. We are also able to support friends groups to access external funding that we can then match from our own budget to deliver new play areas or improve park facilities.\nThere are more than 1,500 charities and community groups in our area so sadly I can\u2019t mention them all, but there is such a vast range of volunteering in this district. We have people improving the lives of older people, with tele-friending and day trips, helping those in need with food banks and offering friendship opportunities at various clubs.\nVolunteers also play a key role in our hospitals and hospices, befriending, gardening, running cafes and shops and supporting patients.\nBut, as well as knowing what a tremendous part volunteering plays in our community, the volunteers can really benefit from the experience too. You\u2019ll see the difference you\u2019re making, even with just an hour of your time. Maybe you\u2019ll gain some perspective on life and learn something new about the world or about yourself.\nSo to the thousands of volunteers already out there, I thank you for the huge part you play in making this district a great place to live, for caring for our people and our places.\nAnd to anyone who thinks they have the time, no matter how little, please think about joining our amazing volunteering community.

That'll keep him out of trouble.\" Those words, uttered by a neighbour's son to my mother in 1955, sparked a flame in me that has burned brightly ever since. Frank was a hiker, a clean living lad in his late teens. I was 13, in trouble with the law and set to appear at the juvenile court \u2013 again. My mother agreed to the expedition and the next Saturday saw me and Frank on the train, from Gorton, east Manchester, to Hayfield, a small Pennine village, nestling below the lower slopes of Kinder Scout.\nWe set off along Kinder Road, passing the quarry \u2013 a path I have trodden countless times since \u2013 and the first sight of Kinder, the \"dark peak\", has never failed to lift my spirits and imbue me with a sharp sense of freedom. That liberation, for me and all those who tramp the Peak District, came at a price. In 1932, five men were jailed for their part in the mass trespass of Kinder Scout, when about 500 men and women took to the hills in defiance of the law, which then decreed those hills and open moorland the sole province of the landed gentry, enabling them to shoot grouse for a few days each August.\nAs the men's spokesman, 21-year-old Benny Rothman was to say in his defence, at Derby Assizes: \"We ramblers, after a hard week's work, in smokey towns and cities, go out rambling for relaxation and fresh air. And we find the finest rambling country is closed to us \u2026 Our request, or demand, for access to all peaks and uncultivated moorland is nothing unreasonable.\" The jury, mostly county establishment, thought otherwise, and the five were jailed for between four and six months.\nBy all accounts, the protest was intended to be peaceful, but keepers, employed by the Duke of Devonshire and armed with sticks, confronted the marchers. The Guardian recorded: \"The protesters fought a brief but vigorous hand-to-hand struggle with a number of keepers specially enrolled for the occasion. This they won with ease, and then marched to Ashop Head, where they held a meeting before returning in triumph to Hayfield \u2026 There will be plenty of bruises carefully nursed in Gorton and other parts of Manchester tonight.\"\nThough the protest cost Rothman and his fellow marchers their liberty, their actions created a tide that could not be stemmed. Three weeks after the trespass, some 10,000 ramblers held a protest rally at nearby Castleton; the right-to-roam movement was on the march. What Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader of the Labour party, was later to describe as \"the most successful direct action in British history\" would lead, in 1951, to the creation of the first national park. Fittingly, it was the Peak District, described as the \"lungs of the industrial north\". In 2000, freedom-to-roam legislation was passed, finally making lawful what Rothman and his comrades marched for. Next week, a festival will celebrate the 80th anniversary of their derring-do.\nFrank, if by chance you are reading this, sadly, you were wrong; your kind intervention did not keep me \"out of trouble\" but it enriched my life beyond measure. Thanks."}
{"idx": "26528", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Artist: Georges de La Tour (1593-1652) was born in the Duchy of Lorraine, probably travelled to Italy and saw Lorraine conquered by France in 1630. By 1638-39, he was working in Paris as Peintre Ordinaire du Roi and had an apartment in the Louvre.\nHis paintings are luminous tableaux. In The Penitent Magdalene ( c1642-44), a woman with long, straight black hair sits by a table in the pale light of a slender flame burning in a glass. There are weighty tomes on the table, a cross, a scourge. She has taken a break from flagellating herself - though her shoulders and upper back are bared - and sits with her face in her hand and a skull on her lap, gazing into the light. The light catches her arm, the skull, her bare knee.\nIn his later career, De La Tour returned constantly to intense religious moments: St Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene (1649), The Newborn Child (c1648). What makes his paintings so entrancing is their light, comparable to that of other 17th-century painters, such as Vermeer and the young Vel\u00e1zquez, and its source, Caravaggio. His paintings are minimalist dramas in which the soul is bared by the light of a candle.\nSubject: The theme of card cheats was a favourite of \"genre\" painting - the scenes from everyday life popular in later 16th- and 17th-century art. Examples include Caravaggio's The Cardsharps (c1594), Valentin de Boulogne's The Cardsharps (c1615-18) and De La Tour's own earlier version of this composition, The Card Players (c1632).\nDistinguishing features: The woman with the long white face in the red headgear and brown dress, her necklace decorating a wide expanse of throat, looks suspiciously to the side and points a crooked finger at the man on the far left. She seems to be signalling to the servant, in an orange turban with a feather, to find out what he's up to.\nShe's right to be mistrustful. The cardsharp, who wears less expensive clothes than even the servant - he has no hat and wears a leather jerkin decorated with blue satin - is holding the ace of diamonds behind his back, ready to add it to the cards and win the gold coins on the table. Meanwhile, the well-dressed youth on the right sits dimly pondering his hand, displaying absolutely no awareness of what is going on.\nThere's a comic excess to it; his cheating is not hard to discover and it might be just deserts for the peacock followers of fashion he is playing with, whose flouncy headdresses make them seem to have less inside their heads than they wear outside. Yet this is more than an anecdote.\nIn his religious paintings, De La Tour isolates people in darkness, with a single candle - the light of revelation. In this painting, the light is blankly pervasive and brittle. The clothes seem too bright, the woman with the oval face overexposed. The brightness heightens the scene's glacial alienation. Communication between lady and maid is indirect; neither of the men make eye contact. All are alone: the stupid youth, the tough lady, the servant, the cheat.\nIn"}

Despite few challenges, the scholars are relishing their experiences. Daily Trust on Sunday reports.\nAdamu Aliyu Muhammed obtained his first and second degrees from Nigerian universities. Though an academic staff of the Taraba State University, he had never imagined he would someday study abroad due to its cost implication.\nHowever, with the intervention of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, he will soon complete his doctorate degree in Literature from the International University of Africa, Sudan, soon.\n\"I never thought of an opportunity to even catch a plane, let alone leave this country to study abroad, but thanks to TETFUND; we came out and we studied,\" the elated Muhammed said.\nHe is among 2, 000 scholars from several tertiary institutions in Nigeria, sponsored by TETFUND through its Academic Staff Training and Development Programmes. The scholars are in various countries around the world.\nThe academic training programme started in 2008 after the National Universities commission (NUC) formulated a policy that PhD would be the minimum teaching requirement in Nigerian universities.\nDuring a monitoring and inspection exercise by the TETFUND officials to Sudan, the Director, Research and Development, Malam Aliyu Na'Iya, said there were less than 15 per cent of PhD holders in all Nigerian universities when the policy was made.\nHe said TETFUND decided to open up and sponsor scholars to acquire their PhDs and meet the requirements, as part of efforts to ensure that Nigeria's tertiary institutions compete favourably with other world class institutions.\nHe said 95 scholars secured TETFUND scholarship to study in Sudan, while 63 have completed their programmes, 31 are still undergoing their studies, but one person died among them.\nAddressing the scholars studying at the International University of Africa, Sudan, Na'Iya said the annual exercise would ensure that the scholars are in tune with what the fund is doing and ensure that they are actually studying. He said TETFUND was reforming the programme due to the failure of some benefiting institutions to comply with laid down rules. He added that the fund would no longer allow scholars benefitting under its scholarship programme to attend any lowly ranked university in the world.\n\"Only universities that meet the World University Ranking of the Times Higher Education and are top on the league table of universities in a particular country would be approved for the purpose of TETFUND scholarship,\" he said. This, he added, would ensure that TETFUND scholars are trained in the best universities in the world.\nHe explained that the University of Ibadan was the only highly ranked Nigerian university in 2017 by Times Higher Education, so academicians may wish to go there instead of going to institutions that are not ranked or those ranked below standard.\nAnother scholar, Tijani Usman, commended the move by the agency to reform the scholarship programme.\n\"We are strongly impressed with the efforts of TETFUND in supplementing the efforts in our institutions.

Speaking at the Commonwealth Club of California, he chided Murphy Brown\u2014the fictional 40-something, divorced news anchor played by Candice Bergen on a CBS sitcom\u2014for her decision to have a child outside of marriage.\nQuayle\u2019s argument \u2014 that Brown was sending the wrong message, that single parenthood should not be encouraged \u2014 erupted into a major campaign controversy. And just a few weeks before the \u201992 vote, the show aired portions of his speech and had characters react to it.\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time for the vice president to expand his definition and recognize that, whether by choice or circumstance, families come in all shapes and sizes,\u201d Bergen\u2019s character said.\nTwenty years later, Quayle\u2019s words seem less controversial than prophetic. The number of single parents in America has increased dramatically: The proportion of children born outside marriage has risen from roughly 30 percent in 1992 to 41 percent in 2009. For women under age 30, more than half of babies are born out of wedlock. A lifestyle once associated with poverty has become mainstream. The only group of parents for whom marriage continues to be the norm is the college-educated.\nSome argue that these changes are benign. Many children who in the past would have had two married parents could have two cohabiting parents instead. Why should the lack of a legal or religious tie affect anyone\u2019s well-being?\nThere are three reasons to be concerned about this dramatic shift in family life.\nFirst, marriage is a commitment that cohabitation is not. Taking a vow before friends and family to support another person \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d signals a mutual sense of shared responsibility that cannot be lightly dismissed. Cohabitation is more fragile \u2014 cohabiting parents split up before their fifth anniversary at about twice the rate of married parents. Often, this is because the father moves on, leaving the mother not just with less support but with fewer marriage prospects. For her, marriage requires finding a partner willing to take responsibility for someone else\u2019s kids.\nSecond, a wealth of research strongly suggests that marriage is good for children. Those who live with their biological parents do better in school and are less likely to get pregnant or arrested. They have lower rates of suicide, achieve higher levels of education and earn more as adults. Meanwhile, children who spend time in single-parent families are more likely to misbehave, get sick, drop out of high school and be unemployed.\nIt isn\u2019t clear why children who live with their unmarried biological parents don\u2019t do as well as kids who live with married ones. Adults who marry may be different from those who cohabit, divorce or become unwed mothers. Although studies try to adjust for these differences, researchers can\u2019t measure all of them. People in stable marriages may have better relationship skills, for instance, or a greater philosophical or religious commitment to union that improves parenting. Still, raising children is a daunting responsibility. Two committed parents typically have more time and resources to do it well.\nThird, marriage brings economic benefits. It usually means two breadwinners, or one breadwinner and a full-time, stay-at-home parent with no significant child-care expenses. Unlike Murphy Brown \u2014 who always had the able Eldin by her side \u2014 most women do not have the flexibility afforded a presumably highly paid broadcast journalist.

It's all based on a computer vision process Intel calls RealSense. And it's happening right now.\nRealSense enables PCs and tablets to scan objects and people in three dimensions. In turn, users can put the image into a computer game or 3D-print a miniature model.\nMost investors have never heard of RealSense, but it's a key enabling technology and a potential breakout for Intel.\nIn fact, \"automated retailing,\" like what those vending kiosks will be a part of, is already a $42 billion market in the United States alone.\nThe RealSense project, which began in 2011 with just a crew of 25, now has 500 employees devoted to it. Some 25 types of tablets and PCs already ship embedded with RealSense.\nAnd Krzanich recently showed that he can deftly navigate the challenging PC market.

Chris Christie today continued to blame former aides for last year's controversial lane closures, saying what they did was \"inexplicably stupid.\"\n\"When things were first reported, I said: 'This can't possibly be true.' Because who would do something like that?\" the Republican governor told ABC News' Diane Sawyer in the first half of a two-part interview at his Morris County home.\nSawyer asked Christie if having staff members act under his nose without his knowledge made him feel clueless.\n\"Not clueless,\" he responded, \"but it certainly makes me feel taken advantage of. And also, more importantly, I feel like I let people down by not knowing. Sometimes, people do inexplicably stupid things.\"\nThe comments come hours after the law firm Christie hired to conduct an internal investigation into the bridge scandal released a report clearing the governor of any involvement. It places the blame largely on two former allies \u2014 Port Authority official David Wildstein and Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly.\nGov. Chris Christie talks to Diane Sawyer in an television interview today.\nChristie has long denied knowing about the plan to close local access lanes at the nation's busiest bridge last September in Fort Lee in an apparent case of political retribution, saying his aides went rogue.\nAsked if the findings of the review were \"whitewashed,\" Christie said no.\n\"The bottom line is: These people have their own personal and professional reputations,\" the governor said during the interview on \"World News with Diane Sawyer.\" \"Six of them are former federal prosecutors. They're not going to whitewash anything for me.\"\nIn one part of the report, Wildstein claims to have told Christie about the lane closings at a Sept. 11 memorial last year. The governor denied that.\n\"David was one of hundreds of people that I spoke to that day,\" Christie replied. \"I'll tell you what he didn't say: 'Hey, by the way, governor, I'm closing down some lanes on the George Washington Bridge to stick it to some mayor. Is that okay?' That I'd remember.\"\nSawyer asked Christie \u2014 who has a famously brash demeanor \u2014 if he felt he created a climate his aides acted in his image.\n\"I've spent a lot of time the last 11 weeks thinking about: 'What did I do, if anything, to contribute to this?,'\" the governor replied. \"And I don't believe that I did. But I'm certainly disappointed in myself that I wasn't able to pick up these traits in these people.\"\nHe also dismissed the idea that his staff may have closed the lanes to please him.\n\"I don't believe it was for me,\" Christie said.\nThe governor \u2014 considered a leading candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination for president \u2014 has seen his poll numbers drop significantly amid the controversy.

Well, around part of a block in Kabul, but still a novelty here.\nThe children waited patiently as they were assigned helmets, shoes and a skateboard. There weren't enough for everyone, so in some cases two or three children shared a board. They lined up, hopping with excitement, then marched to the gate of the compound.\nA half dozen police officers halted traffic as the children spilled onto the street. Some kids whizzed down the road, riding their skateboards the traditional way. Others, less confident sat or stood while their friends pushed them along. Laughter and whoops of joy accompanied the procession, as well as flags and a banner bearing the name Skateistan.\nThe organisation was started in 2007 by Australian Oliver Percovich and a few of his friends. They came to Afghanistan with three skateboards and were besieged by Afghan children who wanted to learn.\nFour years later, the success is obvious. There's an indoor skateboard park in Kabul where 400 children a week come to skate and attend classes like photography, filmmaking and puppetry. Percovich explained it's about helping the kids express themselves.\n\"Anything that can get a story out, that can develop voice for the children anything that can get the idea of what it's like to be a kid in Afghanistan in 2012 out to the rest of the world,\" he says.\nSkateistan's aims are to promote equality and trust, to use the sport as a vehicle for empowerment.\nThirteen-year old Zurhana Stanekzai says it's working for her.\n\"It\u2019s hard to be a girl in Afghanistan, most people think that girls should be in their homes, just cooking, working at home.

Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, is taking a well-deserved break. But his timing is ill-judged. He is missing a G7 meeting of finance ministers in Washington this weekend.\nMost Americans are lucky if they get a couple of days vacation a year and are amazed at the generous holidays Europeans allow themselves. Now one prominent European is not turning up in Washington for an important meeting because he is too busy relaxing with his family in southern Africa.\nPeer Steinbr\u00fcck, Germany's finance minister, has chosen a safari holiday in the former German colony of Namibia over attending a key meeting of finance ministers this weekend. Ever since SPIEGEL reported earlier this week that the minister was crying off the important meeting his political judgement has been coming in for question.\nWhen the finance ministers of the G7 leading industrial nations gather at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, Germany will be represented by Thomas Mirow, Steinbr\u00fcck's number two at the Finance Ministry. In any ordinary year the absence of the German finance minister would raise a few eyebrows, but Germany is currently president of both the European Union and the G8. It would seem that if there was ever a time that Berlin should be basking in the world's spotlight, then it's now.\nSteinbr\u00fcck has already landed in hot water over his holiday plans. In an interview in 2006 the minister gave the impression that he wanted Germans to forgo their precious vacations, when he asked them to tighten their belts. He told the magazine H\u00f6rzu, \"We may have to forget our holiday trips, in order to provide for the future.\" The only crunch was that Steinbr\u00fcck had just returned from a trip to the Baltic Sea.\nNow that he has gone somewhat further afield his spokesperson has tried to dampen down the controversy. \"There are more important things than G7 conferences, including family,\" he said. He added that Steinbr\u00fcck had arranged the trip with his wife and children some time ago.\nThe minister's commitment to his family is commendable, but his political judgement seems questionable and is coming in for harsh criticism at home. \"Such timetabling problems should not arise at a time when Germany holds both the G8 and the EU presidencies,\" Michael Meister of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) told the German newspaper Die Welt.\n\"The government claims to attach a great deal of importance to the two presidencies,\" Green Party finance expert Christine Scheel told the paper. \"One should therefore expect that a minister turn up to the meetings.\" Bavaria's economics minister, Erwin Huber, of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), has warned that his absence could damage Germany's reputation and called on Steinbr\u00fcck to cut short his holiday and attend the meeting.\nSteinbr\u00fcck's attitude has also brought him criticism from within his own party, the Social Democrats (SPD). Klaus-Peter Schmidt-Deguelle, the former state secretary under Hans Eichel -- Steinbr\u00fcck's predecessor at the finance ministry -- told the financial daily Handelsblatt that his behavior was \"unacceptable\" and said that Eichel would never have missed an IMF meeting.\nSteinbr\u00fcck is already unpopular with the left-wing inside his party for his strict fiscal policy and his concentration on reigning in the"}

The day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, an estimated 3.5 million people in cities around the US and the world took part in the Women's March protesting the Trump agenda in what may well have been the largest single-day protest in US history. The march was a powerful moment that started with a single Facebook post and grew from there. Then Monday came, and the Trump Administration went about its work as planned.\nIn 2011, one email started \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d addressing the issue of inequality and corruption by corporations. Within weeks, it became a movement with organised sit-ins and sleep-ins in cities around the US. But when the camps came down, \u201cOccupy\u201d had little to show for its agenda. No US policy has changed. Inequality has not gone down.\nThe contradiction with the 21st century protests is that we can easily assemble a million people with digital technology but they don't necessarily have the same impact a similar action might have 50 years ago, \u201cbecause that was a result of a lengthy process of organising,\u201d according to Professor Zeynep Tufekci who teaches at the School of Information at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and is the author of the book, Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest, published in 2017.\nIn 1963, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, attended by a quarter of a million people\u2014Professor Tufekci points out\u2014was the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement built over the previous 10 years. The movement brought change. One year later, Congress passed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 which ended segregation in public places and banned workplace discrimination based on race, colour, religion, gender or ethnicity.\nFive decades later, the ease of organising and mobilising online is facing criticism. Some say it's too easy to click a link and express \u201clikes\u201d or \u201cdislikes\u201d about something. How does it translate into action? How do we take that ubiquitous but relatively shallow level of engagement and organise it so there are well-defined things that people can do collectively? How do \u201cOccupy\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and more recently, #MeToo sustain themselves and turn themselves into powerful actors that can challenge whomever it is that they want to force change through?\nIn her book, Professor Tufekci says that social media has a tremendous amount of power and the way algorithms are designed could decide the fate of a movement. For example, she argues, Facebook uses a computer programme to choose how to rank what it shows its viewers. So if we don't see something posted by someone, maybe Facebook isn't showing it to us. For a social movement that's incredibly important. It was significant in 2014, as protests broke out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer. Early on, the protests got a lot of attention on Twitter but less so on Facebook because of another viral sensation: the Ice Bucket Challenge.\nThat's because, Professor Tufekci argues, the goals of social media companies and social movements are hardly the same. In the end, these are platforms based on delivering ads, and they want to keep us on there with things that will keep us on there. And their business models aren't necessarily in the interests of what the movements are trying to achieve in"}

Thanks in part to significant amounts of cash repatriated back to the U.S. following the recent tax cuts, S&P 500 member firms are boosting payouts.\n\u201cFrom the start of the year through May 18, 187 companies have either increased or initiated a dividend, the second-highest number through the first five months of the year since 2011,\u201d reports CNBC, citing S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nProviding a lift for income investors and dividend funds is the fact that the rate at which companies are boosting payout is climbing as well. That is good news for dividend investors, particularly at a time when interest rates are rising.\n\u201cThe average dividend increase is also climbing compared to the recent past. So far this year, payouts have risen on average by 13.85 percent, the fastest pace since 2014, when dividends rose, on average, for the full year by 17.5%,\u201d according to CNBC.\nThese dividend funds provide investors with exposure to stocks with not only lengthy histories of higher payouts but the ability to continue delivering higher dividends for years to come.\nExpense ratio: 0.28% per year, or $28 on a $10,000 investment.\nThe WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (NASDAQ:DGRW) turned five years old last month and has become a titan among dividend funds over that time. DGRW is not a complex dividend fund, but it is a departure from the traditional funds that emphasize steadily rising payouts.\nKnowing that a company has raised its payout for 10, 20 or 50 consecutive years is nice and can be a tell about its dividend intentions. However, past dividend growth is just that: something that happened in the past. DGRW focuses on a combination of growth and quality factors to compile a portfolio that is more forward-looking in its approach to rising dividends.\nThis dividend fund was one of the first to feature Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) among its top holdings along with a large technology sector allocation. Today, Apple remains a top-five holding in DGRW and tech is the dividend fund\u2019s largest sector weight at almost 22%.\nOver the past three years, DGRW has outperformed the largest U.S. dividend ETF by 430 basis points. This dividend fund delivers a monthly payout.\nSpeaking of technology payouts, the First Trust Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index (NASDAQ:TDIV) is the first dividend fund specifically dedicated to this sector\u2019s payout potential.\nWhile technology has been one of the primary drivers of S&P 500 dividend growth during the current bull market, the idea of dividends in this sector is still relatively new compared to sectors such as consumer staples or industrials.\nSaid another way, TDIV\u2019s holdings are mature tech companies. The likes of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) do not pay dividends, but Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), among others, do.\nWith interest rates rising, this dividend fund is worth considering.\nThe FlexShares Quality Dividend Dynamic Index Fund (NYSEARCA:QDYN) often"}

People, they realized, do not like getting their hands dirty.\n\"Salsa is an inherently messy food to eat,\" said GameTime Salsa co-founder/CEO Bryce Conway, who with his brother coined the term \"salsa knuckles\" -- that annoying tendency to end up with salsa-slathered knuckles from contact with the messy rim of the jar. \"We looked around at similar foods and condiments and how they are packaged. Everything, except for salsa, seems so much easier to eat.\"\nThe brothers began investigating new kinds of salsa jars, eventually finding that a smaller, individual-sized portion solved a myriad of problems. And in the process of constantly talking about salsa, they also tasted.\n\"We did a lot of testing, and there really aren't a lot of great salsas out there that people like. A lot of it is pretty boring stuff,\" said Bryce Conway.\nThe solution: Better recipes for salsa served in 3.1-ounce cups.\nThe result is what the Conways call a \"game changer\" in salsa: GameTime Salsa -- flavorful, dippable salsa packaged in individual serving cups.\n\"If you're looking for just another jar of salsa, you've come to the wrong place. Boring flavor, generic branding and a messy jar just don't sit well with us,\" the Conways say on the GameTime website. \"Our salsa is different. So different it doesn't even come in a jar. The flavors are unique and our single serving cups take the mess and hassle out of eating salsa.\"\nThe bold, authentic, fully dippable American salsa comes in three flavors: GameTime Original American Salsa (Medium), Tequila Lime Cilantro (Mild) and Smoky Jalapeo (Spicy).\nGameTime Original, which the Conways describe as \"bold, thick and full-flavored, with just enough heat to make your tastebuds tingle,\" features roasted tomatoes blended with garlic, cayenne, pepper, jalapeo and cilantro. Tequila Lime Cilantro is a smooth, laid-back salsa made with quality tequila, a hint of cilantro and tangy lime and Smoky Jalapeo, the spiciest of the three, is an American Salsa with a deep wood-smoked flavor and plenty of heat. It combines smoked jalapeos, onions and chipotle peppers for a spicy and flavorful salsa.\nTo develop these flavors"}

The group also named Scorsese as Best Director. George Clooney won Best Actor for Alexander Payne\u2019s Hawaii dramedy The Descendants, and Tilda Swinton was cited as Best Actress for her role as the harried mom with a monster kid in We Need to Talk About Kevin.\nOn Tuesday the New York Film Critics Circle gave its top prizes to The Artist and director Michael Hazanavicius, with Scorsese finishing second on the director ballot and Hugo third for best film. So the major awards of the first organizations to bestow them have gone to an American tribute to silent French films and a French tribute to silent Hollywood films. That\u2019s either connoisseurship or inbreeding.\nAt the advanced age of 102, the NBR is like a thoughtful centenarian who doesn\u2019t want to disappoint any of her grandchildren.

Don\u2019t know.)

The firm plans to create a single offering from the technologies of RedLock and Evident\u2014which was acquired in March for $300 million\u2014that delivers cloud security analytics, advanced threat detection, continuous security and compliance monitoring.\n\"The addition of their technologies allows us to offer the most comprehensive security for multi-cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, and significantly strengthens our cloud strategy going forward,\" said Nikesh Arora, Palo Alto Networks chairman and CEO, in a statement.\nThe deal is expected to close in the quarter ended Nov. 30, with RedLock co-founders Varun Badhwar and Guarav Kumar joining Palo Alto Networks. The company's stock is down $0.02 (0.009%) to $222.72 in pre-market trading Wednesday.\n\"We are excited to join Palo Alto Networks to bring together the strength of our cloud analytics and their industry-leading compliance technologies to help security teams protect their organizations,\" Badhwar said in a statement.\nPalo Alto Networks said it already provides a broad security offering for multi-cloud environments with inline, host-based and API-based security. The company currently serves more than 6,000 cloud customers globally with a portfolio that includes VM-Series next-generation firewall, Aperture, Evident and GlobalProtect cloud service.\nRedLock, meanwhile, specializes in: discovering and classifying cloud resources and applications; detecting threats and vulnerabilities in an organization's public cloud; and prioritizing risks, investigating and remediating threats. The company's security analytics capability utilizes an artificial intelligence-driven approach that correlates disparate security data sets, according to Palo Alto Networks.\nThe company specializes in correlating disparate data sets\u2014including resource configurations, user activities, network traffic, host vulnerabilities/activities and threat intelligence\u2014to provide organizations with the necessary context on risks. This contextual understanding of the public cloud can reduce incident response time from weeks to seconds, Palo Alto Networks said.\nFrom a risk prioritization perspective, RedLock helps organizations prioritize remediation for the riskiest items first, with risk scores determined for every cloud resource based on the severity of business risks, violations and anomalies.\nRedLock's threat investigation capabilities allow for quick probes of current or past issues and analysis of downstream impact. For example, a company can search for all databases that were receiving traffic from suspicious IP addresses last month and subsequently drill down on each resource to determine connections to other resources.\nThe company's rapid response functions ensure businesses can quickly respond to an issue based on contextual alerts.

{"idx": "26576", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This is a blog on the work of the Value Recovery From Used Electronics Project, organized by iNEMI (the International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative). The focus of this project is to move towards a more circular economy for hard disk drives (HDDs), with the ultimate goal of \u201cmaking hard drives from hard drives\u201d. This article is based upon materials from the iNEMI Value Recovery Committee.\nThere is increasing pressure worldwide for societal transformation from a linear economy \u2013 based on the traditional take-make-waste model \u2013 to a circular economy. The expanding worldwide demand for electronics \u2013 and specifically, for data storage \u2013 is increasing opportunity for the electronics industry, while also increasing resource consumption. The most successful companies will modify their business practices consistent with circular economy principals. To date, some individual companies in the electronics industry have taken this direction, but as a whole, the industry has not undertaken the business-model-level initiatives that are key for a serious transition to a circular economy.\nThere are three major reason why HDDs are a good candidate for a circular economy: (1) the demand for data storage is increasing rapidly; (2) data storage demand is increasing significantly faster than increases in HDD storage density, and (3) industry output of HDDs (manufacturing capacity) is not expected to increase significantly, according to industry projections. This leads to a potential gap between estimated data storage needs and the estimated ability of HDD and SSD manufacturers to keep up with demand. There are a number of ways to fill this gap: continued investment in fabs and technologies to increase HDD and SDD storage, increase HDD reliability, and increase the reuse of used HDDs so that they are available to meet some of our global data storage needs.\nPhase 1 of this project identified stakeholder groups and new technologies necessary to circularize the HDD economy. Phase II of this project, currently underway, is working to demonstrate the feasibility of this goal by using system modeling, case studies, and pilot projects to measure economic and environmental impact of various reuse and recycling options. The team, consisting of industry leaders in the HDD economy, are committed to establishing a blueprint for HDD collection, processing, reuse, and recovery (with a special focus on rare earth magnets).\nThe figure below shows some of the factors in these Phase II studies. In particular it shows two goals, the first to increase the length of time and number of HDDs in use through low cost and secure data wiping. The second is recovery of material in components through dismantling, remanufacturing and recycling of high value metals.\n\u2022 Data destruction demands by the last user, which are not always essential to meet justified data security needs, lead to wholesale HDD shredding, which precludes reuse and reduces material recovery options.\n\u2022 Shredding of the HDDs by pre-processors, before any disassembly and while still embodied in the product, which is done for the purpose of bulk material recovery (e.g. aluminum, ferrous metals, and gold), precludes reuse and can reduce recovery of trace, but highly valuable, materials (e.g. rare earth metals).\nEach of these downstream steps in the value recovery system is also limited by HDD collection efficiencies. Collection of consumer HDDs is very low, corresponding to the generally low collection rates for consumer electronics in the U.S. (26%). Commercial HDD collection is very efficient (90%) and it is estimated that there are 19- to 24 million HDDs available for value recovery form North American data centers alone.\nMore value can be realized and environmental and health impacts can be reduced"}

I enjoy our banter \u2013 it\u2019s part of what makes it so much fun to work at Cray.\nBy now, nearly everybody is used to seeing articles detailing all of the potential benefits of big data, whether it\u2019s making new breakthroughs, gaining unforeseen opportunities or the disruptive impact it\u2019s making across different industries. Despite the fact that we\u2019ve seen serious advancements in recent years, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that most businesses are still struggling to take full advantage of big data; wrestling with not only huge datasets but often the speed and diversity of data itself \u2013 not to mention bottlenecks in data movement.\nAt the core, big data and digitalisation are two sides of the same coin: modernisation. This means that we\u2019ll likely see big data have an increasing impact on organisations across industries. With this in mind, both IT teams and business leaders must find new ways to transform the potentially valuable volumes of data they are sitting on into truly valuable information they can use to improve operations, customer experience, and innovation.\nBut yet when I think of big data, its advantages still seem hard to quantify. Personally, I\u2019m often reminded of a line from the film The Big Lebowski, where The Dude says, \u201cit\u2019s down there somewhere \u2013 let me take another look.\u201d So let\u2019s do that now. Cult comedy films aside, the first thing to consider is what companies expect the impact of big data to be. From my own experience, the general expectation seems to be a combination of improved business opportunities and operational efficiencies.\nFor a bit of a deeper look, here are a few statistics around the potential influence big data is poised to bring to business in the near future.\nThe sale and use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology will account for a $1.9 trillion economic value-add (Gartner, Dec. 2014). Industries leading adopting are manufacturing, healthcare and insurance.\nAlso by 2018, decision optimisation will no longer be a niche discipline; it will become a best practice in leading organizations to address a wide range of complex business decisions. (Gartner, March 2016).\nThe next thing to consider is what organisations are really looking to gain from utilising big data. After all, what\u2019s the sense in collecting such enormous volumes of data if they are not being put to best use?\nConsidering the above, organisations may initially feel the urgency to just keep up in such a dynamic environment, but then they quickly look to use advantages from within their information in a few key areas, including customer experience, stakeholder engagement, business models, efficiencies and new opportunities.\nA significant improvement in productivity amongst various departments.\nThe ability to offer customers a better experience throughout all interactions, leading to significantly improved retention and increased sales.\nThe capability to conduct much more effective and faster business decision making, based on reliable and hard evidence.\nA greater ability to identify new and highly profitable product development opportunities based on customer insight.\nBetter identification and targeting of potential new customers, clients and partners.\nGaining access to a big data advantage requires companies to leverage their information effectively in order to make decisions with near immediacy, continuously pivot strategy and tactics, and merge streams of inquiries into meaningful action.\nCollectively, I refer to this concept as high-frequency insights. Personally, I believe it represents a serious competitive advantage for businesses to keep pace and thrive in today\u2019s often frenetic world.

We have to work together perhaps more than ever before,\u201d he told a press briefing in London.\nThe Pentagon is facing nearly $1 trillion in cuts to projected spending over the next decade, which leaders say would dramatically reduce Washington\u2019s military capability. The next round of across-the-board \u201csequestration\u201d cuts will begin on January 15 if U.S. Congress cannot agree deficit reduction measures.\nThe U.S. army is already closing and consolidating several garrisons in Germany and says under current plans the number of troops in Europe by 2017 will be some 30,000, a drastic reduction from the days of the Cold War. The U.S. Air Force also maintains several bases, as does the U.S. Navy.\nEUCOM had been asked to plan for a budget reduction of between zero and 20 percent next year, Breedlove said. Cuts would likely take place at the headquarters level, he said.\nOther U.S. commands are taking similar steps. Last week, U.S. Africa Command said it expected to lose more than a tenth of its funding, forcing it to slim down planned exercises and cut spending on its headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.\nAlmost all European NATO members are also cutting defense spending, and with little or no new money available for exercises, training to build NATO\u2019s ability to fight sophisticated adversaries would be a challenge, Breedlove said.\nOne solution would be to building a NATO component to already planned and funded exercises by individual or groups of member states, he said.\n\u201cWe need to exercise smarter,\u201d he said, pointing to last month\u2019s Mediterranean exercise \u201cBrilliant Mariner\u201d, run alongside a pre-planned Italian exercise.\nLast month NATO staged an exercise in the Baltic states, \u201cSteadfast Jazz\u201d, which Breedlove said showed that the alliance was moving beyond its recent focus on counterinsurgency to more sophisticated fighting.\nNATO denies such exercises are aimed at Russia, but officials also acknowledge privately that an increasingly assertive Moscow has alarmed eastern and northern European states in particular, most of whom are NATO members.\nBreedlove emphasized on Thursday that a high priority needed to be put on maintaining and increasing military-to-military relations with Moscow to build trust and avert misunderstandings.\nBreedlove also noted increased competition for Pentagon resources, particularly from Asia, to which President Barack Obama has said the United States will \u201cpivot\u201d its resources as part of a strategic rebalance.\nBut he said it was important NATO remained strong in Europe."}

Not only do you have to look like a brick wall, but it's required that you act like it's no big deal.\nZachary Levi's sense of humor will likely serve him well in Shazam! While the film will be another in a long line of superhero action films, it's premise is that a young boy gains the ability to transform into a superhero, a setup that is inherently humorous, and thus we expect Shazam! to be funnier than your average superhero movie, though likely more family-friendly than Deadpool."}

This terrifying prediction, based on projected fuel price rises, suggests that in less than 20 years the ownership of period homes will be the luxury of the super-rich.\nIn the near future, says Chris Hocknell of report authors Eight Associates, \"the upkeep of period homes will be prohibitively expensive for many\".\nConservation organisations such as English Heritage or the Victorian Society who oppose measures such as double glazing in sash windows may need to reappraise their policies. \"The very first rule of preserving a historic building is to get somebody to live in it,\" says low-energy building expert Peter Warm. \"If homes are too expensive to heat they will become redundant.\"\nEight Associates examined the energy requirements of three similar Victorian terrace houses, built around 1840 in the leafy Ladbroke Estate, west London. The houses are all owned by Octavia Housing, the legacy of Victorian social reformer Octavia Hill, who campaigned for decent housing for less well-off city dwellers.\nFor the study, one house was left unimproved; one was refurbished to reasonably good standards with high levels of insulation and a new heating system. The third was retrofitted to \"Passivhaus\" standards, meaning it requires little to no heating and hot water for washing is generated from solar thermal panels on the roof. The windows are triple glazed \u2013 the first imitation sash triple-glazed windows in the UK; walls have been treated with high levels of internal insulation and original wooden doors replaced with heavy insulated ones.\nAlthough the measures sound extreme I would challenge any casual lay person walking down the street to identify the \"Passivhaus\" among the pleasingly elegant flat-fronted three-storey terraces.\nEnergy use of all three homes was measured over a year and for the purposes of the analysis it was assumed that the optimum temperature for living areas would be 21C (70F). Analysis of the homes over the period showed that the unimproved house required 366 kWh (kilowatt hours) of power per square metre (including electricity) while the insulated home required only 198 kWh and the \"Passivhaus\" just 63 kWh. Over the year occupants of the \"Passivhaus\" spent \u00a31,255 less on fuel than residents of the unimproved home and occupants of the insulated home \u00a3560 less.\nIn addition, data revealed that even with heating, temperatures in the unimproved home dropped to 16.4C, well below the \"safe\" temperature for the young, ill and elderly. Projecting fuel price rises, the analysis also revealed that even occupants of the insulated house would eventually suffer fuel poverty unless they were earning more than \u00a360,000 a year by 2030.\nBoushra Bakli, who lives in the \"Passivhaus\" refurbishment, says that when she and her family moved into it the difference was startling. \"We moved from a similarly aged but unimproved house.

Positive steps to apply will have to be taken and many EU citizens, for any number of reasons may fail to do this and could find themselves in the UK unlawfully and at risk of removal.\nIn any event, the system for applying for settled status will not open until later this year and will not be fully operational until 30 March 2019.

By next year, analysts predict that number will reach 11 million barrels.\n\u201cThis would push the U.S. into first place among the world's oil producers,\u201d industry engineer and investor Robert Rapier said in March.\nNatural gas production is on a similar track, estimated to reach record production levels of 81.3 billion feet per day this year. The industry is now eyeing talent in Silicon Valley to help them digitize their land records.\nThe news is overwhelmingly positive, as long as industry firms ignore the depressing field of climate research.\n\u201cWe are doing worse,\u201d says Henrik Jeppesen, an analyst with Carbon Tracker, a financial think-tank that urges shareholders and investors to consider the threat of climate change. Jeppesen, who heads Carbon Tracker's efforts in North America, compares the fossil fuel industry to a drug dealer that is all-too-happy to feed society\u2019s addiction to oil.\n\u201cAs long as oil and gas production and output continue to increase, it is very hard to argue that there will be any decline in emissions, because a barrel of oil and gas eventually will turn into an emission at some point,\u201d he tells ConsumerAffairs.\nNo single advocacy group or agency is calculating the entire country\u2019s carbon footprint, but advocacy groups currently track different pieces of the puzzle.\nWhen the federal government invited even more oil and gas companies to drill on public land in Wyoming in 2014, conservationists hoping to stop the rampant development in a state known for picturesque frontiers knew they needed to act quickly. So they sent a fax.\nThe federal government \u201cis approving record numbers of large oil and gas development projects in Wyoming,\u201d said the fax from the WildEarth Guardians, one of half a dozen conservation groups that protested the sale.\nThe Wilderness Society, another conservation group, had similar concerns, but a technical problem somewhere along the way delayed the message.

One union is saying its workers could strike before December is over.\nAt Oakland International Airport, workers represented by Unite HERE Local 2850 are now threatening to walk off the job because of an impasse in contract negotiations with a major contractor. The workers are resisting drastic takeaways demanded by their employer, HMS Host. About two hundred unionized HMS Host employees run most of the food service operations at the airport. They work in the central warehouse delivering supplies to dozens of vendors like Starbucks, and they work in the kitchens of several of the larger restaurants like Chili's. Most of these employees make $12 to $14 an hour.\nAccording to Matt Clark, an organizer with Unite HERE, HMS Host is demanding that workers now shoulder the cost of increases in their healthcare insurance. Healthcare costs rose rapidly in the 2000s. Last year alone average premiums paid under private sector plans rose 3 to 4 percent, a significant rise even though it represented a slow down from previous years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual study of health insurance coverage.\nFurthermore, HMS Host is seeking to take back paid lunch-time, which would amount to a 7 percent pay cut for workers, and also is demanding a three- to four-year contract that includes no cost of living increases over its duration, said Clark. \u201cWe have called on Host to agree to a fair contract, but all they\u2019ve offered so far are takeaways,\" said Marcia Voge, a bartender at the airport's Pyramid restaurant. \"Now we\u2019re preparing to do whatever it takes in our fight to win a fair contract.\u201d Unite HERE's members have given HMS Host until midnight tonight to make a different offer.\nHMS Host points to a drop in passenger traffic through the Oakland Airport as the main reason for its austere proposals to the union. The company has a point. In 2007, at the height of the housing and banking bubbles, the airport saw more than 7.3 million passengers. But in 2011, the last year for which statistics are available, the airport saw only 4.7 million passengers.\nPassenger traffic through Oakland doesn't tell the whole story with respect to HMS Host's financial condition, however. The company actually is one of the largest food and retail services contractors in US airports, and many of its operations are in venues that have seen increases in passenger traffic and revenues since 2010.\nHMS Host is owned by the Autogrill Group, an Italian multi-national corporation that is controlled by the Benetton family's four billionaire scions, Luciano, Guiliana, Gilberto, and Carlo. The Benetton's control an amazing proportion of Italy's wealth, including Atlantia, the corporation that owns and operates much of the country's privatized toll highways.\nIn a recent letter to investors, Gilberto Benetton, who lead's the family's Autogrill holdings, said that profits derived from HMS Host are up. \"Travel Retail recorded excellent performance in terms of both sales and, even more so, margins,\" explained Mr. Benetton. \"The airport channel [HMS Host] posted positive"}

Williams, who showed off his skill for killing evil monsters first back in 1981 in \"The Evil Dead.\" Campbell would reprise the role in two sequels, a remake, video games and now a new television series, \"Ash vs Evil Dead,\" premiering Saturday on Starz.\namNewYork spoke with Campbell about the series.\nWhat were your feelings about returning to the role of Ash?\nFear. Terror. Approaching Ash again as a middle-aged man is a daunting prospect. We don't shy around it -- the guy wears dentures and a man-girdle, so he needs all the help he can get now, which I think is awesome.\nHow is the physicality for you in the show?\nI've got to stretch a lot more [laughs]. And my stunt guy's pretty busy. He's been busy. Nobody wants to shut a production down. I do plenty. I do more than the average actor. I do a lot. But my routine now is definitely a lot more time in the pool stretching.\nHave you changed how you play Ash after all these years?\nThe only thing that's changed is me as an actor. I'm best known for the role of Ash in the original \"Evil Dead\" when I had no experience. I'm enjoying the hell out of revisiting this character now that I know what I'm doing. And it's way more fun. I can round the character out now. And TV's great for that. TV will allow people to get to know Ash much more than any movie. We made a movie every 10 years. We haven't been cranking these out, so TV's the best format for anyone who really wants to get into it. We have five new hours.\nYou get to see him in new situations, you get to see him possibly in romantic situations, you get to see him as a leader, a failed leader for the most part. You get to see more angles of him.\nWhy is Ash such a timeless character?\nCause he's Mr. Nobody. He's the everyman. He has no skills. And, you know what, Ash is a good guy. There are not many good guys in the horror series. Very few. Ash is one of them. He's like your neighbor. Only probably not as smart as your neighbor.\nHow is this show pushing the horror genre forward?\nWe don't have intent to change anything within the industry, we just want to be left alone and do our thing, and give the audience, basically, an unrated TV show. Starz was the only place where that could happen. So that's our goal and our intent. Our goal is to give them what they actually wanted -- they wanted [director] Sam [Raimi] back, they wanted Ash back. So Sam came back to direct the pilot to set the tone and to set the bar. That was extremely helpful and I think the fans will accept it.\nThis is big reunion for you and Sam Raimi, producer Rob Tapert and even Lucy Lawless.\nIt feels normal.

But what of the Xbox 360 and PS3? Is it time for them to get a refresh? Not quite, says one insider.\nFirst, it\u2019s important to remember that it was only last year and a half that we got the revised 360 and PS3 Slim \u2014 both significant improvements, and both heralding new accessories intended to extend the life of the consoles. And then there are statements on the record showing how Microsoft and Sony execs don\u2019t really feel any pressure to upgrade the machines, since they\u2019re selling well and the competition isn\u2019t really doing anything new. And there\u2019s word from the games development industry that a new generation of even more powerful consoles would make games even more difficult to develop and sell at reasonable prices.\nSo really, nobody should be expecting a new console from Microsoft or Sony this year, and even 2012 would be something of a stretch \u2014 the way we felt about the possibility of a WiiHD being released last year. It would have been surprising.\nBut 2013 \u2014 by that point it will be clear (whatever Nintendo does) that the consoles need a refresh. Why? Well, pressure from the rest of the industry, I\u2019d say. More focus on integration with other platforms, adoption of new media and display standards, attachment to new markets.\nYet the insider quoted at Kotaku seems to think 2014 is a more likely time. Why? Probably just to save money. A year spent on squeezing the last drops out of the old generation is a year they save a billion dollars on R&D, marketing, manufacturing, and so on. And since Sony and Microsoft want to release around the same time (unlike last time, a staggered launch wouldn\u2019t provide much advantage, only give the other an opportunity to respond), it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll both delay as long as humanly possible, unless they get some serious push from outside.\nSome may be disappointed, but personally I think it\u2019s just fine. The current consoles are quite powerful, though whether they have much room to grow is a hard question. At any rate, it\u2019s $400 you won\u2019t be spending this year or the next, and that\u2019s something."}
{"idx": "26601", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Some readers may be unaware that Katy Perry actually began her career as a Christian gospel singer going by her given name, Katy Hudson. Her parents, who are both ministers, very much approved.\nKaty\u2019s gospel music career was not exactly successful, though. In fact, according to a biography of the singer by Kimberly Dillon Summers, her first and only album as Katy Hudson sold less than 200 copies in 2001, its year of release. Katy was only 17 years old at the time.\nAfter her lackluster debut, Katy took a step back from the gospel music scene and began reinventing herself in a way that would distance her from the explicitly Christian demographic and make her music more appealing to the masses. In other words, she began transforming herself into the Katy Perry much of pop culture knows and loves today. To do so, Katy had to turn her back on many of the Christian ideals she had been raised with in order to become more edgy.\nSince then, Perry has only become more popular by continuing to embrace pop culture trends and explicit imagery in both her music and her public image. Take Perry\u2019s image on the cover of GQ\u2018s October 2014 issue, for example. Not exactly NSFW, but certainly not something you would find on the cover of a church\u2019s monthly newsletter.\nKaty Perry\u2019s parents see she has sold out her faith, and they say they are saddened by her decision.\nThey are not condemning their daughter, though. They realize that people do things, especially in their youth, that are not always well-advised, and Keith Hudson says that a parent should not get upset if their own views differ with those of their child.\nKaty Perry herself has said that, while she may not choose to embrace Christianity as her parents have done, she is still a very spiritual person and definitely believes in a higher power.\n\u201cI\u2019m not Buddhist, I\u2019m not Hindu, I\u2019m not Christian, but I still feel like I have a deep connection with God. I pray all the time \u2014 for self-control, for humility. There\u2019s a lot of gratitude in it. Just saying \u2018thank you\u2019 sometimes is better than asking for things,\u201d Perry said during a 2013 interview with Marie Claire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a Heaven or a Hell, or an old man sitting on a throne. I believe in a higher power bigger than me because that keeps me accountable,\u201d Katy continued.\nAs her words suggested, Perry\u2019s career, while not going back to gospel, is moving more towards uplifting, spiritually empowering music. One example is Katy Perry\u2019s 2013 smash hit \u201cRoar,\u201d and perhaps an even better one is \u201cRise,\u201d the song Perry will perform at the Olympics this year and which was recently teased on YouTube for an August 4 release."}

Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison. Photograph by Kent Smith for Showtime.\nApologies, people who never saw either ill-fated season of AMC\u2019s The Killing, because even though it pains me to look back on a show clunkier than a pair of ill-fitting, steel-toed Doc Martins, there\u2019s something about this season of Homeland that keeps bringing it back up (in more ways than one).\nThe Killing, unlike Homeland, alienated viewers completely at the end of the first season when it failed to say who\u2019d actually killed Rosie Larsen, which is awkward when \u201cWho Killed Rosie Larsen?\u201d is the tagline of your elaborate and extensive marketing campaign. Homeland, by contrast, let us know fairly soon towards the end of the first season that Brody was actually working towards an attack on the United States with Abu Nazir and then left us with a season finale so cruel, so unusual, that it was hard to think of Brody as anything other than a vicious lump of foul deformity whose hair was only red because he\u2019d spent so much time playing Hearts in hell with Satan.\nAfter such an ending, it was hard to imagine Carrie and Brody getting back together like the star-crossed lovers Homeland apparently wants us to see them as. So a second season finale which relies pretty much entirely on our interest in the future prospects of their relationship doesn\u2019t have quite the urgency of, say, someone trying to blow up a room full of politicians in a bunker underneath the State Department. In the same way that we wanted to care who killed Rosie in the casino, we didn\u2019t, and while we also wanted to wonder whether Abu Nazir might succeed in blowing up 300 returning heroes at a naval base, the storyline just just didn\u2019t have the same bite to it.\nLike The Killing, Homeland has also spent an entire second season spinning off the plot of its first, when all the exciting stuff (Brody being evil or not, Rosie Larsen dying) has already happened. Homeland has also taken the dubious step of throwing red herrings at us, in the manner of Danny Galvez (whose healing powers are only rivaled in magnitude by the grudge he\u2019s probably going to bear against Carrie now), Aileen, and that minor CIA agent in Gettysburg who also happened to play a lead role in The Wire. Add in some ridiculously absurd breaks from reality (cosy Skype calls with terrorists, Abu Nazir\u2019s driving skills) and the fact that we\u2019ve almost entirely forgotten about what may prove to be a pivotal plot point (ie, who the mole is) along with an unnecessarily long and distracting subplot about a hit-and-run, and you\u2019re on the road to Seattle-like levels of foggy but improbable mystery.\nLuckily, Homeland is saved by virtue of never being boring, as proven by tonight\u2019s episode.

Technology and the economy have converged to create a set of priorities and preoccupations that are unique to our times. Here are just a few workplace and employment issues that are likely to stir debate, frustration and a search for solutions this year.\nDEVICE BACKLASH As workers add more electronic devices, Web sites, software programs and apps to their arsenals, there is a point at which efficiency and satisfaction suffer. More devices can lead to more multitasking, which, though viewed by many as a virtue, has been shown to interfere with concentration.\nMore devices also harbor more vortexes of distraction, like Facebook, shopping sites and cute animal videos. Maintaining focus may well be one of the biggest daily challenges that workers will face this year, now that smartphones and tablets have become ubiquitous.\nMore workers will probably revolt against the idea that they must be \u201con\u201d all the time, recognizing that both their work and personal lives will improve if they create stricter boundaries. Sometimes this expectation is self-imposed; at other times, it\u2019s part of the corporate culture. Look for more companies to address the issue directly. Last month, for example, Volkswagen agreed with labor representatives in Germany to limit work-related e-mails on BlackBerrys during off-hours.\nTHE TRAINING ADVANTAGE More technology necessitates more training. During the recession, too many workers learned new technology imperfectly, on the fly, or not at all. Fortunately, corporate spending on training rose in 2011 over the previous year, according to a report in Training magazine.\nThe pace at which new technology emerges and becomes paramount is quickening as never before. Last year, HTML 5 for the Web was the hottest skill that a job seeker could have; now it\u2019s a knowledge of apps, said Alison Doyle, a job search specialist for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company.\nBoth the employed and the unemployed cannot be complacent about their skills, and must be assertive about keeping up with the latest computer languages and applications, she said.\nTHE RISE OF THE INDEPENDENT WORKER Both by necessity and choice, more workers are deciding to go it alone as consultants, contractors, freelancers and other independent operators. Look for that trend to intensify this year.\nThanks to technology, it\u2019s easier than ever for \u201cpeople to find projects and projects to find people,\u201d and they aren\u2019t restricted by geography, said Gene Zaino, president and chief executive of MBO Partners, which deals with issues surrounding independent consultants.\nThat\u2019s great for people who seek flexibility and autonomy. But working alone can be lonely, and a lack of structure can slow productivity. That\u2019s why the phenomenon of co-working \u2014 where independent workers in a range of fields gather in one room to conduct business and drink lots of coffee or tea \u2014 is likely to spread.\nOf course, not everyone chooses to be independent. Many people have been forced into becoming contractors as more companies with limited budgets hire on a project basis, Mr. Zaino said. Often, these workers\u2019 pay is lower than it would be if they were full-time employees, and benefits are nonexistent.\nNow enter the federal government, which doesn\u2019t like how these fuzzy arrangements affect tax collection.

In fact, the Stormwater Treatment Areas and Water Conservation Areas are more than a million acre-feet above flood stage, and we continue to have high water levels in Everglades National Park.\nSome have tried to use Hurricane Irma as an opportunity to sell the public on additional storage south of Lake Okeechobee, but a southern reservoir would have been of little use with so much rainfall and so few real options to discharge water south. Data from the South Florida Water Management District shows the proposed southern reservoir in Senate Bill 10 \u2014 if it had been bone dry--could have taken only 12% of the two million acre feet of stormwater that has flooded into Lake Okeechobee.\nSouth Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) spokesman Randy Smith said recently, \u201cIf there was a reservoir down here, it probably would have done the same thing. It would have filled up.\"\nIn studying options that would reduce the need for coastal discharges, the SFWMD recently announced restoration projects targeted north of Lake Okeechobee \u2013 where more than 95 percent of the water originates \u2013 that will significantly reduce the need for future discharges. The district estimates that adding 50 additional deep storage wells to the already planned regional projects could reduce discharges to the St. Lucie by 67 percent and reduce discharges to the Caloosahatchee by 77 percent. The district puts an affordable $330 million price tag on the projects could be operational well before most other storage options. These projects should be no-brainer at a fraction of the cost of large land buys.\nWe need to take a holistic approach to finishing projects that will bring the most benefits to everyone impacted by Lake Okeechobee\u2019s high water levels rather than continuing the fantasy of ever returning our dramatically altered, dammed, diked and never totally controlled water management system back \u201cto the way it was\u201d 100 years ago.\nThe only real way to \u201csend water south\u201d the way it used to flow would be if we could all travel back in time \u2014 before the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie Rivers were connected to Lake Okeechobee at the request of our own communities, before the Herbert Hoover Dike was built around the Lake, before the federal government enacted strict regulations for Everglades National Park, before the Endangered Species Act, before Tamiami Trail bisected the Everglades, before a federal judge took control of our water quality, and before all of us moved into the system and made more and more demands on the system.\nFortunately, there are scientifically proven ways to improve management of the current system, but that depends on letting the professionals at the SFWMD and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers complete the suite of projects that are designed to provide the most relief to the entire Orlando, Lake Okeechobee and Everglades ecosystem.\nMitch Hutchcraft is a former member of the governing board of the South Florida"}

{"idx": "26618", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is overexpressed in various cancer cells and the overexpression may be correlated with the prognosis of several types of cancers. Binding of PDGF to its receptors induces receptor dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the receptor\u2019s cytoplasmic domains. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues interact with the secondary signaling molecules to initiate signaling cascades that trigger cellular changes by affecting downstream effectors. In our recent publication, we have shown that a NF-icB mediates the transformation of mouse fibroblast cells overexpressing PDGF B chain. Though there is a significant correlation between PDGF stimulation and N F-kB activity, it is still unclear what secondary signaling molecules and downstream targets regulate NFkB activity in the cell. In the glioblastoma cell line U87-MG which is known to overexpress the PDGF B chain and the PDGF beta receptor, N F-kB activity is significantly increased. A dominant negative mutant of PDGF beta receptor missing five intracellular tyrosine residues, which is unable to activate multiple secondary signaling molecules significantly, decreased N F-kB activity when it was introduced into U87-MG cells. When one o f the five tyrosine residue is added back so that the negative PDGF beta receptor can only activate PI3-K pathway, NF-kB activity returned to the level that was normal for U87-MG the cells. In addition, treating U87-MG cells with chemical inhibitors of the phosphatidylinocitol 3 kinase (PI3-K) pathway resulted in the significant inhibition o f NF-kB activity in a dose dependent manner. The use of short interfering RNA (siRNA) against p i 10 kinase of PI3-K to suppress the expression of p i 10 kinase also resulted in the inhibition of PI3-K pathway activity and NF-kB activity. The study presented here demonstrates that the PI3-K pathway is one o f the pathways that controls NF-kB activity in U87-MG cells. Elucidating the exact signaling cascades that mediate NF-kB activity upon PDGF stimulation will unveil a significant mechanism of PDGF induced transformation, which may lead to the discovery of novel molecular targets to suppress tumors with high PDGF activity.\nShimamura, Takeshi, \"Roles and Regulation of NF-xB in Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Transformed Cells\" (2002).

However, Penner never changed companies \u2014 Sprout Technology is the Nepal subsidiary of CloudFactory, the international company.\nPenner had been active on Twitter and Facebook over the last year, writing about Nepal\u2019s new constitution and the Indian blockade that followed it. Nepal\u2019s constitution, which was passed in September 2015, has been controversial since the Madhesis, an ethnic group in the southern plains, started protests demanding equal rights. Many Nepalis say the constitution also discriminated against women. In October, Human Rights Watch released a report that was critical of the government\u2019s handling of the protests \u2014 but was condemned by some Nepalis as biased.\nPenner, who can speak and write in Nepali, regularly responded to and engaged with critics, often in a stream of tweets or detailed posts that upset some Nepalis. Many disliked Penner\u2019s comments on Nepal\u2019s politics and called his approach combative, while others admired him for doing what many Nepalis did not.\nIn April, a handful of anonymous Twitter accounts sent a message to HelloSarkar (\"Hello Government\"), a Twitter handle set up by Nepal\u2019s government to receive complaints and grievances, asking that it investigate Penner for violating immigration rules and \u201cdoing politics\u201d in Nepal. The government responded by starting an investigation against Penner that is believed to have ultimately resulted in his arrest on Monday.\n\"Can a foreign national live in Nepal and intervene openly in its internal affairs? Look at his tweets.\"\n\"We have sent Ref. No. 30983 for action to the Ministry of Home.\"\nNepal\u2019s law restricts foreign nationals from taking part in politics and has provisions to deport anyone the government thinks threatens national security or creates public disorder. In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Kedar Neupane, the director general of the Department of Immigration, said officials deemed Penner's participation on social platforms threatening and that the law gave them authority to deport him.\nNeupane said Penner was not being deported but that the government is seeking a \u201cvoluntary departure\u201d within two days. Jha, Penner\u2019s lawyer, said the Canadian's team would appeal the decision on Wednesday."}

Starring Vanessa Hudgens, Danny Pudi, and Alan Tudyk, Powerless embraces the everyday weirdness of the DC Universe and mines it all for laughs. Plus, as Powerless proudly boasts in its opening credits that homage classic DC comic book covers, the show exists on an Earth where the Justice League makes its home.\nSupergirl wowed fans with its charming, dead-on version of Superman to kick off its second season, but before that the other superhero shows on The CW, Arrow, The Flash, and DC's Legends of Tomorrow coyly danced around the subject of whether the Trinity of DC's superheroes - Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman - exist on Earth-1 (unless something changes, they don't.) Meanwhile, Gotham on FOX gets to play with most of Batman's wonderful super villain concepts, while keeping the future Dark Knight a teenager and far from donning the cape and cowl.\nSuperman and Batman are neither seen nor heard in Powerless - unless you count the voice of Adam West delivering a brief opening narration - but the show leaves absolutely no doubt the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight prominently exist in its universe. As do Lex Luthor, the President-elect of the United States who promises to \"Make Metropolis Super Again,\" and the Joker, whom we see in custody but with a hood over his head in a newscast from Gotham City. Kryptonite also exists in Powerless, and apparently is so plentiful it can be made into panes of window glass for office buildings.\nThe only superhero Powerless' pilot \"Wayne or Lose\" actually shows is the Crimson Fox, who was a C-list member of the Justice League introduced in Justice League Europe in the early 1990s. The lone super villain plaguing Charm City, where Powerless is based, is Jack O'Lantern, another C-list character who has been a villain in the comics as well as a member of the heroic Global Guardians superhero team. Powerless also briefly shows the Justice League's first-ever enemy, Starro the Conqueror, climbing a building before vomiting on Vanessa Hudgens' character Emily Locke's window, as well as the scrap of a giant robot that may be the Construct, another classic League villain.\nEmily Locke is the audience's window into the weird world of her new place of employment, Wayne Security. Locke and her wacky co-workers provide research and development of products to help Charm City's citizens cope with and survive the daily superhuman brawls that plague the city, like Joker Anti-Venom that comes in different shades of purple. Despite their lofty slogan - \"Wayne Security Gives The Power Back to the Powerless\" - it's surprising and odd that a subsidiary of a company owned and run by Bruce Wayne churns out low grade products that they freely admit are knockoffs of better products developed by Lex Luthor's LexCorp.\nThe best explanation for Wayne Security's corporate culture of under performance can be found in the man who runs it: Van Wayne, played by Alan Tudyk.

The Bank of Canada does not disclose Carney\u2019s exact salary but says he is paid in a range equivalent to US $436,200 (272,030 pounds) - $513,000.\nDuring the crisis, Carney helped to make Canada\u2019s recession one of the shallowest of the world\u2019s richest nations. No Canadian bank needed government help, and the country recovered all the jobs it lost in the downturn relatively rapidly.\nBy contrast, Britain had to bail out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, and the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy is still struggling to achieve growth four years after the crisis broke.\nCarney, 47, will remain as head of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a Basel-based body that sets global banking rules, when he moves to London next year, although the Bank of Canada itself does not regulate the country\u2019s banks.\n\u201cI believe he will bring the strong leadership and external experience that the Bank (of England) itself needs as it takes on its heavy new responsibilities for regulating our banking system,\u201d Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told parliament in announcing the appointment.\nCarney will stay at the Bank of Canada through May, and starts at the Bank in July. He will serve a five-year term, rather than the eight years that had been expected for the next BoE governor.\nFrom next year the Bank will take charge of British financial regulation, almost doubling its size. This boosted the case for a governor with strong management skills and financial market experience, rather than someone in King\u2019s academic mould.\nCarney\u2019s past as a Goldman Sachs investment banker has been a double-edged sword, as he fought to prove his loyalties lie with ordinary citizens, not his high-flying banker ex-colleagues. He clashed memorably last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon in Washington, when the U.S. banker argued against new regulations for the financial sector.\nCarney also courted controversy in August when he accused Canadian firms of sitting on piles of \u201cdead money\u201d, rather than investing it. Large British companies also have money to invest, but little appetite to do so at a time of strong economic risks.\nHow Carney\u2019s monetary policy experience will translate to Britain is less clear"}

No delivery date has yet been set.\nDefending the decision, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explained that \"[the S-300] is not designed for attacks and will not put at risk the security of any regional state, including Israel,\" news agency TASS reported Monday.\nThe S-300 systems are not covered by the UN arms embargo in place on Iran, since it is classified as a defensive weapons system and has no offensive use.\n\"It would provide Iran with a long-range air defense capability that is currently lacking in its inventory [and] provide an additional defensive tier to Iran's air defense plan,\" Ben Goodlad, a weapons expert at defense analytics firm IHS was quoted as saying in a statement.\nDepending on the specific model and the missiles loaded into the system, an S-300 battery can track up to 100 targets and engage 12 to 36 of them within a range of 150 kilometers.\nHow Iran would use an air defense system with these kinds of specifications depends on the outcome of the current nuclear negotiations.\nIf the deal falls through, and Iran continues its nuclear program, then the S-300s would most likely be used to defend Iranian nuclear facilities, greatly increasing the cost of any U.S.- or Israeli-led air strikes on the sites.\nBut if the deal goes through and fears over Iranian nuclear weapons fade, the S-300s would likely be used by Tehran to bolster its defenses against more capable regional rivals \u2014 such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nThis point was made by Lavrov: \"For Iran, taking into account the very tense situation in the region surrounding it, modern air defense systems are very important,\" he was quoted by TASS as saying Monday.\nIn particular, Iran is significantly outgunned by its Gulf rivals the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which is flying modern U.S. aircraft such as F-15s. Last year, Saudi Arabia purchased $1.5 billion worth of aircraft, while the UAE purchased $105 million worth, according to data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\nMeanwhile, Iran's military is an aging force populated with 1970s Soviet and American hardware, such as MiG-29 interceptors and U.S. F-4 Phantoms.\nEven then, the U.S. planes in Iran's inventory have only been kept flying by \"spare parts acquired in Vietnam that were left behind after the U.S. withdrawal,\" said Ben Moores, a senior military analyst at defense analytics firm IHS."}

By the end of the book you have to wonder when he ever sat down. The small, wiry genius didn\u2019t stop till his heart gave out.\nMark Kurlansky does a great job bringing Birdseye to life. He had limited material to work with, a lot of it erroneous. For one thing, Birdseye\u2019s accomplishments were so many and so innovative that he took on mythological attributes over time, inspiring some tall tales in the process. Through interviews, examination of official records and the discovery of a treasure trove of Birdseye\u2019s letters, what Kurlansky does is prove that the man is greater than the myth.\nThe city of Gloucester, Mass., where Birdseye worked and built his grand home on Eastern Point, already knows and appreciates the man who gave many work during the Great Depression. It was in Gloucester that Birdseye devised the methods for fast-freezing fish and other foods that would finally deliver the wealth that had eluded him.\nBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1886, Birdseye is characterized by Kurlansky as a 19th-century man, more mechanically than technologically oriented, with a curiosity that fueled relentless problem solving. He believed that everything could be improved upon. Whatever interested him, whether it was gardening or raising foxes or preserving fresh fish, could become the recipient of his unparalleled energies.\nBirdseye lived in an era of world-changing inventions and he was one of the world changers who, because he was ahead of his time, had to find ways to enable the world to use what he made.\nHe came from a well-to-do, connected family that hit hard times. He left college when he could no longer afford the tuition and set off on a life of extreme adventure. One of his life-threatening jobs was to collect ticks for a medical project on the deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever. By then he\u2019d learned a lot about hunting (a passion) and animals. He spent the days on horseback in the Montana Bitterroot canyons, rifle in hand.\nNext Birdseye developed a fox farming business \u2014 the Hammond and Birdseye Fur Company \u2014 in Labrador. Among his investors was Harris Hammond, brother of the inventor John Jays Hammond Jr., who also lived and worked in Gloucester.\n\u201cBirdseye traveled all over Labrador, often for days at a time, by dogsled. For instance, on January 10, 1913, he averaged almost 10 miles an hour, covering 65 miles in six and a half hours, which is the total amount of daylight in Labrador at that time of year.\u201d He was gone for three to six weeks at a time, writes Kurlansky.\nHammond was a \u201cfoodie\u201d who relished a vast variety of foods. His love of hunting was equal to his love of cooking and consuming what he bagged. It was in Labrador that he articulated what people already knew: the faster (and colder) animal flesh froze, the smaller the ice crystals and the less the damage to the flesh. Slower freezing meant that the larger crystals broke up and damaged the meat.\nIt would take more than a decade before Birdseye could put to"}

Also, cockroaches and mouse droppings were found on or near food at the ballpark.\nPatricia Buck, the co-founder and executive director of the Center for Foodborne Illness Research & Prevention, made mention of the fact that the number of patrons at a sporting event means food safety is of the utmost importance: \"There will be thousands of people at the stadium and there will be maybe 100 at a restaurant, so the sheer number of people being exposed is going to be higher, so it would tend to be riskier if something like contaminated romaine lettuce was going to be served on a taco.\"\nWhile the data is jarring in some cases, not all venues housing NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL teams are rife with violations.\nThe lowest percentage belongs to the Golden State Warriors' Oracle Arena at just 1.12 percent, which is nearly three percentage points better than the 4.17 percent of high-level violations that occurred at the second-place State Farm Arena of the Atlanta Hawks.\nOther venues that fared relatively well in the investigation include the Houston Texans' NRG Stadium (4.44 percent), the now-closed former home of the Milwaukee Bucks in the Bradley Center (6.67 percent) and the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium (7.33 percent).\nOf the 111 venues, four did not have enough vendor data to be included in the report.

With four rounds and a possible 200 points available, the championship is far from over.\nThe current champion Jonathan Rea continues to lead the way with a 70-point advantage over Kawasaki team-mate Tom Sykes. The numbers would suggest that the championship will be won by one of the Kawasaki pairing; factory Ducati rider Chaz Davies is a distant third, 35 points adrift of Sykes and 105 behind Rea.\nPortimao is a circuit that Rea is very familiar with; he is the only rider currently on the grid who has started all 16 races at the Algarve circuit. In fact Rea\u2019s first ever race in WSBK was at the circuit in 2008. Not surprisingly then, it is Rea who, with 230 points, is the highest scoring rider at the circuit. Next up is Sykes with 114.\nRea also has the highest number of podium finishes at Portomao, with 10 from 16 race starts. His nearest challenger for that particular accolade is Sylvain Guintoli, with five.\nOver the eight years that WSBK races have been held at Portimao, Rea is one of only three riders to take double wins, the other two being Max Biaggi and Troy Bayliss. All three riders went on to win the championship after doing so.\nIf either Sykes or Rea win race one on Saturday, Kawasaki will become the first manufacturer to record three consecutive wins at the circuit. Rea knows that he doesn\u2019t have to win every race to retain his title, and in doing so become the first rider to win three consecutive championships.\nHighly unlikely it may be, but if team-mate Sykes were to win the remaining eight races Rea could finish in second place eight times and he would still win the championship by 40 points.\nAt the last round in Germany at the Lausitzring Rea rode intelligently to two second places behind double race winner Davies, safe in the knowledge that he was extending his lead over Sykes, who came home third and fourth in the two races. This weekend the pressure is definitely on the chasing pack - or, more precisely, Tom Sykes.\nIn the Supersport supporting series, the Lausitzring was the first race this season where Kenan Sofuoglu finished and didn\u2019t win, ending his run of four straight victories. Importantly, Sofuoglu, who finished in second place, did finish ahead of his main rival, Licas Mahias, who came home third.\nThe race was won by Sheridan Morais, who became the fifth different winner this season.

Studio Tour invited me and a handful of other journalists to check out the newly-revamped DC Universe Exhibit, which now includes props and costumes from last year\u2019s superhero film Justice League. Typically, they don\u2019t allow video to be taken inside, but they lifted those restrictions for this event and let us bring our cameras inside to take a closer look.\nWhen I first moved to Los Angeles, I worked as a tour guide at Paramount Pictures. So a few years ago, I paid to take the Warner Bros. Studio Tour out of curiosity to see how it stacked up against other studio tours like Paramount, Sony, and Universal. I wrote a whole article about this, but spoiler alert: WB came out on top. The DC Universe exhibit has changed significantly since then: there\u2019s a whole section devoted to Wonder Woman (which, as I mention in the video, is soon going to be replaced by an Aquaman section), and one of the coolest additions to the room is a collection of original comic books from the DC Comics vault celebrating major milestones for their respective heroes.\nThe studio tour has a lot to offer for fans of DC properties. You\u2019ll see tons of filming locations, like the exterior of Commissioner Gordon\u2019s office from the 1966 Batman TV series, the exterior of The Daily Planet from Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, and places where more modern shows like Supergirl and The Flash filmed on the backlot. Nearly every Batman live-action movie shot at least something there, and you\u2019ll see alleyways and streets that appeared in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. There\u2019s a huge white light fixture that was used in the original Superman movie; the film\u2019s set dressers thought it\u2019d fit right in at the Fortress of Solitude.\nWhile this event \u2013 and the above video \u2013 was largely focused on DC stuff, there are a ton of other cool movie-related things to see there. We visited a massive prop house overflowing with elaborate chandeliers, musical instruments, furniture, and other knick-knacks. There\u2019s stuff in here that classic movie lovers would love to see: a piece from Casablanca, alternate statues from The Maltese Falcon, and a throne used in the 1935 Errol Flynn film Captain Blood. Elsewhere, there are costumes from Casablanca and Rebel Without a Cause. There\u2019s also one of studio co-founder Jack Warner\u2019s personal phone books, complete with the phones numbers for people like Walt Disney, Bette Davis, Olivia DeHaviland, Salvador Dali, Cecil B. DeMille, and more.\nSo yes, there are a lot of DC-related hotspots, but I don\u2019t want to make it seem like the tour is exclusively focused on those movies. In any case, I hope you enjoyed our look inside the DC Universe exhibit.

However, he has criticised the previous government for removing the requirement for a $50 contribution from people accessing legal aid.\n\"That put a rocket under the growth curve for legal aid so we're trying to manage it down to an acceptable level,\" he told NZPA last month.\nMr Power said today the Government was also looking to reduce crime costs through the prosecutors' service.\nThe Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill, currently before Parliament, included provisions to free up 16,000 hours of court time and reduce the number of court events by 43,000, he said.\n\"The monetary benefits are sizeable. It's estimated these changes could result in savings of $24m over a five-year period.\"\nHowever, stopping crime before it happened was the most important way to drive down costs, Mr Power said.\n\"This is significant because justice-sector growth is almost entirely driven by demand for services, starting with the police and then the court system.\n\"Of particular concern to me are district court criminal case volumes, which have increased by 14 per cent in the past five years. Remember that each and every person entering the system triggers an array of services at each stage of the process.\"\nKim Workman, the director of Government lobby group Rethinking Crime and Punishment, also spoke at the forum, focussing particularly on Maori crime.\n\"If the Government wants to be successful in reducing crime, it must acknowledge and address the downstream effects of imprisoning the Maori population,\" he said.\nMr Workman said 40 per cent of all Maori males over the age of 15 years had either been imprisoned or served a community sentence.\n\"High rates of imprisonment in vulnerable communities break down the social and family bonds that guide individuals away from crime, remove adults who would otherwise nurture children, deprive communities of income, reduce future income potential, and engender a deep resentment toward the legal system.\n\"As a result, communities become less capable of managing social order through family or social groups.

{"idx": "26684", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In a surprising moment of bipartisan unity, Republicans and Democrats seem to be in agreement that it's time to remove the prescription requirement for oral contraceptives. Right before Memorial Day, Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) introduced legislation aimed at making birth control pills available over the counter, and now Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has introduced a Democratic bill that also would add insurance coverage for a future OTC pill. Though the politics of these moves tend to get the disproportionate share of attention, it's worth exploring what the impact of either bill would be for women.\nSince 2004 I've led a coalition of researchers, doctors and women's health advocates exploring the feasibility of making birth control pills available without a prescription.\nThe science on this is clear: The pill is one of the best-studied medicines on the market today, and it's certainly safe enough to be available without a prescription. Some women have conditions that might make it more risky to take the pill, but studies show that women can use simple checklists on their own to figure out whether the pill is right for them. Other research shows that women getting the pill over the counter stay on it longer than women getting it by prescription. Major medical societies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians, support OTC access to the pill.\nSo do women. Studies show they are very interested in getting over-the-counter access to birth control pills, including about a third of women who currently don't use any birth control but are sexually active and don't want to get pregnant. This suggests that the OTC pill could lead to more women using effective contraception, with fewer gaps in use, which could help reduce unintended pregnancies.\nBut changing the pill from prescription-only to over-the-counter is no small feat, and it will require an interested pharmaceutical company with deep pockets. The research required by the Food and Drug Administration to consider such a change in status is costly. The Republican bill aims to motivate pharmaceutical companies by expediting the review process and waiving the FDA filing fee, which is at least $1 million.\nThere's another reason companies may hesitate to go forward with over-the-counter birth control pills: fear of political interference \u2014 and the costs and uncertainty it introduces \u2014 in the FDA approval process. When Plan B emergency contraception was being considered for over-the-counter sale, politicians of both parties intervened in the process, slowing it down and imposing an unreasonable age restriction, one that was lifted only after a 10-year legal battle.\nUnfortunately, the bill introduced by Ayotte and Gardner would also interfere with the FDA process. It would give priority FDA review and waive the filing fee only for an OTC pill to be sold to those older than 17. From a medical point of view, there is no more reason to prohibit adolescents from getting birth control pills without a prescription than to bar them from buying over-the-counter cough syrup. Research shows that allowing teens access to emergency contraception without a prescription has not led them to engage in riskier sexual activity. Adolescents often have their first sexual encounter before seeing a doctor or nurse to discuss contraception, and over-the-counter birth control pills could help reduce the high teen pregnancy rate in the U.S.\nThere are other issues with the age restriction in the Republican bill. Anyone trying to buy the pill over the counter would need to show proof of age. Many people with the most"}

But unless I'm traveling by car, no matter how little I bring on vacation, I wind up wishing I had packed less. By the time I have wheeled my roll aboard through airport security and to the gate, it feels like I am hauling a steamer trunk.\nStarting two years ago on a trip to Tibet, I substantially lightened my load by leaving my laptop at home and relying on what was then a newly-acquired Apple iPad as my sole means of staying connected (see \"A Financial Advice Wonk Falls For The iPad\"). Since then my husband and I have shed yet more baggage by using a variety of apps, run on an iPad or iPhone, instead of toting weighty paraphernalia.\nWhen the sun is shining, you can orient yourself by looking east (in the morning) or west (in the afternoon). On my vacations it usually rains, so it's helpful to have a more sophisticated tool, like a compass, along. The built-in one on the iPhone works on GPS technology and fits nicely in the pocket of the Gore-Tex raincoat that I wore almost every day of a recent European vacation.\nThe same app can also help you locate yourself on Google maps, and get directions to your next destination. But for this function you must have access to Wi-Fi, which is super inconvenient when touring most places in the world. Instead, I rely on CityMaps2Go. Actually, this app covers not just cities, but the tiniest towns in just about every country you can think of.\nOnce you have purchased the app for $1.99, you can download an unlimited number of maps, and use them to navigate according to street address or place name. On a trip to Spain last summer, these maps saved us hours in finding our way through the labyrinthine old city of Barcelona, where the street names seem to change every few blocks.\nI have yet to find an app that replaces a good guidebook for any location I have visited, but have used apps to supplement information from other sources. A recent addition to my virtual trip library is the TripAdvisor City Guides series. These downloadable guides to 50 cities include most of those on a recent list of the 20 most popular ones to visit in 2013.\nAlso check for apps that focus on specific places you want to visit. In Paris, we used the free one for the Louvre Museum, and liked it better than the museum\u2019s audio guide, which costs 5 euros.\nBy far the biggest suitcase space savers are photography apps. On our latest vacation we tried out the Camera+ app and were delighted with the results. For a slideshow that uses photos taken with this app, see \"Swiss Alpine Flowers.\"\nWe chose this app over the one that comes preloaded on the iPhone because of the extreme flexibility it offers to edit photos on the road. Managing the workflow is a multi-step process, however. Camera+ puts the pictures into a Lightbox. Once you have edited them and hit \"Save,\" they go into the Apple's Camera Roll, which you access using Photos--an app that comes built into the iPhone. From there you can sort your pictures into albums.\nWhat I missed in this process was being able to label the photos as I went along. For that, I bought the iPhoto app, which automatically syncs with Camera Roll when you open iPhoto. It too, allows you to edit, though not with nearly as much flexibility as Camera+. But it has a feature not included in the other apps: you can set it to include the location and date of each picture,"}

As well as rectifying the connectivity issues RIM's added some features to make the new Pearl even more enticing, now offering the connectivity of a smartphone, in a compact, consumer-friendly body.\nThe Pearl 3G has a lot in common with its chunkier brother the Blackberry Bold 9700, running Blackberry 5.0 OS and with the same 624Mhz procssor, which is noticebly quicker. 3G is a welcome addition, browsing is far faster and it finally supports WiFi.\nRIM hasn't tinkered with the build much. At 93g the Pearl 3G feels light and at 13mm deep will easily slip into a pocket. The metal edges have gone and on one side there's a new micro USB port and 3.5mm jack, the other has rubberised volume and camera controls.\nRIM's replaced the trackball with a touch-sensitive trackpad, which is nowhere near as eye catching and can on occasion be incredibly frustrating to use.

It's the only thing that spoils what is otherwise a very slick UI.\nBlackberry handsets have always been class leaders in email and the Pearl 3G is no exception, effortlessly synching 10 accounts into one mail box via the user-friendly Email Setup. The keyboard has transformed from QWERTY to alphanumeric. It's very much individual preference, but personally we prefer a QWERTY, even though having two letters per key like the original Pearl (and the current US version) was a bit cramped. But having it doesn't take long to become familiar with it and SureType technology is pretty accurate at memorising words you type frequently.\nThe 2.25-inch 360x400 screen is sharp, but tiny which limits browsing enjoyment. Unsurprisingly there's no Flash support but we should remember the Pearl 3G isn't trying to compete with the browsing capabilities of the HTC Desire or Apple iPhone, and it's fine for checking up on news headlines. The sceen is also a bit small for video beyond the occasional clip, although the on-board speaker is forceful enough for two people to listen comfortably.\nThe music player is acceptable.

But the company is moving ahead on another bold vision, in which it is seeking to disrupt the world of molecular imaging.\nInDi is announcing today it has set up a new division, called InDi Imaging, in Southern California near the Caltech lab of co-founder Jim Heath. The new division, which CEO Al Luderer says could be eventually spun out into an independent company, will be led by veteran executive Norm Hardman, a former president and CEO of Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: FOLD) and chief operating officer of Onyx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ONXX). InDi Imaging will also be advised by UCLA professor Michael Phelps, a pioneer of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, one of the workhorse technologies of modern medical imaging.\nThe idea here is to basically swap small molecules for the large molecules now used in the imaging world. Today\u2019s PET scanners depend on using genetically engineered antibodies that are attached to a radioactive tracer, which makes it possible for imaging instruments to construct a 3-D image of what\u2019s happening inside the body. While antibodies are good at specifically hitting certain molecular targets of interest, they are also bulky large molecules that can\u2019t hit all molecular structures in and around cells, they can cause immune reactions, they need to be carefully handled to remain stable, and they are difficult and expensive to manufacture at large scale.\nInDi says it can make small-molecule peptides, through synthetic chemistry techniques, that are cheaper and easier to manufacture in large volumes. These small molecules should also be able to precisely bind with just as many biological targets or more, while cutting down on immune-system reactions, Luderer says.\nIt\u2019s taken the InDi team a couple of years to figure out the strategy for how to best use this technology in the business world, Luderer says. It considered developing it as a replacement for proteins used in scientific instruments known as mass spectrometers, and then as a replacement in the antibody kits currently prepared by medical imaging suppliers.

{"idx": "26704", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Most of the new choreography one runs across in the normal course of dance-going has probably been modeled after Merce Cunningham. Chances are, too, that the best of it is Cunningham-inspired and that the best dancers have been Cunningham-trained at his school in New York.\nThere is, however, only one Merce and only one Merce Cunningham Dance Company , and he and it are appearing at the New York City Center through March 28 (during April and early May they also perform in California, in Austin, Texas, and in Mexico City). That Cunningham is still the one and only was proven by his opening-night bill, which was notable not only for the beauty of its choreographic ideas and physical presentation, but also for its range of expression.\nIf one will accept the notion that dance moods have climactic counterparts, one can then equate ''Trails'' with a dry summer day (about 80 degrees F., I should think), ''Inlets'' with a shivering drizzle, and ''Roadrunners'' with mid-fall, when all the joggers in training are clogging the streets.\nThat's a fair amount of weather to take in, and Cunningham makes it all beautiful in one way or another.\nThe most conventionally beautiful is ''Trails,'' the one world premiere of the season. With a hushed montage of natural sound by John Cage, called ''Instances of Silence''; and blazing red decor by Mark Lancaster, ''Trails'' might seem to be a study in extreme oppositions. The choreography, however, is temperate and finds Cunningham in his most lyrical disposition.\nOne is immediately struck by the spaciousness of ''Trails.'' Although composed for 10 dancers, Cunningham rarely deploys their energy all at once. Instead, he sprinkles the stage with only a few dancers at a time, and they maintain a comfortable distance from each other. Their movement is very lateral, ample and stretched; their rhythms at a steady, even pulse. ''Trails'' might take place in a meadow, where it is possible to be alone and together at the same time.\nBut even meadows have shadowy niches. There's a moment in ''Trails'' when what appears to be a chance look between two dancers introduces a new tone of tension, further elaborated in a duet. The latter portion of the dance slowly returns ''Trails'' to an even keel. It ends with the lone remaining couple blithely running off stage, perhaps in search of new trails. But that moment of slight intake of breath, when suddenly a whiff of the unfamiliar fills the air, fills the dance. It gives ''Trails'' a particular slant, and one that is true to life.\nThe other two dances, while not about life exactly, are more obviously about something specific. ''Inlets'' takes place behind a scrim; Cage's score of the same title evokes sounds of water and foghorns. The dancers appear somnambulant at times; at other times, they scurry like mice, secretly going about their business while the rest of the world sleeps. ''Inlets'' is about waiting, about marking time.\n''Inlets'' is not amusing. ''Roadrunners'' is a very amusing satire on the country's passion for keeping in shape. Its point is that athleticism is just a new way of expressing America's old love affair with gadgets and gear. Just how"}

The vendor will continue adding to its on-site services team, which will help the company grow its enterprise sales and services staff to 23,000. These moves are likely to increase tension between Microsoft and channel partners, who already feel the vendor stepping on their toes, say analysts. Simon Hayward, an analyst with Gartner Inc., in Stamford, Conn., said Microsoft needed to align its sales force with vertical solutions as it had \"pretty much saturated one area of the market.\"\nWitts denied channel conflict, adding that Microsoft is \"taking the serious step\" of moving the selling of services into its sales force under a program known as One Microsoft, where there is now one account team and one opportunity pipeline.\nThe number of specialists in the enterprise groups sales force is likely to double to 50 percent of the overall enterprise force in the next five years. The enterprise group is also setting up industry and specialist units to cover vertical specialization and support the account teams that cover the clients, Witts said.\nSome customers, such as John Engates, chief technology officer for Rackspace Ltd., a managed-hosting provider in San Antonio, with more than 6,000 Windows servers, welcomed this greater involvement. \"We have to manage hundreds of customers who all have different needs. Microsofts management and monitoring tools, as well as Active Directory, have always been designed for a big IT shop rather than for service providers,\" Engates said. \"The focus on vertical segments will enable us to have more input into what our specific needs as a hosting company are and see those reflected in the various products like IIS [Internet Information Services], SQL Server and its management tools.\""}
{"idx": "26710", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Two sub-$10 billion tech hardware stocks are trading lower. But which is a better buy?\nFor tech investors looking for stocks trading lower as 2015 comes to a close, Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) may be worth a closer look. Both were disappointing tech stocks during 2015, with GoPro being the worse performer of the two. Fitbit stock is down about 3.5% from the stock's opening price of $30.40 when shares first went public in June. Meanwhile, GoPro stock is down about 71% since the first of the year. Could either of these stocks be good investment opportunities after underperforming 2015?\nTo get a closer look at these two stocks, let's examine their size, competition, recent growth, and valuation.\nData source: Reuters and company filings.\nWhile GoPro is less than half the size of Fitbit, both of these companies are arguably small players compared to key competitors in the hardware space, such as the iDevice maker, Samsung, and Microsoft. At sub-$10 billion valuations, both of these companies could potentially benefit from secular growth in their respective markets.\nBut investors shouldn't automatically assume these companies' smaller sizes compared to established tech giants guarantees any growth. Both companies face similar uncertainty regarding their future, particularly ambiguity about whether Fitbit or GoPro will be able to fend off competition from more established peers if their well-capitalized competition puts more effort into competing directly with these newer companies.\nCompetition for both companies is on the rise. There are already a wide range of alternatives to Fitbit's devices surfacing, and GoPro's market overlaps closely with camera tech on smartphones.\nBoth companies are growing sales incredibly fast. But the nature of each companies' recent growth is quite different.\nThe most obvious difference in Fitbit's and GoPro's revenue growth, of course, is the rate of growth. Fitbit's 168% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 easily trumps GoPro's 43% growth during this same period.\nBut here's a surprising way in how Fitbit's growth differs even more: The wearable device maker's revenue is growing faster than its device sales as it benefits from a product sales shift toward a richer mix. Indeed, the average selling price for Fitbit's products jumped 33% year over year in Q3. On the other hand, GoPro's average selling prices for its products seem to have plateaued recently. And in light of the GoPro's second price cut on its lowest-cost camera in the Hero4 line, the Hero4 Session, which occurred at the beginning of December, it's likely the company's average selling price could decline in the fourth quarter.\nHero4 Session. Image source: GoPro.\nNo matter how you slice it, the market has priced in a greater premium for Fitbit's growth. In other words, the market believes there is a greater probability that Fitbit's earnings will grow at a faster rate than GoPro's over the long haul. Fitbit's premium valuation compared to GoPro's is evident both by its 49.6 price-to-earnings ratio compared to GoPro's at 15.1, as well as by their price-to-sales ratios of 3.9 and 1.5, respectively.\nBoth companies are certainly more interesting than they were earlier in the year when"}

This project aims to help make those models more realistic,\u201d Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral fellow based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said, according to NASA.\nThe robot, developed by NASA, can climb into areas that are inaccessible to humans.\nCurrently, NASA has one VolcanoBot already exploring a fissure in Hawaii. The new model, dubbed VolcanoBot 2, will be sent into the same volcano in March to explore it in much more intricate detail.\n\"It has better mobility, stronger motors and smaller (5 inch, or 12 centimeter) wheels than the VolcanoBot 1. We've decreased the amount of cords that come up to the surface when it's in a volcano,\" Parcheta said.\nVolcanoBot 1 is 30cm long and is mounted on wheels that are 17cm in diameter. It was loosely based on the pre-existing Durable Reconnaissance and Observation Platform (DROP), but was adapted and tailored especially for exploring volcanoes.\n\u201cWe took that concept and redesigned it to work inside a volcano,\u201d Parcheta said.\nUsing the bots, fissures and vents can be explored in detail.\n\u201cIn order to eventually understand how to predict eruptions and conduct hazard assessments, we need to understand how the magma is coming out of the ground. This is the first time we have been able to measure it directly, from the inside, to centimeter-scale accuracy,\u201d Parcheta added.\nThe first bot is already helping to make a 3D map of the fissure it has been exploring.\nIn May 2014, VolcanoBot 1 rolled down a fissure \u2013 a crack that erupts magma \u2013 to the depth of 82 feet (25 meters) of the active Kilauea volcano in Hawaii.\n\u201cThis is the first time we have been able to measure it directly, from the inside, to centimeter-scale accuracy,\" Parcheta said.\nNASA stated that the research could have implications for extraterrestrial volcanoes, as well as those on Earth.\n\u201cIn the last few years, NASA spacecraft have sent back incredible pictures of caves, fissures and what look like volcanic vents on Mars and the moon. We don't have the technology yet to explore them, but they are so tantalizing!\u201d Parcheta stated.\nCarolyn Parcheta undertook the research to develop the robot, alongside Aaron Parness at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\u201cWorking with Carolyn, we're trying to bridge that gap using volcanoes here on Earth for practice.

The learning process was long, and I realize now how I had to internalize a number of new concepts for the therapy to succeed.After much thought and work, therapy was beneficial and rewarding for me. I now know that because I took the process of psychotherapy seriously, it made my life more fulfilling and my relationships more meaningful. For me, psychotherapy was especially helpful in reinforcing my ability to deal with a chronic, debilitating, and life-threatening illness. It helped me make each day a gift, accept my imperfections, and live with uncertainty, frustration, and anger with more dignity and greater understanding.\nWe rarely divulge our personal thoughts in public, unless we feel a sudden sense of commonality and connection with a person or group of people. As an example, I think of the way we talk unguardedly with seatmates on airplanes\u2014perhaps because there is safety in anonymity and because the chance of seeing the person in the adjoining seat again is unlikely. In general, though, public relationships are uncertain, unknown, and uncontrollable. In such circumstances, our confessions, little voices of personal loss, or mean feelings may find their way to their subjects, to unsympathetic people known in common, or to difficult family members. Furthermore, we may be quoted in places or publications without our permission, leading to personal or legal embarrassments.\nThe freedom to speak openly and unguardedly is confidential in very circumscribed situations: with our lawyers and our physicians; with our priests, rabbis, or ministers; and most notably, with our psychotherapists (psychiatric physicians; psychiatric, clinical, and family social workers; clinical psychologists; and licensed lay psychotherapists, for the most part). The relationship between a qualified psychotherapist and a patient is a \u201csafe place,\u201d as described by Dr Leston Havens.1 Nevertheless, I learned that there are rules that govern such a therapeutic relationship, rules that must be adhered to, that have stood the test of time, and that ensure physical and mental safety, for both the therapist and the patient.\nWhile these rules, or \u201cboundaries,\u201d have been stated somewhat differently by various therapists, I describe them from my experience as follows: (1) The emphasis in therapy is almost exclusively on the life and thoughts of the patient; (2) The therapist concentrates on finding ways to communicate meaningfully and helpfully with the patient about his or her difficulties using examples and knowledge from the therapist\u2019s training and experience; (3) While the personality of the therapist is paramount to his or her success in therapeutic relationships, the therapist does not share his personal life, family information or problems, and especially, identity of or information about other patients; (4) The therapist may find ways to build the patient\u2019s self-esteem by expressing admiration or joy for the patient or his success during therapy as well as concern for the patient\u2019s well-being. A competent psychotherapist, however, does not disclose sexual attraction or love for the patient (nor distaste or dislike of the patient). If the therapist has sexual or loving feelings for the patient, or truly dislikes a patient, referral to another therapist is the answer.\nTransference is not usually recognized by the patient (the therapist is trained to recognize both transference and countertransference); many patients feel that they have a special (frequently loving) relationship with their therapist or that they distrust or even hate their therapist.

I happened upon a series of videos by Muttnchop Piper, a YouTuber who runs a channel on pipe smoking and tobacco.\nI was surprised by how good, and charming, these videos are. He talks about how the game brought him and his grown son closer together. His son is an artist, and growing up, wasn't into the typical things, like \"hunting and fishing.\" His son introduced him to the game, and as you can clearly tell from the videos, Muttnchop Piper has really taken to it. He and his son play the game every Thursday.\nIn the videos, he describes the world of Netrunner, how to play one of the Corporations, how to play a Runner, and he runs through a sample game. There are a lot of how-to-play Netrunner videos out there, but I don't think there's a better intro series than the one from this unlikely of sources.\nI also like this brief video explaining why you should play Netrunner. I love this game and think it evokes a cyberpunk world better than just about anything short of reading a novel in the genre. I strongly disagree with this reviewer's assessment that Netrunner is not a dark future. It says \"dystopian\" right on the box! I do agree that this game feels even more timely and relevant than it did when it was first released 5 years ago.

Sure, we\u2019ll get an abridged version of the Jury Q&A that took place this weekend during the jam-packed finale set to air on Tuesday night but I\u2019d rather we get more of that and less footage of stuff we\u2019ve already seen in previous episodes.\nIn addition to rerun clips including some of the fights, Keesha\u2019s disastrous Birthday party, Dan\u2019s hilarious chat with Renny about time zones, the infamous Brian puppet show and Jerry causing trouble with his name-calling, we also got to see some of the other shenanigans that the houseguests have engaged in over the course of the season.\nIt\u2019s understandable that goofing off would be high up on the to-do list in the Big Brother house. They have no TV, books (except for the bible), phone or internet so it makes sense that some of them might try to make their own fun. Earlier in the season the houseguests played make-believe by performing a late night talk show in their living room. This involved Dan hosting the event, sporting a fake mustache and some matching fake-chest hair as he interviewed various guests. Ollie took the role of a hippie guy and bragged about having numerous children with various women. And some of the girls (and Memphis) gave Angie a makeover. It\u2019s weird to see the houseguests having fun as a group considering all of tears and drama that would eventually erupt on an almost weekly basis.\nAlso among the unseen footage were Dan\u2019s pranks on Keesha. He describes his relationship with Keesha as that of a younger-brother/older-sister friendship. It makes sense as his idea of having fun with her involves putting ice down her back, dumping a bucket of cold water on her in the shower and jumping out and scaring her. Basically all the things a bratty brother might do to his big sister. Had Dan not constantly expressed his loyalty and adoration towards his girlfriend on numerous occasions, I might even have perceived his behavior as being a little bit flirty but the harmless kind that doesn\u2019t amount to much (unless you\u2019re in the 5th grade, in which case the rules are entirely different with the above listed social behavior).\nSpeaking of Dan, we got to see his Swim Club classes. This was something he did earlier in the season as a way to motivate Renny and Ollie to learn how to swim. Dan demonstrated his teaching skills admirably with his two students. He even gave them Fight Club-style rules for Swim Club and from what we were shown, he was successful in getting both Renny and Ollie to swim. Now if only he can help Ollie overcome his bird fear.\nOne of the things that stood out in the clip show was that Dan was a big source of amusement in the BB house this year. Memphis was not without a sense of humor as he was often seen sitting in the background snickering at the other people and he definitely got into the Late Night stuff but Dan seemed to put the most effort into finding ways to make himself and the other houseguests laugh.\nThis episode was almost entirely made up of filler, but since the season is drawing to a close, it was kind of nice to review some of the highlights from the season.

While memes can focus on specific topics, they can also be used to reflect the general attitude and mood of students on larger campus issues, he said.\nThe University student group has already used memes to comment on campus issues.

Investors with consistent personal income above $200,000 per year or a net worth, excluding a primary residence, of $1 million are considered accredited.\nIt is important to note that many impact investments are effectively open only to institutional investors and people or families of such high net worth that they invest at institutional scale.\nThis article is not for them. If you are a billionaire impact investor, you can stop reading now.\nThankfully, there are a few and that is all you need to start investing.\nGeorgandellis's comment begs another question of definitions. What is the difference between socially responsible investing and impact investing? Traditionally, socially responsible investing has been about applying negative screens to portfolios, a movement that began with investors divesting their holdings in companies with operations in South Africa to end apartheid there. Since then, the movement has begun to focus on environmental, social and (corporate) governance or ESG standards for screening good companies.\nThere are a number of funds and ratings schemes for scoring ESG, including some that give high scores to oil companies, a judgment that some environmentalists would scorn. Relatively few publicly traded companies are operating a business that would qualify as an impact investment. Tesla is an example of a public company I hold as an impact investment.\nSome purists would argue, however, that an investment made in the secondary market (buying and selling stocks from other investors rather than upon their issuance from the company) isn\u2019t an impact investment because the company didn\u2019t get the money or use it for good. Given that when a new investor buys shares from an original impact investor the transaction provides liquidity and perhaps a return on investment to the original impact investor, it could be argued that the investment has a positive impact. For purposes of this article, I will include secondary investments as impact investments.\nSo, the easiest way to become an impact investor is to build a portfolio of publicly traded stocks in companies that do things you like. You might, for instance, build a portfolio of companies in clean-tech and renewable energy.\nIncreasingly, the line between socially responsible investing traditionally focused on ESG scores and impact investing is blurring. You may conclude that some socially responsible investing funds are doing enough good to qualify for impact investments in your"}

You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean. If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.\nBut if you never disavow your affiliation with a neo-Nazi organization, if you never risk public shame and the loss of a job by coming out of the white-supremacist closet, then you might one day find yourself outed by the Southern Poverty Law Center. And you'll look like a guy who made no effort to break with his sorry past in a way that might warrant some sympathy.\nSomething like that happened to a 65-year-old attorney who had a contract with the city of Baltimore to handle some sensitive litigation. Apprised of the situation, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration decided posthaste last week to end its relationship with attorney Glen Keith Allen, a contract employee outed for having been a supporter of the neo-Nazi National Alliance.\nAllen didn't put up a squawk. He went quietly, agreeing to have his contract terminated.\nWhen contacted by The Baltimore Sun, he described himself as a casual member of the National Alliance in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He acknowledged buying some books published by the alliance and providing the organization with some legal advice. But he said he hasn't been a member in more than a decade.\n\"Whether you believe me or not,\" he told The Sun, \"I'm not a member of the National Alliance, haven't been for many years.\"\nOf his past affiliation with the group, he said, \"I will acknowledge emphatically that that was a huge mistake.\"\nFine, but it's too late. And you get the feeling Allen realized that.\nAdmitting you once paid dues to a neo-Nazi group is not like saying you smoked pot in college. It's far more serious, especially if you maintained the habit well beyond the youthful experimentation stage.\nSo, yeah, Allen knew what was coming, and his deal with the city is over. So is the city's deal with the man who hired him. George Nilson is no longer city solicitor.\nBaltimore City Solicitor George A. Nilson said Saturday that he believes he was \"mistreated\" by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who fired him from city government Friday without meeting with him.\nAll of this because Allen did not take the time, a decade ago, to shake his connection with the National Alliance in some way that might have made his past affiliation tolerable, if not forgivable.\nI don't think people should lose their jobs because of what they think. We should abhor negative consequences for personally held beliefs. But, in this case, what happened was in the best interest of citizens of Baltimore.\nSorry, but you don't get to keep secret your onetime affinity for a neo-Nazi group and take part in the city's legal defense of a lawsuit brought by a black man who alleges that Baltimore police withheld and fabricated evidence to convict him wrongfully of murder.

Now, retailer GameStop has released numbers giving a much stronger indication of just how many people are still clamoring for next-generation systems just before today's launch of the Xbox One.\nThe major chain, which operates over 6,600 locations worldwide (mainly in North America), said in an earnings call yesterday that its initial allocation of PS4 systems is completely spoken for. What's more, the retailer has logged 2.3 million customers on its \"first-to-know\" list seeking information on when more supply comes in for the Xbox One and PS4.\nWhile GameStop's \"first-to-know\" list may have some overlap with customers that managed to get systems elsewhere, the number is the most concrete sign yet that strong sales for the new consoles will last past the holiday season rather than quickly tapering off after the expected initial sellout (see the Saturn, Dreamcast, original Xbox, GameCube, and even the PS3 for examples of such post-launch tapering). The huge number of interested potential buyers also jibes with other tidbits showing strong post-launch demand for the PS4, such as similar sellout reports from retailer Best Buy and thousands of eBay auctions with significant markups.\nFor its part, Sony expects to be able to keep stores supplied and ready to fill that demand through the holiday season and to meet worldwide sales targets of 5 million systems by the end of March. \"[This is] the first platform launch that I\u2019ve ever been involved with where we\u2019ve had such a good production ramp up and a good sense of supply,\" Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House told Game Informer in a recent interview. \"I think through the holiday season that we'll be in good supply.\"\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, says it's expecting difficulty in keeping retailers stocked through the end of the year. \"There will be difficulty getting stock through until Christmas but we will do everything we can to accelerate that,\" Microsoft Xbox VP Phil Harrison told MCV.\nHarrison also kept supply expectations low when in an talk with GamesIndutry.biz surrounding today's Xbox One launch. \"I can only apologize in advance to anybody who is let down before Christmas,\" he said. \"We don't want to lose a sale, clearly, and we'll work hard in our operations and our manufacturing supply chain and obviously with our retail partners to make sure we catch up as quickly as we can.\"\nHarrison was quick to point to \"unprecedented\" pre-orders for the Xbox One as the main cause of any supply shortages and said the launch numbers for the system will be \"significantly bigger than [Xbox] 360.\" Of course, we're going to have to wait a bit for some actual sales numbers before we can really evaluate those statements. All in all, though, it seems likely that we'll be seeing a lot of fights between angry parents scrambling for that last PS4 or Xbox One in the aisles of electronics stores this holiday season."}

The International Committee of the Red Cross said that more than 800 civilians had been killed in \u201cintercommunal\u201d violence in the town, where tens of thousands of Ivorian civilians have been displaced by fighting between the forces of Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of a November election, and Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to step down.\n\u201cWe are shocked by the brutality and scale of this act,\u201d said Dominique Liengme, the Red Cross\u2019s representative in Ivory Coast.\nAs the United Nations and humanitarian organizations sought to tally the dead in Duekoue, rival forces battled for control of the commercial capital, Abidjan, where key installations seized Friday by Ouattara\u2019s forces, including the national radio station, fell back into the hands of Gbagbo\u2019s troops Saturday morning.\nAlain Le Roy, the U.N. undersecretary general for peacekeeping, said in an interview Saturday that Gbagbo\u2019s forces were firing indiscriminately in urban neighborhoods.\nThe violence in Ivory Coast has its most recent roots in the country\u2019s disputed Nov. 28 runoff presidential election. Gbagbo lost to Ouattara in a U.N.-certified vote that was largely backed by foreign governments, but he has refused to cede power. Several months of high-level diplomatic efforts, combined with financial sanctions, have failed to budge him.\nU.N. officials and human rights groups say that in an effort to consolidate power, Gbagbo\u2019s forces have perpetrated serious human rights abuses against civilians suspected of supporting Ouattara, as well as attacking U.N. installations and personnel.\nLast month, a coalition of former rebel groups, police and soldiers mounted a military offensive against Gbagbo, beginning in the rebel stronghold in northern Ivory Coast. The armed movement met with relatively little resistance as it seized town after town, capturing control of the administrative capital, Yamoussoukro, last week, and bringing the fight to Gbagbo\u2019s stronghold in Abijdan on Friday.\nBut Ouattara\u2019s forces have also been accused of carrying out reprisal killings and extrajudicial executions of prisoners during their march to the capital.\nLe Roy said that there clearly had been \u201ckillings by the hundreds\u201d in Duekoue, long the scene of inter-ethnic violence between tribes supporting the rival camps.\n\u201cI understand it has mostly been done by forces close to Ouattara,\u201d Le Roy said of the massacre, adding that Ouattara\u2019s camp has acknowledged killing a large number of people there but claiming they were members of an armed militia, not civilians.\nHe also said Ouattara has agreed to an independent investigation of the killings."}

The film \"Lobster War: The Fight Over the World's Richest Fishing Grounds,\" which documents the struggle between Maine and Canadian fishermen for the lobster catch that has come to represent Maine, will be shown Sunday at Railroad Square Cinema in Waterville, featuring lobster fishermen and their boats from both sides. Photo courtesy of \"Lobster War\"\nThe waters off Machias Seal Island along the Maine coast are beautiful, but the war between U.S. and Canadian fishermen fighting over territory where climate change has caused the lobster population to explode is decidedly ugly.\nThat conflict is portrayed in vivid detail in \u201cLobster War: The Fight Over the World\u2019s Richest Fishing Grounds,\u201d an award-winning documentary film co-directed and produced by David Abel, a Boston Globe reporter, and Andrew Laub, a writer, editor, filmmaker, cinematographer, visual effects artist and soundtrack composer.\nThe film will be shown at 7:15 p.m. Sunday at Railroad Square Cinema in Waterville. Abel will engage in a question-and-answer session with the audience via Skype after the showing.\nThe 2018 film focuses on the clash between the U.S. and Canada over 277 square miles of ocean off the 20-acre Machias Seal Island that both countries have claimed since the end of the Revolutionary War, according to Abel. U.S. lobster fishermen traditionally fished the so-called Gray Zone, but as the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than nearly any other water body on Earth, the lobster population there has grown significantly, prompting Canadian fishermen to assert their sovereignty there, he said. Fighting between Canadian and American fishermen over the territory has been ongoing, with threats of violence and sabotage.\nAbel, an environmental reporter who has long covered fisheries issues, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that \u201cLobster War\u201d shows how the warming waters of the Gulf of Maine are affecting lobster, Maine\u2019s iconic species, whose population for the last 15-plus years has boomed, partly as a result of climate change.\n\u201cMy interest was in looking at how climate change has exacerbated this centuries-old dispute, because Canada and the U.S. both claim the waters around Machias Seal Island,\u201d Abel said.\nSince the lobster surge and the value of the catch increased, the area has attracted more Canadian fishermen. Lobstermen on both sides have accused each other of stealing lines and gear and setting their traps on top of the other\u2019s, according to Abel. One U.S. fisherman reportedly lost a thumb as he was trying to disentangle traps from Canadian lines.\nAbel was part of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news in the Globe\u2019s coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings.

Also, the Obama administration had already signed off on requiring managed care for tens of thousands of Florida seniors who need Medicaid-funded long-term care.\nBut Friday\u2019s announcement was a victory for Gov. Rick Scott and Republican lawmakers who approved the proposal to move to statewide Medicaid managed care in 2011, amid controversy about whether the changes would best serve the needs of low-income Floridians.\nScott this year lobbied U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for approval and said the managed-care changes will lead to improved coordination of care for beneficiaries. Republicans also have argued that the changes will help control rising Medicaid costs.\nBut Florida CHAIN also said patients and advocates will have to remain \u201cvigilant\u201d and pointed, in part, to controversies about a Medicaid managed-care pilot program that began in 2006 and 2007 in Broward, Duval, Clay, Baker and Nassau counties.\nThe state Agency for Health Care Administration said the plan approved Friday ultimately could affect 2.9 million people, with enrollment in managed-care plans tentatively scheduled to start in April 2014. The related move to enroll seniors in managed-care plans is slated to start this August in central Florida.\nIn the approval letter, federal officials also signed off on the continuation of a $1-billion-a-year program that helps hospitals and other providers care for uninsured and low-income people. That program, known as the Low Income Pool, is closely watched by the state\u2019s hospital industry.\nAlong with people in the five pilot counties, hundreds of thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries already get care through HMOs. But others are part of a health-care payment system known as \u201cfee for service\u201d that critics have long derided as fragmented.\nScott and Republican lawmakers in 2011 approved making managed-care enrollment mandatory for almost all beneficiaries statewide and set up a process that involves HMOs and other types of plans, known as provider-service networks, competing for contracts in 11 different regions. The state needed federal approval before it could move forward with the changes, and the process crept slowly as AHCA and Obama administration officials negotiated details.\nEven though final approval did not come until Friday, AHCA has already started the process of selecting managed-care plans to serve the 2.9 million people.

{"idx": "26737", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: While Americans are focusing on the potential outcomes of the fall Congressional elections, there is another election going on that will have ramifications for Americans. There is a high-profile campaign happening right now in Brazil that may help determine if Central and South America will move away from the corrupt socialist policies we see being promoted in Venezuela and Cuba toward free market-oriented policies promoted by the likes of a candidate who is likely to be the next President of Brazil.\nThis past week, Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) almost won the Presidential contest with 46% of the vote in Brazil, running on a conservative platform. The New York Times reported on October 7, 2018, \u201cBrazilians will now vote in the runoff election on Oct. 28 between Mr. Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad, the leftist Workers\u2019 Party candidate. The two men represent radically different visions for Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, where leftists have won the presidency in every election since 2002.\u201d This election is a bell weather on the future of politics in the Americas.\nMany have compared Bolsonaro with President Donald J. Trump because of his tough tone and push against the establishment dominating Brazil. Bloomberg interviewed Bolsonaro on the issues in October 17, 2017 and he promoted an overall message to rid Brazil of corruption. He said he would \u201cconsider the privatization of state companies in all sectors,\u201d because the sales will both boost competitiveness and \u201cnullify issues of corruption in state owned companies.\u201d He also said he wanted to lower the borrowing costs by cutting interest rates from 8.5% to 2%. This would serve to help jumpstart the private sector and to take away a built-in competitive advantage for state run companies. Also, a trade goal is to lessen commerce with China to shift to a bigger trade relationship with the United States. All of these policies will help Brazil and the United States economies to grow.\nBolsonaro has the political benefit of running against a current leadership that has demonstrably destroyed the Brazilian economy, engaged in rampant corruption and an allowed epidemic of crime to spread. Luiz Inacio \u201cLula\u201d da Silva was president from 2003 to 2011 and ended up in jail for bribing politicians on behalf a big state-owned oil company in Brazil. Lula was succeeded by Dilma Rousseff who also was embroiled in the same corruption scandal and was impeached by Brazil\u2019s legislature for her role in the scandal. Rouseff was succeeded by Michel Temer, a more moderate politician, who entered office with an abysmal popularity rating. During this time of rule for socialists, the Brazilian economy crashed, and crime spread through the nation. Brazilian voters dislike the corrupt establishment in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, much like Americans hold Washington, D.C. in disdain.\nMuch like the left in the United States has adopted a very aggressive form of confrontation and harassment of political opponents, the same has happened in Brazil. The left accuses Bolsonaro of seeking to reimpose a military dictatorship if he is elected. The left-wing fear mongering lead to an assassination attempt on the life of Bolsonaro who was stabbed at a campaign event that almost took his life.

To create a road map for new treatments, though, they needed new equipment\u2014and fast. The quickest way to get that, they decided, was via a crowdfunding campaign.\nThe public quickly responded. In less than two weeks, the fundraising effort on Crowdrise has collected $99,450, putting it just shy of its $100,000 goal.\n\"When you think about Kickstarter, everyone who puts in money is receiving a product,\" said Saphire. \"This is pure altruism. ... I was really touched and honored.\"\nTwenty-five laboratories in seven countries are sending antibodies to Scripps so that Saphire and other researchers can hunt for the best medicine to fight against Ebola. The new equipment will help process them and accelerate her work.\nThe institute is also seeking to improve ZMapp and to develop alternative treatments, a spokesman told Reuters. The hopeful cure is a mix of three antibodies that are designed to bind to proteins of the virus, which will prevent it from replication and triggering the immune response of infected cells.\nSaphire is quick to note that the National Institutes of Health has been a very strong supporter of the work Scripps has done over the past several years in researching the disease but says the current surge in Ebola-related federal spending has been in the testing and delivery of drugs and vaccines.\nBasic research, like that done at Scripps, must still go through the same funding processes it has for years, meaning the money often doesn't arrive for 12 to 18 months.\nSamples of the virus, though, are arriving at the institute's labs regularly, as are requests from other labs for copies of the proteins.\nAdding to the urgency is the fact that the virus has undergone many mutations since the 1994 outbreak. Understanding those changes is key to both conquering and preventing the spread of Ebola.\n\"We're like enemy reconnaissance,\" said Saphire. \"When you see the military bomb a particular room of a house to get someone, that's because it had intel photos telling it where to hit. The structure of the virus molecule is like that. It tells the weak points. ... Sequencing tells us what the changes are [compared to older samples of the virus]. The question is, What does that mean? If it has replaced one amino acid for another, has it changed the structure or the function? We have to understand how each of the molecules is behaving differently than before.\"\nRead MoreEbola: Is the world ready for the next deadly pandemic?\nMany crowdfunding efforts continue after they've met their goals, using the additional money to obtain additional equipment or resources.

{"idx": "26741", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There's no doubt the unprecedented recall of 100 million defective air bags made by Auburn Hills-based Takata Corp., linked to more than a dozen deaths, punctured the reputations of Japan-based Toyota Motor Corp. and other carmakers.\nIt also forced some of these companies to cough up $553 million to resolve loss claims, so far.\nFor all that, these frenemies have a vested interest in keeping Takata alive.\nCarmakers want to sustain Takata for the same reason clothing manufacturers and mall owners have kept department store Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears Holdings Corp. on life support years after it stopped booking profits, and why governments have spent billions to bail out banks deemed too big to fail.\nLike those companies, Takata is an important cog in an interdependent global supply chain: It's the second-largest producer of air bags around the world, not to mention the seat belts, steering wheels and other parts that account for two-thirds of its $6 billion in annual revenue.\nWiping Takata off the map could seriously disrupt the intricate, just-in-time operations of global automakers (it's not as easy as you might think to quickly switch suppliers). That would also drive further consolidation among car parts makers, which could lead to higher prices for vehicle manufacturers and ultimately, consumers.\nTo avoid that, Takata's customers, the carmakers, are going to have to pony up even more money to bail out the parts supplier.\nTakata has agreed to pay U.S. regulators, consumers and car manufacturers $1 billion in penalties. Plus, it will have to cover the costs of replacing more than 100 million air bags. Estimates for how much that will cost vary wildly, running from $3.5 billion to $24 billion. For some perspective, the company has only $700 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total assets were $3.9 billion as of March 31.\nTakata has been trying to stave off bankruptcy for months because if the process gets messy, which it probably will, it could interfere with the most important thing sustaining the company's asset value: its production lines. Yet on Friday, Bloomberg News reported that Takata could file for bankruptcy as early as next week.\nThe bulk of the company is expected to end up in the hands of Sterling Heights-based Key Safety Systems Inc., the auto parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp., which could pay $1.8 billion for parts of Takata's operations.\nNingbo Joyson is owned by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianfeng and has been on an acquisition spree of parts suppliers around the world. Buying Takata, despite the headaches and the potential of overpaying for a hurting enterprise, could vault Key Safety into the second-largest supplier of air bags in the world, benefiting Wang's wider auto parts empire.\nThe recall could cost Takata $24 billion.\nStill, even with certain liabilities canceled out in bankruptcy, and a cash infusion from Key Safety, it's unclear how Takata reaches that eye-popping $24 billion number for which it might be on the hook. It's going to need a little bit more help from its friends. Er, frenemies.\nShelly Banjo is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering industrial companies and conglomerates.

Around the web, you can find plenty of ideas for resolutions for 2007. CodePink suggests talking to someone different from yourself about why you believe we need to end the war in Iraq, writing one letter to the editor each month, and joining a host of antiwar groups in Washington, DC, on January 27 to present the Mandate for Peace to Congress. (CodePink is also soliciting resolutions, which will be published online.) WireTap surveys young activists across the nation who share their own resolutions you can use to make a difference. Martha Rosenberg offers eleven useful resolutions for Big Pharma in a piece on CommonDreams.\nWriting in the same WorldChanging series, Jason Kottke calls for a True Cost rating on food and products, like the nutritional information on a cereal box or the Energy Star rating on a refrigerator. True Cost, as he points out, would allow consumers to make legitimately informed decisions about how they spend their money. When True Cost is factored in, conflict diamonds become a more morally charged choice, as does clothing made in sweatshops. Organic blueberries flown in from Chile may be healthier for your toddler, but how much carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere to get them to your kitchen? What\u2019s the energy cost of living in the suburbs, compared to living downtown? Do the people who made the clock hanging on the wall get paid a fair wage and receive health care? Just how bad for the environment (and for me!) is the laptop on which I\u2019m typing or the cell phone on which I\u2019m talking?\nNumerous economists have made the case that the value of transactions is determined far too narrowly by the reigning neo-classical economic model. True Cost tries to offer a counter-framework in which the value of an item includes a number of factors beyond its market price, centrally its environmental, social and health costs. The environmental cost of aviation, for example, could add five hundred dollars per passenger to airline travel. Farming and forestry prices reflect the immediate costs of labor and capital, but do not include long-run ecological costs. Paying two dollars per pound for supermarket chicken does not cover the cost of cleaning up rivers polluted by poultry factories. That charge goes to society at large.\nIn a nutshell, it seems to me that if we can ever make use of Kottke\u2019s idea and have some kind of True Cost estimate available to consumers, it would be a major step forward. Working toward that seems to me a good resolution for 2007."}

One of the core management skills we taught them (this was the group\u2019s choice) was listening. I was thrilled they chose this skill. I dedicated the entire first chapter of Growing Great Employees to listening; I believe it\u2019s foundational to success for both managers and leaders.\nDuring the program, which we conduct twice yearly, I offer 30-minute individual mini-coaching sessions to the participants. One of the women I spoke with told me that, though she had found the listening segment dramatically useful, she also wanted to know how to get people to listen to her.\n1. Listen. This may seem counter-intuitive, but by far the most effective way to get people\u2019s attention is to give them yours. When you truly listen to someone \u2013 when you offer them your undivided focus, summarize their main points to make sure you\u2019re tracking, ask curiosity-based questions to find out more \u2013 you\u2019re demonstrating openness and respect in a powerful way. Most people automatically want to hear what someone who seems interested in them might have to say.\n2. Cut to the chase. I was facilitating a meeting a few years ago for a senior operating group, most of whom were quite talkative, and at the same time quite good listeners. There was one guy, though \u2013 he would start talking, and within a minute or two, people\u2019s attention would drift. I found I kept interrupting him (respectfully), trying to summarize for him, and he\u2019d simply go off in another direction. It was really chewing up the group\u2019s time, and breaking their focus.\n\u201cTry to explain less,\u201d I advised. He looked puzzled. \u201cWhen you say something complex, and people aren\u2019t getting it, it\u2019s not going to help, generally, to say additional complex stuff. Before you start talking, take a minute to think about how to communicate the essence of your message in a simple way.\u201d Happily, he made a real effort to follow my advice, and people were better able to listen to him. I read a really great article today by Kare Anderson in the Harvard Business Review blog, talking about just this situation. If you have a problem communicating in a simple, compelling way, I strongly suggest you read it.\n3. Read the Room. If you\u2019re talking to someone or to a group, and they\u2019re not giving you their attention (surreptitiously looking at their phones, doodling, looking out the window, writing emails), they\u2019re not listening to you. As above, you talking more is probably not going to help. Stop talking. Ask a question; find out what they\u2019re interested in hearing. Even if you\u2019re the most compelling speaker in the world, people won\u2019t listen to you if they\u2019re not interested in your topic. The depth of your passion for taxidermy is not going to engage your vegan friends \u2013 I don\u2019t care how articulate you are.\nTo boil it down: if you want people to listen to you, first listen to them. And when you do talk, focus on topics they find interesting, and paint a vivid picture \u2013 use clear, compelling words and images.\nSimple advice \u2013 but simple doesn\u2019t mean easy. I\u2019d love to hear experiences you\u2019ve had in trying to get people (especially at work) to listen to you. What\u2019s worked for you and what hasn\u2019t?"}

Judge Gray said he would pass sentence later on the other charges, conspiracy to murder and tampering with a witness, but set no date.\nAfter the verdict and her sentencing, Mrs. Smart marched brusquely out of the courtroom past a phalanx of spectators.\nLater, outside the red brick Rockingham County Courthouse, the defendant's mother-in-law said, \"Everything feels great -- she got what she deserved.\"\nMr. Smart added: \"We've said from the beginning that this woman was cold and manipulating.

In primaries and special elections in five states -- Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington -- socialist-leaning Democrats challenged their party's establishment, with mixed results, while President Donald Trump boosted GOP challengers far on the right, with mixed results.\nAnd of course the big story is in Ohio, where, as of late Tuesday night, Republican Troy Balderson narrowly leads a special congressional election that, on paper, Republicans should have won by miles.\nHere are the night's winners and losers.\n--House Democrats (their morale at least): Almost any way you slice the numbers, Ohio's 12th congressional district in the northern Columbus suburbs wasn't supposed to be competitive for Democrats. And yet Democrat Danny O'Connor still has Republicans biting their nails in this special election. With thousands of provisional ballots left to be counted, Balderson is ahead, but O'Connor hasn't conceded.\nVoters in Republican-leaning suburban districts are souring on Trump.\nLargely because of that, a wave that will sweep Republicans out of power appears to be building.\n--Female governor nominees: Nowhere is there a stronger gender disparity in U.S. politics than in America's governor's mansions. Right now there are a grand total of six female governors.\nOn Tuesday, voters in 2018 set a new record for female nominees for governor in either major party, according to data collected by the Center for American Women and Politics. Democratic voters nominated women for the governor's mansion in Michigan and Kansas, bringing the total of female nominees for governors to 11.\nNot all of these women will win in November, but gender experts say just having more women run for office can narrow a subtler gender gap: how voters put different expectations on female candidates than they do male candidates.\n--Labor unions: They claimed a huge victory Tuesday night by overturning a right to work law Missouri Republicans signed last year. Labor unions spent millions to get voters to reject the law by ballot initiative on Tuesday, meaning unions in Missouri can once again collect dues from nonunion members.\n--Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.: It was more of an annoyance than any real electoral threat. But the Kansas Republican had to make sure primary voters knew he was their actual congressman. A challenger, Ron M. Estes, got on the ballot -- and earned a few national headlines for it. The congressman ended up being the winning Estes on Tuesday.\nJennifer Bendery tweeted \"Hands down, the best primary tonight is in Kansas' 4th congressional district. It's Ron Estes versus... Ron Estes.\"\n--Trump's endorsement record: Trump made his riskiest endorsement this week in the Kansas GOP governor's primary. He choose conservative firebrand Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach over the current Kansas governor, Jeff Colyer. Despite Trump's endorsement, the race was close and as of late Tuesday night, still undecided.\nTrump also has yet to prove he has clout in general elections. From last fall's Virginia governor's race, to a December Alabama Senate special election, to a March Pennsylvania special congressional election and now, to Ohio's special congressional election, his high-profile endorsed candidates have either lost or, in Balderson's case, had a much closer race than they"}

He returned to Boston and promptly told Barrett that he had just seen a show about a tone-deaf singer and he was confident she was the perfect person to play the role.

Ryan Kesler won the faceoff back to the Ducks\u2019 zone and Cam Fowler picked it up from goalie John Gibson. Fowler passed it to Jakob Silfverberg, who changed places with the defenseman and retreated behind the Anaheim net.\nSilfverberg waited \u2013 and waited \u2013 until Fowler circled back to pick up the puck.

There just wasn\u2019t much there so we tried to be patient and do the best we can.\nGetzlaf let out a big laugh when the topic was broached.

It doesn't matter if we're playing with Modest Mouse or playing a show in Missouri with only five people.\"\nAccording to Pierszalowski, the biggest advantage of being a full-time band now is the bonds they've birthed and the ability of having more creative minds to work with; when their creative juices don't suffice, their unity kicks in and individual matters affect them all, including the unfortunate passing of Goodwin's younger brother.\n\"If you can say anything positive about tragedy, you can say it puts your life in focus, and it put our album in focus,\" says Pierszalowski. \"So, part of it is dealing with depression and dealing with the anxiety but it's also realizing what you can learn from that and making active changes based on that. We wanted to incorporate things that came from those feelings.\"\nThe unexpected change within the group also led to more practical changes on the album, the most noticeable -- and effective -- being Goodwin's vocals being featured more prominently this time around than on the bands' debut. \"It wasn't an active decision we made, it just seemed like there was no other way,\" Pierszalowkski says, stating it all happened organically. \"She had a lot more to say than I did this time around.\"\nThis focused and sincere partnership grounds \"Threadbare.\" The band's \"beardiness,\" as Pierszalowski puts it, might draw simple comparisons to indie campfire bands like Akron/Family, Bon Iver, or Fleet Foxes, but Port O'Brien is not making music to fit it.\n\"On 'Threadbare' everything was immediately collaborative. We like a lot of different types of music and I think that every song on 'Threadbare' is pretty different, but it still felt a lot more cohesive than anything we've done before,\" he says. \"We always try to cover a lot of ground and not try to be pigeonholed into one specific production style or one form of instrumentation. We felt a strong connection with every song and how they fit together.\""}

He said the fraud led to the city and Computer Sciences submitting tens of thousands of false claims to Medicaid from 2008 to 2012.\nOriginally filed by a whistleblower, Vincent Forcier, the lawsuit seeks restitution, civil penalties and triple damages under the federal False Claims Act.\nThat law lets whistleblowers sue on the government\u2019s behalf and share in recoveries. The government sometimes intervenes in cases it considers stronger.\nRichard Adamonis, a Computer Sciences spokesman, said the Falls Church, Virginia-based company believes the lawsuit is without merit and sees no basis to support \u201cvirtually all\u201d allegations it learned about during the two years it worked with Bharara\u2019s office. He also said Computer Sciences is \u201cconfident\u201d that it did not submit false Medicaid claims for the city.\nNew York state plans to bring a related case against Computer Sciences, court records show. A spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment.\nThe lawsuit concerns early intervention program services, which are provided to children under 3 years old who have developmental delays, or medical conditions such as autism and low birth weight that are associated with such delays.\nAccording to the federal government, the city and Computer Sciences engaged in three fraud schemes.\nIn two, the defendants allegedly circumvented Medicaid\u2019s \u201csecondary payor\u201d requirement that they exhaust private insurance coverage before submitting claims.\nThe third allegedly involved the defendants\u2019 changing diagnostic codes used by medical providers to a generic code that they knew would result in payment by Medicaid.\nForcier, the whistleblower, could not immediately be reached."}

That number rose steadily during his two terms, reaching a record 95,055,000 in November 2016, then setting another record (95,102,000) in December.\nBLS said the December unemployment rate increased a tenth of a point to 4.7 percent, well below the Obama-era high of 10 percent.

Smith, the Wisconsin-based water-heater manufacturer that saw one of its plants along the Cumberland River inundated in the May 2010 flood. Their lawsuit names the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service, which have acknowledged that a lack of communication undercut flood warnings.\nThe Cumberland eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown Nashville, almost 12 feet over flood stage and about 10 feet higher than forecast. The flooding killed 11 people in the city and inflicted more than $2 billion in damages, with another 15 people killed in the surrounding region.\nThe Corps of Engineers referred questions about the lawsuit to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Nashville, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe A.O. Smith plant in the Nashville suburb of Ashland City was covered in mud and silt after the flooding, with the company estimating its losses at $76 million. Meanwhile, Gaylord says the famous Opry House and its Opryland hotel and resort took as much as a $250 million hit from the flooding.\nThe lawsuit argues that the Corps \u201crepeatedly provided incorrect and inaccurate information\u201d to the Weather Service, which issued flood warnings for the Cumberland River. The suit accuses the Weather Service of knowingly using outdated information from the Corps in preparing those forecasts.\nIn a January 2011 report on the disaster, the Weather Service found that the Corps was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the Cumberland River amid record rainfalls over Nashville and the surrounding region on May 2.

In a chapter entitled Why American Writers and Speakers Are Often Bombastic, he wrote: \"I have often noticed that the Americans whose language when talking business is clear and dry ... easily turn bombastic when they attempt a poetic style ... Writers for their part almost always pander to this propensity ... they inflate their imaginations and swell them out beyond bounds, so that they achieve gigantism, missing real grandeur.\"\nWhen it comes to a duel between DePaul university political science professor Norman Finkelstein and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz over Finkelstein's upcoming book, Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History, gigantic bombast feels like an understatement. It is a row that has spilled on to the pages of most of the nation's prominent newspapers and gone all the way to the desk of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nLike the two professors in Irvine Welsh's The Acid House who abandon their high-minded theoretical clashes for a drunken brawl in a car park, Finkelstein and Dershowitz hover between principle and raw verbal pugilism in which the personal and the political are almost indistinguishable.\nFinkelstein says Dershowitz is a \"total liar\", adding that \"If a true word were to leap out of his mouth he would explode.\" Dershowitz eschews direct personal attacks only to ascribe his jibes to others. \"Many people have thought he was unstable ... he is like a child ... he makes up facts.\"\nBut beneath the vitriol lie many vital issues: namely Israel, Palestine, human rights in the Middle East, anti-semitism, academic freedom and intellectual honesty. Not to mention the scope for discussing these subjects in the United States, Israel's greatest ally, where the parameters for debate are relatively narrow compared with the rest of the western world. \"The atmosphere for publishing critical stuff on Israel here is very intimidating,\" says Colin Robinson, who as publisher of the New Press initially intended to publish Finkelstein's book.\nFinkelstein billed his book as \"an expos\u00e9 of the corruption of scholarship on the Israel-Palestine conflict,\" but essentially it is an attack on Dershowitz in general and his bestselling book, The Case for Israel, in particular, which Finkelstein describes as \"among the most spectacular academic frauds ever published on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\"\nThis is fighting talk. But then both of these writers come to this subject and each other with some form.\nFinkelstein is best known for his book The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. The book, serialised in the Guardian, argued that the Holocaust should not be treated as a sacred event to be exploited by a huge \"memory industry\" but understood as one of many genocides. Translated into 17 languages, it drew widespread criticism from many Jews for playing to an anti-semitic gallery in both its tone and tenor. It is \"filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust\", wrote historian Omer Bartov, who holds a chair at Brown university. \"It is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions,"}

The tech giant is reportedly planning to launch a rebranded music service that offers many of Beats Music\u2019s features but undercuts competitors in price, according to 9to5Mac.\nThe new service would be part of the default Music app on mobile devices and iTunes on desktops, according to the report. It would make use of Beats-specific features, such as playlists curated by experts and context-sensitive radio stations. Users would be able to stream tracks as well as download them to add to their iTunes library.\nUltimately, none of that sounds too revolutionary compared to what you can do with Spotify or Rdio, but Apple is also reportedly looking to launch the service at a price of $7.99 per month. That would be $2 cheaper than other similar options on the market, which could help spur sales.\nInterestingly, 9to5Mac also claims that the new service would be available on Android devices as well as iOS ones. While iTunes has long been popular on desktops, Apple has kept the service off of non-iOS mobile devices to this point.

It\u2019s even connecting ice machines. But one thing the Internet of things lacks is a unifying standard.\nDevices will be connected by different radio technologies: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and a host of 2G and mobile broadband cellular technologies. There\u2019s really no way of assuring your \u201cthing\u201d will connect to the network or networks available at any given time.\nThe mobile industry is trying to rectify the problem, at least as it pertains to cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies. The bigger issue of fragmentation among bands and technologies isn\u2019t going to get worked out anytime soon: You\u2019re not going to connect a GSM wristwatch to a CDMA or Wi-Fi network. But often you can\u2019t connect that GSM wristwatch to a GSM network either. Roaming among networks that use the same technology requires not only a business arrangement with each carrier but also a common protocol.\nA group of global wireless-standards bodies are trying to tackle that problem. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) in the U.S. are working with their counterparts in Japan, Korea and China to develop a common \u201cservice layer\u201d that can be embedded in every M2M device, making them compatible with M2M application servers hosted by any global operator.\nAt the end of the day, that means many of the devices in our Internet of things suddenly become untethered from specific networks. That wristwatch could work on AT&T(s t) as well as T-Mobile\u2019s GSM network and then connect to Rogers Communications\u2019(s rci) GSM towers when you fly into Toronto. Shipping containers embedded with M2M modules connect to whatever network is available at any port of call. The same wireless smart meter could be deployed in Kansas City or in Marrakesh without having to completely reconfigure its software.\nRoaming among networks is possible today. The problem is those arrangements tend to be ad hoc deals put together by M2M service aggregators like Kore Telematics, which sort out all the underlying carrier deals and manage each network\u2019s various protocols. Some operators have started taking matters into their own hands.\nIt sounds like a standard, but it\u2019s not quite the same thing. All seven providers use the same M2M management platform supplied by Jasper Wireless, so they are able to bridge their difference through a common vendor. Still, the effort is admirable and could lead the creation of ad hoc interoperability among a large section of the world\u2019s carriers. Jasper has many other customers besides those seven, including AT&T and America Movil (s amx).\nA good example of a problem such cooperation could solve is the Kindle\u2019s international predicament. Even though Amazon(s amzn) sells the Kindle all over the world it has one \u201chome\u201d network, AT&T(s t). That means any Kindle user either living in or traveling to another country has to pay international download (read: roaming) fees to buy a new book or access a periodical subscription.\nIt\u2019s fairly ridiculous that a multinational retailer like Amazon can\u2019t support its flagship device internationally without resorting to such single-carrier arrangements.

It appears that Bowers' gloating over 'Bama's victory didn't sit well at all with those two Bengal Tiger fans. Add a lot of alcohol and you have the most disgusting scenario possible. Bar fights after sporting events is nothing new, but rarely does anyone lose their life defending their favorite teams' honor.\nWhile members of Bower's family are saying it was about the Alabama-LSU game, police are saying the game had nothing to do with it.\nBowers was in the bar watching the game with his daughter, her boyfriend, and her cousin. The family members left before the physical altercation began but people who were in the bar gave them details. It seems that two men, 27 year old Azia Crockett and 24 year old Ryan Anthony attacked Bowers and continued to hit and punch him while he was down on the floor. Bowers was hospitalized three days before passing away on Tuesday. Crockett and Anthony turned themselves in and they've been charged with felony manslaughter.\nIn today's society there is too much hate and anger. Road rage incidents have increased. Mass shootings have become a regular occurrence, taking place every couple of weeks now. Protests are springing up all over the country and there is not just one topic being protested. It has happened so often I am extremely worried about the country that my five grandchildren will grow up in.\nIt was almost this bad back in 1968 when there were so many protests over the unpopular Viet Nam War. There were very few mass shootings but the bad deed of the day back then was political assassinations. Twice in 1968 popular national figures were gunned down and killed. Civil Rights Icon Martin Luther King was murdered in April and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was killed while campaigning in California in June. I remember folks back then wringing their hands and asking,\" Where is our country headed?\" Just like I am today, people were concerned about what would be facing their children and grandchildren in the future.\nDespite their concerns things have turned out okay for me. I've had a great career and a wonderful life but I still worry about our country. Sports and sporting events should be fun.

And Monday he replaced Jerian Grant as the starter as the Bulls snapped their season-high five-game skid with a 115-109 victory over the Hornets.\nRondo's season-high 20 points, six assists and seven rebounds served as the strongest example of how players have professionally handled the in-and-out nature of this season, which is unusual for a team making a playoff push. The victory and the Bucks' loss moved the Bulls to within a half-game of the eighth seed.\n\"That's what I came here for,\" Rondo said of starting and pushing the pace to the tune of 36 first-quarter points. \"(Being benched) is a process I went through. It didn't kill me. It's decisions that people made.\"\nRondo wasn't alone. One day after landing on the inactive list to cap three straight games of not playing, Nikola Mirotic scored a season-high 24 points. That included a huge 3-pointer with 2 minutes, 34 seconds remaining for a 105-96 lead.\n\"We're not going to make the playoffs without Niko playing good basketball. We let him know we need his focus and ability to shoot,\" Dwyane Wade said. \"And Rondo definitely brought something different that we haven't seen in a while.\"\nWith Jimmy Butler posting 23 points and 11 assists and Wade scoring 23, the Bulls placed four players over 20 points for the first time since Jan. 16, 2008, when Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Andres Nocioni and Joe Smith did it.\nCoach Fred Hoiberg finally tightened the rotation, dropping Cameron Payne to 11 underwhelming minutes and Joffrey Lauvergne to just 2:37 and mostly playing eight.

It is a field in which reputations can be made with a single mention on the Freakonomics blog, and book deals signed based on single headlines.\nOne example of this trend is described in the December issue of The Atlantic magazine, in which David B. Klein, a libertarian economist at George Mason University in Virginia, retracts the claim he made last year in the Wall Street Journal, that left-wingers do not understand economics.\nThe problem, as Prof. Klein puts it, was the hidden bias in his own use of the data, and in the decisions he made about how to analyze it.\nThe authors \u2014 Joseph P. Simmons, Leif D. Nelson and Uri Simonsohn \u2014 describe this flexibility as \u201cresearcher degrees of freedom,\u201d and suggest that too much of it leads to bias at best, and nonsense at worst.\nAs a remedy, they offer a series of proposed guidelines for researchers and reviewers, but it was their somewhat cheeky experiment that brought the problem into the starkest relief.\nAs ever in social psychology, the experiment began with a room full of undergraduate guinea pigs, in this case paid for their attendance at a lab at the University of Pennsylvania. In the first of two separate trials, 30 students listened on headphones to one of two songs: either Kalimba, \u201can instrumental song by Mr. Scruff that comes free with the Windows 7 operating system,\u201d or Hot Potato, performed by the children\u2019s band The Wiggles.\nAfterwards, they were asked to fill out a survey including the question, \u201cHow old do you feel right now: very young, young, neither young nor old, old, or very old.\u201d They were also asked their father\u2019s age, which allowed the researchers to control for variation in baseline age across participants.\nUsing a common statistical tool known as analysis of covariance, or ANCOVA, which measures one set of numbers against another, the authors were able to show that, on average, listening to the children\u2019s song made people feel older than listening to the control song.\nA second experiment aimed to extend these results with a song about getting old, When I\u2019m Sixty-Four, by the Beatles, with Kalimba again as the control song.

The picture across the rest of the Gulf and wider Middle East was similar \u2013 with a peak of seven per cent of professionals highly satisfied with their salaries in Qatar, while the figure dropped to a low of only two per cent in Syria.\nThe average monthly salary differed considerably from country to country across the Middle East and North Africa, the survey said. Qatar eclipsed the UAE in terms of the biggest salaries, with more than a third of Qatari professionals, 39 per cent, earning between $3,001 (Dh11,013) and $8,000 each month. The figure was 37 per cent for the UAE.\nUnsurprisingly, the Gulf has the highest number of professionals earning top tier salaries, in excess of $8,000 each month: 12 per cent in Qatar, 10 per cent in the UAE, seven per cent in Bahrain, six per cent in Kuwait and three per cent in Saudi Arabia and Oman. As revealed in earlier findings, the lowest paid residents in the region were found to be in the North African countries of Algeria, Egypt and Morocco \u2013 although the total number of professionals receiving the lowest salary level has dropped in each country.\nThe latest survey said 50 per cent of Algerians earned under $500 per month compared with 54 per cent last year. In Egypt, 41 per cent of professionals received up to $500 per month, while 40 per cent of professionals in Morocco earned similar amounts every month. Only two per cent of professionals in Morocco and one per cent in Egypt earned more than $8,000 per month. The data for the salary survey was collated in part by looking at whether average salary hikes were in-line with the average rise in the cost of living. As found in previous Bayt.com research, professionals resoundingly felt the average salary increase did not reflect the rise in the cost of living in any of the surveyed countries.\nOverall, professionals across the Middle East said the cost of living had increased by 24 per cent, yet the average salary increased by only seven per cent \u2013 more than two-thirds less. In the UAE, respondents said living costs had increased by 22 per cent while the average salary increase was only six per cent. This year, the biggest disparity in the increase in living costs compared to salary raise was felt in Syria \u2013 where respondents felt cost of living had increased by 28 per cent, while salaries had increased by only nine per cent.\nFollowing close behind were Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which found 18 percentage point disparity between the rise in salary level and the rise in the cost of living.\nWhile there were still sizeable gaps between the salary and living cost increases, the countries where this gap was smallest were Tunisia and Qatar, with both recording a 12 per cent difference. Morocco and Bahrain reported a 14 per cent gap each.\nRespondents were asked to compare their salary raise for the period of December 2008-2009, and December 2007-2008.\nAcross all of the surveyed countries, the salary increase for the 2007-2008 period was higher than a year later, which perhaps demonstrated the effect of the rec"}

On Yeats\u2019 map of himself, there are no obscure towns, and all roads lead to Rome. His was, as he saw it, a continuous poetic journey, aided here and there by slaves or muses\u2013Arthur Symons, the symbolist who introduced him to the poetry of Paul Verlaine and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 in the 1890s; Maud Gonne, who made Irish nationalism romantic; Lady Augusta Gregory, an Irish Protestant aristocrat who collaborated with Yeats in his search of old Irish folklore and legends; and Ezra Pound, who stiffened Yeats\u2019 soft \u201cCeltic\u201d verse with a little modernist geometry.\nIn his later verse and in many of his letters, Yeats interpreted those friendships as inevitable. They fed his destiny, which was, as he saw it, to be Ireland\u2019s greatest poet. Critics and biographers have too often collaborated in this legend, separating their accounts of Yeats into green \u201cdevelopments\u201d and golden \u201cphases.\u201d The result is a fairly schematic narrative: The young hothead of the early Celtic Revivalist years produces lovely impracticalities until 1914, when Ireland explodes; he learns about reality, becomes a great poet of civil war, and a modernist to boot; after 1925, or thereabouts, he becomes one of those \u201cmonuments of unageing intellect\u201d about whom he writes in \u201cSailing to Byzantium\u201d\u2013the splendid complainer of the late verse. Even Richard Ellman, the poet\u2019s finest biographer before Roy Foster, followed Yeats\u2019 own division of himself into two opposing selves\u2013the great bard and the man who sat down to breakfast each morning.\nIn this superb biography, Foster unscrambles destiny and complicates it into life. The most distinguished Irish historian alive, Foster floods his Yeats with historical detail. He is less interested in literary exegesis than in historical accident; indeed, his criticism of the poems is a little spare. But he attends to the chaos of Yeats\u2019 early life, a bohemian shuffle during which he was at the mercy of his improvident peripatetic father, the painter J.B. Yeats. He gives a deep description of the tensions and ambiguities of Yeats\u2019 shabby-genteel Protestant origins. His sketch of the hierarchical and socially touchy Dublin of the 1880s is almost novelistic\u2013something like the caste-frozen Bombay of some contemporary Indian fiction.\nYeats remained a devotee of various forms of spiritualism and mesmerism. Theosophy was the craze of the age and, like D.H. Lawrence, who had a keen interest in the occult, Yeats was on the creative qui vive. But he seemed to swallow far too much tainted water. He believed almost all of it. He confessed that he saw no reason not to believe in the actual existence of Irish fairies and goblins. A faith in magic, in the spirit world, became his aesthetic: He denounced naturalism, fought George Bernard Shaw\u2019s \u201cmechanistic\u201d vision (he once had a dream in which Shaw appeared, clicking like a sewing-machine and smiling insanely), and proposed a poetry of dream and Celtic twilight that would shun the hustle of the world.

Why is Mona Lisa smiling?\nRumors that actress Sondra Locke has resolved her differences with Warner Bros. swirled every which way but loose late Friday as her lawsuit against the studio edged toward trial.\nShe's taking the studio to court for its alleged role in a sham movie development deal secretly funded by Clint Eastwood. Locke charges that he dumped her, then settled her palimony claim by setting her up at the Warner Bros. lot. But, he never told her he was funding the deal. And, by paying for it under the table, she charges, he ensured that while she might pitch her little heart out, all she'd ever develop was laryngitis. The studio went along with its big star to keep him happy, the suit alleges.\nAsked late Friday whether she'd reached a settlement, Locke said, \"I too have heard those rumors.\" She added that she was \"unsure what the conclusion of this drama will be.\"\nHer lawyer, Neil Papiano, said the two sides remained \"significantly apart,\" but added that anything could happen by the time the doors of the Burbank courthouse swing open again.\nWarner Bros. lawyer Robert Schwartz declined comment. But the studio has said in the past that it maintains the right to exercise creative judgment and decide which projects deserve a green light. And as far as Warner Bros. was concerned, none of Locke's ideas did.\nThe legal scurrying marks the final round of a bitter legal saga, dubbed \"Lockwood,\" that began when, after 14 years together, Eastwood packed up Locke's belongings and changed the locks of their Brentwood home in 1989.\nThe witness list in the high-stakes case is a veritable Hollywood who's who. Besides Locke and Eastwood, it includes Danny Glover, Diane Keaton, \"'The Godfather\" producer Al Ruddy, \"Analyze This\" producer Paula Weinstein and Warner's co-chiefs, Bob Daly and Terry Semel.\nLocke's professional viability is on the line. As for Warner Bros., the studio recently has come out on the losing end of two multimillion-dollar verdicts: $25 million this month to the family of a man gunned down after an appearance on the Warner-distributed \"Jenny Jones\" TV show, and a record $80 million, reduced to $20 million, awarded last year to director Francis Ford Coppola.\nVATICAN RAG: Holy fee dispute, counselor!

In addition, two former long-term detainees have been deported following the review of 27 long-term detention cases involving inmates locked up for at least a year.\nThe review was launched in the wake of a damning independent audit this summer that revealed a system that unfairly keeps people behind bars for months on end due to ill-informed adjudicators, decision-making based on inaccurate information, unchallenged faith in border enforcement officials and inadequate legal representation for detainees.\nIt also followed a Star investigation last year that found an immigration detention system that indefinitely warehouses non-citizens, away from public scrutiny and in conditions intended for a criminal population.\nWhile those who were freed are still subject to constant monitoring and reporting requirements, the remaining 17 long-term detainees remain incarcerated and are entitled to periodic assessment for possible release. The board notes that the number of detainees who have been released is based on the latest information it had available.\nThe board is now reviewing cases where detainees have been held between six and 12 months.\nIdentities and personal details of the detainees granted their freedom were not available Tuesday, but the Star confirmed one of the eight is Ebrahim Toure, a failed refugee claimant who was profiled in the Star investigation and released in September after 5-1/2 years in jail. He was freed with a combined $26,000 in cash and performance bonds put forward by three sureties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s excellent that the board is taking the audit findings seriously. These are discretionary decisions and the system is supposed to catch these (unjustified) cases,\u201d said University of Toronto professor Stephanie Silverman, an expert on immigration detention practises.\nLong-term immigration detainees are entitled to a review every 30 days before an adjudicator to determine if they should be released or kept behind bars. Although decision-makers are randomly assigned to cases, inmates can only be heard by a pool of adjudicators who work in one of the three regional offices \u2014 Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia \u2014 based on the detainees\u2019 locations.\nDetainees are usually failed refugee claimants or immigrants whose permanent resident status has been revoked. They are held pending deportation because officials consider them a flight risk, a danger to the public, or if their identity can\u2019t be confirmed. Others are inadmissible to Canada for security reasons, violation of human rights, crimes against humanity or for serious criminality or organized criminality.\nThe number of immigration detainees varies by the day but as of September, 50 had been held for more than a year; 57 between six and 12 months; 183 between three and six months; and 2,157 for under 90 days.\nUnder the review, the refugee board said decision-makers are instructed to \u201cactively\u201d investigate the specific barriers to release the detainees, explore potential alternatives to detention and develop a viable plan for their release.\n\u201cWe have seen early success with the program, where all parties understand what is required for release and are ensuring that reasonable and tim"}

Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can\u2019t \u2014 due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process. But that doesn\u2019t change what this new research shows: Sleep disruptions can have very serious, real-world consequences for your portfolio.\nThe study in question, \u201cDEEP Sleep: The Impact of Sleep on Financial Risk Taking,\u201d was conducted by John Nofsinger, a professor of finance at the University of Alaska Anchorage, and Corey Shank, an assistant professor of finance at Georgia\u2019s Dalton State College. The professors gave a battery of tests to 126 upper-level students in economics and finance who, since they were well versed in the concepts of risk and reward, presumably were less susceptible than the average investor to be irrational when it comes to assessing risk. The researchers carefully tracked participants\u2019 sleep patterns according to a number of standard measures, and then had each of them take a battery of tests to reveal their attitudes toward risk.\nThe researchers\u2019 overall finding was that, when deprived of sleep or otherwise suffering from sleep disruptions, we tend to incur more risk than we typically do when we have had more sleep.\nOne consequence of this probability distortion, Nofsinger told me in an interview, is that it leads participants into having a greater likelihood of buying options. As we already know, of course, the vast majority of all options trades are losses.\nAnother risky behavior that the researchers found to be associated with poorer or less sleep is under-diversification. Those with sleep disruptions tended to have less diversified portfolios than those who got more and better sleep. Under-diversified portfolios, of course, are more volatile than they need to be in order to deliver a market-like level of return \u2014 if even it performs that well.\nThough this study is the first that I know of that specifically correlated sleep disruptions with risky investment behavior, there have been others over the years that were at least suggestive of such a connection. One worth drawing your attention to is titled \u201cLosing Sleep at the Market: The Daylight-Savings Anomaly,\u201d which was conducted by Mark Kamstra of York University; Lisa Kramer of the University of Toronto, and Maurice Levi of the University of British Columbia.\nThe bottom line: Get more sleep!

It\u2019s slim, stylish, and powerful, a mashup between the previous Galaxy S series with the original iPod Touch. It\u2019s well-made and unique, a combination rarely found in cellphones these days and it is as far from the Galaxy S5 as the T-1000 was from the original Terminator. In short, it\u2019s pretty cool and probably the only S6 \u2013 the other being the non-curved standard model \u2013 I\u2019d buy.\nThis review is primarily about the S6 Edge. Out of the two phones released by Samsung at MWC the Edge most deserves to be called a flagship \u2013 a device that shows the best of what the company has to offer. While the \u201cstandard\u201d S6 is solid, usable, and handsome, I think the Edge is the real winner here. Why? First off the design is unique and unique to Samsung. It is the one that you will notice and it feels great in the hand. The standard S6 is another solid slab and although the size difference is minuscule you can truly feel the difference. The Edge disappears in the pocket while the S6 is just another smartphone.\nEverything in the S6 is available in the Edge. Both run a Exynos 14nm 64-bit Octa Core processor and both come in 64 and 128GB variants (you can get the S6 in 32GB.) Both have a built-in IR blaster for changing channels on your television, a usable heart rate monitor that doubles as a flash, acceptable front and back cameras, and a beautiful 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 pixel Super AMOLED display that Samsung uses to excellent effect. Everything about the phone is smooth \u2013 from the pixel-free screen to the lush colors to the animations and transitions. This is Samsung kicking out the stops.\nThose familiar with modern Android won\u2019t be surprised by everything the S6 has to offer. It\u2019s more of the same but better. NFC payments are on the table, where available, as is fingerprint recognition. The processor and 3G of RAM make things snappy and Samsung\u2019s Milk services are built in to supply music and video. SHealth, Samsung\u2019s health offering, can measure your steps and take your pulse. They pre-bundled Hancom Office on board in case you wanted to check out some spreadsheets on your flight.\nThe S6 Edge is just good. It has great battery life \u2013 it\u2019s run for about 1 day on a charge with heavy use and lasted about two days on standby. This time will degrade with use, however, so expect about 18 hours of firm usage, less if you\u2019re watching video or browsing a lot. Samsung has truly streamlined Android notifications and made them pleasing to swipe through and read. The lock screen is eminently useful thanks to a little list of icons under the notifications that show you what you have in your queue. A button on the right side wakes the phone up from sleep and there are volume buttons on the left side. That\u2019s it. The rest of the phone is nearly featureless except for a little slot for the SIM card and the iPhone -like bottom face.\nIn terms of size the S6 is just right. While I\u2019m honestly used to a bigger phone these days \u2013 the Note or the 6 Plus are my go-to devices \u2013 this is phone is a great size and, because it is amazingly slim, it fits the hand and pocket well.

So hard that only a few developers, usually trained in quantum physics, advanced mathematics, or most likely both, can actually work with the few quantum computers that exist. Now D-Wave, the Canadian company behind the quantum computer that Google and NASA have been testing since 2013, wants to make quantum computing a bit easier through the power of open source software.\nTraditional computers store information in \"bits,\" which can represent either a \"1\" or a \"0.\" Quantum computing takes advantage of quantum particles in a strange state called \"superposition,\" meaning that the particle is spinning in two directions at once. Researchers have learned to take advantage of these particles to create what they call \"qubits,\" which can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. By stringing qubits together, companies like D-Wave hope to create computers that are exponentially faster than today's machines.\nIBM demonstrated a working quantum computer in 2000 and continues to improve on its technology. Google is working on its own quantum computer and also teamed up with NASA to test D-Wave's system in 2013. Lockheed Martin and the Los Alamos National Laboratory are also working with D-Wave machines. But today's quantum computers still aren't practical for most real-world applications. qubits are fragile and can be easily knocked out of the superposition state. Meanwhile, quantum computers are extremely difficult to program today because they require highly specialized knowledge.\n\"D-Wave is driving the hardware forward,\" says D-Wave International president Bo Ewald. \"But we need more smart people thinking about applications, and another set thinking about software tools.\"\nThat's where the company's new software tool Qbsolv comes in. Qbsolv is designed to help developers program D-Wave machines without needing a background in quantum physics. A few of D-Wave's partners are already using the tool, but today the company released Qbsolv as open source, meaning anyone will be able to freely share and modify the software.\n\"Not everyone in the computer science community realizes the potential impact of quantum computing,\" says Fred Glover, a mathematician at the University of Colorado, Boulder who has been working with Qbsolv. \"Qbsolv offers a tool that can make this impact graphically visible, by getting researchers and practitioners involved in charting the future directions of quantum computing developments.\"\nQbsolv joins a small but growing pool of tools for would-be quantum computer programmers. Last year Scott Pakin of Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2013and one of Qbsolv's first users\u2013released another free tool called Qmasm, which also eases the burden of writing code for D-Wave machines by freeing developers from having to worry about addressing the underlying hardware. The goal, Ewald says, is to kickstart a quantum computing software tools ecosystem and foster a community of developers working on quantum computing problems. In recent years, open source software has been the best way to build communities of both independent developers and big corporate contributors.\nOf course to actually run the software you create with these tools, you'll need access to one of the very few existing D-Wave machines. In the meantime, you can download a D-Wave simulator that will let you test the software on your own computer. Obviously this won't be the same as running it on a piece of hardware that uses real quantum particles, but it's a start.\nLast year, IBM launched a cloud-based service that enables people to run their own programs on the company's quantum computer.

In an attempt to understand the acclimation process, employees' mood states, perceptions of the work setting and their reactions toward the VDTs were assessed. This study followed secretaries (N = 11) through the initial phases of converting from a traditional to an automated office. The subjects were observed four weeks prior to and eight weeks after the introduction of VDTs. The secretaries' stress levels were monitored by the Profile of Mood States. The secretaries' perceptions of the work environment were measured by the Work Environment Scale.\nThis study also examined work and personal factors that may relate to stress and VDTs in the workplace. This was accomplished by administering questionnaires and structured interviews to the employees.\nFour main research questions were addressed: (1) Do secretaries experience more psychological stress after the introduction of VDTs? (2) If they do experience more psychological stress, what is it about the introduction of VDTs that causes stress levels to increase? (3) Is there a consistent pattern of acclimation that secretaries experience when VDTs are introduced? (4) Do secretaries' perceptions of their job and relationship to their supervisors and co-workers change after the introduction of VDTs?\nMeasures of the subjects' levels of psychological stress remained the same throughout the 12 weeks of the study. Therefore, it was concluded that the introduction of VDTs did not significantly influence the subjects' reported affective states.\nMeasures of the secretaries' work perceptions and relationships were essentially the same throughout the study. Therefore, it was concluded that VDT introduction caused no noticeable change in the secretaries' attitudes towards and perceptions of their work environment.\nThe findings of the present research were contrary to research findings in which workers experienced increased stress after VDT introduction.\nThe secretaries' positive attitudes towards their new technology, planning for the introduction of VDTs and consultant support available during the acclimation process may explain why this sample was apparently unaffected by the introduction of VDTs. Recommendations for further research were offered.\nParmelee, Walker Michael, \"Video Display Terminals and Psychological Stress: A Study of the Acclimation Process\" (1986). Dissertations. 2270."}

At what point does a woman steel herself to issue a polite but firm reminder that her name is not ``Honey''? More seriously, at what point does it register with management that an office wolf's behavior could put the company at risk of a lawsuit? But the charges raised in a recent report to the Pentagon are much less subtle. A delegation visiting United States Navy and Marine Corps facilities in Hawaii, the Philippines, and Japan has accused the two services of sexual harassment, discrimination, and ``morally repugnant'' behavior vis-`a-vis military women stationed in the Pacific.\nAmong the more notable charges was that a ship captain was overheard on the radio offering to ``sell'' some women sailors to some Koreans. The captain in question has been relieved of his command pending an investigation.\nThe report recalls a similar one done last year of American military women serving in Europe. On balance, the Defense Department is considered to have done a good job of incorporating women into the armed services - as long as they are stationed stateside. But these two reports suggest that there is much progress to be made in extending basic decency, to say nothing of full equal opportunity, to military women abroad.\nThe Pentagon promises swift and effective response to the charges, including the formation of a group to review policies on women in the military.\nHow ironic if the very services charged with protecting American ideals - with their lives, if necessary - should fall so short of those ideals themselves."}

{"idx": "26856", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Tamara Elliott Rogers, vice president for alumni affairs and development, directs Harvard's record-setting capital campaign.\nAlthough the University has not issued a year-end 2015 update, it appears that The Harvard Campaign has become the largest-grossing higher-education fundraising effort on record. Indeed, individual schools\u2019 results (see \u201cThe Schools\u2019 Status,\u201d below) suggest that the campaign overall is close to its nominal goal of $6.5 billion.\n$6 billion as of last June 30 (a further billion dollars in the ensuing six months).\nBased on partial results from schools, more than $200 million has been committed since then, and fundraising activities continue at full speed. In fact, the next \u201cYour Harvard\u201d gala is scheduled for this evening on the Harvard Business School campus, before the Greater Boston home crowd. Even beyond such headline benefactions as a $150-million gift earmarked mostly for undergraduate financial aid, and the $350-million and $400-million endowment pledges for public health and engineering and applied sciences, respectively (the stuff of fundraisers\u2019 dreams, if not anything they can confidently count on in advance), the momentum is impressive.\nIn an environment of some public, and congressional, questioning of private institutions\u2019 endowments, Harvard is maintaining a low profile about how much the campaign has raised. Nor does there appear to be any appetite for raising the marquee number, when the subject is broached, perhaps because of recent publicity about the share of higher-education philanthropy flowing to a relatively select cohort of institutions. Instead, the mantra is to focus on the academic priorities established during planning for the capital campaign\u2014and on seeing to it that they are in fact fully funded, if at all possible.\nWith the campaign still scheduled to proceed through the end of 2018, University and school development officers and their armies of volunteers have almost three years to go to try to ensure that every school meets its individual goal, plus the overarching Harvard objectives. Among the latter, these in particular loom large: endowments for financial aid; construction of the engineering and sciences complex in Allston; undergraduate House renewal; and support for basic science.\nFinancial aid. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) earmarked about one-quarter of its initial $2.5-billion goal, or roughly $600 million, to endow undergraduate aid, a priority that was the beneficiary of that $150-million gift and other substantial commitments. Nonetheless, fundraising for financial aid continues for the College, graduate-student fellowships, and no doubt in many of the professional schools. The University campaign goal for financial aid and \u201cthe student experience\u201d (which may include projected investments in athletic facilities such as renovation of Harvard Stadium and a new basketball venue) was 25 percent of the initial $6.5-billion target, or some $1.6 billion. And even though supporters have traditionally rallied to financial aid, it is easier in some schools than others to secure substantial scholarship and fellowship funds, given their graduates\u2019 differing capacities to make gifts proportional to the identified need.\nCapital projects. Fundraising for the College\u2019s House-renewal program continues apace. The project has always depended on raising huge sums, and building renovation is a notoriously difficult goal. But as supporters and prospective donors have been able to see the physical effects of completely redoing a House (like Dunster, reopened for this academic year)"}

She said the harassment began in 2007, when Schedler was first assistant to then-Secretary of State Jay Dardenne, and escalated over a period of years. The woman said she was transferred five times to jobs she described as \"undesirable\" because she rejected Schedler's advances.\nIn her lawsuit, the woman said that Schedler used state resources to pursue her. He took her on a work trip to Arizona, which she initially thought was to look at voting machines but later appeared to be more about spending time together for Schedler, according to the accuser. She also alleged he used a state security detail to track her and someone she was dating. Schelder also moved into the woman's townhouse complex, she said."}

That\u2019s the case in lower-cost areas--- like Cobb County, Ga.\u2014and higher-cost areas, like Manhattan.\nWhile a number of states and cities and large businesses have taken steps to raise their minimum wage to at least $15, tens of millions of workers are still left behind at $7.25.\nRight now, the U.S. House of Representatives is debating the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 and gradually eliminate the tipped minimum wage and carve-outs for youth workers and workers with disabilities. Raising the national minimum wage would enable everybody, no matter where they work or live, to better afford essentials, like rent and groceries.\nI have conducted research on the low-wage economy since I was a Harvard Ph.D. in the late 1960s. As someone immersed in every argument for and against raising the minimum wage, I know that an increase to $15 by 2024 is not just feasible, but also well within historic experience.\nIt would not only help workers -- it would also modestly stimulate the overall economy and boost poorer economic regions.\nWe already have a guide for how a $15 minimum wage would play out. Cities like Seattle and San Jose have shown us that significant wage increases lead to more money in the pockets of low-wage workers. And while some opponents of a minimum wage have raised the specter of job loss, the experiences of Oakland, San Francisco and Seattle and other cities that have raised wages to or near $15 simply do not support those fears.\nFor example, research on six cities that were early adopters of high minimum wages - Chicago, District of Columbia, Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle - found that after wages rose in the food services industry, pay went up without a significant effect on employment.\nThere\u2019s significant reason to believe that a federal $15 minimum wage will have similar effects nationally. That\u2019s because we can expect a $15 wage to generate a substantial economic stimulus among low-wage workers that can then be invested back in the community. These benefits are large enough to offset any job loss in the small number of low-wage manufacturing jobs still in the U.S. that could be shipped abroad.\nAnd in the industries where a higher minimum wage will have the greatest impact, like restaurants and retail stores, customers will be willing and able to absorb small price increases \u2013 about 2 percent - 3 percent per year in just those sectors \u2013 that may be passed on as a result of higher labor costs. We have every reason to expect sales in both industries will continue to grow.\nA new Berkeley study this month, in fact, calculated how employment would be affected by raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024, both nationwide and in Mississippi, a low-wage state that would see one of the largest increases. In both cases, a $15 wage would lead to slightly more jobs than in the absence of the wage increase.\nThe benefits low-wage states reap from higher wages -- especially in the South -- argue for a national wage floor, rather than a regional approach. Minimum wage increases help reduce migration from the lowest-wage states, making them more attractive targets for economic investment. And as a result of higher wages, workers who stay in these low-wage states will become healthier, be more productive in their current jobs and better able"}

If the Steelers choose not to match what Ramon Foster can get on the open market, for example, B.J. Finney will take his place in the lineup and receive a starter\u2019s contract.\nIf they choose to release the oft-injured Marcus Gilbert, their starting right tackle, then Matt Feiler could find himself in the starting lineup. But if they don\u2019t, he could potentially go all the way back to being inactive on game day.\nThe Steelers drafted Chukwuma Okorafor in the third round last season with the intention of developing him, and they would be much more likely to give him the opportunity to be the swing tackle than to have the starting job.\nRealistically, he could be anywhere from the starting right tackle to the top interior reserve or just one of the linemen (perhaps the only lineman) that does not dress for games, barring injuries, based on how the rest of the offseason plays out along the offensive line.\nAll Feiler could offer for himself for the moment was, \u201cI really don\u2019t know at this point\u201d about what his role will be in 2019, as he told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\nOne thing that is assured is that he will be on the team, or at least it\u2019s highly implausible that he wouldn\u2019t be. As a two-year veteran without an initial rookie contract, he is an exclusive rights free agent, which means that the Steelers can easily retain him on the cheap, and it would make no sense at all if they were to choose not to do that. But they have not done so just yet.\nFeiler spent three seasons on practice squads, including two with the Steelers, before he finally made a 53-man roster in 2017. He served as the swing tackle during Gilbert\u2019s injuries in the first half of that season as Jerald Hawkins nursed a minor injury, and he ended up being needed to play about five snaps at the end of the Lions game after Chris Hubbard suffered a concussion.\nHawkins was going to be the swing tackle this past year with Hubbard leaving in free agency, but he suffered a season-ending injury back in May. So many were projecting Okorafor for that role, but Feiler ended up seizing it for himself, even though he had been playing the interior positions during the past two summers.\nBy season\u2019s end, he dressed for 11 games and started 10. Okorafor dressed as the game-day swing tackle when Gilbert was healthy, Feiler inactive, but when they needed a starter, they called upon the more experienced player."}

The rebuilding of Ko\u0161ice's Hlavn\u00e1 ulica, \u017dilina's Mari\u00e1nske n\u00e1mestie, and Nitra's \u0160tef\u00e1nikova ulica have breathed new life into these long-neglected city centers. But one of the first projects promising to energize to an entirely new section of a Slovak town is the Belveder Multifunctional Zone in the central Slovak town of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica.\nBuilt on a hilltop site where an auto campground stood until recently, Belveder is being developed by a company called IKM Reality-Staving to be \"a city within the city.\" Construction began earlier this month on the project, which will combine residential, office, and shopping space.\nThe Belveder blueprint includes 300 apartments, \"urban villas,\" offices, street-level shops, a four-star hotel with 250 beds and a congress hall, and a pension with a restaurant, fitness center, pool, and sauna.\nWhile Belveder will house administrative and commercial units, it will be first and foremost a residential complex. Single-floor apartments will range from 70 to 150 square meters and two-floor flats will average 250 square meters. The apartments' future owners will purchase their homes in four installments, which will help finance the construction of the development. The first parts of the development are scheduled for completion in autumn 1998.\nBelveder's primary investor is IKM Invest, a firm related to the developer. Among the projects in IKM Reality-Staving's portfolio are buildings in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica for the National Bank of Slovakia, Banka Slovakia, Istrobanka, and McDonald's. The firm has also developed a few buildings in Germany.\nAlthough Belveder is a private project, IKM is progressing in close cooperation with City Hall. Marian \u0160ov\u010d\u00edk, who heads the city's office of construction and urban development, is coordinating the effort, which comprises designs from 21 different architects.\nAccording to Albert Mikov\u00edny, one of the architects, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica's historic core was the inspiration for the idea and plan behind Belveder. Thus, not only will Belveder share picturesque Urp\u00edn hill and the Kremnica hills overhead with the old town's scenic N\u00e1mestie SNP, but the streets and squares are planned to be colorful and lively as well.\nBut that is where the similarities to Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica's old town end. Belveder will be a thoroughly modern complex, with some buildings that are almost space-age in appearance. Some of the residential and retail space will make extensive use of skylights and triangular and rounded windows. At one of the development's focal points, the facade and roof of one building will be characterized by wavy, curved lines while an adjacent building looks very angular, thus making for an eclectic mix."}

(NYSE:PANW) were down 12% as of 10:00 a.m. Friday after the next-generation network security company announced strong fiscal third-quarter 2016 results, but followed with weaker-than-expected forward guidance.\nSo what: Quarterly revenue climbed 47.7% year over year, to $345.8 million, including 33.4% growth in product sales, to $162.1 million, and a 63% increase from services, to $183.7 million. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that translated to a net loss of $70.2 million, or $0.80 per share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation, Palo Alto's net income climbed 87.8% year over year, to $38.5 million, and rose 82.6% on a per-share basis, to $0.42. Meanwhile, billings climbed 60.9% year over year, to $486.2 million.\nFor perspective, Palo Alto's guidance called for lower revenue in the range of $335 million to $339 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.42. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter Palo Alto has exceeded its guidance.\nTo that end -- and though we don't pay much attention to Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts' consensus estimates called for roughly the same adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share lower revenue of $339.5 million.\n\"Our record fiscal third quarter 2016 results continue to underscore the market demand for our unique Next-Generation Security Platform as more than 31,000 new and existing customers are working with Palo Alto Networks to solve their most difficult security needs,\" added Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin. \"Security has never been more critical than it is today, and our platform delivers natively integrated and highly automated prevention outcomes, allowing us to continue to significantly outpace the competition as we further establish ourselves as the leader in cybersecurity.\"\nNow what: But the market was decidedly less impressed with Palo Alto's outlook. For the current quarter, Palo Alto anticipates revenue of $386 million to $390 million, good for year over year growth of roughly 36% to 37%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.48 to $0.50, up from $0.28 per share in the last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts, for their part, were already modeling both revenue and earnings near the high end of Palo Alto's guidance ranges.\nDuring the subsequent conference call, Palo Alto CFO Steffan Tomlinson explained that while Palo Alto continues to enjoy \"robust pipeline coverage and strong demand,\" its guidance also takes into account the current volatile macro economic environment.\nTo be fair, today's drop seems to ignore Palo Alto's long history of under-promising and over-delivering. And that revenue growth is decelerating -- but still remains well above the rest of the industry -- isn't exactly stunning as Palo Alto builds its business from a continuously larger base"}

Fox has the gift of gaffe. He compared a fence along the U.S.-Mexican border to ``the Berlin Wall,'' boasted that Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are ``doing jobs that not even blacks want to do,'' called border enforcement measures ``disgraceful and shameful,'' and characterized the Minuteman Project as a bunch of ``migrant-hunting'' vigilantes.\nOK, so maybe he got that last one right. But you get the point.\nAt first, Fox's rugged spirit seemed a refreshing change from the stuffed shirts of the corrupt Institutional Revolutionary Party, which controlled the presidency for 71 years before it was ousted by Fox's National Action Party in 2000. Fox also praised Mexican immigrants in the United States as ``heroes'' for their contributions to the Mexican economy -- more than $20 billion in remittances sent to Mexico this year alone.\nThen the cowboy became an aristocrat. Suddenly, he was arrogant, meddlesome and boorish. These are serious times in the relationship between the United States and Mexico, and you'd like to think that the president of Mexico -- a country of 110 million people -- would be a serious fellow with serious thoughts.\nIf that's the case, and at this point I have my doubts, you wouldn't know it from Fox's comments suggesting Mexicans are lucky to have been born in Mexico rather than the United States.\nThe first thing that hits you is the absolute ridiculousness of the statement. Imagine a leader saying something like that in a country where, according to one recent survey, as much as 40 percent of the population would migrate to the U.S. if they could. Who's Fox kidding? In that scenario, the lucky ones are those with enough money to pay smugglers to buy passage to the United States, where workers can make more in a day than they make in a month back home.\nNot that Mexico is a total bust. It works fine for some of its people. Perhaps Fox should have tacked on a qualifier, something to clarify that only some Mexicans are lucky. The wealthy, well-educated, politically connected, fair-skinned English-speaking Mexicans are the lucky ones. As they sit in their country clubs sipping fine tequila, they speak adoringly of Mexico and all that it has provided them.\nIt's the others -- the poor, uneducated, dark-skinned members of the working class -- who have to flee to the United States to feed their families. Those are the only Mexicans that most Americans will ever see, waiting tables and trimming hedges and waiting on street corners for day-labor jobs -- hired, perhaps, by some of the same people who decry illegal immigration.\nMany Americans look down on that brand of Mexican, and they probably never think about the fact that, across the border, there's another kind of Mexican -- educated, refined and privileged -- who actually looks down on Americans. After all, the only Americans many of them will ever know are the rude tourists who come down to Cancun or Mazatlan and drink themselves sick, walk into restaurants with their shirts off, and demand that waiters speak to them in English.\nThese Mexican el"}

From 1984 to 1998, he owned Wheatstone Baking Co. in Boston.\nThe Le Panyol oven at the institute, made in the south of France from white clay, is used in many professional kitchens. The Schaubs\u2019 quest to find one for home use led them to Martin Pearson, a stone and brick mason in Plainville, who at the time was the only licensed distributor of Le Panyol ovens in the state. Pearson built the oven, erecting a double-lined stainless steel pipe that goes up through a new laundry room on the floor above to serve as the chimney.

While the number of Christians in China has increased significantly during the past few decades, the church\u2019s social influence remains minimal. Attention from outside often focuses on the suffering and persecution faced by the country\u2019s believers.\nMyrrl Byler is director of the China Educational Exchange program, which sponsors various exchange and assistance programs with Chinese partners in educational institutions, local government organizations and Protestant churches.\nSince even the highest guesses place Christians at less than 8 percent of China\u2019s present population, the church would need to grow at an incredible rate for Aikman\u2019s prediction to become true. If Christians do become a sizable minority, they will, Aikman believes, greatly influence the direction of Chinese society. He gives examples of people from a wide spectrum of activities, including actors, government employees and business people, who have recently become Christian. The lack of a strong national ideology and the interest in religion will continue to bring educated and influential people to Christianity.\nInterviews and examples demonstrate that the Chinese house church is strongly evangelical. According to Aikman, Chinese evangelicals support Israel and feel called to evangelize the Muslim world. He believes that a \u201cChristianized China may spend less time thinking of ways to outmaneuver and neutralize the U.S. than the military strategists of the current regime.\u201d Aikman speculates that a strong evangelical influence will encourage the Chinese government to be more cooperative with the rest of the world in the fight against terrorism and the prevention of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe book presents a very readable and informative picture of one part of the house church movement\u2014the various networks operating outside of the registered churches\u2014along with some of its better-known leaders. Aikman attributes much of the rapid growth of the church to its charismatic and evangelical nature. His experiences and interviews help us to understand this very vital movement within Chinese Christianity.\nBut Jesus in Beijing perpetuates the misperception that Chinese Christians can be divided into two groups, one operating clandestinely and in opposition to the government, the other cooperating with and officially approved by the government.\nAikman does not mention that in addition to the many house churches which are opposed to any association with the registered churches, there are more than 30,000 which are registered with the government. Just because people meet for worship in homes or apartments does not mean that their actions are illegal and need to be hidden. Many believers in China attend home meetings, while others worship in larger churches. The choice is determined by issues of distance, convenience and leadership. While many house churches eventually become traditional churches, many do not.\nSituations also vary greatly from one geographical location to the next. One northern rural Chinese county which I have often visited includes ten churches and more than 50 registered meeting points. No other house church networks appear to exist in the county. But a bordering county has no registered churches or meeting points, because the local government is hostile toward religious believers. There Christians must meet in relative secrecy. Situations also change. Recently I was invited to visit believers in a county where the government formerly had opposed any connection with overseas Christians.\nGeneralizations and assumptions based on isolated experiences may easily give a distorted picture. In assessing the Chinese situation, overseas believers need a strong dose of humility and a sense of the complexity of the issues.\nThe devout faith and sacrificial lives of the Chinese believers described by Aikman are inspiring to all who come into contact with them. But young church leaders are being trained in many places besides the more cl"}

Mathis attended last week's league-wide meeting in Washington on behalf of the Jaguars, where players reviewed deal points.\nOn Thursday, after the owners prematurely announced an agreement had been reached, the players' anger bubbled over.\n\"It was never close to blowing up; it was just the feeling of being left in the dark and not knowing what was going on,\" Mathis said. \"So that was the main thing. It came to light very quick.\"\nKampman said the NFLPA's leadership helped the situation by taking emotion out of the negotiations.\n\"I think that helped us as well,\" Kampman said.\nFew players expected to miss games, but as the start of training camp approached, some grew a little antsy for the labor battle to finish.\nThey were getting bored with conditioning without coaches and not having the structure of off-season programs.\nThe lockout wiped out organized team activities and minicamps in May and June.\nA few players did not attend the voluntary Tuesday activities, including tight end Marcedes Lewis, who is awaiting a long-term deal.

They unloaded baskets of food, and arranged themselves around a long table in a courtyard. A woman named Niser spread out a tablecloth and put down a plate of dolmas. \"It's a way of celebrating that we still exist,\" she told me. More people were arriving--children, grandparents, cousins, aunts, and distant relations--members of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world who had not seen one another for three years.\nIn the summer of 2014, the Islamic State occupied Christian cities and villages across northern Iraq, appropriated Christian homes, and destroyed farms of Christian families. When Islamic State commanders separated men from women and imposed jizyah, or extortion taxes, their purpose was extreme: they meant to subjugate the Christians or drive them away from the land. Mar Mattai is some twenty miles from Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, where more than one hundred thousand Christians were displaced from their homes. One of the children led me to a wall at the edge of the monastery and pointed below to the brown, dusty tracts of fields that lie at the edge of a region once known as Mesopotamia, the land between two rivers. From above, I saw how exposed the road to Mosul was.\nThe Christians here have endured invasions by Persians, Kurds, and Turks, but they have recovered after each persecution. This is, in part, their tradition: they believe in their sacred right to their land. Mosul is part of the Assyrian triangle, recorded in the Book of Genesis, and the plains of Nineveh--where the Hebrew prophet Jonah is said to have preached after he was spat out by a giant fish in the eighth century bc--are situated on the outskirts of Mosul on the east bank of the Tigris River.\nThis time, things were different, said Niser's husband, Behnam, a thirty-year-old who had come to the gathering from Qaraqosh, an Assyrian Catholic town just outside Mosul that was invaded by the Islamic State in 2014. \"We're worried,\" he said. \"Even with ISIS gone, there's another big threat: there is no work for us.

He can tell you the provenance of every ingredient \u2014 the home-brewed Barolo wine vinegar, the supernaturally ripe and never refrigerated Ligurian tomatoes, the pungent truffles for which this hilly area is famous.

A sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to low back pain, which is the most common symptom seen in GP surgeries.\n\"Armed with mobile phones, consumed with social media, and with rapid access to online information, our patients present with high expectations of modern technology, including surgery,\" the researchers said.\n\"With outstanding results from hip and knee arthroplasties, they expect similar results from spinal surgery. Not uncommonly, the patient attends the surgical consultation with an expectation that the problems can be fixed.\"\nBut more often than not, the surgery fails to fix the problem.\nPatrick Scala, from Shoalhaven Heads, has had two back operations including one in September last year and both failed to relieve his pain. He injured his lower back on three occasions between 2005 and 2008 when he was working at night packing supermarket shelves. He has not worked since 2007 and has been fighting a legal battle to top up the lump sum payment he received from WorkCover in 2009.\nAssociate Professor Atkinson told Fairfax Media that state-based workers compensation schemes rank the seriousness of impairment due to back injury more highly after surgery is performed. He said surgeons were often too busy to \"flesh out\" the real cause of a patient's back pain.\nHe said many injured workers needed to be re-assessed and offered pain management instead of surgery. He said back pain can often get worse in people with untreated depression, workplace or social problems.\n\"There are psycho-social issues that complicate and distort back pain. So surgeons operate for the wrong reasons,\" he said. \"You can't cure depression or workplace unhappiness with a back operation.\"\nThe medical journal paper says the workers compensation system and third party insurance can prolong rehabilitation and extend recovery times. A study of patients receiving workers' compensation in NSW found surgery outcomes were so poor that the benefits were marginal.\nFour in ten people continued to experience pain after a back operation and the success rate was 50 per cent \"at best\".\nProfessor Atkinson said spinal fusion surgery for non-specific low back pain is controversial, particularly its origin is not known \"and imaging of the spine is unhelpful\".\n\"I see so many failed back operations,\" he said. \"We really need to have a look at the psychological and social issues.\""}

Murphy, who had a serious drinking problem and bad legs, was prone to falling and friends say he could be combative, especially when drunk.\nVicar Bob Rainis of Epiphany Lutheran Church, a former NYPD homicide detective who gave Murphy his last rites hours before he died on Sunday, Aug. 15, said Murphy's wounds indicated that he had suffered more than just a fall.\n\"I think he went down, but the other wounds indicate it must be the result of a violent altercation,\" he said.\nBut today, Deputy Inspector John D'Adamo said 52nd Precinct detectives had gathered no evidence that pointed to Murphy being the victim of a beating prior to his death. D'Adamo said detectives spoke with at least one witness who told them they had seen Murphy on the night before he went into a coma and that it looked like he had suffered a head wound. When the witnessed asked him what happened, Murphy replied, \"I fell,\" according to D'Adamo.\nRainis said he had heard a similar story, but that something must have happened to Murphy between that point and when somebody called 911 to say they had found Murphy unconscious.\"There's a 20 to 25 minute period where nobody can attest to what happened to him,\" Rainis said.\nD'Adamo said the investigation was still ongoing and that Medical Examiner's Office was still in the process of completing its analysis. He added that his detectives were all ears if somebody wanted to come forward with new evidence or information. The Medical Examiner's Office did not immediately return phone calls seeking information.\nMuphy's death was the latest in as string of what appear to be violent incidents involving the local homeless population. D'Adamo said he wasn't aware of any trends that would suggest people were targeting the this population, but added that he would look into the matter.\nI used to think that at least the homicide rates couldn't be faked -- after all, if there's a dead body, it has to be accounted for.\nBut DI Inspector has shown me that it may not be the case. A death can be classified as a homicide or an accident.\nI hope everyone working on investigating this case has thought about our friend, Billy Murphy, as they would their brother or their cousin.

If no party member steps forward by the 2016 filing deadline next June, Kansas voters will go at least a decade without any chance to consider a Democrat for a U.S. Senate seat, an apparent state record in partisan futility.\nThe lack of Democratic candidates in Kansas is unusual, but not unique. Other states with dominant parties lack credible House and Senate candidates. Georgia has no official Democratic Senate candidate, for example. There is no Democrat in North or South Dakota now running for the Senate, Federal Election Commission records show.\nYet the Kansas ballot is complicated by the circumstances of the 2014 U.S. Senate race. Democratic nominee Chad Taylor withdrew, leaving his party without a name on the Senate ballot.\nA second straight election without a Democratic Senate candidate worries some in the party. There was no election for a U.S. senator for Kansas in 2012, and there won\u2019t be one in 2018. The last Democrat to run for the Senate campaigned in 2010.\nThat means the party won\u2019t have another chance until 2020 if no one makes the ballot next year.\nThe gap has increased the pressure on Democrats to find a credible candidate against Moran.\nOne political consultant with a deep understanding of Kansas politics was blunt about the Democrats\u2019 struggle.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can call them a major party in Kansas,\u201d he said.\nBut Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita and former U.S. secretary of agriculture, said the problem is solvable.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the state Democratic Party cannot recruit quality candidates in all four congressional districts and U.S. Senate race,\u201d Glickman said.\nIn fact, the Democratic Party is only the third most popular choice for Kansas voters.\nA year ago, there were 777,771 registered Republicans in the state. There were 426,970 Democrats \u2014 and 527,132 unaffiliated voters, the second most popular option.\nThe registration disadvantage means Democrats must run virtually perfect campaigns to prevail, party officials concede. They must find candidates who are well qualified, well financed \u2014 and willing to endure grueling district or statewide campaigns, with just a small chance of victory.\nKansas hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic U.S. senator since 1932, the longest streak of one-party dominance in the nation. Dennis Moore was the last Democrat to hold a U.S. House seat from the state, and he retired from politics in 2011.\nThe demographics are daunting. Kansas is a Republican state.\nHouse races are a similar challenge. Nancy Boyda, a Democrat, won the 2nd District House seat in 2006 \u2014 and lost it two years later.

It was a poisonously global moment: the attacker broadcast the massacre live on Facebook, and he posted a so-called manifesto to Twitter, regurgitating neo-Nazi in-jokes and immigration-conspiracy theories about \u201cbirth rates\u201d and \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d His particulars merit little more attention than that.\nBy now, we know to restrain our instinct to recirculate, and perversely glamourize, the details. We know to deprive the virulent corners of modern life of the \u201coxygen of amplification,\u201d in the words of Whitney Phillips, of the Data & Society Research Institute, who is the author of a valuable report on the interplay between extremists, technology, and journalism. In a list of best practices, Phillips reminds reporters to treat violent language and memes as \u201cinherently contagious\u201d and to avoid highlighting \u201cobjectively false\u201d ideas unless they are prominently undermined.\nDon, Jr.,\u2019s newfound sympathy for decorum most likely owes less to a nuanced theory of violence and publicity than to the shameful reality that the New Zealand killer hailed his father, President Donald Trump, as \u201ca symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.\u201d In the Oval Office, a few hours later, the President was asked if he considers white nationalism a rising threat. \u201cI don\u2019t, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\u201d Trump called the incident \u201ca terrible thing.\u201d He was speaking, not incidentally, during a ceremony in which he vetoed an attempt to block his use of emergency funds to build a border wall. He complained, as ever, about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of illegal immigrants.\nThe New Zealand killer takes his place in the cracked pantheon of violent, Trump-admiring extremists: beside the gunman at the Tree of Life synagogue, in Pittsburgh, who blamed Jews for resettling refugees and immigrants, whom Trump vilifies as the center of his politics; beside the van-dweller in Miami who found purpose amid the throngs of Trump rallies and set about sending pipe bombs to George Soros, journalists, and Democrats. The New Zealand killer did not exact his violence in America, but he would be at home in our statistics: in the past decade, seventy-three per cent of all American extremist-related killings have come from the right wing, compared to twenty-three per cent from Salafi jihadism and three per cent from the left wing, according to the Soufan Center, which studies global security.\nPointing out those patterns does not feed oxygen to the sources; it subjects them to the disinfecting power of sunlight. We can only have an honest analysis of the sources of this violence if we understand how it grows and spreads. That applies not only to the role of journalism but also to the role of technology. Whenever a killer relies, as he did in this case, on the Internet to amplify the effects of his terror, some inevitably defend social media as no better and no worse than the humanity that uses it. Don\u2019t blame the hammer, we are told; blame the hand. At best, that is a deflection"}
{"idx": "26905", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Fujitsu Siemens may not be the first company you think of as manufacturing notebooks but in the last two years the company has improved its range to such an extent that it is now one of the top five suppliers in Europe.\nThe secret behind this success has been the Amilo line of notebooks, which combine great design with an equally impressive low cost. At \u00a3899 (inc. VAT) the Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Pro V2010 represents genuine value for money.\nWeighing at 2.9kg, this latest version of the Amilo Pro is lighter than its predecessor but still manages to come supplied with a 15-inch TFT screen. The screen of our review machine was extremely bright with an even tone across the width of the panel. The Amilo Pro relies on the Intel 855 chipset for its graphics throughput. An integrated solution may help to keep the overall cost of the notebook to a minimum but when it comes to performance it provides the bare minimum. While more than adequate for work and watching DVDs, don't even think about trying to play a 3D game using such a graphics card as it simply won't work.\nThe look of the notebook is trim with a silver and black design. Powered by an Intel Pentium M 725 processor, which has a running speed of 1.6GHz and supported by 512MB DDR SDRAM, the Amilo Pro has sufficient processing power. In day-to-day performance, we would have imagined the Amilo would be responsive and fast. However, we found it to be less than perfect, running at a sluggish pace with only two windows open at the same time. If you have minimal needs this may be sufficient, but we wouldn't recommend this notebook to anyone looking for raw power.\nWith a 40GB hard drive coming as standard, there is space for your files but you may soon find that you'll outgrow what the Amilo has to offer. The two-spindle machine comes fitted with a dual format DVD rewriter, which allows users to burn DVD-Rs at the click of a button. When it comes to wireless networking, Fujitsu Siemens has managed to cram 802.11g Wi-Fi into the Amilo Pro, so faster networking is possible.\nWhere the Amilo came into its own was in terms of battery life. We managed to get a little over four hours from a single charge, which means that a full morning's work is possible before you'll even need to think of charging the Amilo.\nThe keyboard is firmly mounted to the main chassis, which resulted in a very shallow amount of key travel. However, with well-spaced keys, we found typing to be comfortable.\nIt's clear to see that the \u00a3500 price tag is for the supposed styling of this model, yet the styling in our minds just isn't up to scratch and certainly not worth the extra cash. If you're looking for a model that performs and performs well there are other monitors on the market that will do the same job without the price tag. Even BenQ's own FP783 is a cheaper and better model. A nice try, but unless you work or live in an environment where style from a distance is more important that substance then this is probably a no go."}

It also allows 61 acres of land to be put into conservation. RiverWoods is also providing some land for a future fire substation and announced a $150,000 contribution towards the concept Thursday.\nThe ZBA granted a special exception to permit the proposed construction of The Boulders in August. In December, the Conservation Commission supported the road from The Boulders development to Pickpocket Road only as temporary, which is now proposed to be permanent, stating there was significant environmental impact.\n\"All these changes with the permanent road now become some different wetlands impacts,\" said Conservation Commission Chairman Don Clement.\nAlso proposed is a gated, emergency access to Blackford Place, which would also connect through The Boulders to Pickpocket Road.\n\"It\ufffds tempting when you\ufffdre sitting up here to jump on a very generous proposal to put land into conservation. But I\ufffdd rather not approve it at all and hope that the better nature of people comes through and that a nice connecting corridor of conservation land is maintained,\" said Planning Board member Anthony Zwaan. \"I am not yet comfortable with this road.\"\nWhile some members of the board said Red Oak Drive would enable good connectivity from the development through surrounding areas, others have concerns with its impacts on the environment and surrounding neighborhoods as well as traffic and safety.\n\"What you are proposing is a permanent road that impacts wetlands, an existing neighborhood, a scenic road, for the convenience of your own development,\" said board member Ken Knowles. \"I personally feel that this is an unnecessary road.\"\nPickpocket Road residents echoed Knowles\ufffd position. \"I don\ufffdt believe the residents of Pickpocket Road, RiverWoods or Exeter benefit by having a permanent road that connects from Blackford Drive to Pickpocket Road where there is a very suitable road here called White Oak Drive,\" said Pickpocket Road resident Bob Prior. \"It\ufffds disturbing an existing scenic road, existing way of life for people who have chosen to live there in order to not inconvenience the residents of The Ridge and that really bothers me.\"\nBoard member Carol Sideris said she\ufffds not sure what delaying a decision does for anyone. \"As I listen to this community speak there\ufffds an appreciation for the natural resources we have in that area,\" she said. \"I think there\ufffds an advantage to our community to not only connect through Pickpocket Road and up into the other connector road (Blackford Place), but to maintain as much of that natural environment as possible. I think that\ufffds what Exeter\ufffds about. I\ufffdm not sure what more information I would need to make that decision.\"\nRiverWoods has two existing facilities: The Woods and The Ridge. The Boulders would be on 59 acres near The Ridge campus. The project\ufffds first formal presentation before the Planning Board was made on Dec. 6.

There's a risk in scaling something like this, taking it out of its environment, diluting it.\"\nPuddicombe took the plunge and cofounded Headspace in 2010 with Rich Pierson, a former employee of creative agency BBH. The app's content ranges from ten-minute mindfulness sessions to advanced modules that tackle problems such as poor sleep and stress. The app has now been downloaded by more than a million iOS and Android users in 150 countries.\nIndependent scientific evidence validates the benefits of mindfulness to alleviate depression, aid cognition and strengthen cardiovascular health. There are currently 38 ongoing and planned academic studies with Headspace in conjunction with establishments such as University College London and Yale: in one study related to stress in the workplace, clinicians observed a significant reduction in participants' systolic blood pressure after eight weeks of using the app. \"We have a clinical trial with St Bartholomew's looking at chronic pelvic pain,\" says David Cox, Headspace's chief medical officer and a lecturer at the Imperial College School of Medicine. \"If successful, it could lead to the app being prescribed by NHS doctors for chronic pain.\"\nHeadspace was created by Bristol-born Puddicombe who previously worked with physicians in London. \"I started to experiment to see what worked and what didn't,\" says Puddicombe. \"Meditation is essentially a neurological skill with broad applications. We can wrap it around many different ideas and philosophies, but ultimately it's about being present.\"\nThis month, Headspace will start testing a version for kids in schools in Seattle, LA and Chicago. It is also developing tailored programmes for parents, pregnant women and athletes -- an Olympic team is using it in its preparation for 2016.

Some Sacrifice Is Required.\nAccording to experts, the most difficult string quartet ever written is Ben Johnston\u2019s Quartet No. 7. It was composed in 1984 but went unperformed for decades. Musicians who knew the score, with the ingenious palindromic structure of one movement and variations teeming with over a thousand microscopically distinct pitches, considered it well-nigh unplayable.\nNow the work is available on a CD that the Kepler Quartet released hard on the heels of the composer\u2019s 90th birthday in March. The album, which also contains Mr. Johnston\u2019s sixth and eighth quartets and a short piece for voice and strings called \u201cQuietness,\u201d marks the completion of one of the most ambitious and single-minded recording projects in American music. The Kepler players \u2014 the violinists Sharan Leventhal and Eric Segnitz, the violist Brek Renzelman and the cellist Karl Lavine \u2014 dedicated the better part of the past 14 years to learning and recording all of Mr. Johnston\u2019s 10 quartets. The sixth alone took them a year and a half to master.\nAt the same time, the quartets raise questions of the practicality and cost associated with such an uncompromising compositional voice. Like the preposterously difficult rhythms Conlon Nancarrow developed in his studies for player piano, the microtonal intricacies of Mr. Johnston\u2019s quartets can seem like exercises designed to measure the gap between human imagination and ability.\nOther ensembles have collaborated with Mr. Johnston, among them the La Salle, Concord and Kronos quartets. But, as Mr. Segnitz said, the complexity of Mr. Johnston\u2019s tuning system and the amount of rehearsal time it requires have proved impractical for groups with busy touring schedules.\nThe nature of his writing has created a mystical aura around Mr. Johnston that has been further enhanced by his physical distance from the centers of American music-making. After spending much of his career teaching at the University of Illinois, he now lives on an isolated farm on the outskirts of Madison, Wis. As his failing health made travel increasingly difficult, the Kepler players moved closer to him, rehearsing in a church close to the farm \u2014 \u201cliterally in the midst of a cornfield, in the middle of a cemetery,\u201d in Mr. Segnitz\u2019s description \u2014 that over time became a focus of pilgrimage for musicologists curious to hear the realization of one of the most esoteric bodies of work in the chamber-music literature.\nMr. Johnston traces his interest in tuning back to his childhood in Macon, Ga., where he quizzed family members on the physics of tuning a piano and peppered his music teacher with questions about the organization of sound. \u201cI became interested in the sounds in a fairly abstract way,\u201d he said. Soon he challenged the system of equal temperament that has dominated Western music for centuries. In equal temperament the octave \u2014 the space between one note and the next highest iteration of that same note \u2014 is divided into 12 half-steps spaced equally apart, allowing for harmonic modulation and easy communication among different instruments. But in creating an orderly horizontal sequence of pitches, certain intervals \u2014 the vertical harmonic relationships between two notes played simultaneously \u2014 are distorted so they no longer ring true.\nMr. Johnston\u2019s tuning system"}

He believed the main problem was that people with expert skills in a particular field think that they are suited to hold any position in that business.\nThe Minister may give a short time to also reflect why the 2015 government that people believed would be honest and voted to victory, so very quickly became riddled with cancerous dishonesty. So much so that the people now believe that it came into power with a pre hatched plan to outdo their predecessors in making themselves and not the nation rich.\nHe pointedly cited the worn out case of a pilot, skilled in operating the most advanced commercial planes, managing an air line. The airline, he said, would not be a success as the pilot did not have \u2018management skills\u2019 which he thought are essential to deliver. These skills were presumably like those the Minister and his ilk have in abundance. He had ignored, maybe for good reason, leadership skills. They are found in abundance in the military that appears to be anathema to government politicians.\nMinister Wickramaratne may recall that late President JRJ in the late 1970s requested Lee Kwan Yew to release one Wickramanayake who was a pilot in Singapore Airlines to be the CEO of the newly formed Air Lanka (AL)? The foundation for the ruin of AL and its successor SLA lay in that ill considered request.\nOn the other hand the minister should ask the SLAF why no one other than a pilot can ever command that organization. What do military commanders have and politicians never have to be successful?\nWickramaratne also tossed in for good measure an equally worn out sermon on the lack of wisdom in constructing an airport at Mattala and a harbour at Hambantota. The harbor, situated 12 miles from international sea routes, was first mooted about 3 decades ago and not by MR. It stalled only for the lack of funding. The Finance Minister in 2017 however declared that the harbour would become a \u2018world class port\u2019. While there were only 34 ships in 2012, there will be nearly 350 calling by year end.\nWho was it in 2003 who wanted an international airport built at Wellawaya and also to relocate the Ratmalana airport to Aluthgama? Is it the same PM RW who now condemns Mattala? He wanted the Ratmalana land for a housing/building project. Thankfully for the country and its armed forces these nightmares did not haunt SL during the conflict years. The PM gaily offered chewing gum, gold chains and Volkswagens at 2 million bucks at diverse elections for a people struggling to make ends meet.\nWhat was the worse choice? Wellawaya as a diversionary sop to collect votes but no money to build or Mattala with adequate Chinese funds, a huge harbour next door, plus attractive business and tourist potential though it was considered a white elephant until a pragmatic Finance Minister in 2017 vowed it would come through hale and hearty.\nSL has had a bellyful of \u2018management\u2019 skills by its politicians for 70 years of \u2018freedom\u2019. The people decided so in the LG elections in 2017. In 1979 they \u2018managed\u2019 under the UNP to convince themselves that they could solve by year end what was essentially a political problem by military force. It silenced habeas corpus too.

It\u2019s only fair to ask what Americans are getting in return.\nThat seems especially appropriate now.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is busy badmouthing the tentative nuclear deal with Iran, a major diplomatic achievement for the United States. And a few weeks ago, he declared his opposition to a Palestinian state, a longstanding U.S. priority.\nBibi has tried hard to sabotage President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to head off another Middle East war.

The Obama administration is guilty of this practice, too. But using the intelligence to meddle in your ally\u2019s domestic politics is beyond the pale.\nNetanyahu\u2019s subsequent campaign pledge to reject Palestinian statehood flew in the face of not only his previous (if grudging) acceptance of a two-state solution, but also decades of stated U.S. policy.\nObama now says it\u2019s \u201chard to envision\u201d how the United States can broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians if the stronger side \u0096 Israel \u0096 doesn\u2019t want it. There have been intimations from the White House that Washington won\u2019t automatically side with Israel at the UN Security Council any longer.\nIn response, Netanyahu tried to walk back his electioneering bluster.\nBut he\u2019s still campaigning against the nuclear accord with Iran. And he looks likely to form a coalition government of right-wing parties that will thwart a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in word and deed.\nMaybe it\u2019s because in the same breath as its jabs at Netanyahu, the White House promises to keep dropping that $3-billion chunk of taxpayer change into Israel\u2019s coffers.\nLast year, that money constituted more than half of all U.S. military aid worldwide \u0096 and nearly a quarter of Israel\u2019s arms budget. This boodle forms the core of the U.S.-Israeli \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d And as long as the White House considers it sacrosanct, Israel won\u2019t take U.S. criticism seriously.\nWant to see if Israel will halt the construction of Israeli settlers\u2019 homes and shopping malls in occupied Palestinian land? Or stop its attempts to thwart the peace process with Iran? Put that military aid on the chopping block.\nIf Israel thumbs its nose, as it very well might, then at least Americans will no longer be footing the bill.

{"idx": "26936", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Facebook Messaging: Reinventing the power of meh.\nSo let\u2019s get this straight: it\u2019s not an email killer, and everything that it does can be done by services that I already use? Can someone tell me why, then, I should care at all about Facebook\u2019s new messaging platform? Taking a look at the inner workings, what we see from Facebook today is an Apple-esque way of working where the company has taken things that Gmail has already done and simplified them or cleaned them up somewhat.\nThe fact of the matter is this, from where I\u2019m looking: What Facebook did today could easily be done in Gmail with 3 Gmail Labs plugins. Oh, and then I don\u2019t have to move over to Facebook.\nSomeone sends me an email, and I can immediately open a chat with them. If they don\u2019t get the chat, it emails my response to them instead. Got it. Does this sound like Google Talk to anyone else? It seems that it would be a simple thing for Gmail to tweak the response settings via a Labs plugin to allow me to open a chat with anyone who has an XMPP-enabled address (such as what Facebook is using, interestingly enough). If they close their window or don\u2019t reply for X number of minutes, my message is emailed to them.\nFurther, from the demonstration that we saw on stage, it\u2019s simply real-time chat. That sounds suspiciously like a trimmed-down version of Google Wave, to us. Maybe Google was a bit too hasty in killing the Wave, after all?\nOK, we get it. It\u2019s cool to be able to look back through all of your history as a single thing instead of seeing threaded conversations. Again, though, this is a Gmail Lab waiting to happen. When I search for \u201cchad@thenextweb.com\u201d in my email, Gmail tells me that I had chats with him, I had emails with him and I even had Wave conversations where he was included. So, someone roll up a plugin that will take my search results for a specific person and display them as a timeline chat window, instead.\nOh, and better yet, if I don\u2019t like the idea and need a bit more organization, I can kill the plugin and choose to not use it. Sorry, but from where I\u2019m sitting, this looks like backwards-thinking innovation. Zuck himself said that email was too difficult to deal with. Why, then, would I want to add more to it?\nIf I\u2019m using my Gmail and someone sends me a message, I have some choices. I can read it if I want, archive it, report it as spam or just let it sit there, among others. Though the idea of locking down your email to only the people that you know is somewhat interesting, it\u2019s like too limiting.\nHowever, let\u2019s say for a moment that it\u2019s something you want. How hard would it be for Gmail to look at my contacts and see if the email is from someone I don\u2019t know? Pretty easy, it would seem. And so I could use another Labs plugin to bounce that email back to the sender with a standard bounce message. Again, not ground-breaking.\nIn all, what Facebook announced today, again just appears to be a polished version of Google products\u2026but with fewer options. If you\u2019re already a heavy Facebook user, then maybe it\u2019s a good thing for you. If you\u2019re not, though, it\u2019s likely a change that will be far too much of a pain in the tail to use\u2026especially if you\u2019re coming from Gmail."}

The note revealed why the borrower hid the book for all those years.\n\"We found this book amongst my late brother-in-law's things. Funny thing is the book didn't support his efforts with his first (and only) marriage... it failed! No wonder he hid the book! So sorry!!\nParrott said, \"An overdue item is nothing to be ashamed of or to feel guilty about.\"\nTo remain anonymous, Parrott suggested using the library's drop box to return the overdue book. \"We want you to use the library and its resources, and we want our materials so others can use them,\" he said. \"Libraries are the greatest resource, and they're free.\"\nIn case you're wondering, this copy of Ideal Marriage cannot be borrowed because the library did not put it back into circulation as it was not in demand."}

For their 15 months there, they rented an upscale home for their family of five. The Toronto-area home had amenities like a high-style gourmet kitchen, which \u201csolidified our ideas on what we wanted and didn\u2019t want if we ever renovated our Edina house,\u201d said Alison.\nThe couple had bought their Edina home, a spec house, when it was new in 2012. With three children, including a baby, they were attracted by the size (five bedrooms), location and the big suburban lot, on which they added a swimming pool in 2013.\nWhen David was transferred back to the Twin Cities, they were ready to make modifications that the Edina house needed to fit their lifestyle and add functionality for their family. The question was: How far should they go?\nAfter doing some comparison research, it was clear that the escalating values of the neighborhood justified making a serious investment. Plus, it sat on a rare and desirable half-acre wooded lot.\nThe Mirelezes enlisted Eddie Near, director at Nor-Son Custom Builders, to put on a two-story addition, which houses a gourmet kitchen and lower-level family room, as well as a new sunroom, mudroom and an owners\u2019 bathroom retreat.\nThe couple were always bumping into each other in their previous no-frills kitchen. Thanks to the 588-square-foot bump-out on the back of the house, they were able to double the room\u2019s size. They also lightened the color scheme from dark wood tones to light gray with white.\nThe focal point of the kitchen is a 10-foot-long granite-topped furniture-style island, which the family uses for everyday prep as well as for entertaining.\n\u201cWe call it the continent,\u201d Alison joked.\nWith a six-burner Wolf range and split refrigerator and freezer, it\u2019s the ultimate cook\u2019s kitchen, complete with a modern butler\u2019s pantry that stores the microwave, toaster, coffeemaker and shelves of food. The pantry can be closed off by a sliding pocket door.\nThe part of the addition facing the backyard has become a glass-walled sunroom, where the family gathers to watch movies and play games. It\u2019s also a sweet spot for Mom and Dad to hang out in.\nDesigned to echo the architecture of the original home, the sunroom features a vaulted beam ceiling and a wall clad in reclaimed wood planks. The room is now Alison\u2019s sanctuary. \u201cI love to see the changing seasons and watch falling snow,\u201d she said.\nBy adding 531 square feet, the lower-level walkout has turned into a high-energy entertainment and recreation space, warmed by heated floors. Next to the built-in kitchenette, David added a pub table, where guests can sit for conversation and play board games, instead of lining up at a long bar counter. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to end an evening of socializing with friends,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cconcession\u201d window that opens to the swimming pool patio, so David and Alison can easily hand out refreshments to family and friends gathered there.

Some of them are particularly troubling.\nFor months, Republicans have claimed Democratic-leaning special-interest groups have been handing in fraudulent or duplicate registrations.\nIn Florida, multiple lawsuits have been filed by Democrats charging election supervisors with voter disenfranchisement. Labor unions and voting-rights groups have sued to stop some 10,000 incomplete registration forms from being disqualified.\nDemocrats also are complaining about reports in Nevada and Oregon that detail charges by former employees of an Arizona firm hired by the Republican National Committee to register voters in those states.

Last week, the Oregon state attorney general began a criminal investigation into the claim.\nPolitical parties often pay outside firms to register voters, and those firms often don't identify themselves as working for a political party. Clearly, they should state their party affiliation. Without greater transparency in the registration process, American faith in the political system is likely to erode further.\nAnd though it seems obvious, everyone from the election day volunteer up to the secretaries of state must not let their politics interfere with obtaining the most accurate vote possible.

Today, Ladino reflects the trajectories of the Sephardic Jewish diaspora, but can it survive?\nOn our way to Sarajevo's Ashkenazi Synagogue for the Friday evening Shabbat (Sabbath) service, my friend Paula Goldman and I walked down cobblestone streets through the Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija, the old Ottoman area of the city, passing mosques, shops and a madrasa (Islamic school). It was the year 2000, and the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina still bore the scars of the Balkans War. A Nato tank rolled by as we crossed the Miljacka river.\nAs we entered the second floor of the salmon-coloured stone building with its four onion-shaped domes, light flooded through doors set with stained glass images of the Star of David and into the synagogue. We took our seats among the congregation as cantor David Kamhi took his place in front of the ark that held the Torah (a scroll containing the Five Books of Moses). Soon, the synagogue filled with the harmonies of prayer. Paula and I looked at each other strangely when we heard \u2018Adonaj es mi pastor. No mankare de nada\u2019 (The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want) from Psalm 23 recited in what we thought was Spanish. After the service, I asked Blanka Kamhi, the cantor\u2019s wife, why the congregation was praying in Spanish.\nLike many Bosnian Jews, Kamhi and his wife are descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain by the Edict of Expulsion in 1492. During the Spanish Inquisition, Jews who did not voluntarily convert to Catholicism were expelled from the country, killed or forcibly converted. Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire invited the displaced Sephardic Jews to settle in the Balkans, where they were permitted to maintain their religion and customs. Many chose to move to the Ottoman Empire, while others moved to North Africa, the Netherlands and the Americas.\nWhen the Jews left Spain, they took their language with them. Over the last 500 years, the language has maintained the structure of medieval Spanish and sounds more similar to some forms of Latin American Spanish than European Spanish. \u201cWe could not have contact with Spain and the Spanish language, and therefore we have a special language that we speak,\u201d Kamhi said.\nToday, the language is known by a number of different names: Ladino, Judeo-Spanish, Judezmo, Spanyolit, Djidi\u00f3 (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Haketia (in North Africa). And, according to Unesco, it is one of the world\u2019s 6,000 languages that are at risk of extinction.\nBefore World War Two, Sarajevo\u2019s Jewish population numbered around 12,000, and the people even printed their own newspaper in Ladino. After the Holocaust, only about 2,500 Jews returned to Sarajevo, with many of them restricting their use of Ladino to the home so as not to stand out. Since the post-World War Two Jewish community in Sarajevo was so small, the Sephardic Jews had to share a synagogue \u2013 the one where Kamhi led services until 2017 \u2013 with the Ashkenazi Jewish community, whose ancestors had relocated"}
{"idx": "26958", "prompt": "Continue the following text: During the business portion of the Little Cypress-Mauriceville CISD Board of Trustees meeting on Monday, August 13, the Board continued to review expected revenues and expenditures for the very difficult upcoming budget. Taxable values of property in the District declined by more than $29 million due primarily to Hurricane Harvey damage. State funding for the District will also be less next year due to a loss in students after the storm. The District had to obtain a loan of $15 million last year to be able to make needed hurricane repairs while waiting on FEMA funding to come through. The repayment of that loan starts in the upcoming budget which, along with increased insurance costs, make up the bulk of almost $1.4 million in increased expenditures. However, almost $1 million was cut in other areas of the budget including almost $700,000 in positions that were not filled when employees resigned. With these reductions, the overall increases to the budget are less than 1% or about $344,000.\nAt this week\u2019s meeting, the Board made the decision to publish the proposed 2019 tax rate that the Board will vote on at the public meeting to discuss the budget and proposed tax rate which will be at 5:30 p.m. onTuesday, August 28, 2018. The proposed rate is 13 cents higher than last year\u2019s rate. Even with the tax rate increase and the reductions to expenditures, the budget is expected to be deficit by $2.2 million.\nAlthough the proposed tax rate is above the rollback rate, there will not be a rollback election as Texas Property Tax Code Section 26.08 allows school districts to adopt a tax rate higher than the rollback rate in the year following a hurricane or other disaster without a rollback election. This only applies for one year. Although the tax rate may be increasing, some taxpayers may not see an actual increase in taxes if their property values are down. The average market value of residences in LCM was $122,024 last year but is only $110,208 this year. When exemptions are applied to those average rates, the taxes due is $54 less than last year when the increased tax rate is applied.\nLast year\u2019s M&O rate was $1.04, and the I&S rate was $0.39 for a total of $1.43. There have been no changes in the District\u2019s tax rate since 2015. This year, the proposed I&S rate will stay at $0.39, but the proposed M&O rate is $1.17 for a total of $1.56. This will be reconsidered next year, but for the M&O rate to stay the same, a rollback election will have to be held at that time."}

It trades in Obamacare\u2019s guaranteed payouts for a new program of federal spending that looks vaguely adequate in year one. But Tryancare then caps future payouts \u2013 at a growth rate far below health care inflation.\nEven over a short time horizon, Tryancare will strangle the budgets both of middle-class families trying to renew insurance policies and of state governments working to provide health services to the working poor and the elderly.\nLeave aside for now the budget machinations of Tryancare \u2013 in short, the bill would give massive tax cuts to a lot of rich people \u2013 and focus just on the policy changes.\nFirst, give the plan a bit of credit for what it does not do: It doesn\u2019t kick young adults off their parents\u2019 plans. It doesn\u2019t end protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It doesn\u2019t allow insurers to impose lifetime caps on benefits.\nSo what are the big changes?\nTryancare does away with Obamacare\u2019s premium supports \u2013 by which the government now pays a large percentage of the monthly insurance bill for millions of middle-class Americans. Instead, Tryancare would mail out a monthly refundable tax credit \u2013 essentially, a check from Uncle Sam \u2013 for Americans to buy their own health plans.\nUnlike Obamacare, Tryancare does not account for huge, regional variations in the cost of insurance. And it does not offer larger subsidies to the poorest Americans. The tax credit varies only by age, growing more generous with each decade reached. The subsidy does phase out for Americans with incomes over $75,0000 (individuals) or $150,0000 (couples) per year.\nHere\u2019s the gist: If you\u2019re under 30, you get $2,000 a year in federal support. If you\u2019re between 40 and 50 years of age, you get $3,000 to buy premiums. And if you\u2019re over 60, the payout jumps to $4,000 a year. The credits accrue to each member of a family \u2013 but the payout maxes out at $14,000.\nUnder Tryancare, there would be no IRS penalty for failing to get or maintain a policy. Instead, Tryancare would punish people who don\u2019t maintain insurance coverage by allowing insurers to charge 30 percent higher premiums in the first year of their enrollment or re-enrollment.\nMedicaid is a health insurance program for low-income Americans; the federal government pays the lion\u2019s share of program costs, with states picking up the rest. Obamacare provided funds to expand Medicaid from a program generally limited to women and children in poverty to create, instead, universal coverage for the poor and working poor. But a Supreme Court decision made expansion optional in the states; as a result, the U.S. now has a patchwork system where Medicaid benefits vary dramatically across state lines.\nTryancare doesn\u2019t immediately reverse Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion; it sustains expanded funding for Medicaid recipients who enroll before a 2019 deadline \u2013 and don\u2019t later lose"}

Drexel Burnham Lambert Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, and since then the subsidiaries have been unloading their securities and commodities.\nThe creditors of the commodities subsidiary, the Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corporation, filed for the subsidiary to be liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.\nThe creditors who filed the petition were the National Bank of Yugoslavia, Banco de Portugal, Ultramar Energy and Nissho Iwai.\nDrexel did not challenge the petition, but said it would excercise its right to convert the case into a Chapter 11 proceeding. Under such a proceeding, Drexel lawyers have said the firm would have greater latitude in selling its holdings than it would under a liquidation.\nAlthough the commodities subsidiary has sold most of its contracts, it has been unable to recover $645 million it is owed by the parent. That debt is the largest single asset ofthe commodities trading group.\nLawyers for the creditors said yesterday that the filing was made because they did not believe that the parent, which was still overseeing the day-to-day operations of the trading corporation, was acting in a way that would allow creditors of the subsidiary to recover the debts.\nRichard Krasnow, a lawyer with Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which is representing Drexel, said that creditors to the parent have had a wide say in the liquidation process, and that no significant decisions have been made recently without their knowledge.\nAdvisers in the case said they did not believe yesterday's filing would have a significant impact on the proceedings. ''I don't think it alters things very much,'' said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the creditors committee of Drexel.\nThe concerns among the creditors of the subsidiary were said to have been heightened last week, when Drexel tried to establish a $10 million hedge. The hedge was intended to decrease the possibility that debts would increase with changes in currency values, because not all of the debts were in the same currency. While the effort was rejected, yesterday's filing means that all of the debts will become dollar denominated, lawyers said. The central banks of Yugoslavia and Portugal, as well as other customers, are owed hundreds of millions of dollars as the result of trading by the commodities division in precious metals.\nFor example, Portugal's central bank is owed $120 million as a result of the parent's collapse."}

He also suggested the UK should not count on the same rights and obligations as EU members after it leaves.\n\"Third countries can never have the same rights and benefits as members,\" Barnier said.\nHe reiterated that negotiations would not start before the official notification, and that the EU's single market and its four freedoms were indivisible.\n\"Cherrypicking is not an option,\" he said.\nBarnier also said there could be no deal on the future relationship between the EU and the UK until the UK had formally left the bloc.\n\"These things cannot be done together legally,\" he said.\nWhen asked about a possible transitional period, he said that he needed first to know what the UK wants, \"is ready to ask and accept\" before he can envisage such a period.\nBarnier has travelled to 18 member states so far to prepare the EU position, and he said he would visit all 27 by the end of January.\nHe has a team of 30 people, who \u2013 along with the commission services and the EU Council negotiating team \u2013 have screened the EU law to check which issues need to be discussed with the UK.\nOnce May has triggered Article 50, the 27 other states will set the framework for negotiations and give a negotiating mandate to the commission.\nBarnier pledged to keep the European Parliament, the college of commissioners, and member states up to date.\nAsked about the open border issue between Ireland and Northern Ireland that could become an EU's external border once the UK leaves, he said that the EU would do its \"utmost to find a way to preserve the success of the Good Friday agreement,\" the 1998 peace deal in Northern Ireland.\nBarnier also said he did not know what a \"hard\" or a \"soft\" Brexit was: \"I can tell what Brexit is.

The Wall Street Journal\u2019s All Things Digital blog reports that Twitter\u2019s ad plan is tied to Twitter search (and third-parties that use the API), uses Twitter\u2019s 140 character limit, and includes a self-serve platform akin to Google AdWords. Succinctly, it describes the plan as \"Copy Google.\"\nAs Twitter\u2019s been implying all along, the idea here is to be as non-invasive as possible. As opposed to inserting ads into your stream, Twitter is only going to place ads in search. On the other hand, if third-party apps like TweetDeck or Seesmic jump on board (and WSJ says a revenue share will incentivize them to do so), the searches you run and set up inside the program would conceivably include ads.\nMy initial thought is that while this sounds like a win for users (no annoying ads in stream), it might not be the huge windfall you\u2019d expect for Twitter. When you search Twitter, you\u2019re typically looking for comments and conversation about a topic \u2014 not necessarily products or services to buy that relate to it. While the 140 character twist sounds interesting, I\u2019d expect the payout to be a lot more like AdSense (contextual ads) than AdWords (search ads).\nNonetheless, if The Wall Street Journal has the broad strategy correct, Twitter will be able to both advertise on-site and in the third-party clients that have become such a popular means for accessing the service. With Twitter now seeing upwards of 1.5 billion tweets per month, the opportunity is still likely substantial, though we don\u2019t know what Twitter\u2019s total search volume looks like.\nIt does appear, however, that we\u2019ll at long last soon have some answers surrounding the omnipresent (if not slightly tired at this point) question of how Twitter plans to make money."}

He\u2019s given himself up to another 18 months at the helm, or at least the opportunity to depart gracefully on his own terms if the board identifies someone beforehand.\nIf Borghetti were to see out his extended notice period he would have been in the role for nearly a decade.\nReviews of his performance will be - ought to be - mixed.\nBorghetti was recruited by Virgin Blue to succeed its founding CEO, Brett Godfrey, after losing out on the top job at Qantas to Alan Joyce. He came with a reputation for understanding the product \u2013 the planes and lounges \u2013 that appeals to business travellers.\nOn that front he delivered. Virgin has a better fleet, a better business travel offer, better lounges and a loyalty program that it didn\u2019t have when he started. It is a genuine competitor to Qantas, albeit that Qantas\u2019 remains dominant in market share and profitability.\nThe strategy Borghetti pursued appeared a rational one. Virgin had recently been buffeted by the impact of the financial crisis on what was, in 2010, a low-cost carrier with a disproportionate exposure to leisure travel.\nNevertheless, after losing $160 million in 2008-09 Virgin had returned to profit in 2009-10, with statutory earnings of $21.3 million.\nThe airline, famously started just ahead of Ansett\u2019s collapse with capital of only $10 million, had an equity base of about $1 billion and retained earnings of more than $300 million.\nOver Godfrey\u2019s 10-year tenure it generated about $1 billion of pre-tax earnings, paid dividends and returned capital to its shareholders.\nWhether Borghetti\u2019s strategy of creating a serious challenger to Qantas was itself ill-conceived or whether he was too ambitious and tried to do too much too quickly, the financial outcomes definitely haven\u2019t realised the ambition.\nAt the end of last financial year, after raising $1.5 billion in new equity from shareholders in four years and generating $335 million of cash from the sale of a 35 per cent interest in its Velocity loyalty program in 2014, Virgin had an equity base of only $1.57 billion and a deficiency in its earnings reserves of $735 million.\nBorghetti has demonstrated that he is a consummate corporate politician.\nIt has made a profit only once during the Borghetti era ($27.2 million when the Qantas fleet was grounded in 2011-12) and has lost about $1.5 billion over that period despite roughly doubling the amount of capital employed in the business.\nIt has absolutely shredded capital. It might be a better airline than the old Virgin Blue but Virgin Blue was a far better business. Few CEOs, if any other than Borghetti, could have survived the financial performance that Virgin has produced since 2010.\nBorghetti has, however, demonstrated that he is a consummate corporate politician.\nHe has needed to be, given the nature of his share register and boardroom \u2013 although it is the nature of that register that has probably protected him from the fate that would have be"}

She came out and transitioned to presenting herself as female just after starting high school, and she said being barred from unrestricted use of the locker room is the only truly negative experience she's had from being open about it.\nShe believes unrestricted use of the locker rooms by transgender students would be a nonissue among other students she's heard from. They've told her no one gets completely undressed or showers for gym class, but she admits she has no firsthand knowledge.\n\"I've never been allowed in the locker room so far,\" Maday said. \"I can't speak about how it's used. Everybody is very modest about their body. ... I think if it were up to the students, we wouldn't even be having this discussion.\"\nThough Maday speaks of not being allowed in the locker room, the lawsuit itself specifies that restricted use of the locker room in a private area was offered by the district but rejected by Maday and her mother on the basis that non-transgender girls don't have the same requirement.\nEd Yohnka -- spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which is representing Maday in the case -- said California is a state where unrestricted access to locker rooms for transgender students is public policy. He said he knew of no difficulties in implementing that policy.\n\"Where people feel they need additional privacy, they seek it out,\" he said.\nThe ACLU is a co-defendant with District 211 in a federal lawsuit filed by a group called Students and Parents for Privacy that argues even the limited access to locker rooms that's been granted transgender students in the district goes too far.\nYohnka said Maday's lawsuit being filed with the state is a key difference. While the federal government establishes the lowest level of civil rights a citizen can expect, states can set their own standards higher.\nMaday said she hopes her lawsuit can move through the courts quickly enough to benefit her before she graduates next June, but she'll be happy enough if it benefits others after her.\n\"I'm not doing it for me,\" she said. \"I don't like the spotlight. ... One of the things I've learned is that not everyone can fight for themselves.\"\nMaday's mother, Brenda Schweda, said that's one of the many things she's learned herself from her daughter's journey.\n\"If we can help one more"}

Kasich pushed a Medicaid expansion past the Republican-controlled Legislature, in effect signing on to a key part of the federal health care law conservatives love to hate.\n\"After my first year, I was the most unpopular governor in America,\" Kasich recently told a crowd in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"Nobody likes that title, but it didn't bother me at all.\"\nIn protest of a bill limiting the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions, labor activists paraded through Ohio cities and showed up at Statehouse hearings in throngs. Citing security concerns, Kasich's public safety department locked the Statehouse doors.\nKasich didn't spearhead the 2011 legislation, but a spokesman for a group that successfully fought back the restrictions at the ballot box said he still must own how it was handled.\n\"There is nothing wrong with Gov.

According to the GAO, the government maintains 77 fusion centers throughout the country and their operations are funded by federal and local sources.\nThe ACLU obtained about 1,700 suspicious activity reports filed with the Sacramento office through a California Public Record Acts request.

The 19th century art deco Dare House at the site houses EID Parry (India) Ltd and other businesses of the Murugappa group that owns it.\nEID Parry is the largest sugar producer in south India and the fifth largest in the country. It\u2019s also present in bio-pesticides and nutraceuticals. The company also has a significant presence in the farm inputs business through its Coromandel International Ltd subsidiary. It\u2019s also buying the 49% stake in Silkroad Sugar Pvt. Ltd held by joint venture partner Cargill Asia Pacific Holdings Pte Ltd to make it a fully owned unit.\nIt was in 1788 that Britisher Thomas Parry landed in Chennai and registered as a free merchant. He founded East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Ltd, which set up the country\u2019s first sugar plant at Nellikuppam in 1842. East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories merged in 1962 to form EID Parry Ltd. Two decades later the company was struggling to survive because of labour issues. In 1981, M.V. Arunachalam of the Murugappa group took over the company and became chairman. Currently, his son A. Vellayan is chairman and Ravindra Singhvi is managing director of the company.\nThe Murugappa group traces its roots to 1900, when businessman Dewan Bahadur A.M. Murugappa Chettiar began a money-lending and banking business in Burma, now Myanmar. The group has a presence in 28 businesses that include engineering, abrasives, finance, general insurance, cycles, sugar, farm inputs and plantations. With manufacturing facilities spread across 13 states, and a workforce of more than 32,000 employees, the $4.4 billion (around \u20b9 23,848 crore today) Chennai-based group is an example of how a family managed group has transformed itself into a corporate entity run by professionals. In 1999, when M.V. Subbiah, the grandson of A.M. Murugappa, decided to step down, he brought in an external chairman for the group and let the family take advisory positions. The businesses of the group were all handed over to professional CEOs from outside the family. That decision, unusual then as now for a family-run group, is one of the key reasons why EID Parry has one of India\u2019s best-managed boards.\nThe Murugappa group today relies on a fairly compact corporate board consisting of three external independent directors, three executive directors and two family members. Each director on the executive board also doubles up as a lead director for various businesses of the group. For example, M.M. Murugappan is the lead director for Carborundum Universal Ltd and Tube Investments of India Ltd, while N. Srinivasan, director-finance of the group, is the lead director for the financial services business.\nThis top decision-making body of the group, the Murugappa corporate board, reviews various business matters that include governance, business development, talent and succession planning, besides environment and social responsibility. The board members also review the business performance of various group companies on a quarterly basis with the respective business heads.\nThe board spends 12 days a year with the group and in that time, discusses"}

What a joke.\nAlongside the idea that America was a fetid pit of misery and despair from which only he could deliver us, the most consistent theme of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was that the \u201celites\u201d had ignored the interests of ordinary people for too long. If you put your faith in him, Trump argued, he would give you your country back and make it great again. Some of us were more than a bit skeptical of this claim, arguing that Trump\u2019s \u201cpopulism\u201d was more stylistic than substantive, and if elected he\u2019d pursue the interests of the wealthy with as much zeal as any Republican.\nOn Friday, Trump signed an executive order to begin exploring ways to ease regulations on Wall Street banks. \u201cWe expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank,\u201d the law passed to prevent a repeat of the 2009 financial meltdown, he explained, \u201cBecause frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses, they just can\u2019t borrow money.\u201d Whatever the alleged fortunes of Donald Trump\u2019s friends, all evidence suggests that credit is widely available for businesses and individuals. But he made clear who he\u2019s listening to: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you\u2019re going to tell me about it,\u201d he said of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.\nAs part of the Wall Street deregulation effort, Trump will likely target the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea originated by Elizabeth Warren before she became a senator. In the five and a half years of its existence, the CFPB has returned billions of dollars to consumers wronged by banks, credit card companies, payday lenders, and debt collectors. They also unraveled the Wells Fargo scandal, in which the bank created accounts in the names of thousands of customers without their knowledge. So as far as Trump and congressional Republicans are concerned, the CFPB has got to go.\nOn Friday Trump signed another executive order instructing the Department of Labor to prepare the ground to rescind the \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d a regulation the Obama administration wrote last year. It requires financial advisers to act in their client\u2019s best interests, just like doctors or lawyers are required to. The need for it came about because often those advisers push their clients to buy products that are bad for them but that bring the advisers higher commissions. You\u2019d think that a rule saying you have to serve your client would be uncontroversial, but no.\nThe administration is preparing to kill an Obama-era Labor Department rule that would have meant overtime pay for millions of American workers.\nTrump has not yet chosen the new head of the Food and Drug Administration, but all the candidates are interested in reducing the regulations that protect consumers. The leading contender believes that drugs should be allowed on the market before they\u2019ve been shown to actually do what they claim.\nThis is just one corner of the actions the Trump administration is taking on a range of issues, but the unifying principle of these moves is that corporations should be free to do what they want, even if it hurts consumers, workers, or ordinary citizens. Indeed, the expansion of corporate power and privileges already looks like it will be one of the hallmarks of this administration.\nWhich would make it no different from any other Republican administration. But that\u2019s precisely my point: for all Trump\u2019s rhetoric about taking on the \u201celite,\u201d when it comes to making policy he\u2019s just as interested in enhancing corporate power at the expense of citizens as is Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell.\n\u201cBut what about"}

In 1880, he opened the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company. His first camera, the Kodak, was sold in 1888 and consisted of a box camera with 100 exposures. Later he offered the first Brownie camera, which was intended for children. By 1927, Eastman Kodak was the largest U.S. company in the industry. Eastman committed suicide in 1932.\nNamed after his father George Washington Eastman, George Eastman was born on July 12, 1854, in Waterville, New York. George Sr. had started a small business school, Eastman Commercial College, in Rochester, where he moved the family in 1860. But he died suddenly when George Jr. was eight. One of young George&apos;s two older sisters was wheelchair-bound from polio and died when George was 16.\nGeorge&apos;s mother, Mary, took in boarders to support the family, and George dropped out of high school at age 14 to add to the family income. He began as a messenger and office boy for insurance companies and studied accounting at home to qualify for a higher salary. He eventually landed a job as bookkeeper at the Rochester Savings Bank.\nWhen George was 24, he planned to visit Santo Domingo and, on the advice of a colleague, decided to document the trip. But the photography equipment alone was enormous, heavy and costly. He bought all the equipment, but he never took the trip.\nInstead he began researching how to make photography less cumbersome and easier for the average person to enjoy. After seeing a formula for a \"dry plate\" emulsion in a British publication, and getting tutelage from two local amateur photographers, Eastman formulated a gelatin-based paper film and a device for coating dry plates.\nHe resigned from his bank job after launching his fledgling photography company in April 1880. In 1885, he headed to the patent office with a roll-holder device that he and camera inventor William Hall Walker had developed. This allowed cameras to be smaller and cheaper.\nEastman also came up with the name Kodak, because he believed products should have their own identity, free from association with anything else. So in 1888, he launched the first Kodak camera (a few years later, he amended the company name to Eastman Kodak).\nThe company slogan was \"You press the button, we do the rest,\" which meant the camera was sent in to the company after the 100 exposures on the roll of film had been used; they developed it and sent it back to the customer. In 1889, Eastman hired chemist Henry Reichenbach to develop a type of flexible film that could be more easily inserted into cameras. Thomas Edison adapted the film for use in the motion-picture camera he was developing, further propelling the success of Eastman&apos;s company.\nThe Brownie camera was launched in 190"}

After almost 40 years of working for a newspaper, the 60- to 80-hour weeks that were and continue to be expected are doable. But when I was much younger it came a bit easier. Of course, working with the public keeps me well-rounded and motivated. But as we get older, we become different people. Although I still enjoy my job, the demands are high and many times I feel overwhelmed with so much to do.\nBut on the other hand, if I retired, I would miss the interaction with co-workers. The daily sharing of experiences along with the fellowship that grows while pursuing a common purpose is highly rewarding.\nHowever, the thought of leaving this behind does not scare me. I enjoy sharing time with others and find more than enough interaction outside the work environment. And when the time comes, and I need more socializing down the road, I can always volunteer at one of the worthwhile nonprofits or charitable organizations in our area.\nAlthough I cannot predict when that time will come, I have learned what is most important to me at this stage in life is different from what was at the top of my list in earlier years. Back then, I accepted that I would have to work long hours and spend less time at home. But now, more years and many hours behind me, sometimes I find myself refocusing on new priorities. There is not a whole lot that I want. I know that good health is truly a blessing not to be taken lightly. And although I may have missed spending quality time with my late husband, I foresee in the distant future getting to spend time with my children and grandchildren. I do think I have learned what is important, and when that time comes, I will take advantage of that hard-earned knowledge.\nBut as many of you know , one of the biggest risks of entering retirement is not having enough to do to keep busy, and I don\u2019t think anyone wants their retirement days to stretch painfully on.\nFortunately, I have come to the conclusion that when it comes to staying active, it will have to be up to me, and of course God, to find discoveries along the way into retirement.

I already have the perfect spot picked out for the hammock.\nPeople say that you personally will know when it is your time to retire. If and when that time comes, I will happily take the well-deserved plunge.\nCongratulations to Lee Austin who has accepted a job at Cumberland University in Lebanon as their Jazz Band Director and Pep Band Director.

He recently interviewed over 200 ultra-successful people, including 7 billionaires, 13 Olympians, and a host of accomplished entrepreneurs. One of his most revealing sources of information came from their answers to a simple open-ended question: What is your number one secret to productivity?\nIn analyzing their responses, Kruse coded the answers to yield some fascinating suggestions. What follows are some of my favorites from Kevin's findings.\nMost people default to hour and half-hour blocks on their calendar; highly successful people know that there are 1,440 minutes in every day and that there is nothing more valuable than time. Money can be lost and made again, but time spent can never be reclaimed. As legendary Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller told Kevin, \"To this day, I keep a schedule that is almost minute by minute.\" You must master your minutes to master your life.\nUltra-productive people know what their \"Most Important Task\" is and work on it for one to two hours each morning, without interruptions. What task will have the biggest impact on reaching your goals? What accomplishment will get you promoted at work? That's what you should dedicate your mornings to every day.\nThrow away your to-do list; instead schedule everything on your calendar. It turns out that only 41% of items on to-do lists ever get done. All those undone items lead to stress and insomnia because of the Zeigarnik effect, which, in essence, means that uncompleted tasks will stay on your mind until you finish them. Highly productive people put everything on their calendar and then work and live by that calendar.\nYour future self can't be trusted. That's because we are time inconsistent. We buy veggies today because we think we'll eat healthy salads all week; then we throw out green rotting mush in the future. Successful people figure out what they can do now to make certain their future selves will do the right thing. Anticipate how you will self-sabotage in the future, and come up with a solution today to defeat your future self.\nKevin first learned this one from Intel's Andy Grove, who said, \"There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done.\" Highly successful people know what they value in life. Yes, work, but also what else they value. There is no right answer, but for many, these other values include family time, exercise, and giving back. They consciously allocate their 1,440 minutes a day to each area they value (i.e., they put them on their calendar), and then they stick to that schedule.\nRichard Branson has said on more than one occasion that he wouldn't have been able to build Virgin"}

(CN) \u2013 A federal judge indicated Thursday she won\u2019t order Planned Parenthood to turn over information about the costs of its fetal tissue donation program that anti-abortion activists say would show it profits from aborted fetal tissue.\nThe issue is just one component in a bitter lawsuit that accuses the activists of smearing Planned Parenthood as a \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d in their attempt to hamper abortion access.\nIn the Oakland hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said she would review a 2016 Congressional report and raw footage anti-abortion activists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt secretly shot inside abortion conferences purporting to show its doctors haggling over the price of fetal tissue to evaluate their request for the information.\nDaleiden and his co-defendants say they have evidence that four California Planned Parenthood affiliates profited from fetal tissue donations by taking in more money than they spent facilitating the donations. The affiliates denied that the payments exceeded their reimbursement costs.\nAfter the affiliates denied the allegation, the activists challenged them to identify the facts, documents and witnesses supporting their response.\nBut Ryu cautioned Thursday that the information may not be relevant enough to warrant discovery.\n\u201cIf it turns out that this is a rabbit hole, that this is not particularly relevant, or even if it\u2019s marginally relevant to something that is not going to be a big issue in the case, then there may be no further discovery or limited discovery,\u201d she said.\nPlanned Parenthood sued in 2016, claiming Daleiden and Merritt endangered the safety of its doctors and patients and cost it millions of dollars in increased security costs after they posted doctored videos online making it seem as if Planned Parenthood sells aborted fetal tissue.\nThe videos led to a near-shutdown of the women\u2019s health organization in 2015, after GOP lawmakers threatened to pull its funding.\nDaleiden and Merritt separately moved to dismiss the suit and strike state claims of fraud, trespass, invasion of privacy, nonconsensual taping and contract. The pair insists the First Amendment protects their activities as \u201cinvestigative journalists\u201d \u2013 which included using fake driver\u2019s licenses to gain access to the conferences. They said Planned Parenthood failed to adequately plead its claims or marshal enough evidence to support them.\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco tossed all four motions. In May, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed his rulings.\nIn an interview outside the courtroom, Daleiden disputed that the information he seeks is irrelevant.\nIn the hearing, Daleiden\u2019s attorney Peter Breen with the Thomas More Society in Chicago referred Ryu to a Republican report issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee in December 2016 for a discussion of findings that Planned Parenthood made more money than it spent facilitating tissue donations.\nAccording to the report \u2013 which Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, posted on his website \u2013 three fetal tissue procurement companies had since 2010 paid Planned Parenthood affiliates \u201csubstantially\u201d more for aborted fetal tissue than it cost.\nMoreover, the report found, although Planned Parenthood had a policy to ensure its affiliates were only reimbursed for the costs of facilitating donations"}

Texas Tribune reporter Jay Root reveals Perry's poor performance could be chalked up to one thing: an undiagnosed sleep disorder.\nRoot is releasing a new book called Oops!A Diary from the 2012 Campaign Trail, and it was excerpted in the Texas Tribune and the New York Times. Root talks about his time following the Perry campaign's slow decline from front-runner to punchline to afterthought.\nBack at headquarters in Austin, Perry\u2019s health \u2014 his severe lack of sleep, mainly \u2014 became a central focus. \u201cOur guy\u2019s not sleeping,\u201d Dave Carney said in the office in a brainstorming session about the governor\u2019s condition.\nPerry had kept in touch with his medical team, and by early October, days after the Florida fiasco, he had urgently consulted sleep specialists. After conducting overnight tests on Perry, they produced a rather startling diagnosis: He had sleep apnea, and it had gone undetected for years, probably decades.\nPerry's debate performances are a thing of legend at this point, but not for any good reason. At least now he has an excuse. The condition had previously gone undetected until a back surgery in the summer of 2011 stopped his regular exercise routine, which caused his apnea to start bothering him. Root says by the time the diagnosis was in Perry's campaign team had split into two warring factions. Things were done. He was bowing out of the race."}

But Greeks for centuries have wanted them back; the deal was made before their country fought for independence from the monarchy. NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Christopher Livesay reports.\nThe story starts in the early 1800s. The Parthenon had fallen to ruin. Half the marbles were destroyed by neglect and war. Then, a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, made an agreement with Ottoman authorities who were in control of Athens at the time to remove some of statues and friezes. He took about half of the remaining sculptures.\nAnd then he shipped that back to the UK. For a long time it remained part of his personal collection so he put it on display and then he made the decision to sell the collection to the nation. And the Parliament chose to acquire it and then pass it on the British Museum. So we would certainly say that Lord Elgin had performed a great service in terms of rescuing some of these examples.\nIn fact, the Acropolis Museum was built in part as a response to the British Museum's claim that Greece did not have a proper place to display the sculptures. The glass and steel structure has a dramatic view of the Acropolis, so while you're observing the art you can see the actual Parthenon. The third floor is set up just like the Parthenon, with the same proportions. These friezes, from the west side of the temple, are nearly all original. On the other three sides, there are some originals but also a lot of gaps, as well as white plaster copies of the friezes and statues now in Britain.\nWe believe that one day we could replace the copies with the orginals to show all this unique art in its grandeur. Every block has two or three figures and here is only one.\nDimitrios Pandermalis is the Director of the Acropolis Museum where the story of the missing marbles differs widely from that of the British Museum. Presentations for visitors portray Lord Elgin critically. One film shows the marbles flying off the Parthenon and calls it the uncontrollable plundering of the Acropolis. You have these videos that actually show how the pieces were removed. Another film depicts how one of the marbles was crudely split by Elgin's workmen.\nHe damaged the art pieces, yes.\nHe did damage some of these pieces.\nOf course, it was to be expected.\nI think the situation we find ourselves in now we feel is quite beneficial. It ensures that examples of the wonderful sculptures from the Parthenon can be seen by a world audience here at the British Museum and in a world context in terms of being able to compare with Egypt and Rome and so on and so forth. But we feel the two narratives we are able to tell with the objects being in two different places is beneficial to everybody.\nBut Pandermalis says rather than being in two places the sculptures should be reunified, literally. He showed us examples around the museum, including one that is almost complete save for one thing.\nAnd this. The chest of the god Poseidon. So the marble portion in the center where we can see clearly defined the abdomen, that's original but the surrounding portion in plaster, the shoulders, that's in London. So the piece has been completely split in half.\nAnd perhaps most dramatic, this frieze. So the darker stone is the original and the white plaster that represents"}
