Toshiba states that going forward their retail SSDs will be sold under the Toshiba brand name, while OCZ will be a sub-series. They further state that all Toshiba retail SSDs will have OCZ performance \"DNA\" and target the enthusiast and gaming market which includes entry-level DIY system builders and first-time upgraders from HDDs under the same umbrella.\nBiCS is what Toshiba calls their vertically stacked three-dimensional (3D) flash memory. BiCS flash, has far higher die area density compared to two-dimensional (planar) NAND flash memory. This is because with 3D memory technology, NAND flash strings run vertically. Think of 3D NAND flash as a skyscraper building and planar flash as a single-story building. Both can have the same footprint, but the skyscraper can have hundreds of times more floor space depending on how many floors, or layers in the case of 3D NAND, are used.\n3D NAND flash has many inherent advantages over 2D (planar) flash that go beyond density alone. 3D NAND flash can be programmed faster than 2D can. Spaces between memory cells on 3D flash are far wider than in 2D NAND flash memory. This makes it possible to improve the programming speed and at the same time reduce power consumption by increasing the amount of data for a single programming sequence. The wider open spaces between cells also decreases cell coupling providing greater reliability and endurance in comparison to 2D NAND flash memory.\nThe TR200 pairs Toshiba's 2-channel TC58 controller with a third generation Toshiba BiCS 3D flash array. BiCS 3D flash will only come in TLC (3-bit) or QLC (4-bit) flavors, there will be no MLC (2-bit) variants. Toshiba is confident that the performance and endurance offered by BiCS 3 is at minimum on par with planar MLC flash. Just as we no longer see new retail SLC flash products brought to market, the day is coming sooner rather than later where we may no longer see new MLC flash products hitting store shelves.\nHigher Capacity: Vertically stacked cell structure enables higher capacity in the same footprint.\nHigher Endurance: Charge trap cell & memory hole structure increase endurance.\nHigher Performance: Faster programming speed with 1-shot program called \"Full Sequence\". Triple pages can be programed simultaneously with fewer steps.\nHigher Power Efficiency: Triple pages can be programed with almost the same power consumption of a single page program.\nSo far, we've seen BiCS 3 64-Layer 3D TLC flash featured on two enthusiast level SATA SSDs coming from Toshiba's flash partner Western Digital, as well as Toshiba's own blazing fast XG5 OEM client NVMe SSD. Now, Toshiba has their sights set on penetrating the SATA DIY upgrade value segment with BiCS 3.

The trade row has generated a ripple effect on the global economy, including the Philippines which is a long-time ally of the US and is currently trying to strengthen its economic ties with China.\nSo far, according to recent international media reports, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods, totaling more than $250 billion. This covers a wide range of consumer and industrial items, including handbags, rice and railway equipment. China, for its part, has struck back and has set tariffs on $110 billion worth of American goods. China\u2019s list of products subject to levies includes chemicals, coal and medical equipment.\nThe trade war has already shown signs of economic strain. Some international firms have admitted that they are being harmed from global trade tariffs.\nIn Asia, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the escalating US-China trade tension will most likely hurt Asian exporters of electronic products to China, including that of the Philippines.\nIn a May statement, the credit rating agency said that Asia continues to rely on merchandise exports to generate economic growth, with manufacturing-based economies and the region\u2019s two trans-shipment hubs \u2014 Singapore and Hong Kong \u2014 most reliant on trade.\n\u201cThe region\u2019s rising intra-regional trade linkages will increasingly define trade patterns in Asia, while the integration of the region in the global economy also shows in rising foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in manufacturing,\u201d Moody\u2019s Managing Director for Sovereign Risk in Asia Marie Diron was quoted as saying in a statement.\n\u201cSince the global financial crisis, Asia\u2019s exports to the US and EU have remained largely flat as a percentage of GDP, but intra-regional trade has, by contrast, grown strongly,\u201d Ms. Diron added.\nMoody\u2019s Vice-President and Senior Analyst Joy Rankothge, on the other hand, said that China, being at the center of Asia\u2019s trade activity, takes part in shaping the region\u2019s supply chains and is increasingly a source of demand for final goods from Asia, especially for consumption goods.\n\u201cAccordingly, the region is vulnerable to a further escalation in tensions between the US and China over trade and technology transfers. Additional US restrictions on Chinese exports, investment and purchases of technology supplies would have an impact the rest of Asia through supply chains,\u201d Mr. Rankothge said.\nIn the Philippines, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported last October that electronic products continued to be the top exported commodity of the country in the first semester of 2018, with 55.7% share to the total exports.

Canada has pitched in more than half-a-billion dollars over the last 20 years, including $54 million last year.\nBut that amount was based on the Stephen Harper government\u2019s plan to buy 65 new fighter jets to replace Canada\u2019s aging CF-18s, which the Trudeau government has since officially increased to 88.\nEven though Canada has not committed that those 88 jets will be F-35s, the Department of National Defence says that change means it will have to pay more to remain a partner \u2014 including about $72 million this year.\n\u201cCanada\u2019s costs under the F-35 (partnership agreement) are based on an intended fleet size,\u201d Defence Department spokeswoman Ashley Lemire said in an email.\nAs each partner contribution is determined annually, based on the overall cost of the F-35 development program for that specific year, Lemire said she could not provide details how much more Canada will have to pay.\nThe F-35\u2019s development costs have been a constant source of criticism over the life of the stealth-fighter program, which Canada first joined under the Chretien government in 1997. The entire program is believed to have already cost more than US$1 trillion.\nThe Trudeau government says it plans to keep Canada in the F-35 development effort until a replacement for the CF-18s is chosen \u2014 partners in the development work can buy the planes at a lower price and compete for work associated with their production and long-term maintenance.\nCanadian companies have so far won more than $1.2 billion in contracts related to the F-35, according to the government.\nThe F-35 is one of four planes slated to participate in the $19-billion competition that the government plans to launch this spring, the others being Boeing\u2019s Super Hornet, Eurofighter\u2019s Typhoon and Saab\u2019s Gripen.\nThe competition isn\u2019t scheduled to select a winner until 2021 or 2022, meaning Canada will be on the hook for several more payments. The first new aircraft is expected in 2025 and the last in 2031, when the CF-18s will be phased out.\nF-35 maker Lockheed Martin says more than 350 of the stealth fighters have been delivered to different countries, while Israel became the first country to use the plane in combat last year when two of the jets struck targets in neighbouring Syria."}

Emboldened by this groundswell, some progressives have started using the word \u201cprimary\u201d as a verb \u2013 and as a threat.\nFor Democrats in Washington, many of whom are still surprised by the scale and furiousness of backlash, the challenge is how to convert this energy into electoral success.\nSchumer has significantly slowed the pace of Trump\u2019s cabinet confirmations and excoriated many of the president\u2019s nominees. But the activists outside Schumer\u2019s home on that January night were unimpressed by his votes in favor of Trump\u2019s nominees to represent the US in the UN and to lead the Pentagon, CIA and Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cOur message to Democrats is simple: fight Trump or we\u2019ll find someone who will,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, a co-founder of the progressive group All of Us and a former organizer with the Bernie Sanders campaign. This week, the group launched the political action committee We Will Replace You, the latest in a series of projects to warn Democrats that failures to oppose Trump\u2019s agenda will have consequences.\nThe group argues that Democrats need to exercise the little political power they still have. The activists have a long list of demands: votes against \u201call Trump appointees\u201d, opposing his supreme court nominee, using congressional procedures to \u201cbring all business to a crawl to block Trump\u2019s agenda and demand Steve Bannon be fired\u201d.

With his party shut out of power in Washington, public shows of support are arguablyits most powerful weapon, but he must also worry about the lawmakers in his caucus facing elections in states where Trump won.\nDemocrats must defend 23 Senate seats in the 2018 election cycle, 10 from states that Trump won in November.

What's going on with the extreme weather this year?\nMost of it is par for the course, experts say, because we live in the nation with the world's wildest weather extremes: No other country on Earth has the USA's ferocious weather stew of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, wildfires, blizzards, heat waves and cold snaps.\n\"You'd be hard-pressed to find another patch of land on Earth the size of the USA that boasts such a variety of such intensely extreme weather inside its borders,\" said meteorologist and author Robert Henson of Boulder, Colorado.\nMore statistics: While the eight deaths from severe storms was certainly a tragedy on Sunday, the number pales in comparison to the horrific tornado outbreak of Palm Sunday 1965, when 271 people were killed by 47 tornadoes.\nTornadoes, such as the ones that slammed Texas on Wednesday, are nearly a uniquely American phenomenon. Each year, \"the U.S. experiences about 80% to 90% of all the tornadoes that occur across the world,\" says Randy Cerveny, a professor of geography at Arizona State University.\nWhile climate change does have a documented effect on many extreme weather events, it has no clear connection to severe thunderstorms nor the tornadoes they produce. In fact, a 2016 report from the National Academy of Sciences found that of all weather phenomena, severe storms have the least connection to human-caused climate change.\nThat's not the case for other types of extreme weather, however: That report found there were clear links between climate change and heat waves, droughts, heavy rain and snowstorms.\nThe floods that swamped the central U.S. after the first \"bomb cyclone\" snow and rain storm in March had a climate change connection, scientists said last month. The root causes of the floods \u2013 like wetter weather and rapid spring warm-ups \u2013 also have become more likely because of climate change, according to Yale University.\nThe flooding was consistent with projections in a government report last November, the National Climate Assessment Volume II, which said climate change would increase the frequency of powerful storms.\nClimate change, or global warming, is caused by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. That has raised the global temperature and also worsened climate and weather disasters around the world, the U.N. has said.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 26.7 degrees, a mind-boggling 15.9 degrees above the long-term average. (Most monthly temperature records are broken by a few degrees, or even tenths of degrees.) That exceeded the previous warmest March in 1965 by more than 3 degrees, NOAA said.\nIn fact, all long-term climate stations north of the Alaska Range and Bristol Bay had their warmest March on record. And amazingly, Kotzebue's average March temperature was warm enough to be among its 10 warmest Aprils on record, NOAA said.\nHeat waves remain one of the clearest signals of Earth's warming climate, as"}

After all, a potato's a potato, and even the most inexperienced cook has a pretty good idea of how to prepare it.\nAnd yet it's surprisingly easy to end up with gluey mash, limp chips or leathery roast potatoes. It turns out that the humble potato is quite a complex structure.\nIf you want to get the best out of it, it's worth understanding that structure, and how best to handle it to create lovely, silky mash, or chips and roast potatoes with a wonderfully crunchy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. First of all, a potato isn't just a potato.\nBehind that name lie hundreds of varieties, among them anya, charlotte, desiree, king edward, marfona, maris piper and pink fir apple*. Each of these has a slightly different structure that responds slightly differently to cooking. Choosing the right potato will make a difference to the end result.\nHeston Blumenthal ... how to cook the perfect potato.\nAlthough it looks like a solid knobbly lump, about three-quarters of a potato is water. The rest is known as ''dry matter'', principally starch. It's the dry matter that gives a potato its flavour, and managing the dry matter is central to cooking good mash, chips and roast potatoes.\nGrowing conditions have such an influence on dry matter that the amount in a single variety can vary virtually from field to field, depending on the temperature, rainfall and drainage. It's not an exact science. You can cook a particular variety perfectly one day, then find it responds badly the next.\nIn general, floury potatoes, such as anya, king edward and maris piper, have more dry matter, while the waxy charlotte and marfona have less. You might therefore think it's a simple case of going for a potato with high dry matter, after all, maximising flavour is what it's all about. But there's more to it.\nAll starch granules are made up of a proportion of two molecules - amylose and amylopectin - which respond to heat and cooking in different ways. Amylose tends to form a strong, tightly knitted gel; amylopectin coheres more loosely.\nI'm looking forward to the day when bags of potatoes come with information about dry-matter percentages and amylose-amylopectin ratios printed on them - it will really help cooks find the perfect potato. For chips or roast potatoes, you're looking for a variety that's high in dry matter, with a reasonable proportion of amylose to help keep the shape. For mash, too much amylose is best avoided as it can lead to a gummy consistency.\nWhen cooking roast potatoes (and chips), I want an interior that's soft and fluffy, with a crisp, almost glass-like, crust. Although you're working towards these aims simultaneously, it's helpful to think of them as separate tasks, each requiring a specific process.\nFor that soft interior, it's best to use a type of potato with a high dry-matter content and simmer carefully until it's almost falling apart.

And of the more than 30 countries represented at the ceremony, many of them \u2014 including Mexico, Iran and Canada \u2014 have repeatedly incurred the president\u2019s ire.\nAt the ceremony, the influence of Trump\u2019s policies was apparent, as a small group of speakers \u2014 including Andrew H.

And in the shade of a tent that served free cola floats, voter registration clipboards were circulated among the new citizens, identifiable by their commemorative medals and tightly clutched American flags.\nNagy, 55, who received his green card through the diversity visa lottery program that Trump has called to end, stood up to briefly share his joy over fulfilling a 20-year dream of becoming an American citizen.\nBut he said that it did not take away from his love for the United States, which started two decades earlier when he visited New York for the first time and marveled at what he saw as the peaceful integration of so many cultures.\nLike many of the people naturalized Wednesday, Nagy broke into a broad grin after reciting the oath, waving to family members in the crowd.\nThe magnitude of becoming a citizen, she said, was amplified by the ceremony\u2019"}

The company\u2019s products are conceived in the classroom by children, and are made from local hardwoods in Honduras, completely by its people.\nSince 2007, Tegu has planted 26,000 trees in Honduras, funded 3,500 days of school for disadvantaged children amounting to more than $10,000 and also created 50 jobs for locals.\nThe Haugheys are part of a growing trend of small businesses working toward the greater good. Instead of just worrying about their bottom line, these companies are giving back in some way as a part of their business plan.\nDave Blanchard, founder of Praxis, which assists employee-owned non-profit and socially-responsible businesses, said more and more startups are leaning toward giving back and adopting social responsibility into their missions because workers are demanding it.\nThose under 35 considering starting a business will rarely consider it without a social component, Blanchard said, and he predicts the trend will continue. Praxis works with 12 nonprofits and startups, or fellows, yearly, choosing them from a pool of applicants -- all aiming for social impact within their models. They participate in a six-month long program and have access to mentors to help them with key organizational developments. The program typically works with businesses and organizations with less than $2 million in revenue, he said. Tegu, which is headquartered in Darien, Conn., was a Praxis fellow.\nLike the Haugheys, Evan Goldsmith, founder and owner of Hope for Women, was inspired to start his business after multiple trips to India in the 1990s. He worked on a service project in the Himalayas creating pressed-flower greeting cards with local women for a group in the U.K., and said he wanted to stay connected after moving back home.\nHe decided to open his business that same year as a Fair Trade company, a popular business model where the company is based in Burlington, Vt. The company sells products such as Tagua nut hair ties made by local women in Colombia, India and El Salvador, and has also partnered with cosmetics company Aveda selling these items. The company is registered with the Fair Trade Federation.\nMelinda Haselton, owner of Burlington, Vt.-based Dolma Fair Trade, also works with local artisans in Dhramsala, India. She first met the people of the community while teaching there in her early 20s. In 2006, she was inspired to give back to the community that had so deeply touched her during her work there.\nThe artisans hand-make table linens and scarves that Haselton sells online and to retailers, donating 15% back to women and children in India.

The level opens as he zips into a canyon that has been fortified with an alien ship of sorts. UFOs fly around blasting at him as he tries to take down a number of mounted guns.\nAfter spending a few minutes pinging the massive guns with his own weapon, Will flips over, flying straight at a UFO. A quick button push and he's standing on the floating disk, trying to pull up some of the protective metal armor. This skyjacking amounts to quick mini-game of avoiding gun fire while trying to disable the ship.\nWhen he succeeds, a robot of sorts stands up and Will boots it from the craft, taking control of the UFO. The developers point out, rather enigmatically, that the game has no robots, only vehicles.\nUsing the ships heavier guns and explosive fire, Will makes short work of the guns.\nAfter spending the entire opening sequence in flying combat it is a little bewildering to see Will flying straight for a platform filled with barricades and enemies. As he approaches the developer cuts his jet pack and Will lands on his feet, quickly running to cover.\nThe game seems to shift to a straight-up, though admirably solid shooter. Will ducks in and out of cover as he takes down his enemies.\nAfter working his way inside the building, mostly through classic shooter strategy, Will is faced with an interesting new dilemma: He needs to work his way straight up through a tunnel of slowly turning platforms. One option is to aim carefully, hit the gas on your jet pack and hope for the best. This often results in a flattened body. Another approach is to use vertical cover.\nTo use vertical cover, the developer has Will look up and then presses the cover button when one of those platforms rotate to directly above him. Will hops into the air and grabs the platform, clinging to its underside as the view suddenly shifts making it appear you are looking down a hallway, rather than up a tunnel.\nWill can then scramble back and forth on this shelf of metal, ducking behind it as he fires, or he can climb on top of it resetting the view until he jumps up to the next shelf. It's disorienting, but it appears to work.\nAfter the demo, the developers said that currently their plans are for the game to be single player only but that if \"people clamber at the gates for multiplayer jetpack goodness\" they will look into it.\nDark Void hasn't yet been dated, but is in development for the PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360."}

Archbishop Pietro Sambi accused Israel of dragging its heels over implementing the terms of the 1993 treaty that established diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Jewish state. However, the Vatican quickly distanced itself from the comments, saying they were the archbishop's personal views, not church policy. While the archbishop's comments are not likely to harm Catholic-Israeli relations in the long term - an official with the Chief Rabbinate's office told The Jerusalem Post relations have never been better - they underscore the tension within the Catholic Church over its Israel policy. Pope Benedict XVI is an avowed advocate of closer political relations with Israel and theological dialogue with Judaism. However, his views are not held by all within the Roman Catholic Church's hierarchy. In an interview published on the Italian Catholic Web site Terrasanta.net on November 16, Sambi, who served as the Church's nuncio (ambassador) to Israel from 1998 to 2005, said Catholic relations with Israel were at a low ebb, and had even been \"better when there were not diplomatic relations.\" The Vatican had established relations with Israel as an \"act of faith,\" with the belief that the \"concrete aspects\" of the concordat would be settled over time, he said. However, he said, this trust in Israel had been misguided. Ten years after Israel and the Vatican signed a treaty dealing with resolving disputes over taxation of church property, restitution for \"unjustly seized\" land, and \"equal compensation\" for work performed by Catholic social service agencies, the Israeli government had done nothing to implement the reforms, Sambi said. \"Since the Fundamental and Legal Personality Agreements [of 1997] have been signed, they are internationally valid. But not in Israel, because Israeli law requires that any international agreement be approved by the Knesset for it to come into force on Israeli territory. And so far, no one has bothered to get the Knesset's approval,\" he said. \"After 10 years of negotiations, the economic agreement has not yet been signed, undercut by delays and the Israeli delegation's limited power to negotiate, weakened, that is, by a lack of political will. Everyone can see how much faith can be placed in Israel's promises!\" The Vatican moved quickly to minimize the diplomatic damage caused by Sambi's gaffe after Oded Ben-Hur, Israel's ambassador to the Vatican, asked for an explanation on Friday. Vatican Press Office director Fr.

I was aware of the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteer program from my experiences with the Illinois court system.\nOne concern centered on the fact that I had no direct experience with children except for four spoiled nieces over 25 years of shopping trips, babysitting, vacation taking and general drama. I was not sure this would have me prepared me for child advocacy and some of the hard truths involved!\nI discovered the N.C. Guardian Ad Litem program for Henderson, Transylvania and Polk counties. I scheduled a prospecting interview to determine the how and when I could become a volunteer and if they would be interested in me.\nAfter an interview with one of the program supervisors, I completed an online criminal background check and an application. So far, so good.\nAfter passing the background check, my classes would begin on a Monday and continue for five Monday afternoons from 1 to 4 as we went through the various training exercises. There was homework that required some facility with online applications and word processing programs, nothing too strenuous, requiring only reasonable computer skills.\nThere were interesting classroom exercises that helped me to connect with my fellow volunteers and learn the how and why they were volunteering. All are interesting people with varied backgrounds (ranging from nurses to real estate tycoons to deputy sheriffs to metalworkers) who wanted to contribute to an effort that would benefit the world in general and children in particular.\nEveryone brought a different viewpoint to the table, and it resulted in some spirited exercises. So far, so good.\nNext up, my first case! My first client was a tiny charmer living with nice relatives, a mom who was really putting in the work to regain custody, and a Department of Social Services worker who knew the system and helped the mom get the right kind of services to regain her child.\nIn 14 months, Mom turned her life around, and they are together today. So far, and really good!\nMy second case was a tough one with a family who did not want to be there and were deeply resentful that their situation even came to light. This was an uphill battle for the case worker and for me.\nI am sorry to say that I resigned from the case because I believed I could not be effective. So far, not so good.\nThe takeaway here for a potential Guardian Ad Litem worker is that it is OK to say, \u201cI don\u2019t think I am making a difference here and I think another worker might be beneficial.\u201d The supervisors are good listeners.\nWe prepare reports on our cases, and consult with the DSS workers and our Guardian Ad Litem supervisor. Reports are submitted to the courts on a regular basis, and we then appear when our cases are up for review.\nAttendance is necessary and always on a Thursday. It was very different from federal and state court activity. So far, so good.\nOver this period of 13 months, I have learned that Guardian Ad Litem is a place where I was meant to be, doing what I was meant to do. With the help of the supervisors and my fellow advocates, I learned to stop worrying and love the program. If you want to do good, then this is the place for you.\nInterested people from any background can get information about the Guardian Ad Litem program by calling the Hendersonville office at 828-694-4215.\nMore information and the application for the program can be found at www.volunteerforgal.org.

{"idx": "37049", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: There\u2019s never really a bad time to visit Spain. When to go depends on what you plan to do there, from skiing the Pyrenees to checking out Gaudi\u2019s architectural art in Barcelona or hitting the beaches of the Costa del Sol. Weather plays a major role, as do tourist crowds that clog major sites and drive up prices. Based on these criteria, the optimal time to visit Spain is April through June or September through October.\nSpain\u2019s diverse landscape and climate means favorable weather can be found in some part of the country year-round. Generally, Spain\u2019s best weather emerges from April through October, although sweltering summers with temperatures exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit around Madrid and inland Andalucia sends residents scrambling for the coasts. The Mediterranean and Northern coasts tend to experience more rain than the rest of the country, especially towards the mountains. Winters are mild along the southern and Mediterranean coasts, while inland cities such as Madrid are known to be bitterly cold from December to February.\nMany of Spain\u2019s 30 million annual visitors make their way to the country in the summer, particularly July and August. During this time, Spain\u2019s popular beach and mountain resort towns are full of visitors, as are major cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Sevilla. This is also the time of year when many of Spain\u2019s shops and restaurants close down for vacation, further limiting visitors\u2019 choices. Those planning a Spanish vacation for this time should reserve airfare and accommodations well in advance, as transportation and rooms book quickly, especially on the coasts.\nAirfare and accommodation prices throughout Spain soar during peak tourist season as visitors pour in from throughout Europe and beyond. Visitors planning a trip to Spain in July and August should reserve any low-cost airline tickets or budget lodging far in advance, especially for popular resort areas. Those looking to visit Spain while saving as much as possible are advised to head to the peninsula during low season from December through March. In addition to saving up to 50 percent on accommodation rates, travelers will escape the tourist swarms that blanket Spain\u2019s most popular spots in summer.\nSpain\u2019s main festival season takes place from February through August, though Christmas, New Year's Eve and San Sebastian\u2019s mid-January Festivadad also draw crowds of revelers. In the week leading up to Easter, Semana Santa takes over Spain with an endless array of parades and street concerts; the biggest of these celebrations is in Seville. Spain\u2019s infamous summer celebrations include Pamplona\u2019s Running of the Bulls in July and La Tomatina, a massive, soggy tomato battle in the Valencian town of Bunol at the end of August.\nSpain\u2019s nearly 2,500 miles of coastline entice tourists to enjoy sunbathing, swimming and surfing, among other beach activities. May through June or September are ideal for water sports, as weather on the Mediterranean and southern coasts is still pleasant and crowds are thinner. March through September is usually an excellent time for camping, mountain biking or hiking along the trails found in the Pyrenees, Cantabrian Mountains or Sierra de Grazalema National Park. Skiers and snowboarders can hit the slopes in these mountainous regions around November, after the first snowstorm of the year."}

Noah Reidy led the way with four goals, including three straight in the second period.\n\"We enjoyed it, it's always fun playing your arch rival,\" St. Xavier coach Nate Sprong said. \"Playing in a stadium like this makes it even more special.\"\nThe game came together as Moeller Athletic Director Mike Asbeck was exploring more opportunities for the Crusaders. Last fall, Moeller had played football at Nippert Stadium with Elder and another one is scheduled this fall with St. Xavier. UC AD Mike Bohn has been extremely cooperative in allowing Moeller use of their NCAA Division I facilities.\n\"We figured out how to get the lines down, we coordinated it with the football practice,\" Asbeck said. \"We painted the lacrosse lines. This paint's easy they wash it right off.\"\nWith UC football nor FC Cincinnati on the field, the door was open for the Crusaders and Bombers to set up the nets and allow the players to experience a college setting.\n\"Mike Bohn has been great,\" Asbeck said. \"He wants to get us to play basketball here.

Here's what we, and our Maesters, uncovered.\nFirst, Theon got a pep talk from Jon that explained he was definitely both a Greyjoy and a Stark (and, as Game of Thrones is the story of the Starks, that's significant). Then he won a brutal scrap which allowed him to lead the Ironborn in a mission to rescue his sister Yara.\nBut what does this mean for Theon? Well, we're going to focus more on his Stark heritage, because we think the Yara rescue mission is a bit of a misdirect.\nSure, he'll go off and get his sister back, but we expect Theon to be back in Winterfell for GoT's final episode. The story will end where it began, with all the surviving Starks coming together. And, yes, that includes Theon.\nWe'd also bet several Gold Dragons that he'll make a heroic self-sacrifice in the season-eight finale \u2013 as moving from braggart to coward to honourable hero makes the most sense for this character's journey.\nYes, we've complained about how crap Bran was in season seven, but that doesn't mean he won't be an important part of season eight. Mostly because he sort of has to be \u2013 the youngest surviving Stark has clearly been kept in reserve for a big moment and we suspect the writers will hold that back until the very last episode.\nIn the finale, we saw Sam and Bran join forces to uncover important information about Jon's parentage, so expect the same pair to provide an essential weakness in the Night King's armour in the season eight closer. And we know that the Night King is targeting an individual this season \u2013 most likely Bran.\nAfter weeks of lingering looks, Jon and Dany finally got romantic in the season seven closer, which may well make Dany the love of Jon's life \u2013 sorry Ygritte, sorry Ghost.\nIf that's the case, expect him to plunge his sword into her heart to fulfil the Azor Ahai prophecy, which requires a hero to kill his true love in order to save the day. We're pretty sure Jon's the Prince who was Promised, and that's a reveal that'll surely be saved for the finale.\nDany's legacy will be as the saviour of Westeros, not its ruler. It'll be tragic, it'll be tear-jerking, it'll happen.\nThis is a bit of a reach, but bear with us. Season seven ended with the Night King melting one of the biggest symbols of the series \u2013 the wall.\nThe only thing bigger? The Iron Throne. It's the most iconic thing in the show, the ultimate target for several key characters, so wouldn't it be a massive shock if it got destroyed by a zombie dragon?\nThe Night King will make it to King's Landing, and he'll melt the throne.

{"idx": "37065", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: When Will the Food Bubble Burst?\nOur early 21st century civilization is in trouble. We need not go beyond the world food economy to see this. Over the last few decades we have created a food production bubble\u2014one based on environmental trends that cannot be sustained, including overpumping aquifers, overplowing land, and overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide.If we cannot reverse these trends, economic decline is inevitable. No civilization has survived the ongoing destruction of its natural support systems. Nor will ours.\nThe archeological records of earlier civilizations indicate that more often than not it was food shortages that led to their downfall. Food appears to be the weak link for our global civilization as well. And unlike the recent U.S. housing bubble, the food bubble is global.\nThe question is not whether the food bubble will burst but when. While the U.S. housing bubble was created by the overextension of credit, the food bubble is based on the overuse of land and water resources. It is further threatened by the climate stresses deriving from the excessive burning of fossil fuels. When the U.S. housing bubble burst, it sent shockwaves through the world economy, culminating in the worst recession since the Great Depression. When the food bubble bursts, food prices will soar worldwide, threatening economic and political stability everywhere. For those living on the lower rungs of the global economic ladder, survival itself could be at stake.\nThe danger signs are everywhere. In the summer of 2010, record high temperatures scorched Moscow from late June through mid-August. Western Russia was so hot and dry in early August that 300 to 400 new fires were starting every day.\nThe average temperature in Moscow for July was a scarcely believable 14 degrees Fahrenheit above the norm. Watching the heat wave play out over the seven-week period on the TV evening news, with the thousands of fires and smoke everywhere, was like watching a horror film. Over 56,000 people died in the extreme heat. Russia's 140 million people were in shock, traumatized by what was happening to them and their country.\nThe record heat shrank Russia's grain harvest from roughly 100 million tons to 60 million tons. This 40-percent drop and the associated grain export ban helped drive world wheat prices up 60 percent in two months, raising bread prices worldwide.\nCrop ecologists estimate that for each 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature above the norm during the growing season, grain yields decline by roughly 10 percent. In parts of Western Russia, the spring wheat crop was totally destroyed by the crop-withering heat and drought. As the earth's temperature rises, the likelihood of more numerous, more intense heat waves increases.\nHow much time do we have before the food bubble bursts? No one knows. If we stay with business as usual, the time is more likely measured in years than in decades. We are now so close to the edge that politically destabilizing food price rises could come at any time.\nFor example, Brown notes that if the 2010 heat wave centered in Moscow had instead been centered in Chicago, it could easily have reduced the U.S. grain harvest of 400 million tons by 40 percent, or 160 million tons. World carryover stocks of grain for 2011\u2014the amount remaining in the bin when the new harvest begins\u2014would have dropped to an all-time low of 52 days of consumption, well below the 62-day carryover that set the stage for"}

But \u201cThe Wall,\u201d which features Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a U.S. Army soldier pinned down by a preternaturally accurate Iraqi sniper behind a crumbling wall and pro-wrestler-turned-actor John Cena as his injured superior officer, doesn\u2019t sound \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 like there\u2019s much room for innovation, let alone a movie. And yet the debut screenplay of Dwain Worrell \u2014 which won a screenplay competition sponsored by Amazon, before going on to make the 2014 Black List of the year\u2019s most-liked scripts \u2014 is smart, tense, provocative and weird.\nSet in 2007 Iraq, \u201cThe Wall\u201d opens on Taylor-Johnson\u2019s Sgt. Allen Isaac and Cena\u2019s Staff Sgt. Shane Matthews as the two are following up, from a distance, after an attack at an oil-pipeline construction site that has left four workers and two security contractors dead. After this short prologue, in which nothing much happens \u2014 except the establishment of a viscerally real-feeling bond between these two profane, macho, half-cautious, half-cavalier warriors \u2014 the situation dramatically changes for the worse. Matthews, who has gone to get a closer look, is shot and grievously wounded. When Isaac rushes to his aid, he is wounded in the leg before hobbling to safety behind a stone barricade.\nWhen Isaac attempts to radio for help, he finds himself talking not to his base, but to the unseen sniper (voice of Laith Nakli), nicknamed \u201cJuba\u201d after the legendarily lethal gunman reputed to have killed as many as several hundred U.S. troops. And that is pretty much where things stand \u2014 that is, in a tense standoff \u2014 until the climax, which somehow manages to be both bleak and satisfying.\n\u201cRewarding\u201d might be a better word. The movie, which defies conventional thinking about war-movie endings, largely consists of conversation, not conflict (at least not in a military sense), as Juba alternately taunts, attempts to school and acts as a confessor to Isaac, who, as one would expect of these things, tries to use his head to outwit his enemy and survive.\nThe movie, for its part, is also fairly cerebral, raising questions about the purpose of this conflict in particular, but also about war in general. Worrell\u2019s screenplay, through the voice of Juba, interrogates the mechanisms through which terrorists are made and multiply, despite the best efforts of military strategists and attempts at nation building.\n\u201cThe Wall\u201d is a fairly hopeless film. In a sense, the fragile structure of the title acts as a double metaphor: for a barrier between enemies that keeps them from killing each other, as well as one that must come down if true understanding is ever to occur."}

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill in the Lok Sabha on Monday, one day after former Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju alleged that he had informed former Chief Justice of India S H Kapadia and three other ex-CJIs of the corrupt practices of a few High Court judges yet they had all failed to take action.\nIndia is currently the only country in the world where judges appoint judges. The collegium system was implemented in 1993 after a verdict by the Supreme Court. At the time it was hailed as a guarantee against any political attempt to install a pliant judiciary. But the complete exclusion of the executive from the judicial appointment process created a system where a few judges appoint the rest in complete secrecy. This has resulted in alleged favouritism in certain cases, and a general decline in the quality of appointments.\nThe recent controversy over Justice Katju\u2019s allegations on corruption in the top judiciary has shaken the existing system. He had earlier alleged that a \u201ccorrupt\u201d Madras High Court judge was allowed to continue in office due to political pressure from the previous DMK-supported UPA administration.\nFollowing the change in government, the new NDA administration began a process of consultation with eminent jurists to reach a consensus on a constitutional amendment bill to replace the collegium system. The proposed Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) is expected to include the executive in the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts.\nYet the composition of the six-member JAC has divided jurists, with several calling for judicial independence to not be compromised. Justice Katju said the JAC should include the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and one jurist nominated by the President.\nOn Monday, Chief Justice of India RM Lodha responded by defending the collegium system and warned of a \u201ccampaign to defame the judiciary and to tarnish its image in the eye of public.\u201d He claimed that incorrect information was being spread about the functioning and decisions of the collegium."}

They are heads of state, major religious figures, entrepreneurs and outlaws. Comparing the relative power of such a diverse group is slippery business. To do it, we defined power in four dimensions. First, we asked if a person has influence over a lot of people? For heads-of-state we looked at population; for religious figures we measured the size of their flocks; for CEOs we counted their employees; and for media figures we considered the size of their audience.\nThen we determined if they were powerful in multiple spheres, awarding bonus points for those who can project their power many ways. Silvio Berlusconi (No. 14), for instance, got a big boost for not only being the prime minister of Italy, but also a billionaire media mogul and owner of a soccer team, AC Milan.\nFinally, we insisted that they actively wield their power. This eliminated some the richest people in the world, including Ingvar Kamprad, the billionaire founder of Ikea, and the descendants of Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton.\nWe culled an initial suspect list of more than 100 names to 75, and then asked seven Forbes editors to rank them in all four categories.

I must either take him back as he is or move on. Which I have done. I have made it thus far on my own, but I don\u2019t want my daughter to think I never gave her dad a chance. Any advice?\nMonique, you think a second chance means a second chance for him to be better. He thinks it means a second chance for him to be who he is and for you to accept it.\nWhat he did to you was heinous. He is a man you would have no connection with if you had known he was married. Now he is using the evil he did you as a reason to take advantage of you some more. When he leaves again, what good will you have done your daughter?\nYou moved on but you didn\u2019t move on far enough. Keep moving.\nX Games \u2014 I have been in a relationship for two years, my first relationship after my divorce. On our first date she brought a home movie of herself with her ex-husband.\nLater she decided to change jobs and go into the same field as her ex. So I helped her study for her licensing exam. As she was learning the business she would call her ex several times a week for advice. Then she went to work for a company her ex was fired from.\nAt one point she brought her ex-husband in on a sales call out of town.\nThey didn\u2019t ride together to the meeting, but they didn\u2019t sell anything either.\nShe didn\u2019t get home until 1:30 a.m., but she told me about it, so it\u2019s not like she tried to hide anything.\nAs time went on she wasn\u2019t making that much money and decided to look for a different company. Her ex-husband had started his own company and wanted her to go work for him.\nWe talked it over and she said she would be making a lot more money and could do most of her work from home.\nNeedless to say she isn\u2019t making more money and she does all her office work at his office. You have to know this guy to believe him. He came over at Christmas to bring their daughters home and just came in the house, walked around, and talked to everyone except me. No invitation or anything.\nAndy, the best way to deflect blame is to blame the other person. That\u2019s why she says you are controlling and jealous. Whatever caused their divorce, doesn\u2019t matter. She still wants him.\nAnd you still want her. Why?\nBecause human beings are reluctant to accept a loss. That\u2019s why people hold on to bad stocks and bad relationships. Once you see it\u2019s easier to accept a failure than hold on to it, you can let her go.\nSend letters to: DirectAnswers@WayneAndTamara.com, or Direct Answers, PO Box 964, Springfield MO 65801."}

The Optimus G line may not have been the most popular phone of 2012, but it was a quality piece of hardware that deserved respect. The LG Nexus 4 became a popular item over the holiday season, offering the latest software from Google in a sleek form-factor and an incredibly low price.\nIt\u2019s been a little while since we\u2019ve heard anything new from LG, but it looks like while we wait for them to release their new flagship in the Fall we can enjoy the previously international-only Optimus G Pro.\nAT&T\u2019s latest exclusive is a huge 5.5-inch smartphone with a 1080p IPS LCD display. Underneath that glass is a 1.7Ghz Snapdragon with 2GB of RAM and a 2.1MP front facing camera. The 13MP rear camera is similar to the same camera seen in the Optimus G, but with some new features in the camera app. The dual recording feature will capture the front and rear camera at the same time in recorded video, setting the front camera up as a window in the corder of the recording.\nWhat really helps the LG Optimus Pro stand out is the massive 3140mAh battery and the unique notification light. The nearly 1000mAh difference between the Pro and the HTC One is made all the more impressive due to its ability to be removed and replaced like the Galaxy S4. The single button on the front of the display has a special multi-colored light underneath it that pulses for notifications, and is completely programmable using the tools LG baked into Android 4.1.2.\nIn terms of raw performance, the Optimus G Pro is right on par with the HTC One and the Galaxy S4. Their benchmarks exchange a few digits back and forth, but the Pro is every bit as powerful as the flagships being offered by Samsung and HTC. AT&T\u2019s exclusivity on the phone is unfortunate, since LG\u2019s competition is available in many other places.\nIf you pre-order from AT&T, however, you can get a new Quick Cover folio case.

Additionally, HNW individuals often install high-tech security measures \u2013 that can be monitored remotely \u2013 in their luxury homes.\nAs IoT becomes more widespread, the potential for cyberattacks increases significantly. According to cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky, attacks on IoT devices increased threefold in the first half of 2018 alone. This is because the security on most IoT devices is still considered to be relatively weak in the face of ever-evolving cyber risks.\nRansomware attackers now have one more medium to extort money from victims, with attackers taking to disabling a connected device at crucial moments when they cannot be reset or disconnected.

But the new habitats may lack some of those defenses, the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agricultural Organization says. It\u2019s convening a conference in Bangkok this week to help share information and strategies on battling the pest.\nKeeping it in check is an urgent priority: Even though Asia is mostly known for rice growing, maize is an important staple crop and a crucial source of feed for poultry and livestock.\nIn the cornfields in Kanchanaburi, there were armyworms in all stages of the crop, from seedlings to knee-high to \u201celephant\u2019s eye\u201d high.\nOrganic farmers don\u2019t use the usual farm chemicals so they can sell the waste corn stalks as cattle fodder.

For taller plants, that\u2019s about the only way for the small-scale farmers to get pesticides up onto the affected parts of the plant once the worms are established.\nSwaddled against the burning sun, Uraporn Nournart and her team of young scientists scrambled through the fields, peeking into corn husks and pulling apart damaged stalks to collect worms and eggs for monitoring. They\u2019re conducting trials in fields like the one Sanae was working her way through, a tranquil plot of waist-high corn ringed by banana trees.\nCharuwat Taekul, an entomologist at the Department of Agriculture who specializes in microscopic parasitic wasps, was collecting egg clusters to use in his research into natural enemies of the worms. It\u2019s unclear if such wasps would be effective in keeping the fall armyworms under control, but it\u2019s one of various strategies being considered.\nShe notes that the worm\u2019s adult moths can fly more than 60 miles a night, even farther if they\u2019re carried by the wind.\nThe best-case scenario, says Fredrix, would be farmers successfully scouting for and finding the worms early on, so they can keep them under control. The FAO has developed an app that teaches the basics of how to find and deal with fall armyworms."}

The National Institutes of Health is about to put in place a new system for reviewing this kind of work in the future.\nA health official culls chickens on a poultry farm in a village on the outskirts of Katmandu, Nepal. Chickens suspected of being infected with H5N1 bird flu were found in the area in October.\nFlu researchers may be close to ending an unusual moratorium on some controversial scientific work that has lasted almost a year.\nThat's because officials at the National Institutes of Health say they will be moving swiftly to finalize a new process for deciding whether or not to fund proposed experiments that could potentially create more dangerous forms of the bird flu virus H5N1.\nSuch work has been on hold since January, when dozens of flu researchers around the world voluntarily agreed to a pause that was originally supposed to last 60 days. The move came in response to fears that NIH-funded researchers in two labs had created contagious forms of H5N1 bird flu virus that could potentially cause a pandemic in people, if the contagious germs escaped or fell into the wrong hands.\nBut researchers say the moratorium has stopped work that's vital for understanding how flu viruses found in animals can jump into humans and start a dangerous pandemic. They say these studies are needed to help public health officials get ready for that threat.\nThe NIH has just concluded a public meeting to discuss the benefits and risks. Scientists, public health experts, and security specialists from around the world were also asked to weigh in on a proposed set of criteria that the NIH would use in the future to decide what kinds of experiments could be funded.\nThe government is accepting comments on that draft policy until January 10, and officials indicated that a final version could come soon after. \"This isn't something that could be drawn out over a very long period of time,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at a media briefing after the conference.\nHe said federally funded flu researchers have indicated that they plan to quickly submit proposals for experiments so they can be reviewed under the new system. \"As soon as we finalize it, get the comments, and get it solid as an official framework, then we can just very nicely, I hope, take these proposals as they come in,\" Fauci said.\nIn addition to this new NIH review system, federally funded flu researchers also need the government to indicate what laboratory safety measures should be required for these types of experiments. That issue has been under review and a decision is expected soon. \"That's also on an expedited timeline as well,\" says Amy Patterson, director of the office of science policy at the NIH.\nUnder the NIH's proposed new framework, research that might create more dangerous H5N1 bird flu viruses would have meet certain criteria in order to receive funding. For example, the experiments would have to address significant public health questions, and there would have to be no less-risky ways of addressing those questions. But some participants at the meeting say they still don't fully understand how decisions would actually get made.\n\"It's critical who is going to do the vetting on this research. Who decides what can be done and what cannot be done?\" says virologist Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, whose NIH-funded lab did one of the experiments that sparked the most concern.\n\"If you"}

The students turned out to be the victims of the Black Hebrew Israelite hate group who were screaming racist, vile things at the students, and Phillips waded into the middle of what he was sure were racist students in MAGA hats in order to provoke a response.\nHe didn\u2019t really get a response, but the media targeted the students anyway, prompting no end of hatred to come at the kids in the form of calling for their expulsion from school, or just being burned alive while in it. Upon the collapse of the narrative, leftist figures rushed to delete their horrific tweets targeting the kids, while some outlets attempted to double down on the claims that the students were racist by grasping at any straws they could, further embarrassing themselves.\nMeanwhile, it turns out Nathan Phillips\u2019 claims about his identity as a Vietnam vet were completely false, as were his claims that the kids were mocking him and the Black Hebrew Israelites, who he said were just talking among themselves.\nIt also turned out that the day after Phillips made headlines with his confrontation with the Covington kids, he led an attempt to interrupt an ongoing Catholic service with 20 activists at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception during a Saturday evening Mass.\nNeedless to say, Phillips isn\u2019t very tolerant but will excuse hate groups blatantly flinging racist things at kids, and help generate an outraged mob that will promote to do far worse. He referred to the Covington kids as a \u201clynch mob\u201d who attempted to intimidate and mock him. Yet, they clearly weren\u2019t anything like that at all.\nIn fact, a Cincinnati restaurateur named Jeff Ruby offered to fly Phillips first class to \u201cbreak bread and make amends\u201d with the students, which Phillips refused.\nNow Phillips wants to \u201ccreate space for the teaching of tolerance to happen,\u201d days after he smeared children.\n\u201cWe feel that there is a distinct lack of understanding and appreciation of Native peoples and traditions worldwide. It\u2019s time to address the indecency of culturally appropriating our ritual movements and songs for the enjoyment of non-Native peoples,\u201d Phillips said.\nThe absurdity of this is beyond any kind of sense the real world can provide. Wonderland wasn\u2019t this weird.\nThe man who has demonstrated intolerance and deceit has now deemed it time to nobly saunter on down to the school to meet with the kids that he falsely painted as racist villains for the better part of a week so that he can teach them how to be better people.\nIf the school has any sense, it will refuse Mr. Phillips\u2019 gracious offer and allow him to keep his \u201cmorality\u201d to himself."}

Grants.gov will be the first major e-government initiative to adopt the federal E-Authentication model.\nNow, under the federal E-Authentication initiative, the process to certify an individual\u2019s identity will be more efficient, said Terry Nicolosi, deputy program manager for Grants.gov.\nIndividuals will manage their own authentication instead of Grants.gov handling the establishing of credentials.\nThe governmentwide grants management site has been preparing since early this year to phase in grant-making agencies to use additional providers available through the federal E-Authentication initiative.\n\u201cThis will affect agency users, but not agency systems, and only enhances the functionality of the Grants.gov site,\u201d Nicolosi said.\nStarting in fiscal 2005, OMB said, all agencies must have at least one application using e-authentication services and one in this year. An OMB official said 13 agencies met the requirement by as of this month, and more are working on it. Overall, nine applications use e-authentication services.\nE-Authentication is considered by many to be the main cog in the e-government machine: It gives users a single log-on password and can help Web sites conduct transactions. It eliminates the need for each program to develop a new or duplicative application for identity verification and electronic signatures.\nAfter agencies have started using the approved credential providers, Grants.gov will prepare end users, or grantees, to choose from among credential providers in August 2007.\nUntil now, Grants.gov has used a single e-authentication provider, Operational Research Consultants Inc. of Fairfax, Va.\nGrants.gov allows agencies to electronically post and manage grant applications from its site, and those seeking grants to apply through the portal. OMB has given agencies the goal this year of posting 75 percent of their grant application packages on Grants.gov, Nicolosi said.\nGrants.gov agency users will have the choice of two federally approved credential providers\u2014the Agriculture Department and the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Employee Express\u2014in addition to ORC, Nicolosi said. ORC was the first commercial provider under E-Authentication for Level 1 and Level 2 Security Assertion Markup Language 1.0 credentials.\nGrants.gov last year pledged to phase in E-Authentication over two years in an agreement with the E-Authentication Project Management Office and the Office of Management and Budget.\nIn the first phase, Grants.gov is reconfiguring its Grantors system so agency users can select from the list of credential providers. It is testing and simulating the expansion of credentialing choices with agencies to smooth the transition.\n\u201cThe result is a look and feel of the log-in process that remains largely unchanged,\u201d Nicolosi said.\nIn the second phase, Grants.gov will move its applicant users to the E-Authentication system. Users who already hold a Grants.gov user name and password through ORC will not experience much change. New users will be able to choose from the credential providers on the federation list. Testing with a limited number of users will begin in spring 2007.

We'll finish it at approximately never.\"\nGraves called FEMA's effort to redefine flood zones \"futile\" because they do not address environmental factors like the recent increase in river levels from northern runoff and the ever-shrinking coastline that puts communities closer to the Gulf of Mexico.\nGraves also said that focusing on flood insurance rates rather than improving flood protection \"is like changing the tire on a burning car.\"\nThe goal of the new rating system is to keep the NFIP afloat, as it faces about $20 billion in debt.\nThe new rates are expected to go into effect for single-family homes Oct. 1, 2020.\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards' office released a statement on the potential change on Monday, saying more time was needed to review the proposal.\n\"We\u2019re still waiting to see the official plan, but once we have an opportunity to review FEMA\u2019s proposal we\u2019ll have a better understanding of what it entails.

{"idx": "37110", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: On Monday, President Barack Obama issued a set of ultimatums to General Motors and Chrysler that represent the direct intervention of the US government to effect a brutal restructuring of the American auto industry in the interests of Wall Street.\nThe measures demanded by Obama include the elimination of Chrysler as an independent company, either through a merger or outright liquidation, and the downsizing of GM well beyond the already massive scale proposed by GM management, with the agreement of the United Auto Workers union.\nAt the heart of the \"New Path to Viability\" outlined by Obama's Auto Task Force is a far more \"aggressive\" shutting of plants, elimination of models and nameplates, closing of dealerships and destruction of jobs, combined with deeper cuts in wages, benefits and work rules and the ditching of the auto companies' pension and retiree health care obligations.\nObama announced that his Auto Industry Task Force had rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler, required under the terms of the $17.4 billion in emergency loans granted by the Treasury last December under the Bush administration's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). He also announced that his administration had forced the resignation of General Motors Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner and would oversee the departure of the majority of GM's board of directors.\nHe gave Chrysler 30 days to finalize a merger with Fiat or another company and allotted GM 60 days to comply with his Task Force demands, and indicated that the best means for carrying them out was a \"supervised bankruptcy\" process under which a bankruptcy court could terminate union contracts.\nUnder TARP, hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money have been handed over to banks and the insurance giant American International Group (AIG), with no strings attached. No Wall Street bankers have been removed from their posts, even though Citigroup and Bank of America have each received $45 billion in TARP funds plus some $300 billion in government guarantees for their bad debts.\nThe double standard between the administration's treatment of Wall Street and the auto industry is blatant. It was already prefigured in the personnel appointed by Obama to his Auto Task Force. The group is headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who was the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank prior to joining the Obama administration. In that position, he played a key role in fashioning the Bush administration's bank bailout policies.\nJust one week prior to Obama's auto announcement, Geithner revealed a scheme to allow the banks to offload their bad debts by using hundreds of billions of taxpayer money to subsidize and insure lucrative profits for hedge funds and private equity firms that agree to buy the banks' \"toxic assets\" at inflated prices.\nGeithner's chief advisors on the Task Force are investment bankers. There are no people connected to the auto industry on the panel.\nAuto workers do not need to read the statements issued Monday by the Task Force to know that their jobs and livelihoods are being destroyed in the name of restoring the auto companies to \"viability.\" However, it is worth reviewing these declarations to get a better sense of the naked class interests that determine the policies of the Obama administration.\nIt is extraordinary that a government should, in its name, publish documents that unabashedly articulate the interests and aims of a financial elite that constitutes a miniscule portion of the population.\nThe overview of the Task Force's findings carries the euphemistically cynical title \"Obama Administration New Path to"}

Look beyond polls.\nKristen Soltis Anderson and Patrick Ruffini are co-founders of the Republican research firm Echelon Insights.\nPlanes rarely crash because one instrument fails or one gauge gives a bad reading. Rather, the right combination of things fail in tandem \u2014 a mechanical problem paired with bad weather, a backup system malfunctioning at the same time as a pilot error \u2014 leading to catastrophe. The disaster of the 2016 election forecasts is not dissimilar, with a series of mistakes building upon one another to lead prognosticators astray. Pollsters now are sifting through the wreckage to find the black boxes and assess what went wrong in order to prevent it from happening again.\nThe good news is that at the same moment polling feels a bit broken, there are new tools available for measuring the mood of the people, the tides of public opinion and the swings of an election. These tools \u2014 including precise demographic models and social-media data \u2014 shouldn\u2019t replace polling. But they could help refine our predictions and our understanding.\nDespite America\u2019s surprise at Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election, not all polls failed in 2016. The national polling average will probably be fairly close to the final popular-vote result once all the remaining ballots in California are counted. And polls in some states, including New Hampshire and Virginia, got the election almost exactly right. But polls were off in enough other states by large enough magnitudes to mislead forecasters about which states were in play and which way the electoral college would go.\nSome analysts have suggested that \u201cshy Trump voters \u201d were afraid to admit their true preference to pollsters, but it is not clear why this would cause Trump to dramatically outperform his poll numbers in some swing states but not others, and it doesn\u2019t explain why Republican Senate candidates often outperformed their polls by similar margins. There is some evidence for the theory that pollsters\u2019 turnout assumptions were off and that the electorate was simply more Republican across the board, with turnout rising the most in heavily Republican counties and dropping the most among a core Democratic constituency: African Americans. Polls can also err because of late movement heading into Election Day, especially in an election with historically high numbers of undecided and third-party voters. A possible clue here lies in the exit polls, which showed late-deciding voters in those decisive Rust Belt states breaking heavily for Trump.\nNate Silver of FiveThirtyEight managed to outperform his peers by assuming that the polls might not be as good as people thought and, as a result, believing there were more possible paths to a Trump victory. But to always assume that the polls might be \u201coff\u201d is not a very satisfying way to address the problem.\nRebuilding trust in polling is key, as polls not only help politicians win elections but also offer a valuable way to tell those in \u201cthe Beltway bubble\u201d what their constituents are thinking.\nIn the worlds of polling and data analytics, there should be a reassessment of how we can accurately determine who is likely to vote. Relying on vote-history data from voter files, rather than often-erroneous self-reports of voting history, is an essential element missing in most media polling. But leaning too heavily on data from previous elections can lead us to miss what\u2019s different about this one. For instance, it wasn\u2019t a given that Hillary Clinton would be able to reenergize the Obama coalition. Meanwhile, conventional likely-voter \u201c"}

The diplomatic cables puts this struggle starkly, especially when dealing with Kandahar Provincial Council Chief (and the president's brother) Ahmed Wali Karzai. \"The meeting with (Karzai) highlights one of our major challenges in Afghanistan: how to fight corruption and connect the people to their government, when the key government officials are themselves corrupt,\" reads one dispatch, labeled Confidential. During the meeting, State Department officials and the council chief discuss how the lack of electricity hampers the government's legitimacy. But the dispatch notes: \"Given Ahmed Wali Karzai's reputation for shady dealings, his recommendations for large, costly infrastructure projects should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.\"\nLikewise, when it comes to fighting the Taliban, Afghan government officials' motives are cast into doubt. Karzai lobbied for more local control over hiring security guards. But the Confidential cable notes that Karzai \"is understood to have a stake in private security contracting\" and is trying \"to exert control over how contracts are awarded in the province.\"\nAs we said in August, the problem is that corruption flies in the face of the counterinsurgency effort that the Obama administration is following, which requires a reliable indigenous partner to which it can hand legitimate control. With the politicians fighting and the rehabilitation of the nation lagging, the military effort could stall or prove futile. With the public release of these diplomatic cables, the situation seems even more dire\u2015and damaging to U.S. efforts."}

I\u2019m a hunter, and I have a rule: a full freezer is more important than a party.\nMy first Thanksgiving hunt ended without meat, and that night I joined two other hunters in a rented room at a motel in Southwest Montana. After a full, fruitless day of hunting, we dried our gear, drank Yukon Jack from the bottle and called our friends at the potlucks we could have attended. I broke out my last package of ground deer meat from the year before, and proceeded to make ham Bourguignon on the camp stove.\nDespite what the name implies, there is no ham in ham Bourguignon (or hamburger, for that matter), but the first ingredient is at least bacon. It\u2019s followed by deer, wine, onion, wine, vegetables, wine and wine. The winey, greasy steam filled the room, perfuming our hunting clothes with \u201chuman\u201d scents. It was getting dangerously close to a party interfering with a full freezer by the time we turned in.\nI spotted a herd of elk at dawn, tracked them all day, and radioed my friends at 3 p.m. with the news I\u2019d shot my first elk. They came with a sled. Twelve hours later, the elk was in my truck. By morning on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, I was home with my meat, a proud graduate of the Loser School of Hunting.\nThe Loser School of Hunting is not a prestigious institution. No hunter begins the season hoping to matriculate, much less miss, the Thanksgiving feast. The foundational academic principle of Loser School is that if you haven\u2019t filled your freezer yet, you don\u2019t just need meat. You need practice. So you get back out there and do that, hoping to sharpen your skills enough to succeed. It could be your shooting that needs attention, or your ability to be quiet, stay focused and sense the animals before they sense you. It may depend on your willingness to go where fresh tracks take you, even if that\u2019s away from the truck and toward the grizzlies.\nAs hunting season winds down, a loser will cycle through his or her usual hunting buddies until there is nothing left but misfits like us. We find buddies of buddies who still haven\u2019t succeeded, and make plans to bed down with these strangers in tents, motel rooms or cold, mouse-infested cabins. We may still hunt alone, but it\u2019s good to know that somebody knows generally where you are. Sometimes, when the conditions are right on the ridge lines, it can feel like outer space. Once in a while a text floats up with a delicately posed question about how it\u2019s going.\nBehind these well-intended messages, I visualize the sender, having already filled his freezer and now chilling in his sweatpants by the fire, drinking tea and planning his Thanksgiving side dishes. And I\u2019m gonna be listening to some other hairy dude snoring.\nBut those strangers, hairy or not, dudes or dudettes, can be treasure troves of knowledge. They have different ways of doing all the things that a hunter must do, like keeping the falling snow off of a scope, keeping your precious water in liquid form, and, of course, cooking burger meat.\nEvery hunter has their ways of cooking burger.

And oral health indicators are not where they ought to be.\nAccording to the National Oral Health Survey (NOHS) 2015, the prevalence of tooth decay is at 34.3 percent among adults and 46.3 percent for children, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) cites tooth decay and cavities as the most widespread chronic disease.\nA pertinent concern among dentists is that most Kenyans only visit them when the pain and discomfort becomes unbearable.\nThis poor oral health seeking behaviour not only increases the complexity and cost of treatment, but also leads to a disproportionate focus on curative measures at the expense of preventive ones, hence the huge gap in preventive care with many people, for example, not knowing how to use a toothbrush properly despite brushing their teeth daily.\nOther underlying factors contributing to the high oral health disease burden include insufficient government funding and inadequate baseline data to guide planning and implementation of services.\nWhile formulating an effective policy framework to address these issues, stakeholders need to urgently increase public awareness about oral health.\nAmong the many misconceptions about oral health is that a huge section of the general public does not view it as an integral part of general health and well-being despite the fact that oral diseases can affect the ability to breathe, eat, swallow, speak or even smile.\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s World Oral Health Day provided an opportunity for stakeholders to raise awareness about the importance of oral health, a more strategic and sustainable approach for engaging the public is needed.\nA programme by Kenya Dental Association (KDA) and partners to increase awareness about oral health by providing free screening and treatment to schoolchildren, inaugurated last year, has reached more than 10,000 children in Nairobi, Murang\u2019a and Nakuru counties.\nPhase two, which kicked off recently in Kajiado County, will reach 10,000 more schoolchildren across Kajiado, Machakos and Meru this year.\nThe key highlight of this corporate social investment isn\u2019t free screening and treatment, but creation of 20,000 young oral health ambassadors who will grow up championing this important issue. This will have a more sustainable impact on awareness about oral health.\nA major challenge worth mentioning is shortage of dentists. Kenya has one dentist for every 42,000 patients \u2014 meaning they treat six times more patients than the WHO-recommended 1:7,000 ratio.\nSmart tactics, such as working with community health workers, are needed to improve access to preventive and general care, especially in rural settings where the shortage of dentists is particularly acute."}

So he put himself on a miserly spending plan.\nA financial planner disagreed, however, and assured Anderson that his pension and savings would be plenty for a lifetime. In fact, the planner told Anderson to give himself a break and have some fun.\nIn response, Anderson, 67, and his wife Pam, 65, took three driving vacations last year from their suburban St. Paul, Minnesota home. Anderson also treated himself to a new \u2013 but used \u2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.\nMost retirement research points to an impending retirement crisis for about half of Americans who save too little. But a new study suggests that behaviour like Anderson\u2019s makes the outlook far less dire. Because people worry about outlasting their savings, most adjust by living humbly \u2013 often overly so. Consequently, they make even modest savings last for years longer than expected by researchers.\nWhile some people do run out of money, a person with less than $500,000 in savings, on average, spends just about a quarter of it during the first 20 years of retirement, according to a study by Sudipto Banerjee of the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\nOne-third actually end up with a nest egg larger than they had when they left their jobs, the study says. Even people who had only $32,000 shortly after leaving the work force had about $24,000 left some two decades after retiring.\nRational behaviour defies the assumption in many studies that people exhaust their savings and live in crisis, Banerjee said. He used government data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to track retirees born between 1931 and 1941 with assets ranging from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate and CDs to savings and checking accounts. Individual homes were excluded, although people with homes and pensions stretched their savings the furthest.\nThe EBRI study found conservative spending among every income group.\nIn the EBRI study, those with the most savings \u2014 a median of $857,450 shortly after retiring \u2014 still had $756,300 two decades later. The decrease amounts to just 11.8 per cent of the original sum.\nThe largest drop in retirement nest eggs, 24.4 per cent, was among those with the least savings, or a median of $29,975.\nFrugal behaviour is consistent with research led by Anna Rappaport for the Society of Actuaries. She and her team found that most people do not plan for retirement or know what they should spend, but they adapt \u2014 even when shocked by high dental bills or a roof repair.\nWhat can devastate financially are divorce, caring for a mentally or physically ill adult child who cannot work, and long-term care expenses, according to the Society\u2019s research.\nStill, debilitating healthcare costs are far more rare than people fear, according to the EBRI research. Half of retirees face no nursing home expenses since Medicare covers short recoveries after hospital stays and Medicaid can help when resources run out.\nThe medical annual out-of-pocket spending for 90 per cent of retirees is just $2,000, and the big nursing home costs over $87,000 hit only 10 per cent of people living longer than 95, according to the EBRI study."}

She brought her classically trained background in jazz guitar and viola to the early \u201990s Dischord band Autoclave. Shortly thereafter, she replaced founding singer Mary Lou Lord in the Boston band Helium. Timony\u2019s dark, intoxicating songwriting flourished via that project on Matador Records until breaking up in 1998.\nSince then she\u2019s churned out a trio of solo albums (including 2005\u2019s \u201cEx Hex,\u201d from which her new band takes its name) and played in the indie-punk supergroup Wild Flag, with members of Sleater-Kinney, Quasi and the Minders.\nBut in Ex Hex, which headlines the Hi-Dive on Oct. 9, Timony is abandoning her droning chords and alternate tunings for a throat-grabbing directness.\nDebut album \u201cRips\u201d (to be released on Oct. 7 by Merge Records) plays in the tradition of the Ramones, Cheap Trick and Thin Lizzy, bursting with big riffs and concerns of the teenage heart. Timony has said she wants it to invoke the upbeat soundtrack to a cool older sibling\u2019s \u201970s adolescence, all denim and hormones and vinyl-seat sweat.\nOn album-opener and single \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Lose,\u201d Ex Hex\u2019s all-female power trio surfs a wave of reverb into a grinding dance-rock chorus. It\u2019s somewhere between head-bobbing and headbanging, with plenty of implied sunglasses and spilled beer.\nDrummer Laura Harris and bassist Betsy White add muscle to Timony\u2019s guitar work, which takes on a beefier dimension with Timony swapping out her prized Fender Jazzmaster for a Gibson. Searing leads and bent notes are channeled through a mix of favored amplifiers, including Timony\u2019s Orange AD30, Swart and Fender Champ. As in past projects, tone and atmosphere are at the core.\n\u201cI was super into this Stax (Records) documentary I saw that just got me thinking about how these people were approaching pop songwriting,\u201d she said.\nEx Hex was also able to road-test the songs before recording them, lending an additional layer of premeditation to the finished product.

To her neighbors and friends outside of tattooing, Barba is just a friendly grandmother with an infectious laugh who sometimes has her daughter dye her short hair pink; but she happens to also be one of the most famous, respected and important tattooers in the world.\nEven if you unknowingly went into Outer Limits Tattoo, there\u2019s a good chance you still wouldn\u2019t realize that the lady with few visible tattoos and a near-permanent smile is not only the owner but also a Long Beach legend and tattoo industry pioneer.\nActually, you probably know more about tattoos today than Barba did forty years ago when she started in the business.

She still didn\u2019t know much about the art form or the industry, but a little encouragement from her neighbor and her ex\u2019s desire to learn quickly tossed the young artist straight into the art form.\nBarba kept trudging through the misogynistic muck that was the tattoo world of the 1980s and 1990s until, eventually, she opened the door so wide for women that it could never be shut again.\nBut Barba isn\u2019t just considered an accidental trailblazer for her advancements in gender equality among tattooers, she also unintentionally revolutionized the style now known as \u201ccolor realism\u201d long before anyone else was even considering it. Throughout the first half of her career, highly detailed tattoos were thought to only be possible in shades of black and gray, a style popularized in the barrios of East LA in the 1970s by tattooers such as Freddy Negrete and Jack Rudy. But Barba, a lifelong artist, did not understand why it couldn\u2019t be done with bright colors just as well, and she wasn\u2019t about to let others sway her aesthetic decisions.\nAlthough she now realizes that tattooing equipment (such as inks and machines) at the time weren\u2019t capable of leaving color details that would last in the skin over the years, her trial-and-error approach and the same tenacious work ethic she carries with her today brought the now-popular style into the limelight long before most were ready to accept it.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what tattooing would be like today without Barba\u2019s influence, although if you point out how much of an impact she\u2019s had on both a local and worldwide level, she\u2019s more than likely to downplay her overall influence.\nWhile others might get hardened after facing decades of the kind of adversity and bias she\u2019s passed through, Barba still greets just about everyone with a hug and a smile, and she\u2019s merely developed a thick skin over her unshakably tenacious and generally positive attitude.\nBut regardless of whether she sees her handiwork in today\u2019s tattooing, there\u2019s a good chance that Long Beach\u2019s current tattoo scene would look a whole lot"}

So he decided to remake it as \"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop,\" set a couple of centuries back in a small desert town in China. Were it not for some overly slapstick-y humor, it would totally work.\nWang is the cruel and abusive owner of a noodle shop who learns that his wife has bought a gun from a Persian arms dealer. When he finds out that his wife is sleeping with Li, one of his employees, he decides to get the drop on them both. He hires Zhang, the best cop in all the land, to kill them. In the meantime, two other shop employees, Zhao and Chen, are conspiring to liberate from Wang's safe the back wages they are owed.\nWhat follows is an epic game of chess with all the players only able to see a small slice of the board. One after another they try to out think one another, only to end up in a deeper mess. It's a nice little metaphor for the rat race we all find ourselves in.\nUnfortunately, much of the suspense that's been so carefully crafted is regularly hamstrung by the overly broad humor, with folks stumbling, howling, cowering, stammering, quaking -- particularly Xiao Shenyang and Cheng Ye, who play Li and Zhao respectively -- most of it isn't funny and much of it is dumb. But to be fair, the blame for their performances rests squarely with director Zhang Yimou, who was clearly asking for this flavor of acting.\nThere's plenty of room for humor in a good noir, \"Blood Simple\" itself being an excellent example, but packing the corners of a thriller with an episode of \"The Three Stooges\" just isn't going to work.\nThat said, there is some fine acting in \"Noodle Shop.\" Sun Honglei as Zhang is a soulless laser beam with a single-minded focus. Easily the smartest and most determined of the bunch, even he falls victim to the pitfalls of fear and greed. And Ni Yan as Wang's wife is great, running the gamut from rage to sorrow to contempt to terror.\nSetting aside his curious acting choices, director Zhang Yimou has shot a beautiful film, with rich desert landscapes, rolling cloud banks, and beautiful blues, grays and oranges. And there are a couple of sequences that one would gladly watch on a loop, like an early scene when Li, Zhao and Chen prepare a cauldron of noodles for the local police -- it's both stunning and mouthwatering.\nZhang Yimou deserves credit for keeping \"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop\" true to \"Blood Simple\" while making the story very much his own. It's not entirely without its charms, but it falls a bit short of success."}

It presents to us the words of the Gospel of St. Luke but, at the same time, it draws from the great treasury of the Old Testament, in particular from the Second Book of Samuel and the Book of Psalms. There is an intimate bond between the Old and the New Testament, which is illustrated clearly and profoundly by St. Paul in the passage from the letter to the Romans proclaimed a short while ago.\nWho is the one who, in the words of the Psalm, cries out: \"You are my Father\"? It is Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. Before these words were spoken by Jesus of Nazareth, however, the psalmist had spoken them precisely in the context of the covenant which Yahweh made with his people. Therefore, they are words addressed to the God of the covenant.\nSo, you see, it is precisely God, the rock of mankind's salvation to whom Jesus cries out: \"You are my Father\"! He says this using the word which expresses a son's greatest degree of confidence in his father: \"Abba\", my father!\n2. Abba, my Father! This is what Jesus calls his heavenly Father, thus making it possible for us also to address in like manner the One whose eternal, consubstantial Son he is. Jesus authorizes us to use this expression, to pray to the Father in this way. Today's liturgy introduces us in a significant way into the prayer which the Son of God ceaselessly addresses to the heavenly Father.\nAt the same time, from his prayerful invocation which sheds light on the fatherhood of God, in some way emerges a special salvific plan concerning the man called Joseph, to whom the eternal Father entrusted a singular participation in his own fatherhood.\n\"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife in to your home. For it is through the Holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins\" (Mt 1:20-21).\nBy these words the heavenly Father calls Joseph, a descendant of the house of David, to participate in a special way in his eternal fatherhood. The Son of God, Son of Mary, conceived by the Holy Spirit, will live at Joseph's side. He will be entrusted to his loving fatherhood. He will address Joseph, a human being, as a \"father\".\n3. When Jesus was only 12 years old, did not his mother say in the temple of Jerusalem: \"Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety\" (Lk 2:48)?\nMary, speaking of Joseph, uses the expression \"your father\".\nOn that occasion the response the boy Jesus gave to his parents is quite singular: \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?\" (Lk 2:49).\nIn this way Jesus reveals the profound truth of his divine Sonship: the truth concerning the Father who \"so loved the world that he gave his only Son"}

The couple of billion dollars in aid Congress and President Clinton plan to use to fight the drug menace over the next three years may also simply get lost.\nThe heart of the problem is narcotics and the money it spawns. Colombia produces at least 80 percent of the cocaine and two-thirds of the heroin consumed in the US. Despite all efforts, there are more drugs than ever. Ironically, US customers pay the suppliers many times what Washington gives the Colombian government to stop the traffic.\nBut the puzzle embraces far more than drugs. Three-cornered civil war is a constant. Guerrilla factions, rich and heavily armed, fight each other and mysterious right-wing paramilitary death squads, as well as national police and armed forces. The oldest and largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), has been the most successful. Its nearly 20,000 men have fought Bogot to a standstill and carved out a piece of territory in the south the size of Switzerland. It is a \"demilitarized zone,\" an independent area free of any government authority.\nPresident Andres Pastrana has been trying since his 1998 election to bring the guerrillas into the political mainstream through negotiation. FARC, not especially eager, finally agreed - but on its own terms. It has continued attacking the Army and extorting \"taxes\" from communities, travelers, and oil and mining companies. It's selling drug lords protection and cooperation, kidnapping for ransom, and using child soldiers. Nor is it clear what FARC wants of the negotiations. It demands undefined fundamental political, social, and economic change, but not supreme power.\nThese woolly views may reflect the 40 years the guerrillas have spent fighting and out of touch with political reality. So in February, a government-guerrilla delegation toured Europe meeting with officials, aid donors, religious leaders, and journalists. It was a government attempt to build confidence between the groups and to show the guerrillas models of social democracy. The result remains to be seen. Some think it has boosted FARC's morale and status. The government, responding to another wave of kidnappings and sabotage, is ready to give the second-largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) its own independent zone in the north.\nAll this against a background of systemic national crisis. Last year, the economy suffered its worst setback in 100 years. Rural poverty matches the worst of the third world. Unemployment is at 20 percent. Foreign investment, essential for recovery, is at a dead stop. Drug influence contaminates all the institutions of state and has demoralized the justice system. In four years, an estimated 800,000 people, including many highly trained professionals, have left the country. The murder rate is 10 times higher than that of the US, and the rate of kidnapping is the world's highest.\nThe question is why all this should have happened to Colombia, inherently rich, with democracy well established. Unfortunately, violence is well established in Columbia, too. Upon gaining independence in 1819, Colombia had a series of civil wars culminating at the turn of the century in the War of 1,000 Days, which cost 100,000 lives.\nThese upheavals, in which liberals and conservatives fought for power, were marked by widespread acts of brutality"}

Within the industries, metals, construction, sugar and cement account for roughly 45-50% of the turnover.\nGiven the sharp correction in metal prices and moderation in demand, several players have cut down on fresh capex commitments, which is resulting in severe slowdown in new orders.\nWhile the utilities (SEBs) remain the largest customer segment for the transformer makers, Voltamp has traditionally focused on the non-utility segment or the industrial segment.\nMarquee client base includes Reliance Industries, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, DLF, Infosys Technologies ABB, Siemens, Larsen & Toubro, Torrent Power and Suzlon.\nHowever, with the industrial segment showing signs of cyclical downturn, the company has started taking orders from the SEBs as well.\nThe company is spending around Rs350 million for creating greenfield manufacturing facility. On completion in Q4 FY09, the total installed capacity to manufacture transformers will increase to 13000 MVA from the present 9000 MVA.\nThe company is comfortably placed to post a net revenue of around Rs7-7.5 billion in FY09. It has achieved net revenue of Rs3.4 billion in H1FY09. With an order backlog of Rs3.5-4 billion, Voltamp has adequate comfort in achieving the target revenues.\nThe stock is currently trading at inexpensive valuations of 3.8x and 4.9x FY09 and FY10 earnings respectively. At the current price, dividend yield works out to 3.9%, which is attractive.\nDividend payout has been low at 16% in FY08, and we see scope of increase in dividend payout as the company has adequate cash surplus.\nWe are however, reducing our target price for the company by building in stresscase scenario. In our DCF model, we have forecast a 6% CAGR in revenue growth beyond FY10 till perpetuity.\nSimilarly, in the model, we have forecast operating margins to decline from 21% in FY08 to 14% in FY11 and thereafter. We have taken a WACC of 13.6% and reduced terminal growth rate to 3%. Thus we arrive at a price target of Rs472."}

{"idx": "37164", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Just how profitable is it to mine Ethereum? To properly answer this question, let\u2019s start at the beginning: Let\u2019s construct a hypothetical mining rig, plug in some reasonable numbers, and come up with a pragmatic analysis of how much you can earn through Ethereum mining.\nLet\u2019s also hold the price of Ethereum static. By removing any profitability from the appreciation of Ethereum from the equation, we\u2019ll be able to correlate the actual rates of return exclusively with hardware, electricity, and any other costs associated with running a mining rig.\nAs you can see here, our hypothetical mining rig is more efficient and profitable than some of the best mining equipment on the market right now. We are assuming four GPUs that mine 40 MH/s each. The hardware specs are four GPUs, plus a processor, a motherboard, and a power supply rated at 1,000 Watts of electricity. The cost of this rig would be approximately $3,000.\nA reasonable cost of power is approximately 10 cents per kwh. This is below the national average for retail power rates in the U.S. To run a mining rig you will likely pay at least 10 cents per 1,000 watts run for each hour. This means one full day of mining comes with an electricity cost of $2.40. We will also use the block reward and block difficulty from January of 2018 as our base point. And we assume mining with a single rig is only reasonable when working with a mining pool. Some mining pools take up to 10 percent of your earnings, but some of the best only take 1 percent. For that reason, we\u2019ve pick a modest 1.5 percent.\nBased on this fit, we found the following values to describe a predictive line for future values of the difficulty function.\nUsing the growth of block difficulty, we can calculate that over a period of one year, the difficulty factor will grow from 2,280,210,891,539,710 to 11,880,071,363,893,300. We do this by using the fit of the difficulty function and assuming this fit will be true for future values.\nThe block difficulty shares an inverse relationship with the profitability of your Ethereum mining rig. This means that every day, as the difficulty gets higher, your rig\u2019s profitability is reduced.\nEventually, your rig will make less money per day than the cost of electricity to keep it running. At this point, you would have to turn off your miner, because keeping it on will lose you money.\nUsing CoinWarz\u2019s mining profitability calculator, we can plug in a growing block difficulty to see that the profit per day goes from $18.24 to $1.60 in just one year. The calculator uses the following inputs: hash rate (MH/s), power (Watts), power cost ($/kWh), difficulty, block reward, pool fees, ETH/BTC value, BTC/USD value, and hardware costs. For our predictive profit function, we plugged a point into the calculator once every month and assumed a linear fit in between each point.\nAccording to this calculator, if you started mining in January 2018, a year and a half in (day 476) you would start losing money since your Ethereum mining rig would cost more to run than it would generate in profit (again, assuming a static price in Ethereum).\nThe total profit you would have acc"}

The state\u2019s prosecutors argued there were stolen credit cards inside the vehicle at the time of the traffic stop but the jury did not convict Hawkins on those charges.\nHawkins was sentenced following the trial to serve three years in prison.\nDuring trial the state\u2019s sole witness was Washington C.H. Police Patrolman Jeffrey Heinz, who testified for more than two hours about the traffic stop he attempted to make on Hawkins.\nHeinz said he was just finishing up a traffic stop on another vehicle at approximately 3 a.m. May 20, 2016, when Hawkins drove past. Heinz said the patrol car\u2019s on-board license plate reader beeped and when the license plate was ran, it revealed the plates were for a different colored vehicle.\nAt this point in the trial, the video from the officer\u2019s car and the audio from the officer\u2019s body mic was played for the jurors.\nThe video showed that Heinz caught up with Hawkins on US 35 near the Tanger Outlet Mall and he activated his overhead emergency lights, the vehicle stopped, and he spoke to Hawkins about the plates and registration discrepancy. Heinz said that Hawkins then gave a social security number belonging to someone else.\nHeinz said that initially he was going to write Hawkins a traffic warning. He walked back to Hawkins a second time to ask him about his social security number. As Heinz was walking back to his car with yet another social security number, Hawkins drove away. Heinz followed.\nHeinz, who had followed Hawkins from US 35 and was now nearing downtown Washington C.H., re-activated his overhead emergency lights again to initiate another traffic stop.\n\u201cI pulled him over and told him there is a warrant for his arrest. He drove off rapidly accelerating. By the time I had gone back to my vehicle, approximately 10 to 15 feet, he was already making a turn,\u201d said Heinz.\nThe video from the patrol car showed the vehicle speed down West Market Street and attempt to turn left on Green Street, but nearly collided with a deputy sheriff who was on the road. Instead of hitting the Fayette County deputy sheriff\u2019s car, Hawkins turned off the vehicle\u2019s lights, drove through several front yards and hit a bush, disabling the vehicle. Hawkins refused to open the vehicle\u2019s door and Heinz said he used his flashlight to break out the vehicle\u2019s passenger side window.\nHawkins then attempted to flee, according to Heinz, but was chased and arrested.\nHowever, Heinz explained, the VIN number of the vehicle matched the VIN number of the vehicle\u2019s registration.\nFollowing the trial, the jurors\u2014five women, seven men\u2014deliberated briefly before coming to the agreement that Hawkins was guilty of failure to comply.\nHawkins declined to stand trial on his own behalf and remained silent throughout the day\u2019s proceedings except to talk with his defense attorney, Thomas Arrington.\nCourt records show Hawkins filed"}

He said that everything was \"looking really good\" and that the rest of actor's deals could possibly be done by the end of the day.\nThe process of getting the deals signed wasn't exactly easy, though. The first obstacle, according to The Hollywood Reporter, was convincing Jeremy Piven to come back and reprise his role as the \"crass and foul-mouthed agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold.\" Piven eventually closed his deal towards the end of August which included him getting a portion of the movie's \"backend,\" according to Deadline. Once the other cast members found this out they reportedly held out in hopes of getting a portion of the \"backend\" as well.\nThe problem with the deal holdouts was that it brought Warner Bros. close to not being eligible for a 20 percent tax credit from the California Film Commission, according to Rolling Stone. Warner Bros said that they would not make the movie without that credit, according to Deadline, because it would help keep the movie's budget under $30 million.\n\"Here's what I'll say about holdouts: Athletes hold out when they have a contract they don't want to honor.

However, a triple-berry filling loads the pie with beneficial vitamins and minerals. The berries produce juice that blends with sugars and creates thick, indulgent syrup, negating the need for fatty toppings, such as whipped cream.\nBasic triple-berry pie uses pastry crust, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, blackberries, strawberries and raspberries. Frozen or fresh berries work in the filling, but fresh berries provide the best consistency. Using artificial sugars interferes with the formation of thick, natural syrup. If the recipe you use calls for artificial sweeteners, the caloric content is much lower than a pie made with real sugars.

About 111 of the calories are from the fat. Of the fat, 3 grams are saturated. On average, adults need 2,000 calories and 44 grams of fat daily. To prevent stroke and cardiovascular disease, MayoClinic.com recommends limiting daily intake to 16 grams of saturated fat. Each slice of pie has no cholesterol, but does contain 250 milligrams of sodium. Limiting your sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams daily is healthy for an average adult; too much sodium causes high blood pressure.\nA slice of triple-berry pie contains 50 grams of carbohydrates. For energy, you need around 225 grams daily. You also consume 3 grams of protein per slice, which is a minimal amount in comparison to the 50 grams daily recommended by MayoClinic.com.

Nevertheless, this decision is noteworthy, because it greatly increases the likelihood of one or both parties being wiped off the map in the coming election. And that would be one of the best things that could happen to the religious Zionist public. Since both parties claim to embody religious Zionism's most cherished aspirations (the National Union, having been abandoned by Avigdor Lieberman's faction, now consists mainly of MKs who broke away from the NRP over the last decade), that might seem counterintuitive. Yet not only have both failed dismally to live up to this claim, but their continued existence has prevented religious Zionists from considering better ways to achieve their political goals. One ordinary citizen succinctly described both parties' biggest problem in an interview with Haaretz last month: \"The house is on fire \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and you guys are fighting over seats!\" In fact, the NRP in particular has for years done nothing but fight over jobs - while neglecting virtually every issue that it was ostensibly elected to promote. Nothing better illustrates this than the party's recent negotiations with the National Union. The latter accepted the NRP's two \"ideological\" demands: that the campaign focus on education, welfare and Jewish identity as well as settlements, and that the joint list not rule out joining any coalition in advance. That achieved, a party that cared about its stated goals should have been satisfied. Instead, NRP Chairman Zevulun Orlev abandoned the talks for the pettiest possible reason: the National Union's unwillingness to name him campaign chairman. But while such pettiness may be merely laughable in minor issues, it is devastating at the national level - as became evident after the May 1996 elections, when Israel faced several urgent tasks. These included coping with a deadly suicide bombing campaign by Hamas; reevaluating the Oslo process in light of the Palestinian Authority's manifest failure to fight terror; and dealing with the financial crisis caused by the previous Labor government's borrow-and-spend policies (the balance-of-payments deficit had become so staggering that even Labor MKs admitted retrenchment was necessary). WITH ALL that on the government's plate, one would have expected coalition members to buckle down and get to work. Instead, the NRP (the National Union did not yet exist) completely paralyzed the government for over two months while it fought with Shas for control of the Religious Affairs Ministry. Compared to the all-important issue of securing the ministry's patronage jobs for its hacks, nothing else mattered a whit. But perhaps nothing better illustrates the hypocrisy of both parties' claim to care about national issues then their behavior in positions of power at the Education Ministry: For years, they shortchanged funding for Jewish education in secular schools in order to funnel more money to Orthodox schools. A party that truly cared about the state's Jewish identity would have done exactly the opposite, since for secular children, school may well provide their only exposure to Judaism. That is presumably not the case for religious children. Yet even if the NRP (or the National Union) should miraculously reform, their demise would still be beneficial - because small splinter parties have long since ceased to be the best way for religious Zionists to influence the national agenda. They would be far more effective acting within a"}

During that time, the NYPD issued 1,839,414 \u201cquality-of-life\u201d summonses for offenses like public urination, disorderly conduct, drinking alcohol in public and possessing small amounts of marijuana.\nDuring that time, \u201cfelony crime, with a few exceptions, declined along with quality-of-life enforcement,\" the report stated. Why? It\u2019s not clear. \u201cWhatever has contributed to the observed drop in felony crime remains an open question worthy of further analysis,\u201d according to the report.\nA spokesperson for DOI said the study looked only at arrests and summonses in relation to felony crime, and stressed that DOI was not directly challenging the broader strategy of \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing, in which officers use community building techniques, verbal warnings and other strategies to deter crime and maintain public order. \u201cBroken windows\u201d policing is a cornerstone of NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton\u2019s strategy.\nThe DOI report runs counter to an earlier NYPD analysis. In 2015, an NYPD report about \"broken windows\" policing said low-level summonses and misdemeanor arrests happen in locations where residents call for help, via 911 or 311. \"The historic increase in misdemeanor arrests paralleled a decrease in major crime and felony arrests,\" the NYPD report stated.\nPolitically, the concept of \"broken windows\" has been tricky for de Blasio. In the 2013 mayoral race, he purposely positioned himself as a critic of the police and called for a scaling back of stop-and-frisk and enforcement tactics. But once elected, he installed Bratton as NYPD commissioner. Bratton repeatedly said he would not deviate from the concept of maintaining public order in order to assure public safety.\nWhile de Blasio has said he believes in the \u201c core notions\u201d of \"broken windows\" policing, he has also said it is an \u201cevolving\u201d concept in which some elements can be reduced \u2014 fewer arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana \u2014 while other elements can"}

He also indicated Tbilisi\u2019s desire to import Iranian natural gas through a pipeline currently constructed in southeastern Armenia.\nOfficials said his meetings with President Robert Kocharian, Prime Minister Andranik Markarian and Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian touched on a wide range of issues of mutual concern, including bilateral economic ties, unresolved conflicts in the South Caucasus and ways of spurring regional integration. No concrete agreements were announced after the talks.\nThe two U.S.-backed pipelines have made Georgia a key regional transit hub. That status would only be solidified in case of the planned construction of a new railway that would link the capital Tbilisi to the Turkish city of Kars.\nThe project, estimated to cost at least $300 million, has provoked strong objections from Armenia which fears that it would add to its regional isolation. The Armenian government says Georgia as well as Azerbaijan should instead use the existing Gyumri-Kars railway which Turkey has kept closed as part of its 12-year blockade of Armenia.\nArmenian leaders conveyed their concerns to Bezhuashvili. Oskanian told reporters that Armenia is even ready to avoid shipping any cargo through the Gyumri-Kars rail link and put it at the disposal of Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan only. \u201cThe international community, Georgia, Turkey and Azerbaijan know that Armenia is ready to let that railway function without its participation,\u201d he said.\nBezhuashvili, for its part, reiterated Tbilisi\u2019s assurances that the Tbilisi-Kars project is not aimed at isolating Armenia and is only meant to bring Georgia extra economic benefits.\nThe two sides also discussed the future of another railway that connected Armenia and Georgia to Russia until the 1993 war in Abkhazia.

Michael Belfiore, author of the new book The Department of Mad Scientists, talks about the bizarre projects happening behind the scenes at DARPA -- the secretive research arm of the Department of Defense.\nWhat happens when scientific research borders on science fiction? Michael Belfiore, author of the new book The Department of Mad Scientists, talks about the bizarre projects happening behind the scenes at DARPA -- the secretive research arm of the Department of Defense. More information.\nIf, by some strange coincidence, you happen to be reading this sentence on the Internet, you can thank a small, somewhat secretive division of the Pentagon called DARPA. For 50 years, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has helped create innovations in technology that match the wildest dreams of science's top minds.\nAs it goes with such advanced research divisions of the government, it was also off limits to reporters until Michael Belfiore managed to get behind DARPA's doors. Belfiore has a new book called The Department of Mad Scientists.\nBelfiore tells Guy Raz that DARPA was launched in 1958, in the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik. He says the Eisenhower administration originally wanted to create a large bureaucratic institution \u2014 something like what NASA eventually became \u2014 but wanted something they could put into effect much faster.\n\"The idea was to get a bunch of people in a room and get them cooking up ideas for defeating the Soviets in space,\" Belfiore says.\nWhen NASA took over the space race, ARPA \u2014 the \"D\" wasn't added until 1972 \u2014 turned its focus to areas like information technology. ARPA invented the precursor to the Internet and worked on speech recognition techonology, GPS, and lasers.\nAt least, they worked on the concepts. \"They don't have any of their own laboratories. They just have people coming up with the ideas,\" Belfiore says. \"Then they go out into the field and they find people at universities, at private companies who can actually put those ideas together.\"\nIn 2007, Belfiore witnessed the fruits of DARPA's outsourced inventive streak, a race between cars that drove through city streets, stopping at street signs, signaling turns, and staying within the speed limit, all without human drivers behind the wheel.\n\"The idea is that they wanted to develop cars that could drive themselves through war zones so we don't have human drivers at risk,\" Belfiore says.\nCompetitors included MIT and Cornell as well as General Motors and Volkswagen. DARPA's arrangement with those auto companies means that some of the technology they developed might have already made its way into your driveway.\nThe institutions they hire \"have the right to develop these things on their own and market them to the public,\" Belfiore says.\n\"You can have a car that can sense an impending collision and warn a driver of it. Or perhaps even actually automatically swerve your vehicle away from a potential accident,\" Belfiore says.\nAs befits a shadowy government agency, not everything DARPA invents is quite so cuddly. In fact, Belfiore says he's sure that some of the work they do is \"quite nasty.\" He can't be certain, he says, because \"about 50 percent, I'm told, of what DARPA is doing is off limits to any outsider.\"\nBut Belfiore got just a glimpse of some of the potentially \"nasty\" technology while he was inside D"}

There's no guarantee you'll ever get back to this point, which is what is humbling for me to go four years ago. The odds of getting back are slim if you stay at the same school or go to another team and to take two different teams means I'm truly blessed.\"\nNo. 5 West Texas A&M (32-2) will look for its first NCAA Division II women's basketball championship at 6 p.m. today as the Lady Buffs play No. 1 Bentley (Mass.) (34-0) at Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pa.\nKellogg, a Dallas native who earned a graduate degree from WT, spent seven seasons at Fort Lewis and made an appearance in the 2010 championship. Fort Lewis lost to powerhouse Emporia State in the championship game, 65-53, but the experience he gained was valuable to guide the Lady Buffs this week.\n\"The first time I went was with Fort Lewis and it was different because we went through a process of building a team,\" Kellogg said.\n\"We went to the first round and lost, then to the Sweet 16 and eventually to the national championship in my fifth year there. That experience has made this week a little easier and I'm more comfortable with everything beyond basketball. I knew there would be a press conference today and the trophy would be here on the table. That's the kind of stuff you don't know about until you go through this whole process. The challenges are still there and the quality competition is still there.\"\nPlaying in tonight's game is also a special experience for senior guard Casey Land, who is fifth all-time in WT history with 373 career assists. Her mother, Angela Seay Land, is the record holder in WT history with 694 assists. Angela Land played in the 1988 Division II championship as WT fell to Hampton, 65-48.\n\"It's absolutely special and has been awesome to go through this with her,\" Casey Land said. \"She's been very encouraging and told me about her experiences. Unfortunately they lost but yeah, it's special for her to be here and kind of live it again with me.\"\nCasey Land and the rest of the Lady Buffs guards could play a crucial role in tonight's game as Bentley comes in with an experienced lineup full of speedy, smart guards. WT could find an advantage in the paint with junior forward Chontiquah White and senior forward Devin Griffin from Coronado. The two have dominated throughout the tournament and create matchup problems for the Falcons.\n\"We want to play well for our seniors and they've been great on and off the court,\" White said."}

Listen to Jones' amused but rapid delivery as he spins witty anecdotes and observations, pausing appreciatively whenever small groups of kids race by, just out of class, many modeling the costumes they officially would wear on Halloween.\nJones is discussing the myriad ideal qualities required of someone who conducts a boat tour \u2014 as per his assignment Sunday aboard a ferry trip to and from Block Island. The occasion is the 34th New London Maritime Society Annual Meeting & Cruise, and Jones will regale his audience with stories of Long Island Sound as they apply to our section of the world.\nA renowned historian, author, boat-builder, railroad worker, filmmaker, publisher of Flat Hammock Press, lighthouse keeper and raconteur, Jones, in his mid-80s, retired last spring after years as a professor of writing, English literature and coastal and maritime studies at UConn Avery Point. With this resume and charismatic presence, Jones has for decades been in demand for tours and lectures about Noank Island, the Sound and the Niantic, Thames, Mystic and Connecticut rivers.\nOn Sunday's cruise, Jones' remarks will touch on, among other topics: his friend Ellery Thompson, the renowned dragger-boat captain, writer, painter and trumpeter; Lawrence Malloy, the youngest of a six-generation Mystic boat- and shipbuilding family; Bill McCoy, whose fascination with and expertise aboard sailing ships led to a legendary career as a rum-runner in the 1920s; and Sir Thomas Hardy, the British admiral defeated in Stonington during the War of 1812.\nWith all of Jones' experience, then, it seems reasonable, in advance of Sunday's cruise, to ask how he distills all this source material into a distinct presentation for maritime enthusiasts.\n\"You know, my father (Edward Jones) did similar tours as well, and he taught me two things,\" says Jones, dressed in a straw hat, black blazer and blue denim shirt. \"One was that he would never think of doing this sort of thing inland. There's a different rhythm on a boat and a different quality of light being on the water, and the sea as a venue itself transforms the experience in ways you could never achieve on land. Oh, and, also, stay focused.\"\nIn one-on-one conversation, though, focus can be a challenge. Jones' conviviality, knowledge and history are such that he seems a sort of biologically alchemical blend of Falstaff, George Lyman Kittredge and G.W. Blunt. The listener can't help but interrupt with follow-up questions \u2014 thereby twirling the conversation in all sorts of directions.\nHe speaks fondly of Shakespeare, for example, acknowledging that an ability to regale groups of folks can be decidedly heightened if one has spent quality time speaking aloud the Bard's work. It's something Jones gravitated to as a child when his father would recite Shakespeare around the house. Later, various English teachers would quote Shakespeare in a machine gun monotone, significantly lessening the power of the words.\n\"I spent a lot of time reciting Shakespeare or reading him aloud,\" Jones remembers. \"Let's face it, you can get bored with Shakespeare if you're not interpreting the words.

Conscience surviving after death. Artificial intelligence. These complex and intriguing topics promise, and fail, to come together in the plot of \u201cTranscendence.\u201d Although the movie tries to open our eyes to the implications of advancing science, its evocative voice becomes muffled under the many limiting layers of Hollywood cinema.\nThe film follows the journey of Will (Johnny Depp), his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and their friend Max (Paul Bettany) as the three scientists test the boundaries of digital consciousness. Their controversial research sparks the emergence of a radical group known as R.I.F.T. that attempts to assassinate Will along with anyone involved in the project. Ironically, the only way to save the poisoned, dying scientist is to upload his conscience into a computer, thus creating true artificial intelligence. The remainder of the movie explores a series of problems resulting from this experiment. Morality, ignorance, love, loyalty and power become central themes as each character explores the repercussions of this new sentient being\u2019s existence.\nThe plot\u2019s potential to mix sci-fi and real human emotion is buried beneath stereotypical Hollywood characters and actors. There are the scientists trying to do good, a power-hungry artificial intelligence, shady government and terrorist figures and a group of small-town folk that are brainwashed through no fault of their own. To add to this mess is Johnny Depp, known best for his humorous roles as eccentric characters like Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka. Cast as the typical glasses-wearing serious smartypants scientist, he falls short of anything spectacular. Rather than promoting his acting skills, the movie seeks only to attract attention through this big celebrity name. This typical Hollywood stunt is coupled with the sporadically appearing scientist Joseph, played by none other than Morgan Freeman. While we all may rejoice at his name at first, his flat, underdeveloped character offers little to the film.\nIt seems like there\u2019s a constant tug-of-war between experimental originality and hackneyed Hollywood moments. The movie is Wally Pfister\u2019s directional debut, and he falls right into the trap of a big budget and interpretive freedom. Pfister is a renowned cinematographer who has worked with Nolan to produce the \u201cDark Knight\u201d trilogy as well as \u201cInception.\u201d While the cinematography is indeed praiseworthy, little else can be saved. Embedded into the emotional, fresh imagery are predictable scenes of money badly spent. Explosions, failed government ops and of course the occasional mushy love scene slow the pace of the movie down to an almost unbearable rate.\nSo what in this movie can be dug up from the layers of Hollywood sludge? The answer is cinematography and computer graphic effects. While the predictable plot is indeed questionable, there\u2019s no doubt that the movie fulfills at least some of its objective. It gives close-ups of single water droplets and zooms out to an immense field of solar panels. It tracks the detailed regeneration of plants and human parts and then pans out to a digital fast-paced computer screen. Moments of grandeur are glimpsed and captured in these images, evoking a sense of amazed disbelief that is key to any good sci-fi film.\nWhile \u201cTranscendence\u201d may fall short of becoming the next sci-fi classic, it does have one noteworthy accomplishment.

Another one came on Thursday, with the administration mounting a renewed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, despite no indication that the politics in the House of Representatives have moved far enough to make the latest push any less Quixotic than the last catastrophic attempt.\nBut Trump has been eyeing the 100-day mark with dread for some time, as Shane Goldmacher reported in Politico on April 10.\nSpoiler alert: They\u2019re not going to make it. This tweet aside, Trump has little to show for his first three months in office. The one exception that he cites, Neil Gorsuch, is indeed a notable one. By placing a young and strongly conservative justice on the Supreme Court bench, Trump can solidify a long legacy of conservative jurisprudence (though there\u2019s little to suggest he has much personal interest in this, outside of the political win). The rest of Trump\u2019s ambitious political agenda is largely stalled: defeated in Congress, obstructed in Congress, blocked by the courts, or caught up in the bureaucratic machine\u2014which, thanks to the president\u2019s slow pace of appointments, is working well below peak capacity.\nThe Friday morning tweet shows Trump\u2019s obsession with press coverage of his administration. He is right that the 100-day mark is arbitrary\u2014or at least little more than a historical artifact bequeathed to future presidents, willing or not, from Franklin Roosevelt. Perhaps, as Jeff Greenfield recently wrote, it ought to be ignored. Given that arbitrariness, press coverage matters more than real accomplishments. That\u2019s a truth that Trump has grasped well, from his business career through his presidential campaign, when messaging often triumphed over substance. But that hasn\u2019t worked well for him since coming to the White House.\nTrump can complain about the tone of the coverage, and he can complain that the press it out to get him, but he can\u2019t blame anyone else for the emphasis on the 100-day standard: It\u2019s an unforced error that candidate Trump made. On October 22, 2016, Trump appeared in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he unrolled a \u201cContract with the American Voter,\u201d hearkening back to the 1994 GOP \u201cContract With America.\u201d The document, helpfully still posted on his website, lays out precisely the steps that Trump promised to take by the same 100-day deadline he now ridicules.\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag. Trump has ticked off some of the items on the list, like instituting rules about lobbying activities by former members of his administration, or imposing a hiring freeze on the federal government. He has announced U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, okayed construction on the Keystone XL pipeline, and begun deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nBut far more of the big-ticket items remain unfulfilled. Trump attempted to institute a ban on Muslim immigration but was slapped down by federal courts; a second, far narrower, order has also hit legal roadblocks.

For over 60 years, NATO\u2019s Incirlik Airbase served as a deterrent to possible Soviet expansion and proved valuable in handling various crisis in the Middle East. According to the World Island theory of Mackinder \u201c who controls the rimland rules Eurasia, who rules Eurasia controls the destines of World.\u201d To that end, the enunciation of the Truman Doctrine on March 12,1947 led to the expansion of U.S defense ties to Turkey and laid the ground work for Turkey\u2019s eventual incorporation in NATO. Turkey\u2019s strategic importance to the United States provided a bridge to the Arab world and served as a stabilizing force in the Middle East; hence, the continued access to Incirlik Airbase remains important factor for preserving U.S national interest in the Greater Middle East.\nNATO\u2019s Incirlik Airbase has important factor for Turkish-American and Israel relations to manage geopolitical developments in Middle East. On 21 February 1955, the airbase was officially named Adana Air base, with 7216th Air Base Squadron as the host unit. This base was renamed \u201c Incirlik Air Base\u201d on 28 February 1958. Establishing Incirlik Airbase created an \u201cadvanced defense front\u201d against the threat of potential Soviet incursion through the southern wing of Turkey. Another important reason for the creation of the southern wing was preservation of oil resources in Middle East and paving way for the Alliance of Periphery to expand its sphere of influence by which the Turkish membership to NATO has pushed the alliance front further east and right after Israel gained independence from Britain, the Alliance of Periphery was formulated by Israel\u2019s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. The alliance called Israel-as secular democratic state in the Middle East- to develope a close strategic alliance with Turkey and the United States in order to counteract against pro-Soviet Arab regime. From the military and strategic point of view, military operations from NATO\u2019s Incirlik Airbase are representing Pax-Americana or American super power to protect democracy, stability and oil resources in the Middle East.\nThe civil wars raging in recent years in some of the Arab states in the Middle East and the emergence of the movements, motivated mostly by ISIS \u2013ISIL sponsored terrorism, challange the current political configuration of the region and supremacy of the central arab governments. It is difficult to imagine that the old order of Sykes- Picot can be restored. Rather, in light of the different religious and ethnic realities in the region, Middle East is requesting new order creating political and economic viability. A combination of creating new order by using of new political formations such as federation/confederation may be requested in region. It may be premature to discuss \u201cnew Sykes-Picot system\u201d will break out but it will also be futile to assume that some of the indigenous forces battling in the Middle East will be satisfied with simply returning to the status quo ante bellum. To this end, Turkey is powerful NATO country in region fighting against PKK terrorism to settle stability in region is important factor for civil war in arab countries and will determine fate of the Middle East.\nOn 24 July 2015, Turkey officially launched its two-front campaign against PKK terrorism and Islamic State jihadist group in Syria, marking Turkey\u2019s first military involvement in the US-led campaign against ISIL.

{"idx": "37215", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Not long ago, the process of installing tiles was often left to the hands of professionals. It involved soaking ceramic tiles in water for a whole night then setting them in thick mortar afterward. Nowadays, the introduction of backer board and thinset adhesives have made it possible for anyone to perform a DIY tile installation.\nSince home renovations can cost thousands, many homeowners prefer doing things on their own. This is true with tiling. Calling for a tiling contractor is expensive. On average, it will cost anywhere from $45 to $150 per hour. There are also those who will charge you around $35 to $50 per square meter depending on the materials used.\nBefore you begin with your tiling project, you have to prepare the surface first. Ceramic tiles can be installed over most substrates; however, you need to clear the surface of any dirt. Make sure it\u2019s clean, dry, smooth, and free of any grime and dirt. Remove any loose or uneven areas, trims, appliances, moldings, and anything that can only interfere with the installation.\nWhen doing a wall and floor tiling project, make sure you keep the layout of your room in mind. If you install tiles on your walls, start from the bottom row first. From there, you can then start working your way up one row at a time.\nMeanwhile, if you install tiles on your floors, you need to make sure it has a flat surface first. You can do this by pouring a self-leveling compound for a flat, smooth base for your tiles.\nYou should use the right mortar or adhesive for your surface to make sure it bonds properly. If you have a cement board or concrete surface for your walls, using a multi-purpose mortar is recommended. Meanwhile, a thinset mortar is ideal for concrete slab or cement board floors. Once you have applied the appropriate adhesive, you may then start setting your tiles.\nGrouting follows after you have successfully set the tiles on your walls or floors. On average, you will need to wait for 24 hours before you can start grouting. Determine the color of the grout you want. For best results, it\u2019s ideal to pick a color that complements your tiles.\nFollow the instructions indicated when mixing your grout, and mix only enough to use within 30 minutes. Before applying, make sure you wear protective gloves. Spread your grout mixture on the tiled surface with the use of a squeegee. Don\u2019t forget to remove any excess grout from the surface. After you\u2019re done, begin the cleanup procedure.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s not really impossible to perform a DIY tiling project. With the right materials and procedure, you can do tiling on your own without the need to rely on a professional\u2019s help."}

Few other details have been made available.\nSpaceX has already conducted a number of successful launches for the U.S. military.\nBut in June 2015 one of its Falcon 9 rockets blew up shortly after lift-off.\nIt is unclear whether the Pentagon investigation will cause a delay for the launch of the Canadian satellites but the Canadian Space Agency has expressed confidence in SpaceX.\n\u201cThe use of a SpaceX Falcon 9 launcher meets the reliability and security requirements set out by the Government of Canada for RCM,\u201d said Canadian Space Agency spokesperson Audrey Barbier.\nShe noted that SpaceX would have more information on the investigation.\nAt this point the RCM is to be launched sometime between May 16 and May 22. The exact date will be determined closer to the launch, according to the Canadian Space Agency.\nSpaceX officials have said they continue to work closely with the Canadian Space Agency and with MDA, the builder of RCM.\nSpaceX considers the probe to be an audit of the U.S. air force\u2019s certification process and not an investigation of the company\u2019s rocket. It doesn\u2019t know what motivated the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general to act.\nThe three RCM surveillance satellites will provide the government with a significant capability.

Researchers there are scheduled to release more information on the use of the vulnerability by cyber-espionage groups on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe CVE is rated as important and the attacker would need to log on to the system to exploit the vulnerability, but when exploited the attacker would gain full control of the affected system,\u201d according to Chris Goettl, director of product management, security, Ivanti.\nGlen Pendley, deputy CTO at Tenable, said the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild by threat actors and poses a real-world risk to organizations.\n\u201c[Five of the] memory corruption vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-8551, CVE-2018-8555, CVE-2018-8556, CVE-2018-8557, and CVE-2018-8588) would give attackers the ability to execute code remotely if a user on a vulnerable system were to access a malicious website or malicious content hosted on a website (e.g., advertisements),\u201d said David Carver, threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future.\n\u201cBrowser and scripting engine patches should be prioritized for workstation-type devices, meaning any system that is used for email or to access the internet via a browser. This includes multi-user servers that are used as remote desktops for users,\u201d wrote Jimmy Graham, director of product and vulnerability management at Qualys.\nMicrosoft also fixed a vulnerability (CVE-2018-8566) impacting its BitLocker tool for encrypting hard drives with 128 bit or 256 bit encryption. The bug is a Public Disclosure vulnerability in Windows 10, Server 2016 and Server 2019. \u201cThe Security Feature Bypass vulnerability exists in BitLocker and could allow an attacker to bypass protection to gain access to encrypted data. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker must gain physical access to the target system,\u201d Goettl noted.\nGoettl said that patching for CVE-2018-8566 is especially important for laptops that can easily be physically accessed.\nIn related news, Adobe on Tuesday released three patches \u2013 including a fix for a flaw in Adobe Acrobat and Reader that exposes hashed passwords and that already has publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code."}

Even so, Intel\u2019s most recent generation of processors has only just begun. Here\u2019s everything we know so far.\nYou can find the processors at varying prices, depending on where you are buying. You can find the Intel Core i9-9900K at BestBuy for $530. The Core i7-9700K, on the other hand, comes in at $410, and the Core i5-9600K at $280.\nAs for the workstation-class Xeon Processors, Intel noted that it would start shipping in December. The Core X-Series, on the other hand, did pick up some suggested pricing starting at $590 and also goes all the way up to $1,980. The difference in pricing boils down to base clock speed, the amount of core and threads, and the Smart Cache amount.\nIntel\u2019s first 9th-gen Core desktop chips are built for gamers and desktop enthusiasts and the company is dubbing its 9900K as \u201cthe best gaming processor in the world\u201d (it\u2019s not necessarily the best Intel processor \u2026 an interesting choice of words). We\u2019d agree with that sentiment. The Core i9-9900K is Intel\u2019s first mainstream processor with a 5GHz Turbo Boost maximum, eight cores, and 16 threads. It also features STIM technology, which helps dissipate heat and allow for more thermal headroom when gaming.\nThe cheaper Core i7-9700K and Core i5-9600K still present good options, coming with eight cores and eight threads, and six cores and six threads, respectively. Those come with a slightly lower base clock speeds of 3.6 GHz, and 3.7 GHz, turbo boost of 4.9 and 4.6 GHz, and cache of 12 MB and nine MB.\nThe specifications of the Core i9-9900K add up to results, with Intel claiming that gamers can expect up to 10-11 percent more performance and frames per second in popular PC games compared to the last generation. They also claimed that video editing in Adobe Premiere can go up 34 percent faster than the previous generation, though there was some recent controversy in testing up against the latest from AMD.\nThe processor is compatible with the new Intel Z390 chipset, and all Intel Series 300 chipsets. The new Intel X390 chipset includes high-speed integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2 and integrated Intel Wireless-AC with support for Gigabit Wi-Fi speed. Also, keep in mind that Spectre protection is built-in for the K-Series chips, but not the X-Series.\nIntel hasn\u2019t made any official announcements about the mobile versions of its 9th-generation CPUs, but we do have some news on the topic thanks to rumors and leaks. Lenovo documentation spotted at the end of November for an upcoming IdeaPad S530 convertible laptop offered three choices of processor: The Core i7-9550U, Core i5-9250U, and Core i3-9130U.

Vice President Mike Pence and an assortment of Cabinet officials are also expected to make trips; Pence may go twice ahead of the March 13 special election, two administration officials said.\nThe White House has taken an especially keen interest in the race: Members of Trump's political affairs office met with Saccone this week. And during a Tuesday conference call between the Republican national party committees and the Saccone campaign, White House political director Bill Stepien expressed displeasure with the progress the candidate was making on fundraising. Stepien said Saccone wasn\u2019t raising enough money and asked for an update on the campaign\u2019s progress in the days to come.\nTrump\u2019s visit to the district next week will take him to a manufacturing plant outside Pittsburgh. The president plans to use the ostensibly official trip to promote the recently passed tax reform plan.\nIt is unusual for a White House to expend so much political capital on a single House race, particularly in what's typically seen as a safe Republican district. But the involvement underscores the high stakes confronting the administration as it approaches a midterm election in which the party\u2019s hold on the House majority is in grave danger. A loss in the working class Pennsylvania district, which the president won by 20 percentage points, would show that few GOP seats are safe.\nRepublicans have reason to worry. Aside from his anemic fundraising, Saccone, a Trump-aligned state representative, is facing a telegenic opponent in Democrat Conor Lamb, an Ivy League-educated 33-year-old attorney and Marine Corps veteran. The special election was triggered in October, when former GOP Rep. Tim Murphy resigned amid allegations that he asked a woman he was having an affair with to get an abortion.\nThe contest was discussed at a private weekend sit-down between Trump and congressional leaders at Camp David last weekend. During the meeting, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy delivered a sobering presentation on the election landscape in which he underscored the historic tendency for the party in power to lose seats in a president\u2019s first midterm. McCarthy, according to two people familiar with the discussion, made a broad ask for assistance from the White House and warned that a loss of the House majority could have profound consequences for Trump's administration.\nPennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican who is retiring, pointed out that his party has underperformed in a series of special elections since the president took office.\n\u201cI hope that doesn't happen in southwestern Pennsylvania because that's a Trump district and the outcome there could have repercussions for the midterms more broadly,\u201d Dent said in an interview. \"It should go Republican, but in this environment one can never take anything for granted.\"\nThe outcome could also have consequences for the White House political office, which is attempting to corral the Republican Party machinery ahead of a brutal midterm season.

The bug bounty program is asking people to report any apps that abuse data on Facebook, and it offers a reward based on how severe the abuse is.\n\"While there is no maximum, high impact bug reports have garnered as much as $40,000 for people who bring them to our attention,\" Collin Greene, Facebook's head of product security, said in a post.\nThe new program comes almost a month after The New York Times and the UK's Observer and Guardian papers revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling firm, took advantage of a Facebook app to siphon off personal information on 87 million people. The scandal has fanned the flames of a backlash against Facebook by lawmakers and users.\nAt the hearing on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said the bug bounty program was one of many steps Facebook was taking to improve its security.\n\"In general, bounty programs are an important part of the security arsenal for hardening a lot of systems,\" the Facebook CEO said.\nIf Facebook's bug bounty program were in place in 2015, and a user reported Cambridge Analytica's data abuse then, the social network would have considered it a \"high impact\" report, Pete Voss, a Facebook spokesman, said.\n\"Those high impact rewards, we look to pay upwards of $40,000,\" Voss said. \"We're really going off impact, and taking these pretty seriously.\"\nThe highest amount Facebook has ever paid for a reported bug was $40,000, Voss said.\nFacebook has changed how much information apps can access, and said it's auditing every app that had access to a large amount of people's data. Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, said the company has been hunting for another Cambridge Analytica, and it has since bounced other data analysis firms, including AggregateIQ and CubeYou.\nAs part of the new program, Facebook would inform the people affected by the reported app's abuse. But the company doesn't plan on making knowledge of the abuse public, only opting to notify the people affected by it, Voss said.\nThat policy is subject to change, Voss added, as Facebook looks to grow its bug bounty program.\n\"We're focused on really making sure the people who are impacted are aware,\" Voss said. \"But this is day 1 of our data abuse bounty. We're open to feedback.\"\nBug bounty programs are common in cybersecurity, with companies paying researchers who find vulnerabilities that hackers could abuse.

{"idx": "37252", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Dressing appropriately helps you feel comfortable and confident during an interview.\nAppearance plays a critical role in the way you are perceived by a hiring manager in a job interview. Several studies, including one by Oregon State associate professor of psychology Dr. Frank Bernieri, indicate interviewers form first impressions in mere seconds. The way you dress can enhance your interview presentation -- or take away from the interviewer's favorable assessment.\nA primary purpose of interview dress is to support your overall impression as professional and competent. Unless you have reason to believe otherwise, the best approach to interview dress is traditional, professional and conservative. For men, this includes a navy blue or black suit, a white collared shirt and a neutral tie. For women, a pant or skirt suit with a jacket are traditional looks. Ultimately, your dress should enhance the message you deliver about your abilities, not distract from them.\nIf you prefer more specific direction on dress for a particular interview, call the company's human resources department. Hiring managers in a more casual workplace may prefer a business casual appearance. Those in a trendy fashion and apparel company might go more for an eccentric, trendy or less traditional look. In essence, you can simply take the \"play it safe\" mode, or find out the actual preference of the company and its hiring managers.\nAlthough attire alone won't get you a job, lack of attention to it can contribute to a missed opportunity. Wearing worn-out, unpolished shoes, for example, may suggest that you lack attention to detail and personal pride in your appearance. So wear a belt and shoes -- polished ones -- that match your outfit. Ironed shirts and pants are also critical.\nAlong with projecting a professional look, avoid wearing items that are especially distracting to interviewers. Multiple earrings or long, dangling ones, for instance, can take the focus away from your words and facial expressions. If you have visible tattoos, try to cover them with clothing. Avoid revealing outfits that may get you noticed, but for the wrong reasons.\nKokemuller, Neil. \"Tips for Dressing for a Job Interview.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/tips-dressing-job-interview-11874.html.

Longtime City Attorney Roger Orr resigned in April 2014 after being implicated in Sunshine Law violations by two City Council members. His successor, Pam Booker, was fired in February 2014 for poor communications and legal strategy.\n\"What the city needs is a leader to guide the City Attorney's Office out of its current chaos,\" Osenton wrote in his introduction letter to the council.\nOsenton's letter told the council members he would resolve the leadership vacuum by effectively managing the office and communicating with the workers.\nBut the city's Feb. 20 internal investigation report found Osenton to be lacking many of the qualities he claimed to possess.\n\"First, the city attorney must be an effective manager,\" Osenton wrote. \"I know how to coordinate my subordinates in their work and keep a command of the successful operation of the office.\"\nThe City Attorney's Office, according to the report, was plagued by personality conflicts and generally was divided between veteran female employees and new male employees hired by Osenton.\nThe report also accused Osenton of ignoring disrespectful behavior by his second in command, Senior Assistant City Attorney Phil Mugavero, and allowing ongoing animosity between Mugavero and longtime Office Manager Betty Bollinger.\n\"The investigators were provided with numerous examples in which Attorney Mugavero berated Office Manager Bollinger to others, and has discounted or minimized issues female staff have brought forward,\" the report says. \"Witnesses stated that Attorney Mugavero is consistently critical of Office Manager Bollinger's insistence that staff adhere to policies and procedures, to the point of being 'downright mean' to her.\"\nThe report also identified \"shared animosity\" between Bollinger and paralegal Charles Snyderman, who is assigned to assist Mugavero.\nMugavero's handling of Snyderman prompted paralegal Jennyfer Ladouceur to lodge a complaint with the city Human Resources Department on Jan. 22 claiming Snyderman received preferential treatment.\nThe complaint lead to the investigation that uncovered Osenton's hiring-policy violation and resulted in his resignation.\nIn an interview with TCPalm, Osenton admitted he made a mistake by including the word \"attractive\" on a list of qualities he was seeking in staff-attorney candidates. But Osenton declined to discuss the management and personnel issues in the report.\nSeveral passages in Osenton's sales-pitch letter seem ironic when compared to some of the findings in the investigation report.\n\"A city manager must be responsive,\" Osenton wrote. \"He/she must be responsive to assistant city attorneys and staff so that the City"}

Already CNAC\u2019s preferences for \u201cborder security\u201d and \u201ctemporary workers\u201d have attracted friends with clout, but did you know that Mexican oil is also on the agenda?\nShortly after last year\u2019s Waco Summit brought together three North American heads of state, Bush, Fox, and Martin, a CNAC proposal was released by the US Council of the Mexico-US Business Committee (MEXUS), an organization which predates the Council of the Americas (COA) to which it now belongs.\nThe April 2005 report is signed by COA heavyweights Robert Mosbacher and James Jones, backed by a leadership team composed of ChevronTexaco, Eastman Kodak, First Data, Ford Motor, Kissinger McLarty, Manatt Jones Global Strategies, Merck, MetLife, Miller and Chevalier, Nextel, and Proctor and Gamble.\nIn a preface to the report, MEXUS takes a lot of credit for creating NAFTA or the North American Free Trade Agreement; brags about publishing \u201cNAFTA Works\u201d; and promises to maintain leadership for \u201cincreasing competitiveness\u201d in the unified North American bloc.\nThe fact that seems to irritate this report more than any other is that despite NAFTA the maquiladora sector of the Mexican economy had managed to lose 250,000 jobs to China in the first five years of the new American century. This fact also locates the area that CNAC authors are most interested to address: how to fix the problems of Mexico so that the NAFTA alliance can steal back those maquiladora jobs. One key task is \u201cfree and secure\u201d trade through borders which commodities can speed quickly, but which must do a better job screening people.\nConcurrent with release of this report last April, the Minutemen were quietly fading into the margins of the media when their profile was rescued by terminator Governor Schwarzenegger of California. At that time, remember, Schwarzenegger miscued himself by talking about \u201cclosing the border\u201d, a line he later delivered closer to script.\n\u201cYesterday was a total screw-up in the words I used,\u201d the governor said at a press conference. \u201cBecause instead of closing, I meant securing.\u201d With those words, pieces of the border puzzle had actually locked into place last April, soon followed last May by a caucus report from Congress calling for 36,000 national guard at the border. At the time, the idea seemed far-fetched, like the idea of full-scale invasions had sounded a few years before that.\nAs we now know, the President has fulfilled the 2005 prophesies by sending thousands of troops to replace the function modeled by the Minutemen, just as Schwarzenegger and the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus had suggested in the first place.\nBesides \u201cborder security\u201d the CNAC report is clear in its preference for a second darling policy favored by Bush and Companies: an \u201cenforceable temporary worker program that will match willing workers with willing employers, bringing order and increased security to current haphazard patterns of immigration.\u201d We haven\u2019t heard the end of this idea this year.

And Stop Saying 'Grit.'\" Osgood's piece points out that Tough's \"new\" premise--character matters more than data upticks in eventual outcomes for American kids--is hardly a novelty, or surprising to teachers. And \"grit,\" the buzzword that summarizes student perseverance, is beyond annoying--it's somewhere between disingenuous and offensive.\nThere are a lot of words like \"grit\" out there in the market-based pizzazz vocabulary of school reform. It's as if the right innovative plan and the right catchy language would cause our students, rich and poor, to soar to the top of international rankings--the benchmark du jour. Never mind that students in top public schools are already there.\nThe pitch: once we start thinking of education as an \"opportunity culture,\" where grit and entrepreneurial spirit are materially rewarded, the real cultural surround of inequity and anti-intellectualism will simply melt away. If all our \"top\" teachers (whom we have precisely identified through standardized, data-rich evaluation models) were sufficiently entrepreneurial, could we really close the gaps, raise the bar and keep our nation great?\nShould we start treating great teaching as a commodity, subject to market forces around distribution, innovation, production and efficiency?\nThat doesn't seem to be what Franklin D.

But one fact stands tall: In less than a week the number of perfectly playable games on Steam for Linux increased by nearly 1000 titles.\nThat's an increase of almost 20% practically overnight, and it's guaranteed to climb higher as the Linux community continues testing the enormous library of Windows games on their favorite Linux distributions.\nValve has whitelisted only 27 games, but many more are perfectly playable.\nValve has officially whitelisted only 27 games at this early stage, but we can expect that number to grow at a rapid pace.\nAs of this writing, 2134 unique games have been user-tested from the Steam for Windows library. Each game receives one of six ratings: Completely Stable, Stable, Unstable, Unplayable, Crashes or Won't Start. A Completely Stable rating signifies that the game exhibits native-like performance with no bugs or errors. Since testing began, 971 unique titles have been stamped with a Completely Stable status.\nIt's worth pointing out that your mileage may vary depending on GPU driver version and operating system. Note that Ubuntu accounts for 37% of all submissions (Arch Linux is in 2nd place), and 64% of users are running on Nvidia.\nAs the hours tick by, it's becoming clear how beneficial this latest Steam Play update is to the Linux community at large. Valve's first step at rejuvenating Linux in 2013 with SteamOS and the Linux Steam client yielded results, but \"The Year Of Desktop Linux\" never arrived. By improving on the tools created by the open source community -- and employing the developer behind the DirectX-to-Vulkan project, it has done more for PC gaming on Linux in the last week than it managed to do in 5 years.\nSee, before this happened, Linux users were forced to use workarounds like Wine and DXVK to get these games running with varying degrees of success. Even with pleasant GUI tools like Lutris, there was still a lot of guesswork. Now Steam automagically applies those workarounds and various customizations to each game. It's as transparent as simply installing a game on Windows. You can even point your Steam for Linux client at your Windows installation, and it will download the necessary updates.\nAgain, this doesn't mean you can ditch Windows and expect every game to work. Not yet. Possibly not ever. Especially ones that contain aggressive DRM and anti-cheat software. It does means that in the weeks and months ahead, the total available games you can play on Linux -- and with native-like performance -- should at least double. And I think that's a conservative guess.\nI've started doing my own testing and have been pleasantly surprised with games like Monster Hunter: World, DiRT 4 and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. All three are games I previously relied on a Windows 10 installation for.\nThe community-maintained Steam Play compatibility reports can be viewed here. You can submit your own results here.

The collection made headlines not just for the merchandise itself but for the fact that shoppers were so manic that they famously crashed the retailer\u2019s website, causing every item to sell out within minutes and contributing to Target\u2019s 3.7 percent net profit boost that quarter. It appears H&M might have its own collaboration success story with the insanely buzzy Balmain collection.\nThe site\u2014www.hm.com\u2014crashed immediately after the anticipated collaboration went live at 8 a.m., and when went it went back up at 9:00, mostly everything was gone. About an hour later, everything was gone\u2014from $40 T-shirts to $690 beaded jackets (yes, people were paying almost $700 for H&M).\nAs for why this collection is causing such a stir? As much as we hate to say it, we probably have the Kardashians to thank. Up until recently, Balmain wasn\u2019t exactly a brand you\u2019d consider mass market. It was a very, very high-fashion French label that your teenage cousins had certainly never heard of. Then, its 28-year-old creative director, Olivier Rousteing, starting leveraging his relationships with the It-girls we often see on TV, in the tabloids, and on Instagram.\nKim Kardashian wore a strong-shouldered Balmain dress to her bachelorette party and later appeared in an ad with Kanye West. Teenager Kylie Jenner suddenly started wearing the house\u2019s dresses to events. Kendall Jenner walked the label\u2019s runway. Even Kris Jenner began sharing photos that showed up her kicking it with Rousteing in Paris. Factor in the sheer number of people who follow this group on Instagram, and you\u2019ve got some pretty priceless brand awareness.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Kardashians: Back in May, the Billboard Music Awards was essentially a Balmain takeover, with even more starlets turning up to the red carpet dressed in the label and traveling in a pack, including Taylor Swift, Lily Aldridge, and Chrissy Teigen, all of whom feature prominently on Instagram when you search for the hashtag #Balmain or #BalmainArmy.\nAnd as much as fashion snobs gripe that brands like Balmain (and others, like Givenchy) are becoming a part of Us Weekly culture, it\u2019s a smart way for a very, very aspirational (read: expensive) label to align itself with the social media generation, letting us know the world\u2019s coolest girls are all about the brand. The result: People beating each other down to get a piece at H&M and a sold-out collection.\nIf you\u2019re really keen on snagging something from Balmain x H&M, may we suggest heading over to eBay where a beaded, velvet minidress\u2014the same one Kylie wore to the party celebrating the collab last month\u2014is already up to $1,500 and has 19 bids with 10 hours left."}

His parents, Paul and Emily, both pharmacists, ran the town pharmacy. An interesting fact is that Emily had the distinction of being the first licensed woman pharmacist in North Carolina. Music was a part of the Kyser household; apparently everyone in the family had a pleasant singing voice \u2014 everybody but Kay. Though he had an intuitive feel for music and rhythm, he was never trained and was always frank about not playing an instrument or reading music, even when he became one of the most successful bandleaders of his era.\nIn high school Kay was active in many extracurricular activities, including sports \u2014 he was a member of the basketball team, but he was too slight for the football team. Enterprising as usual, he formed a football team of a group of classmates who, like him, lacked the bulk of varsity squad members; the team was named the Tigers. There is a legend that the Tiger games grew larger gates than the regular team.\nOne story, gleaned by Beasley from a newspaper report, tells that Kay organized a student body walkout on Armistice Day since he thought it should be a school holiday. According to the press report, the walk out was a success. Kay was class president in both his junior and senior years. His social conscience and his genius for persuasion led him, in his senior year, to create a plan that would insure that every member of the senior class would graduate. He had students who were doing well tutor those who weren\u2019t, with the startling result that everyone graduated together for the first time in Rocky Mount High School history. He also became a cheerleader, an activity he would continue to enjoy once he entered UNC.\nDuring a time when school spirit was at low ebb at Chapel Hill, tryouts were held for varsity cheerleader. Kay took over, wowed the student body in the stands, and in his enthusiasm decided that there had to be an organized cheering squad. He recruited an enthusiastic group and led them as they rehearsed on the field just like the athletic teams. They became the Cheerios, a precision squad of 250 uniformed members.\nAmong a myriad of other campus activities at Chapel Hill, Kay produced and staged the Playmakers shows. One of the other undergrads with whom Kay worked on theatrical productions was Hal Kemp, who had a campus band, the Carolina Club Orchestra. The band was popular locally and in surrounding areas, where they would play for dances and parties.\nBy the time Kemp was ready to graduate, he had recorded some music for Columbia records and was getting time on the air. Kemp surprised Kay by suggesting that he put together a new band and lead it himself.\nThe original six players that made up the band played by ear, weren\u2019t very good, but Kay\u2019s humorous shenanigans made up for shortcomings in the music, and as their music improved the band became regionally popular; soon they were booked for school dances on campuses all over the South.\nBeasley does a thorough job of"}

An adult Squalus clarkae found in the waters off Belize.\nSay hello to Squalus clarkae, otherwise known as Genie\u2019s dogfish. This newly identified species of deepwater shark was named in honor of Eugenie Clark, a scientific pioneer who influenced an entire generation of marine biologists.\nFew people have done more to improve the reputation of sharks in the public\u2019s mind than Eugenie Clark, who died in 2015 at the age of 92.\nEugenie Clark takes measurements of a shark on the dock at Cape Haze Marine Lab.\nKnown as the \u201cshark lady,\u201d she founded the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida, and was an early member of the American Elasmobranch Society. Among her many scientific achievements, Clark discovered several new species of fish, and learned that some species of shark don\u2019t need to swim in order to breathe. She also conducted some of the earliest research into shark behavior, showing they\u2019re more than just mindless killing machines. Over the course of her career, Clark received numerous awards and honors, including a 1996 Emmy Award for her underwater films.\nAnd now, fittingly, a newly discovered species of shark has been named in her honor, the details of which were published this week in the science journal Zootaxa.\nThe new shark, christened Squalus clarkae, is a member of the dogfish family, which all tend to look alike. These modestly sized deep-sea creatures feature slow reproductive rates and low genetic diversity, making them difficult to study. Previously, marine biologists had mistakenly conflated S. clarkae with another type of dogfish, Squalus mitsukurii. But genetic testing and a thorough analysis of its physical characteristics revealed Genie\u2019s dogfish, as it\u2019s also called, as a distinct species deserving of its own name.\n(A) Photo of an ddult female Squalus clarkae from the Gulf of Mexico, (B) sketch of an adult female S. clarkae.\nGenie\u2019s dogfish can be found in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic ocean. Compared to other dogfish, its distinguishing features include a longer body, a tighter gap between its eyes, a shorter caudal fin (its tail fin), and a differently proportioned first dorsal fin.\nA few other fish species have been named for Clark, including Sticharium clarkae and Enneapterygius clarkae.\nThanks to the pioneering efforts of Eugenie Clark, who devoted her life to changing our conceptions of sharks, many people now recognize the importance of this preservation effort.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post mistakenly referred to Toby Daly-Engel as the lead author; that distinction belongs to Mariah Pfleger."}

Post YOUR reviews here!\nIt looks funny when a fil m starts with a disclaimer saying, 'All the characters, plots etc are fictitious and any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental,' and is followed by another message saying the film is 'Based on a true story.' But then again, you can expect the unexpected from Ram Gopal Varma.\nThe first 30 minutes of Rakht Charitra 2 is just a recap of the first part. But that slows the proceedings so much that by the time the second part actually starts, you've lost interest.\nNarasimha Reddy (Kitty) is a big-time politician in Anandapur, a small town in Andhra Pradesh. One of his close associates Veerabhadraiah (Rajendra Gupta) belongs to a backward community. His brother Nagamani (Kota Srinivasa Rao) is not happy with their relationship and creates a rift between them. Then he uses Manda (Ashish Vidyarthi) as a weapon to kill Veerabhadraiah.\nVeerabhadraiah's son Paritala Ravi is pursuing his studies in the city, and wants to get married to Nandini (Radhika Apte).\nParitala learns about the murder of his father and goes to the village. Then he gets busy avenging the deaths in his family. Actor-turned-politician Shivaji (Shatrughan Sinha) takes him under his wing and, after winning elections, makes him a minister.\nHe then asks Paritala Ravi to wipe out all the bad people in the community. How he takes his revenge forms the rest of the first part.\nThe second part revolves around Narasimha Reddy's son Surya. Surya is a happy-go-lucky person living in the city. He is in love with Bhawani (Priyamani) and wants to settle down with her.\nAt this juncture, Surya learns about the murder of his father, who is killed by Paritala Ravi. So he goes to the village.\nUnlike Paritala, Surya is not interested in revenge. He plans to take his family to the city and settle down. But an incident changes his life, and he now makes it his mission to kill Paritala.\nBoth films are similar -- the only difference is that they have been narrated from two points of view. The first film shows the rise of Paritala Ravi and the second shows the rise of Surya. With so much similarity and such an outdated plot, there's not much RGV can do to salvage the show.\nRGV's direction is effective but the script lets him down. It lacks the narrative style required, and fails to hold the audience. Post-interval, the film loses pace and just drags to the end.\nThe action of the film is as raw as it can get. Action directors Javed-Eijaz have continued where they left off in Rakht Charitra 1. One might feel that there is an overdose of violence but the script asks for it.\nCinematography by Amol Rathod is poor. There are too many long shots, close ups, irregular movements and unnecessary turns. The soundtrack is too loud but it does add to the drama.\n* The opening scene where Surya fails to kill Paritala Ravi. You can see the hatred"}

Meanwhile, Crosby and McDavid are both on offensive tears.\nCrosby, who had 35 points in his first 40 games, has 25 points in 15 games since Jan. 1 and 60 overall. McDavid, who was in 13th place overall before Monday night\u2019s five-point explosion, is now tied for third with 63 points.\nThis is what the great players do. They eventually rise to the top. Of course, it\u2019s not just Crosby and McDavid who are enjoying second-half surges.\nPhil Kessel, who has 23 points in his last 15 games, is in second place and trailing Kucherov by one point in the Art Ross Trophy race, while Evgeni Malkin (26 points in his last 15 games) is tied for fourth place. Not surprisingly, the trio has the Penguins looking like the same team that won back-to-back Stanley Cups.\nSince Jan. 1, the Penguins trail only the Bruins in the win department, posting an 11-4 record. They have are tied with Boston for the most goals (58), have the best power play (36.6%) and the third-best penalty kill (87.2%).\nLike Stamkos said, don\u2019t bet against Crosby. Further to that, don\u2019t bet against Pittsburgh and a potential three-peat.\nStrange to think that Kessel could win the Art Ross Trophy in a year where he wasn\u2019t even invited to all-star weekend. Then again, even if he were to lead the league in scoring, what are the chances he gets more votes than Crosby or Malkin for MVP? \u2026 The more I think about it, the more sense it makes for the Penguins to trade for Rick Nash at the deadline. He\u2019s not the 42-goal scorer he was in 2014-15, but he\u2019d still be a perfect winger for Crosby. And after losing Chris Kunitz, Matt Cullen and Ron Hainsey in the off-season, he\u2019d fill a much-needed leadership void.\nOn pace for close to another 100-point season, the talk is that the Oilers are wasting a great season from McDavid. But it happens more than you\u2019d think. If he were to win his second straight Art Ross Trophy, it would be the fourth time in the last 15 years that the scoring leader was on a non-playoff team. The others were Dallas\u2019 Jamie Benn in 2014-15, Tampa Bay\u2019s Martin St. Louis in 2012-13 and Calgary\u2019s Jarome Iginla in 2001-02.

Believe me.\nSince 2015, South Carolina farmers have started from ground zero over and over with each new plant and harvest season. From Matthew and Irma, to Florence and Michael, the damage done on farms and ranches across the state over the past several years due to natural disasters has left farm families struggling. Coupled with the downturn in the farm economy, many of South Carolina\u2019s farmers and ranchers may not survive without aid.\nThe two most recent hurricanes walloped Palmetto State farmers with estimated damage of $205 million. Farms of all sizes were affected. And the disasters have not been limited to the Southeast.\nAcross the nation, farmers have dealt with wildfires, a volcanic eruption, two Category 4 hurricanes, an earthquake, tornadoes and major flooding. Similar to South Carolina, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy in most of the affected states.\nWhile some assistance may be available for livestock and crop farmers through USDA disaster aid programs, much of the damage will not be covered through assistance or insurance. Farmers are calculated risk-takers, but these exceptional situations cannot be planned for.\nIn spite of the widespread impacts of these natural disasters, national political pandering has once again left farmers hamstrung while deeply divided groups in D.C. wait on the other to blink. Food is a nonpartisan issue, and relief for those who feed our state, nation and world should not be held hostage to politics.\nI have heard from so many that they aren\u2019t sure how they\u2019ll make it another year. Generations of hard work and sweat and prayers will be sold off piece by piece so homes can be saved and some dignity salvaged in the process. Farm income is down 50 percent over the last four years, and with low commodity prices fueled by tariffs and market uncertainty, who could blame farmers for being pessimistic.\nWhile the national political storm rages on, we have a potential saving grace. South Carolina legislators have the opportunity to step up to the plate when others will not. South Carolina Farm Aid, created in response to the flood in 2015, gave farmers hope and the means to see another planting season.\nCurrently, the S.C. Senate budget includes a $25 million proviso designated for farm aid. Please know, this aid will only cover a small portion of the damage accrued over the past four years, but it could be the light at the end of the tunnel that our farmers need to continue on.\nFarmers do not want to ask for help. They want to till the earth, sow the seeds and watch their crops grow. They want to continue to provide for their families and communities, but this is a situation beyond their control. I urge the South Carolina General Assembly to offer a helping hand to our friends and neighbors who desperately need this aid. Without it, farmers will face a disaster beyond the weather.\nHarry Ott of Calhoun County is president of South Carolina Farm Bureau."}

These Germans even spit on baseballs.\n\"Overlord\" is a jingoistic throwback to a time of moral clarity when there weren't very fine people on both sides, adapted for an audience that likes its action movies to be structured like video games, with Private Boyce (Jovan Adepo) creeping down brick hallways like he's in a first-person shooter, pausing to pick up clues. Novel? Not especially. \"Overlord\" works best as a patriotism booster shot \u2014 it's \"Inglourious Basterds\" without a swizzle of irony.\nOverlord's opening sequence is fantastic. It's the night before D-Day, and the sky and seas are cluttered with soldiers steeling themselves for the morning's big fight. Avery opens in the air with a plane of paratroopers preparing to take out a Nazi radio tower mounted like a wicked steeple atop an occupied village church. The camera focuses on the young Americans' nerves, the bouncing knees, clenched fingers, and empty boasting, as though loudmouth Tibbet (John Magaro), the one with the obligatory Bronx accent, plans to personally assassinate Hitler. When they reach the French coast, they're suddenly surrounded by stark chaos, planes plummeting through the air, bullets ripping through their fuselage, a color palette by cinematographers Laurie Rose and Fabian Wagner made only of smoke gray and fireball red.\nPrivate Boyce, the film's conscience, is silent and terrified. He almost failed out of boot camp because he was too timid to kill a mouse \u2014 literally, he captured one that liked to leave droppings in their tent and chose to set it free, for which Tibbet mocks him mercilessly. Meanwhile, taciturn new addition Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell), an explosives expert, limits himself to macho platitudes like, \"You keep worrying about dead bodies you're going to be one,\" and the even simpler to needlepoint, \"Friends die.\" When their commander (Bokeem Woodbine) commands, \"We have to be just as rotten as they are,\" there's a sense that screenwriters Billy Ray and Mark L. Smith intend to use Ford's violent tactics to test how far audiences will support a good guy character who willingly uses torture. (There's even a shot of a German prisoner strung up and hooded like an image from Abu Ghraib.) But the Nazis are so cartoonishly evil that there's never a debate: These blonde, big-cheekboned fiends must be stopped by any means necessary.\nRussell is miscast as a battle-scarred grunt \u2014 he has the untroubled brow of someone who always smells of sunscreen. Yet, when Ford and Boyce regroup on land along with remaining survivors Tibbet and a mellow war correspondent (Iain De Caestecker) who sees nothing wrong with tromping around Nazi territory with a giant flashbulb around his neck, Avery is able to wring out a few more shots of beautiful and unearthly brutality: bobbing"}

Barbara Boxer of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts.\nThe bill also has the support of conservative Republicans such as Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana and James Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n\"This is a political Halley's Comet\" that may not be seen again for many years, said Markey, a former opponent of the bill who signed onto it in recent weeks after changes were made to ensure that states that regulate chemicals closely can continue to do so.\nMarkey called the bill \"a special piece of legislation\" that finally updates one of the major environmental laws approved during the 1970s.\nThe agreement announced Thursday merges bills that the House and Senate passed last year.\nNegotiations had stalled in recent weeks, as lawmakers struggled over a provision that allows states to continue regulating toxic chemicals. The proposal announced Thursday declares that any state law or rule in place before April 22 would not be pre-empted by federal law. The proposal also would allow states to work on regulations while federal rules are being developed, a process that can take years.\nBoxer, who had opposed earlier versions of the bill, said the proposal protects the rights of California, Massachusetts and other states that aggressively regulate chemicals \"to continue their critical work to protect their citizens from harmful toxic chemicals.\" States that do not regulate chemicals closely would follow the federal standard.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement Thursday that the measure \"goes a long way to providing businesses with much needed clarity and certainty by facilitating a more predictable federal regulatory program\" for chemicals.\nRichard Denison, a senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, called the bill a \"significant victory for public health,\" noting that it will require safety reviews for thousands of chemicals already in use and mandate greater scrutiny of new chemicals before they can be sold.\n\"While not perfect, this will be a dramatic improvement over current law,\" Denison said.\nChemicals used in everyday products such as household cleaners, clothing and furniture have been linked to serious illnesses, including cancer, infertility, diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Under current law, only a small fraction of chemicals used in these products have been reviewed for safety.\n\"People believe when they go to the grocery store or the hardware store (and) get a product, that that product has been tested and it's been determined to be safe.

Klein was arguably most well-known for providing dermatology services to Jackson, but the list of celebrities he provided services for were quite extensive, including Elizabeth Taylor, Carrie Fisher, and Dolly Parton. According to NBC News, Klein\u2019s specialties lied within Botox treatments and Restylane treatments, which helped patients battle wrinkled and sagging skin problems.\nArnold Klein was a renowned dermatologist with numerous celebrity clients.\nKlein, originally from Mt. Clemens, Michigan, moved to California when he was in his 20s, and opened up his first medical practice in Beverly Hills. His work became so popular that he was given the unofficial titles of \u201cFather of Botox\u201d and \u201cKing of Lips.\u201d Klein eventually became popular among celebrities.\nYet, along with popularity came scrutiny against the dermatologist, including speculation that he contributed to Jackson\u2019s death. Authorities investigated Klein after Jackson\u2019s death in 2009 due to medications prescribed to the late singer by the dermatologist. Klein was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. He fought back by saying he never hurts his patients and he is talented in his craft.\nAlong with being one of Jackson\u2019s close friends, Klein treated Jackson for more than 25 years.\nKlein gave an interview shortly after Jackson passed away, and said that the \u201cThriller\u201d singer was in a great mood, dancing and singing. However, the dermatologist also stated that he felt Jackson had an issue with the prescription drug Propofol, which was found in Jackson\u2019s system when he died.\nKlein was often rumored to be the biological father of Jackson\u2019s oldest son, Prince Jackson, 18. Although the dermatologist once left cryptic photos of himself and Prince, the rumors have never been substantiated. Prince took to Twitter recently, after being constantly harassed about his paternity. The college student provided a classy response to the doubters, indicating that Michael Jackson would forever be his father.\nDespite rumors, it's never been proven that Arnold Klein was the biological father of Prince Jackson.\nArnold Klein received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, followed by a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

By combining supportive services together in one location, officials hope to reduce overall costs of care.\n\u201cThe two buildings together will save us over $3 million a year in emergency taxpayer costs including shelter, hospital emergency rooms and jail,\u201d said Jessica Katz, assistant commissioner at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\u201cWe recognize that affordable housing, access to supportive services and quality health care need to work concurrently to ensure a quality life,\u201d said Joanne Oplustil, president and CEO of CAMBA, of the new project.\nNext door to the new construction site, more than 209 residences are ready for tenants at CAMBA Gardens Phase I, a 193,000-square-foot housing complex built in a formerly underutilized KCH building, which officially opened Monday as construction at the second building began.\nMany residents of the first building have already moved in, including Elizabeth Melendez, the mother of a 21-year-old son and 16-year-old twin daughters born with developmental disabilities.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t fight as much as I wanted to. I fought as much as I could,\u201d she said.\nBut she found luck last summer when CAMBA accepted her application to CAMBA Gardens I at 738 Albany Ave. at Clarkson Avenue. Last March, she and her family moved into a brand-new three-bedroom apartment.\nTenants at CAMBA Gardens pay 30 percent of their annual income toward rent, a CAMBA spokeswoman said, and the rest is subsidized by the nonprofit and the state.\nThe building project will cost $165 million, $100 million of which is funded by New York State. Phase I includes a rooftop solar panel array designed to reduce energy consumption by 45 percent, several multi-purpose rooms, gardens and a rooftop terrace.\nPhase II will include community rooms for health services, adult education and a computer lab in addition to 60,000 square feet of landscaped outdoor space, open to the public.\nMore than 7,000 people applied to live at the first phase of CAMBA Gardens, the CAMBA spokeswoman said. Tenants of the second phase of the project will be determined by a lottery conducted by HPD when the building is more fully constructed, she said, which will be publicized on both CAMBA and HPD's websites.\nFor more information about the CAMBA Gardens project, visit CAMBA\u2019s website."}

In a letter, Steven H. Baden '92 said that the reorganized fraternity \"was an insult to the expelled brothers, the MIT Greek system, and the MIT community at large.\"\nBaden said the reorganized chapter only had \"four or five\" members left and that by today \"this whole episode will be little more than an unpleasant memory.\"\nBut the chapter's president, David S. Borison '91, said the new AEPi chapter was moving forward. \"We will be a good fraternity.\"\nBorison would not reveal how many members the chapter had, but said, \"We lost Steve, that's about it.\" Earlier, the chapter claimed to have about 15 interested students.\nThe national fraternity expelled 45 of the 55 members from the MIT chapter earlier this year. The national said the reorganization was prompted by violations of the Fraternity Insurance Purchasing Group rules, but members of the new and old chapter said poor relations with the national were at the root of the expulsions.\nBaden, who had been elected vice president of the chapter less than two weeks ago, said he reconsidered his membership in light of \"other views\" about the national's actions. He concluded that the national had treated the MIT chapter poorly and not gone through \"proper channels\" when initiating the reorganization. Baden said he did not want to be associated with \"an organization whose behavior I found reprehensible.\"\nBorison claimed Baden's letter did not reflect Baden's current views. \"[Baden] believes what the national did is correct and is gung-ho for the chapter,\" Borison claimed. But \"he feels right now it is creating strife among the Jewish community.\"\nBaden refused to comment or disassociate himself from the remarks in his letter.\nMembers of the new AEPi chapter and the national organization met with Hillel representatives last night to try to improve relations. According to several students, the meeting was often heated. The non-AEPi Hillel members told the fraternity that it could only help the Jewish community by leaving campus. The national stressed that they had no intention of leaving campus.\nBorison said the names of current members would not be revealed because they \"don't want to deal with this hassle.\" He stressed that \"they want to be in this fraternity\" and said the chapter should be judged on its accomplishments in the coming years."}

Tower noted plane left of course. Tower directed plane to climb and maintain 3000 feet and didn\u2019t comply. When advised to climb a second time, the pilot declared an emergency and was lost from radar shortly thereafter.\"\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has now posted a more complete report, but one which still leaves unresolved both the exact nature of Connell's emergency and the cause of the crash.\nAccording to the NTSB, Connell initially contacted air traffic control (ATC) at the Akron-Canton Airport to ask whether there were any reports of icing and was told there were none. His approach was then uneventful until ATC noted that he was left of his course and asked if he would like to be resequenced. Connell replied \"correcting.\" ATC then advised him again that he was \"well left of the localizer\" and Connell responded that he would \"like to correct.\"\nThe report continued, \"N9299N [Connell's plane] was about 2 -... miles from the airport when it then transmitted if it could execute a 360-degree turn. ATC then instructed N9299N to climb and maintain 3,000 feet and queried N9299N\u2019s present heading. N9299N transmitted, 'heading due north and climbing.' N9299N then declared an emergency.\"\nNTSB spokesperson Bridget Serchak told RAW STORY on Monday that she had spoken with Senior Air Safety Investigator Mitchell Gallo, the NTSB investigator on the case, and could confirm that \"the pilot asked for assistance landing.\"\nWhen reached by RAW STORY on Tuesday, Gallo, who had reviewed a tape of the full radio exchange, explained that the Connell had not elaborated when declaring the emergency. \"He didn't describe the nature of it,\" Gallo stated, \"but then following that ... I don't remember what the actual verbiage was ... you'd have to again refer to the actual report.\"\nThe NTSB report further cites an eyewitness who \"was outside of his home when he first heard a 'loud' engine sound from a small aircraft. The sound was coming from the north and sounded as though the pilot was trying to accelerate 'rapidly.' Suddenly, the witness saw two bright lights coming almost nose first toward the ground with the engine 'roaring.' Based upon the witness\u2019 view of the lights, he assumed the airplane was flying west to east. He lost sight of the airplane when it descended below a tree line.\"\nAccording to the witness's statement, when the plane vanished from his sight, \"I was certain it was going to crash and was actually waiting for the sound. However, once again there was a tremendous roar of the engine and I thought it was just the pilot doing a stunt over their house. It was almost instantly after I once again heard the engine that I heard the thud as it hit the ground. Approximately 1 second later, the sky became orange and there was no doubt what had happened.\""}
{"idx": "37329", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: OAKLAND, Calif. -- The score won't matter, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't.\nSure, Matthew Stafford won't play much when the Detroit Lions open the preseason on Friday night against the Oakland Raiders. Neither will a slew of other starters. And those who do play will do so in schemes that are more vanilla than a Michael Bay movie.\nBut that just leaves more opportunities for players further down the roster to shine, many of whom are locked in serious battles to make the team. Here's a look at eight players worth monitoring tonight when Detroit opens the exhibition slate in the Oakland Coliseum.\nDon't expect to see many starters for long tonight, but Ragnow could get a few extra series as Detroit prepares him for the opener. He needs the reps. He's been good in Lions camp, but imperfect. Which, you know, you'd expect from a rookie offensive lineman. He's seeing players he doesn't know making moves he's never seen. That's what happened on the first day of joint practices with Oakland, and Mario Edwards made him look silly. Then he watched the tape, chatted with coaches and returned for the second day a whole lot better. Tonight should provide him another such opportunity to pick up some experience before the games start counting.\nRudock has turned in good preseason performances each of the last two years, but will need another to maintain his grip on the No. 2 quarterback job. Rudock has been up and down throughout camp. So has his competition, Matt Cassel, for that matter. But Cassel has 13 years of NFL experience, four of which were acquired during the Bob Quinn and Matt Patricia years in New England. If neither QB separates, you have to figure Detroit opts for Cassel's experience. So Rudock has to be good in the preseason -- and to this point, he has not been good.\nPerhaps no one's stock has fallen more precipitously this offseason than Killebrew's. He looked like a promising young safety as a rookie in 2016, when he played a key role in turning around the third-down defense. Now he's hardly a safety at all. He struggled to see the field there down the stretch last season, and wasn't making any headway this offseason. So he made the move to linebacker this week, and hey, Matt Patricia does value versatility. Then again, a position change with less than a month until cuts is rarely a good sign. Expect the Lions to give him a long burn tonight to get a better evaluation of what, if anything, he can offer there.\nBob Quinn carried four undrafted roookies out of his first two training camps as Lions GM. This year, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better UDFA than Redding. Problem is, he also happens to play Detroit's deepest position. All four of last year's top receivers are back, which means there's maybe one spot left, if even that. With that said, there's no doubt Redding has been one of the most exciting young players in camp, using good speed and excellent hops to win a whole heap of downfield passes. You're definitely going to keep your eyes on No. 10 tonight.\nDarius Slay won't play more than a series at most, and Nevin Lawson missed the last day of practice with an injury. That means we're probably about to see Teez Tabor's most extensive action since last preseason."}

{"idx": "37331", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The work community or workhouse containing the industry would only make widgets now manufactured exclusively overseas, overcoming the current legal impediments to prison industries. The employer would rent space from the state or federal prison or perhaps build a separate building on or off the prison grounds to prepare for making widgets. Widget-making machinery is brought in, and it may not be the most up-to-date machinery. The proprietor of this business then hires from among the state's or federal government's inmates, choosing those it prefers without any legal concerns or restrictions, just as American businesses did 150 years ago. The wages, hours and conditions of employment are negotiated between the employer and the prospective employees and committed to writing. Employers are free to pay $1.25 per hour if prisoners will agree to work for that. There are no wage and hour legal restrictions, because prisoners don't deserve them.\nThe prison industry is completely free to negotiate with the prison authorities for food, clothing, medical care, security, guards, rent and other things. The private employer must reduce the state's correctional costs or else it cannot co-locate, hire prisoners or remain a prison industry. The company buys supplies and services from off-site free businesses and unionized labor, boosting the American economy.\nThis is not convict leasing, because prisoners can choose to remain in the general prison population or return there if they don't like making widgets in the new work community, subject to their contract of employment. By the same token, employers can send prisoners back to the general prison population for any reason or no reason, subject to the contract the parties have signed. Troublemakers get sent back early in the process. By exercising this selectivity, the employer keeps peace in the work community; prisoners prize these jobs. If the prisoner tries to escape, the prisoner's earned wages are forfeited. Fines might be imposed for other misbehavior. The longer the inmate works, the less likely the prisoner attempts escape or misbehavior. In fact, prisoners in the general prison population behave better to improve their chances of obtaining one of the better private jobs.\nPayment of wages is not to the prisoner directly, but instead into a special trust account managed by the employer, with some oversight by prison authorities. Deductions can be made for child support, crime victim restitution or for room and board at the prison. At the end of the prisoner's sentence, the prisoner has learned to work hard and receives the balance in his or her trust account, a nest egg or \"freedom dues\" as indentured servants were paid in the colonial era. For those serving life without parole or very long sentences, their earnings permit them to enjoy some luxury items.\nThe employer makes sure the work community is a better environment than the general prison population. The work community is safe. A moral atmosphere is encouraged and enforced. Family and friends are welcomed and attracted. Inmates must abandon gang and criminal activities and help stop fights. When religious organizations run these communities, attendance at religious services can be mandated or heavily encouraged. Prisoners can have a weekly party, dance or get-together and music is encouraged. The food, rooms, yards and exercise facilities are superior to what they had in the regular prison. OSHA is enforced for the sake of industrial safety.\nExcept for repairs or planned outages, prisoners run the widget-making machinery 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 52 weeks every year. Each prisoner is working up to 60 hours per week, which is easier to do without commutes, family activities and the other distractions of life among the free.

He knew that in the epicenter of Trump country, his supporters would not realize that they themselves favor the major liberal policies concerning health care, taxation, the environment, infrastructure, and education.\nBarr knows that code words like \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cthe wall,\u201d \u201ctaxation,\u201d \u201cObama,\u201d and \u201cPelosi\u201d will work their magic with his close-minded and politically inert supporters.

Few of them are open to the appeals of even the most civic-minded, honest, dedicated politicians such as McGrath. Few of them are bothered by Barr\u2019s subservience to the banking industry, including payday lenders.\nAnd yet McGrath did make a difference in 2018. For the first time since Barr won office, the Sixth District had a competitive race, so competitive that Barr was forced into disgracing himself by the vile ads that defined his campaign.

First off was Andrew Kershaw in the first race of the day for Under 15 Boys. Andrew ran extremely well to finish 29th of 118 finishers in 16:29 for the 4.25 km.\nAs a first year Under-15, this was a very encouraging performance and leaves him nicely poised for a top ten slot next year.\nEllie Roberts is also a first year Under -15 and finished strongly in her race, 62nd of 143 in 19:52 for her 4.25 km. Again, a good result and gives confidence for a return as a final year under-15.\nIn the Junior Men&apos;s race both Patrick and Joe Vis were running. In a field of 76 completing the 8.2 km course, it was Patrick who emerged in front of Joe, finishing 26th in 29:16. Joe was 36th in 29:43, both doing very well against local rivals.\nFinally, we had just one runner in the Senior Men&apos;s race, the mass start of which is one of the most memorable sights of these championships.

The company has assembled a so-called \u201cworld-class counsel\u201d of compliance experts to provide the Commerce Department additional information about its recent steps to comply with export regulations.\nUnfortunately, it will be difficult to convince U.S. regulators to lift the export ban, considering ZTE\u2019s pattern of deceptive behavior, including a series of false statements spanning years, and a history of ignoring U.S. compliance rules, which includes knowingly selling prohibited items to Iran and North Korea.\nWhile ZTE has many markets beyond the U.S., export limits will prevent ZTE from making anything anywhere that contains U.S. products. This is a major problem considering some critical products such as processors and modem chips are made by American companies. Even worse, rumors are circulating that Google may cancel ZTE\u2019s license to use Android, which could prevent ZTE from continuing as mobile technology company.\nIt\u2019s likely ZTE\u2019s only chance at a pardon is by making a case that U.S. companies will be hurt by the ban.

The Rockies are enjoying their early-season gold rush so much that they may redraw the blueprints for the new stadium that is going to be built for the team.\nCoors Field was going to be a cozy little place that held 43,500 fans, but the attendance explosion may force planners to increase capacity to as much as 50,000.

Despite strong performances by junior shortstop Marshall Yanzick and freshman third baseman Ben Swinford, who both had three hits, Yale\u2019s power at the plate and on the mound proved too much for the struggling Red. On Sunday, the offense finally came alive to earn the Red its first win in Ivy League play, as Cornell split its home series against Brown. After dropping the first game by a narrow margin, 5-2, the Red exploded for a season-best 13 runs for its first victory since March 25, keyed by an eight-run sixth inning, 13-8.\nIn game one of the series against Yale (12-10, 2-2 Ivy League), senior starting pitcher Jadd Schmeltzer took the loss, giving up five runs on eight hits and five walks. Despite striking out eight batters, Schmeltzer was pulled in the fifth inning after the Bulldogs regained the lead with a sacrifice fly that scored the eventual game-winning run.\nGame two proved just as frustrating for the Red as Yale jumped out early, scoring a pair of runs in both the first and second innings to take a commanding lead, 4-0. Although the Red (3-17, 1-3) decreased the deficit to two runs with a homerun over the left field wall by junior outfielder Brian Billigen, Yale never looked back and won the game, 5-3, after Eric Shultz shut the door for his third save of the season.\nThe Red hoped to implement this strategy when it faced Brown (3-15, 1-3) in a doubleheader on Sunday. In the first game, Cornell took the lead on a double by Billigen that one-hopped the wall in left, who later came around to score the first run of the game. Senior starting pitcher Corey Pappel began to struggle in the seventh inning, giving up a homerun that would ultimately be the difference in the game. The Red went down in order in the bottom of the seventh to close out the inning, as Brown broke the tie and secured the win, 5-2.\nThe second game against Brown developed much differently and finally showed the raw power that the lineup can produce for the Red. After Brown expanded its lead to 7-5 in the sixth inning, the Cornell offense exploded. The inning began with a single by senior catcher Mike Lopez, followed by a base hit from Yanzick that sent Lopez to third. With runners on the corners and one out, senior first baseman Mickey Brodsky stepped up to the plate and ripped a blast that cleared the batting cages beyond left. This would spark the bats for the Red, who would ultimately score a whopping eight runs in the inning.\nCornell closes out the six-game home stand on Wednesday when it plays host to Binghamton in a 3 p.m. contest at Hoy Field."}

Developers say it would be one of the most expensive residential buildings in the West.\nThe $400-million tower along one of the area's toniest corridors would be the first building in California designed by renowned Paris architect Jean Nouvel, known for his daring designs. He is proposing a narrow glass structure with sweeping views through the building and extensive greenery ringing each floor.\nThe developer predicts the project will attract European and Asian globe-trotters as well as local empty-nesters ready to move from sprawling Westside mansions to roomy condominiums complete with concierge services, a private club, first-run movie screenings and valet parking.\nEven at a time of economic uncertainty -- when Southern California employers are trimming payrolls, stock prices are falling and home values are dropping -- the demand for luxury housing continues nearly unabated in the Westside. And with it has come more traffic and growing homeowner resentment about construction and congestion.\nPrices have not been set for the proposed condos at 10000 Santa Monica Blvd. But units in the ultra-luxury Century tower being built in nearby Century City are being offered at a range of $3.2 million to $30 million, and the Nouvel condos are expected to be even more pricey.\nTwo top-drawer projects are also being planned around the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards in Beverly Hills.

He called current defensive postures a patchwork of point solutions and regulatory-based policies that need to be replaced with actionable intelligence.\nRSA had a share of security hell when its systems were breached last year in a high-profile attack that resulted in the loss of some critical information about its security tools. \u201cWe hope that the attack on us will strengthen the sense of urgency and resolve for all of us,\u201d Coviello said.\nThat resolve will be required to enable the data sharing needed to create actionable security intelligence. \u201cThe age of big data has arrived in security,\u201d Coviello said.\nMaking use of that data remains a challenge, said Scott Charney, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of Trustworthy Computing. \u201cThe problem is we have too much security data and we don\u2019t know what to make of it,\u201d he said at the conference. He added that the emergence of cloud computing could help in gathering analyzing that data to provide actionable intelligence.\nRight now the bad guys are outpacing the security and IT industries with their flexible, cooperative models of operations. Security analysts need to adopt an offensive mindset in sharing and using data, Coviello said. He said there have been promising developments with the evolution of grassroots information-sharing networks.\nCharney, in outlining advances made over the past decade at Microsoft in its Trustworthy Computing Initiative, laid out a similar vision in his look ahead at the future of the initiative. The future of security and privacy in a world in which vulnerabilities and exploits are inevitable lies in protecting data through the use of metadata associated with policies that will let creators and owners control data, he said.\nThe growth and change in security challenges facing the IT industry come at a time when cybersecurity is more important than ever, Coviello said.\nThat risk is increasing because of the slow response of the IT industry and its inability to act together, he warned."}

School leaders have called it an \"experiment\" that they anticipated would benefit the high school's science, technology, engineering and math-oriented students.\nBut university leaders have questioned whether their students are benefiting from the arrangement.\nSince the high school's first semester, there's been tension over the presence of eStem students on the university's campus, and late last month university student leaders began circulating a petition urging UALR administrators to address the situation.\nThe problems, university students say, include a \"high school atmosphere\" on campus. The petition had 1,200 signatures as of Wednesday.\nThe high school students are confined to the high school and various spots in UALR's Donaghey Student Center, where they eat lunch.\nUALR Chancellor Andrew Rogerson told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Friday afternoon that he has an alternate site on campus that he believes could accommodate eStem's three lunchtime rotations of roughly 175 students.\nHe declined to name the site, saying he had yet to mention the suggestion to students or reach an agreement with eStem officials on using it. It is near the eStem school, Rogerson said, adding that it would not need to be renovated, is not an entire building and is not empty.\nRecords requests for communications with eStem officials regarding the high school's campus did not yield any documents about other buildings. Officials recently scrapped hopes of renovating University Plaza, the university-owned shopping center on the south part of the campus, as a place for eStem students to eat lunches, after the officials learned what it would cost to modify the site to meet fire codes.\nAfter saying just more than a week ago that he believed the arrangement between the university and eStem was \"failing in its current form,\" Rogerson said Friday that he was optimistic about reaching a short-term agreement to accommodate eStem students for lunchtime and after school for the next two school years.\n\"The campus knows we are trying to find a place to put them, which is going to keep them [eStem students] out of the student center,\" Rogerson said. \"And that's for the benefit of both institutions. It's not that we're trying to get rid of eStem. It's just too many people trying to eat in a facility that cannot handle my students and their students.\"\nJohn Bacon, chief executive officer of eStem Public Charter Schools, could not be reached by email or phone Friday.\nFinding space on campus for the high school students coincides with enrollment drops at the university, which is attempting to boost its enrollment to 15,000 students by 2022.\nUALR's enrollment was 10,525 students last fall, down 15 percent from five years earlier. As of Oct. 1, eStem had 506 students enrolled.\n"}

I don\u2019t mean being male, or being mentally disturbed, or having been cruel to women, or living in places like the United States where it\u2019s easy to acquire weapons of war. These and many other factors are very significant and very often discussed, as they should be, when we consider mass killings.\nThere\u2019s something else that ties a lot of mass killers together, and it\u2019s also obvious, but seldom discussed. The man who killed with a van in Toronto had been briefly in the Canadian military and promoted his crime on Facebook beforehand as a military operation. The same day he killed in Toronto, the G7 countries were meeting at the University of Toronto and declaring their unified hostility toward Russia. The mass killing on Toronto\u2019s streets sought to solve problems in the same way that the Canadian government and its allies seek to solve problems.\nThe recent mass-killing in a Florida High School was also promoted by the killer as a military operation, in the sense that he wore his JROTC (Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps) shirt and killed in the same school where the U.S. Army had trained him to shoot and instructed him in war-supporting views of the world and its history.\nWhy should anyone notice such points or generalize from them? Don\u2019t members of militaries and veterans have it hard enough already without such gross bigotry?\nThere\u2019s actually no need to generalize. Looking at a long list of mass shootings in the United States, almost all of the shooters are men, and almost all of them are between ages 18 and 59. Above age 59, the percentage of men in the general U.S. population who are veterans leaps up dramatically. Between 18 and 59 \u2014 by averaging the percentages for each age year \u2014 about 14.76 percent of U.S. men are veterans, but at least 35% of these shooters were veterans. I determined that by quickly reading available news reports online about each shooting, so the percentage is likely to be significantly higher. I found no news reports that stated that any of the shooters had not been in the military.\nOf course it\u2019s possible that people inclined toward mass shootings are also inclined to join the military, that the relationship is a correlation and not a cause. In fact, I would be shocked if there wasn\u2019t some truth to that. But it\u2019s also possible that being trained and conditioned and given a familiarity with mass shootings \u2014 and in some cases no doubt an experience of engaging in mass shooting and having it deemed acceptable \u2014 makes one more likely to mass shoot. I cannot imagine there isn\u2019t truth in that.\nThe most killing Western societies do is done abroad by their militaries. In the United States, hundreds of deadly shootings every year are committed by police officers \u2014 disproportionately military veterans. Suicides, as well, are disproportionately committed by veterans. And not because we are untactful in pointing to problems, but because we generally fail to admit to and deal with problems. Veteran suicides are driven by guilt over having participated in killing. That guilt is the top factor in predicting suicide, according to the U.S. Veterans Administration.\nMilitarism will continue to cause extensive damage until we shift our culture to nonviolence. That shift needs to include our governments, and it needs to treat the illness, not just its symptoms. The answer to gun violence is not more guns any more than the answer to van violence is more vans. I hope that seems obvious. It should.\nThis article was"}

They feature women with osteoporosis who are longing to play with their grandkids or meet up with friends for a game of tennis, but are hindered by their fragile, weakened bones.\nThe message they send teaches that, by taking proper care of oneself, this potentially harmful disease can be prevented. But with 10 million Americans currently affected by osteoporosis and another 34 million at high risk for developing the disease, the numbers suggest that many Americans are unaware of how osteoporosis occurs and how people can protect their bodies from excessive bone loss.\nSo, how does a person lose bone mass?\nDuring childhood, adolescence and even early adulthood, our bones are continuously developing and bone mass gradually builds with the help of estrogen or testosterone hormones in our bodies. However, once we reach middle age or menopause for women, our bodies produce less of these hormones, triggering a rapid loss in our bone mass (particularly for women) that lasts five to seven years after menopause. This post-menopausal bone loss directly accounts for the high proportion of women with osteoporosis today.\nWhat are the dangers of osteoporosis?\nBecause people with osteoporosis have compromised bones, they are more susceptible to chronic fractures from the simplest of movements, such as a hug or a cough. Commonly, breaks attributed to osteoporosis are the result of falls, but they also can happen spontaneously, according to www.womenshealthmatters.ca. The most common injuries for someone with osteoporosis are spinal or hip fractures. Both are very serious injuries that can lead to further complications or very long recoveries requiring physical therapy.\nWho is at risk for developing osteoporosis?\nAccording to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, there are a clear set of factors that put a person at risk for developing osteoporosis. The list includes: women who are post-menopausal, those of Caucasian or Asian descent, anyone with a family history of osteoporosis or easily broken bones, those who do not consume enough calcium or vitamin D, people who do not exercise regularly, and anyone with a low bone mass per a bone density test.\nCan anything be done to prevent osteoporosis?\nBeing at risk for osteoporosis does not mean that one is certain to develop the disease. To the contrary, some of the risk factors mentioned are within a person\ufffds control to change. By increasing the amount of calcium or vitamin D in one\ufffds diet and by adopting a regular exercise routine as simple as walking, jogging or dancing, a person can reduce his or her likelihood of osteoporosis. Also, because tobacco and alcohol are harmful to bones, it is to one\ufffds benefit to limit or abstain completely from these substances.\nAnyone age 50 and above, or those who believe they are at risk for osteoporosis, should ask their doctor about bone density testing. This painless exam entails simple X-rays of the hip and lumbar vertebrae in the spine, which are then examined to measure the bones\ufffd thickness. Having a test performed at age 50 provides physicians with a baseline to compare future exams against and chart any changes in bone mass.\nWhile statistics show that millions of women are at a great risk for developing osteoporosis, proper diet and exercise are preventative measures one can take to ensure strong, healthy bones, and bone density"}

Because there are so many specific requirements for your passport photo, some businesses specialize in taking these portraits -- it is not recommended that you attempt to take the photo yourself. For example, it must be a color photo taken within the past six months, and it must be 2-by-2 inches. Your head must be centered in the frame at a certain size, and you must wear a neutral expression on your face. Check with the location where you are applying for your passport, because some of them -- certain U.S. post offices, for example -- will take your photo on the spot for a fee.\nGo to a passport acceptance facility with your documents.

The time that it takes for your passport application to process varies, but is generally at least a few weeks. Paying extra for expedited service cuts the wait time in half, but may still leave you waiting over a week. If you need your passport within 14 days, the U.S. Department of State recommends making an appointment at a passport agency.

Flame, which has some code in common with Stuxnet and was apparently developed five years ago (making it the older of the two), is extraordinarily complex. It can \u201cactivate computer microphones and cameras, log keyboard strokes, take screen shots, extract geolocation data from images, and send and receive commands and data through Bluetooth wireless technology.\u201d It replicates and spreads itself across networks and hides as an anodyne-looking software update.\nWhether this is true, we can\u2019t really know\u2014at least not until the next Kaspersky Labs report or the next controlled leak. Still, it\u2019s fair to assume, based on what we\u2019ve learned about Stuxnet and Flame, and about the resources being devoted to cyberwarfare by the NSA, CIA, Mossad, and related entities, that this isn\u2019t the end of the line for Western cyber-espionage against Iran.\nEven so, one would think that the Obama administration isn\u2019t happy that the Iranians discovered this sophisticated, resource-intensive piece of malware, even if there are other such weapons in reserve. And reading between the lines of the Post\u2019s report, you can detect some notes of displeasure. For example, the article claims that Flame was discovered by Iran based on a series of attacks against the oil industry that Israel directed without consulting their American partners. This fits the traditional narrative that the Americans and Israelis are enthusiastic partners, but the Israelis tend to go off the reservation and do things without telling their Yankee friends.\nAll of this makes for a fascinating installment in the sub-Ludlum tale that is American-Israeli cyber-espionage. And for America\u2019s politicians\u2014who care more about apportioning credit and blame than most anything else\u2014this latest report will surely feed into the nascent investigation into classified leaks, rather than cause any concerted debate over the consequences of this still untested form of warfare."}

BookGlutton, a site that launched last year, has put 1,660 books online and created tools that let readers form groups to discuss their favorite titles. Meanwhile, Bob Stein, an e-publishing veteran from the CD-ROM days, put the Doris Lessing book The Golden Notebook online with an elegant commenting system and hired seven writers to collaboratively read it.\nNeither move should come as a surprise. Books have a centuries-old tradition of annotation and commentary, ranging from the Talmud and scholarly criticism to book clubs and marginalia. Stein believes that if books were set free digitally, it could produce a class of \"professional readers\"\u2014people so insightful that you'd pay to download their footnotes. Sound unlikely? It already exists in the real world: Microsoft researcher Cathy Marshall has found that university students carefully study used textbooks before buying them, because they want to acquire the smartest notes.\nThe technology is here. Book nerds are now working on XML-like markup languages that would allow for really terrific linking and mashups. Imagine a world where there's a URL for every chapter and paragraph in a book\u2014every sentence, even. Readers could point to their favorite sections in a MySpace update or instant message or respond to an argument by copiously linking to the smartest passages in a recent best seller.\nThis would massively improve what bibliophiles call book discovery. You're far more likely to hear about a book if a friend has highlighted a couple brilliant sentences in a Facebook update\u2014and if you hear about it, you're far more likely to buy it in print.

{"idx": "37388", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Washington's three-game road tour through Western Canada got off to a dismal start on Thursday night in Vancouver with a 6-2 loss to the Canucks. The Caps were never really in this one; they generated little in the way of a threatening offensive attack while Vancouver had all the offense it would need before the first period was over.\nWhen the Canucks scored their third goal of the first period at 18:43 of the first, the Caps were still stuck on three shots on net, having gone nearly 11 minutes without one in the middle of the period. Five of the six Vancouver goals in the game came from less than 20 feet away. The longest of the six came from 22 feet, and if you laid all six of them end to end, you'd use less than half the length of the ice (85 feet) and exactly the width of the ice.\nBy contrast, Washington didn't manage a shot on net from inside 20 feet until after the midpoint of the contest, by which time the Capitals were in a four-goal ditch at 4-0. Devante Smith-Pelly's shot from 16 feet out came at 10:43 of the second, the first Washington shot of the night from that close to the cage.\nWashington was playing without Nicklas Backstrom because of an illness that hit the sublime center on Thursday morning. Backstrom, who has played every game in seven of his 11 seasons in the league, missed his first game of 2017-18. His absence made the Caps an easier team to defend; Alex Ovechkin didn't have a shot attempt until the fifth minute of the second period and didn't have a shot on goal until the 16th minute of the middle frame. Ovechkin's first shot on net produced a rebound, and linemate Evgeny Kuznetsov scored the Caps' first goal of the game on that rebound a second later.\nThe loss leaves the Caps at 4-5-1, and for the first time this season, they are south of what passes for the .500 line in the modern NHL. It's the Capitals' worst start since 2012-13, when they opened that lockout-abbreviated campaign with a 2-7-1 record after 10 games.\nDouble Whammy - Special teams have been a Washington strong point throughout most of the Barry Trotz administration, but the Caps' last two games have been sorely lacking in that regard.\nIn Saturday's 4-1 loss to Florida, the Caps were 0-for-4 on the power play (they also permitted a shorthanded goal) and they were 4-for-6 on the penalty kill. The three special teams goals surrendered in that contest were also the difference in the game.\nOn Thursday in Vancouver, the Caps again were blanked with the extra man, and they once again surrendered multiple goals (three of them) on the penalty kill. This marks the first time in nearly six years that the Caps endured consecutive games in which they were shut down on the power play and they yielded multiple power-play goals in the same contest.\nThe last time the Caps suffered that indignity was Nov. 17-19, 2011 in back-to-back losses at Winnipeg and at Toronto, respectively. The Caps were 0-for-5 with the extra man and they were 3-for-5 on the kill in a 4-1 loss"}

Others don't like that another piece of Naples' history will be lost.\n\"It's sad to lose some of the charm of Naples, but at the same time I think it's part of the expanding and growing image of Collier County,\" said Jack Wert, the county's tourism director.\nThe two-star motel \u2014 at 82 Ninth St. S. \u2014 recently sold for $4.9 million.

The property wasn't listed for sale, but the agent and broker saw it as an ideal redevelopment opportunity for their investor clients.\n\"It kind of stands on its own as a redevelopment project, and it's going to be retail,\" Carroll said.\nThere's a vision to attract a \"great variety of retailers\" to the property, he said.\n\"We want to bring something that's new and fresh to the area,\" Carroll said.\nWhile some of the area's hotels took a beating from Hurricane Irma in September, the Sea Shell fared OK and was \"up and operating until the day we closed on it,\" Carroll said.\nRandy Smith, president of the Collier County Lodging & Tourism Alliance, said most of the smaller hotels like Sea Shell are doing well, but many are operating as brand names, not independents like it did.\n\"They do have a good location,\" he said. \"So I\"m sure their property is worth some nice money. So maybe that was the decision. The property value was just worth more.\"\nOverall, he said demand and room rates remain strong in the Naples area, \"so hotels are doing well.\"\nAs for losing a bit of history with the teardown, Smith said he was OK with it.\n\"I see that point of view,\" he said. \"I'm"}

Republican leaders in Congress say they are considering what course of action to take if the president announces an executive order that could shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.\nSpeaking at a news conference Friday in Myanmar, the president struck a defiant tone when asked about multiple U.S. media reports he may be planning to take sweeping executive action on immigration reform as early as next week.\n\u201cAnd I indicated to Speaker Boehner several months ago that, if in fact, Congress failed to act I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better. And that is going to happen. That is going to happen before the end of the year,\u201d said Obama.\nThe president said he has given the Republican-led House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner more than one year to take action. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation in June 2013, but the House has not taken up the issue.\nBoehner and other Republican lawmakers say the president would be going beyond his constitutional authority if he uses executive action to radically shift the focus of immigration authorities to grant what they call \u201camnesty\u201d to millions of undocumented immigrants. Media reports cite administration officials, saying the plan could shield from deportation up to 5 million undocumented people who are the parents of U.S. citizen children or legal residents.\n\"We are going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path. This is the wrong way to govern,\" said Boehner at a news conference Thursday.\nCongress has to approve a spending bill by December 11 to keep the U.S. government running. Boehner refused to say whether he would link the spending bill to the immigration issue, although he did say it is not Republicans\u2019 goal to trigger another partial government shutdown like the one in 2013.\n\"All options are on the table,\u201d said Boehner.\nSome analysts say the White House likely has not yet decided whether to announce an executive order on immigration shortly or wait to act until after Congress has passed a spending bill next month.\nRepublicans on the Senate side also are vowing to take action to prevent the president from taking broad unilateral action. Republicans won control of the chamber in November elections, meaning the president will face even stronger Republican opposition in Congress starting in January.\nMeanwhile, the White House announced a plan to grant refugee status in the U.S. to certain children living in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nVice President Joe Biden announced the new program Friday at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington.\nHe said it gives those seeking asylum \"a right way\" to come to the U.S., instead of making the dangerous trek north through Mexico and crossing the border illegally.\nUnder the plan, those 21 years old and younger with at least one parent who is a legal resident of the U.S. can qualify.\nImmigration and the best way to reform the system became a major issue in the United States this year when thousands of children from Central America, with no hope for a better life at home, illegally entered the U.S. to escape gang violence and poverty.\nImmigrant rights advocates say they should be allowed to stay, while opponents say that would be unfair to the millions of immigrants who waited their turn"}

Loopt will be available free in the App Store.\nTypePad's iPhone client also made its debut today, featuring a demo of its blogging capabilities. The client will be free and allows users to create new blog posts and snap pictures with the iPhone camera to immediately upload them. TypePad will also be available for free.\nA particularly compelling app comes from the Associated Press. Called \"Mobile News Network,\" users can view the AP's award-winning photography and send breaking news directly to the AP. Users can also view a map of where news is happening in their area, bringing the new location-based services trend to news on the iPhone. Mobile News Network will also be free.\nOther games were demoed, including a few we already saw back in March, as well as Enigmo, a port of Pangea Software's killer Mac puzzle game. I'm particularly jazzed for this one, as I own licenses for both Enigmo 1 and 2, I and can't wait to bring it with me in my pocket. Enigmo, as well as CroMag Rally, will be sold for $9.99 each.\nThe MLB is also on board the iPhone app train now. An MLB.com app was demoed on stage that lets users see game scores, stats, and even play clips that appear right after the play, not just after the game finishes.\nA couple of medical apps were also demonstrated, the first being a human biological reference guide aimed at students called Modality. Users can track down regions of the body and easily zoom and pan across hundreds of anatomical images. The next app, called MIMvista, is geared for doctors and patients to share medical info and images, boasting information sharing directly between two iPhones.\nLast but not least of the actual software demoed on stage is Crom, a game that pushes the iPhone's accelerometer and OpenGL support for a full 3D adventure game. Crom should be available in September.\nOne final Touch OS-related announcement should turn those frowns on the faces of \"I want my background apps!\" critics upside down.

{"idx": "37409", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Archbishop Justin Welby\u2019s statement to the Christian radio station Premier that he talks in tongues every morning is an appeal using one of the clearest markers to his evangelical tribe. Talking in tongues is a streaming babble of nonsense syllables delivered with a curious calm authority, as if what the speaker were saying made incontrovertible sense, even though it contains no recognisable words. It sound like what it probably is, the spontaneous operation of the speech-producing parts of the brain when they are completely decoupled from the bits that handle language and thought.\nFor believers, it is a priceless expression of the presence of the holy spirit. It is mentioned in the New Testament, and has been the defining feature of the charismatic movement, which was the major development of Christianity in the last century.\nIt is certainly what saved evangelical Christianity in Britain from the extinction that swallowed most traditional protestant churches in the past 50 years. When Christian doctrine makes no sense in the modern world, a retreat into nonsense may be the only way to save it.\nSpeaking in tongues is not hard to do if you want to, and find yourself among people who do it themselves and expect others to. Perhaps the most intensive instruction is provided by the Alpha course, invented in Welby\u2019s home church, Holy Trinity Brompton in London; there, on the sixth weekend, the participants are taken away to a residential retreat and most find themselves praying in tongues.\nSomeone as driven and disciplined as the daytime Welby might find in early morning babbling in the dark a deeply needed psychological relief. Permission from God to stand at ease must give a wonderful feeling of security. A friend of mine who was a missionary in her youth still remembers with joy the experience of God, as she felt it, praying through her as she sang in tongues at Taiz\u00e9.\nWhat is more weird is the notion Welby mentioned of \u201cwords of knowledge\u201d \u2013 little nuggets of prophecy direct from God that work their way to the surface of the world like meteorites appearing from under the Antarctic ice fields. Prophecies have traditionally been one of the main forms of psychological manipulation within the movement. Charismatic leaders can use them to push their followers in desired directions; even more clearly than public, performative prayer, they can be used to get across messages that the messenger would not wish to stand behind.\nIt is hardly surprising that the first records of charismatic phenomena in the New Testament are contemporaneous with St Paul\u2019s efforts in his letters to calm down all the excitement, and to insist that the people who had the visions were not also those who got to pronounce on their significance and meaning.\nAgain, the underlying phenomenon is remarkably common and the ability can be trained. Professor Tanya Luhrman\u2019s wonderful book When God Talks Back, about her experience as an anthropologist in a charismatic church, describes how members there were encouraged to treat God as an invisible friend: pouring a second cup of coffee for him at a break, and so on. For people with a particular character trait, measured on the Tellegen absorption scale \u2013 which is, roughly speaking, the ability to climb aboard a train of thought and have it carry you far from the everyday world \u2013 this kind of practice can lead to a constant sense of supernaturalism in the world.\nWelby rather wisely sidestepped the question of whether God talked to him as well as to some of his correspondents. His listeners on the evangelical radio will have taken it for granted, but no one in the outside world wants an archbishop who takes directions from God. That is altogether too much like"}

It is standard for ridding lakes of alien fish.\nTerri Thomas, the Presidio\u2019s director of conservation, said workers will apply 47 gallons of the product in a 5 percent solution in liquid form at Mountain Lake during a single day in mid-November.\nThe workers will spray the compound into the water at strategic points amid the tules around the lake shore, while two others aboard a small boat equipped with hoses will pump the liquid into the deeper waters.\nAlthough all traces of rotenone disappear from water in less than three days, Thomas said, the lake will be completely fenced and inaccessible for up to three weeks after the application. He added the lake also will be fenced off two days before it begins.\nThe Presidio\u2019s goal is to transform the lake\u2019s once-fouled waters and its shores into a protected habitat \u2014 hopefully filled with many of the same plants and animals that the Ohlone Indians and early European settlers knew centuries ago.\nThe lake has been dredged, deepened and purified to drinking water standards. Presidio botanists, together with hundreds of volunteers, have been planting native vegetation on the lake\u2019s shores and under the water, where it can serve as food and habitat for transplanted native wildlife.\nFor many years San Franciscans have used Mountain Lake as a dumping spot for unwanted aquatic pets. Their tiny goldfish have grown into huge voracious carp that now disrupt the lake bottom and forage on bottom sediments so that natural aquatic plants cannot grow.\nInvasive turtles, once happy in home aquariums, are now big invaders that prevent the native western pond species from establishing themselves in the lake.\nTo prevent future dumping, conservation workers plan a long public education campaign. In addition, wildlife ecologist Jonathan Young said an \u201camnesty station\u201d will be established so that people with unwanted aquatic pets can deposit them in a special lake shore tank.

As the non-commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC), she ran our chapel business at a mile-a-minute, coordinating chaplain appointments, keeping our books and arranging our chapel for worship.

We\u2019re hoping the neighbor has a better way to design the fence and will help rebuild it. Maybe we even hope that we won\u2019t have to deal with the fence today.\nLike some of you, I think this is the best approach to fence building. That\u2019s because I believe our task must always be people. Folks like me believe our job is best accomplished through the good relationships we maintain with our colleagues, neighbors and coworkers.\nThere are others, like my staff sergeant, who can\u2019t find time for people until their job is thoroughly finished. They won\u2019t have time for the sociable neighbor until their fence is stained and the brushes cleaned.\nAfter all, if they don't get their fence fixed, their dog will run off, burglars will have a nonstop path to their back door and the homeowners association will cite them. They will, one day, welcome the neighbor, but only by invitation.\nSo, back at the base, who was right? Me, the people-person?

They take no responsibility for the additional fees - blaming the fee entirely on MP Gordon Brown. The email is very unprofessional - no offer of further information, no option to cancel flight for a refund, no link to a customer service page or a contact number. Instead an email address to the government ministers to complain about Gordon Brown is provided.\nCalling their support number (at 10p/min) will get you into a long queue with no help or alternatives offered by the representatives when you get through.\nWhen I finally did get through I spoke to a rep called \"Anna\" and requested my flight be cancelled and I be refunded.

The veteran commentator has not been seen since.\nWhile Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance is a crippling personal loss for Cengiz, it also threatens to undermine the close relationship between Washington and Riyadh that has developed under the Trump administration, in part at the instigation of president Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nThe story has been gathering steam in the United States since the Washington Post carried a blank space where Khashoggi\u2019s regular column was supposed to appear on October 4th.\nEven amidst the relentless news cycle that has become a hallmark of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the story of the missing Saudi journalist stuck. By the end of last week it was becoming clear that Trump had to comment on the matter.\nAsked to do so by reporters travelling with him to Ohio last Thursday, the US president said it was a \u201cvery serious thing\u201d, but he added that questionable human rights records were overlooked in many countries.\nSince then, he has flip-flopped on his response to the disappearance. In an interview with CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes show, he warned of \u201csevere punishment\u201d if Saudi Arabia was found to be involved in Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. His comments prompted a stern rebuke from the kingdom, which vowed to retaliate with \u201cgreater action\u201d if the US administration sought to punish it.\nBut in the same interview Trump played down expectations that he would halt a $110 billion (\u20ac95 billion) arms deal with the Saudis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt jobs. I don\u2019t want to lose an order like that,\u201d he said, referring to last year\u2019s promise by Riyadh to buy billions of dollars worth of military equipment, adding that \u201cthere are other ways of punishing\u201d.\nSeveral times over the past few days Trump has cited the fact that Khashoggi is not a US citizen, suggesting that the US has limited responsibility for the missing man, who was a resident of the United States.\nOn Monday Trump suggested to reporters that \u201crogue killers\u201d could be responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance \u2013 giving a potential out to the Saudi regime, which has vehemently denied any involvement with the disappearance, a position reiterated by King Salman during a 20-minute phone call with the US president on Monday.\nTrump\u2019s equivocation on the issue has given fuel to his critics, who have consistently highlighted the US president\u2019s apparent willingness to engage with autocratic regimes with poor human rights records such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the Philippines.\nHis comments on Monday that the Saudis \u201cdeny any knowledge\u201d of the disappearance and his apparent acceptance of the improbable theory that \u201crogue killers\u201d could be to blame have echoes of his approach to Russian president Vladimir Putin, when he took at face value Putin\u2019s denial of electoral interference despite the findings of his own intelligence services.\nAs a steady stream of prominent business leaders and companies pulled out of a high-level investment conference in Riyadh scheduled for next week, it remained unclear on Monday night if US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin would attend as planned.\nWhile Trump may prefer to look"}

Since announcing ARKit last year, the tech giant has hardly been sheepish about its belief in AR\u2019s potential.\n\u201cI think AR is big and profound,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any sector or industry that will be untouched by AR,\u201d he told Vogue.\n\u201cI think AR is that big, it\u2019s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives,\u201d he told The Independent.\nBehind a lot of that talk is belief in the tech\u2019s utility down the road, but until Apple is ready to experimenting with AR tech in core iOS features, all of the chatter around AR having plenty of utility today feels a bit half-hearted. I\u2019ll be very interested to see if the company announces any AR integrations in iOS 12 tomorrow that add new utility or if Animojis are still about as far as they\u2019re willing to go.\nWhile nearly every major tech company spent 2017 opining about the potential of AR, there still doesn\u2019t seem to be much that consumers can show for it. Google made a few interesting announcements surrounding the technology at its I/O conference last month, most fascinating was an AR walking mode being tested for Google Maps. Apple Maps is in desperate need of an upgrade and it makes sense for that to be the starting point for where its integrations begin.\nAR is definitely one of Apple\u2019s longer term investments, but it\u2019s also one that may not see much payoff in the short term.\nWhile Apple has been content to let many of their long-term bets iterate through awkward phases underground in the R&D labs, ARKit has been thrust onto hundreds of millions of devices while still in that odd, what-are-we-supposed-to-do-with-this stage. AR is more broadly one of those unique scenarios where everyone can imagine a potential end-case, it\u2019s how it gets there that\u2019s the head-scratcher and Apple seems to need developers to take on the risk of experimenting.\nAt Apple\u2019s developer conference keynote tomorrow, the company seems poised to showcase new developments for its ARKit augmented reality platform. Chief on the list of expected upgrades (via Reuters) is a system of sharing coordinated point clouds between phones so that multiple users can run AR apps in a shared experience, aka AR multiplayer.\nWhere Apple will definitely highlight ARKit\u2019s potential is in the gaming sector. Gaming has always been more-engaging with multi-player, but how that really looks with augmented reality is anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s been two years since Pok\u00e9mon GO was released and for all of the attention that title received, it isn\u2019t entirely clear how AR capabilities contributed to its success.\nGames that integrate a multiplayer ARKit are going to have to make a lot of discoveries on their own. Playing games with friends in AR will gain a hyper-local edge but will lose much of the freedom offered by online gameplay in terms of connecting gamers seamlessly. There are countless other UX questions that will also still need to be experimented with.\nAugmented reality is a truly exciting technology and Apple\u2019s efforts to lead the pack in building developer support has built up a lot of initial enthusiasm from that crowd, but to keep that excitement Apple\u2019s going to need to start proving out some of those use cases for users on their own and put its big bet deeper into users\u2019 daily"}

They\u2019re the ones who put the ball in the end zone.\nThat\u2019s why Rams running back Todd Gurley\u2019s poor performance Sunday against Chicago seemed so shocking. Gurley, who entered the game as the NFL\u2019s leading rusher, got bottled early by a strong Chicago defensive front and finished with 28 yards on 11 carries in a 15-6 defeat. He also did not reach the end zone, which is the most surprising of all.\nGurley, coming off an extraordinary 2017 season in which he totaled a league-high 19 touchdowns in 15 games, already has matched that total this season. Gurley entered Sunday\u2019s game, his 13th of the season, with 15 rushing touchdowns and four receiving scores.\nGurley, who won NFL offensive player of the year honors last season, also seemed on pace to exceed last season\u2019s league-leading total of 2,093 yards from scrimmage. Gurley\u2019s profile has been lower this season, in part because of the Rams\u2019 stellar passing game, but he\u2019s been no less valuable.\nUntil Sunday, the Rams\u2019 offense has been every bit as effective this season, and Gurley\u2019s usage has been remarkably similar. Gurley went into Sunday\u2019s game against the Bears with an average of 23.2 touches per game, compared to last season\u2019s average of 22.9.\nGurley\u2019s receiving stats are down from last season, but he was averaging 19.4 carries this season, compared to 18.6 last year. The Rams\u2019 run-pass ratio has skewed toward the air as this season has progressed, but Coach Sean McVay said he doesn\u2019t track Gurley\u2019s usage during a game.\nGurley presumably remains a candidate for the NFL\u2019s most valuable player award, even with Sunday\u2019s unproductive outing, and even though a running back has won it only once in the past 11 seasons (Adrian Peterson in 2012). More realistic is the league\u2019s rushing title, which was in Gurley\u2019s grasp last season until the final week.\nHeading into the final week last year, Gurley led Kansas City\u2019s Kareem Hunt by 13 yards. The Rams chose to rest almost all of their starters (including Gurley) in the final game, while Hunt played and had one 35-yard run to clinch the rushing title. At the time, Gurley said it didn\u2019t matter to him.\nBackup running back Malcolm Brown suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last week, so the Rams put both Justin Davis and John Kelly on their 46-man game roster as Gurley\u2019s backups. McVay had said he would wait until the end of the practice week to determine how to handle the situation.\nKickoff temperature at Soldier Field was 29 degrees, with a wind chill of 25, which was not the coldest of the Rams\u2019 season. Their Oct. 14 game at Denver was an unseasonably cold 25 degrees, with a wind chill of 18.\nGoff decided not to wear gloves during the game, as he did at Denver.

The first is the option that the AHL has used this season, which features three minutes of 4-on-4 overtime and then four minutes of 3-on-3. The second option is to go with five minutes of 3-on-3 overtime, according to TSN\u2019s Bob McKenzie.\nIf the league ends up approving the measure (they\u2019ll have to negotiate with the Players\u2019 Association in order to work out specifics), then it would mean more exciting finishes to overtime, and in all likelihood would bring a decrease in the number of shootouts used to determine the winners of games.\nThis would be the Cadillac line, and the one most likely to score in a 3-on-3 situation. Kane would provide plenty of speed and passing ability, while Toews could double as an offensive weapon and a defensive security blanket if the play goes the other way. Keith is also excellent at stretch passes, meaning that transition play would be a huge asset.\nThis line would be really solid, with Sharp\u2019s willingness to fire shots in on goal and Seabrook\u2019s heavy slapshot proving to be good assets.\nThe Blackhawks have some incredible young talent on the roster, and putting two of those stars together on a line would be a match made in heaven. Teravainen and Saad both are excellent passers with speed to burn, and the thought of them going out on a 2-on-1 rush would turn opposing teams\u2019 stomachs.

For all that time, he has quietly and contentedly filled the back of his house with elaborate models and cityscapes.\nBut on Saturday, April 22, he\u2019ll show off his creations. That day, during a community garden workday, Kellison will display his paper models in the parking lot of neighboring Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church.\n\u201cI wanted to exhibit my papercraft somehow, so I was just going to put tables out in my driveway and in the church lot to let people stop by and see,\u201d Kellison says in his understated, easy way. He\u2019s quiet and calm and, if the delicate paper models throughout his house are any indication, patient and gentle as well. Kellison doesn\u2019t seem to speak much, either, but doesn\u2019t need to. He simply doesn\u2019t mind silence.\nAt first, Kellison made his paper models from punch-out patterns that are downloadable from the internet. These include castles, cathedrals, \u201cStar Wars\u201d characters and a scale model of a space shuttle resting on a massive crawler-transporter.\nAfter completing numerous models from these patterns, he decided to create his own. He does this by printing textures \u2013 brick or corrugated roof, for example \u2013 directly to card stock. Then he creates.\nOn this day, Kellison is working on a fantasy mill, its medievalesque character and unlikely proportions placing it in a fictional sword-and-sorcery world. There are differences between the picture from which he\u2019s basing the model and the model itself. Today, for instance, he\u2019s thinking about where he wants its shacks and outbuildings to go.\nKellison also builds traditional \u2013 that is, non-paper \u2013 dollhouses. One of these sits in the unused nursery at Wesley Memorial next door, waiting to be taken downtown.\n\u201cThe dollhouse, which is right over here right now, is going to be auctioned at Marbles (Kids Museum) to raise money for us,\u201d says Lucinda MacKethan, manager of the church\u2019s Planting on Whitaker (PLOW) community garden. Kellison doesn\u2019t attend the church, but he\u2019s been a big supporter of its community garden and a good friend to many parishioners. He bought fruit trees and bushes and helped plant them, and he has put in many hours working in the church\u2019s garden.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve helped a lot of people over there by feeding them,\u201d Kellison says.\nIn addition to being a hard-working artist, Kellison also has four decades of experience tending his own plot of land. His garden goes right up to Whitaker Mill, and birds sing and forage among its plants even while traffic passes. There are bluebird houses, and Kellison and his sister, who lives here as well, feed them mealworms. He grows lettuce, carrots and beets in a bed out front, while daylilies, peonies and tall phlox plants thrive here as well.\nLike his roomful of paper models, gardening is something he does to pass the day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sitting around,\u201d Kellison says with a chuckle.\nNote: Those wishing to work in the community garden should dress accordingly."}

Face it, it\u2019s not like you can change the locks on the side door. Once hacked, your Social Security number is out there indefinitely.\nBeginning Sept. 21, though, a new federal law will help consumers stop intruders in their tracks. The three big credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 will be required to offer you a credit freeze, free of charge. Such a freeze will restrict access to your credit file and help stop crooks from opening credit cards in your name.\nAlso starting Sept. 21, parents across the country will be able to get a free credit freeze for children under age 16, too. A child\u2019s credit file would be frozen until the child is old enough to use credit.\nTo be sure, the new law is but a minuscule response to the widespread outrage expressed by consumers just a year ago. Even so, it is a key step for regaining some control over our data.\nYet there\u2019s a not-so-small challenge ahead: Many people may have absolutely no idea what a credit freeze actually is and how it works, according to new research conducted by a team at the University of Michigan School of Information in Ann Arbor.\nAmazingly, some consumers wrongly think that a credit freeze stops them from using their own credit cards.\nSo what exactly is a credit freeze?\nPerhaps some consumers associated a freeze with times that credit card issuers send out new cards and stop us from using old ones because the numbers of the old ones have been breached.\nPerhaps others remember tips that once suggested putting your credit card in the freezer in a baggie to control spending.\nInstead, a credit freeze stops many but not all businesses and others from reviewing your credit file.\nThe consumer who signs up for a voluntary credit freeze is given a PIN \u2014 a PIN that you want to keep track of \u2014 to use when you want to unfreeze that credit file in order to apply for new credit.\nUnder the new law, if a consumer asks for a freeze online or by phone, the credit reporting agency has to put the freeze in place no later than the next business day, according to a Federal Trade Commission blog.\nIf the consumer wants to lift the freeze \u2014 for example, to finance a new phone or fridge \u2014 that has to happen within an hour.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just assumed that people know what a credit freeze is,\u201d said Florian Schaub, U-M assistant professor of information, whose research focuses on security and privacy issues.\nBut Schaub, 35, said too often \u201ccredit freeze\u201d is just swept into the jargon in the industry \u2014 jargon that many consumers simply do not understand.\nMany times, people only fully understand a credit freeze once they\u2019re actual victims of ID theft and told that a credit freeze is essential.\nAnd what is a fraud alert?\nSome consumers had a hard time understanding the term \u201cfraud alert,\u201d as well. Some thought the alerts were when a bank or credit union would text you when fraudulent activity was detected on your account.\nInstead, placing a fraud alert on your credit file actually means that you\u2019re adding a red flag, if you will, to your credit report to alert a lender to carefully verify your identity before making a loan.\nUnder the new law, a fraud alert will last one year, instead of 90 days.

Indiana, has the fourth largest population of Army National Guard members in the country. This creates a unique opportunity and challenge for the schools and communities in which these Guard members and their families live. The Guard members deploy frequently, but there is no active duty Army base in the state.\nThere are many Joint Community Forces meetings in the state to help the civilian community support the brave men and women who live military and civilian lives, and have to toggle between the two. The meetings recently addressed how local schools can help military children. Many educators have no idea of the struggles these children face. A National Guard parent can be gone anywhere from 6 months to 18 months on a deployment. Furthermore, children of a parent with PTSD face additional challenges as the entire family dynamic is often dramatically altered.\nHow can the education system better serve our military children?\nLike many issues, awareness of a situation is an important first step. Many educators and school systems have no idea which children are living in military families. Sometimes, the only sign that a child is struggling is a behavior changed. I experienced this myself as my family has faced PTSD for four years. My daughter began acting out in the classroom as my husband and I dealt with the difficult diagnosis after his second deployment.\nFortunately, our daughter's school was proactive, getting her in counseling at the school, educating the teacher about her situation, and working well with us as parents. She was allowed to journal throughout the day to express anger and confusion. She was given the opportunity to meet with the counselor at any time she needed. My daughter formed a strong bond with the counselor, and being with her became a safe place for her to discuss her struggles.\nI know that not every military family is as fortunate as we were with our school. I wonder: Is there a way to make teachers aware of which students are in military families? And, how can we provide support for those struggling with separation or other military-related issues?\nCan we educate the educators?\nThe greatest influence in a child's education is often his or her teachers. Children spend the majority of their lives at school, and those schools often offer social support when a child is struggling with a situation at home. When a parent is deployed, their lives become much like those of active duty kids, but without the support of an active base and military culture. With this in mind, we need to educate teachers on the effects of deployment and PTSD on military children.\nTeaching educators about the effect that military life, deployments and PTSD have on children would go a long way toward helping them understanding their students. Even providing teachers a basic understanding of military culture and the sacrifice required would help better reach these kids. Can we provide ongoing education for our teachers about these situations? The Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) is working on improving education for military children, but there are individual steps parents in military families can take to help their child, too.\nTalk to your child(ren)'s teacher. Make a point to talk to your child's teacher about your military status. If a parent is deploying or has recently deployed, it is valuable information for the teacher to know. He or she might be more apt to notice a behavior issue and bring it to your attention, thus allowing you to address a situation early. The teacher can also be sensitive about language and lessons the class related to the military.\nTalk to your child. If you live in an area in which people do not understand military life, let your child know. He or she might assume that others understand the military lifestyle, even if they do not.\nAccess existing resources. The Military Child"}

The members took to social media Tuesday claiming they would receive only 10 percent of the revenue generated from the music streams; the other 90 percent would go to their former label Tommy Boy.\n\"Dear Fans, the music WILL be released digitally,\" De La Soul wrote in an Instagram post. \"After 30 years of good music and paying their debt to Hip Hop, De L Soul unfortunately will not taste the fruit of their labor.\"\nDe La Soul members Posdnuos, Trugoy, and Maseo asked their fans to not \"feed the vultures,\" and instead cop their non-Tommy Boy projects, And the Anonymous Nobody\u2026 (2016) and The Grind Date (2004).

The rapper captioned the post with a GZA&apos;s line from the 1995 song \"Labels,\" in which GZA and RZA took aim at shady music imprints.\nOther music figures such as Pete Rock, Jarobi White of A Tribe Called Quest, and Questlove have also joined the boycott.\n\"I been hoping and wishing and praying for their back catalogue to be made available on digital media FOREVER\u2014but not like this,\" Questlove wrote. \"@tommyboyrecords This narrative has been going on since the blues, since jazz, since rock n roll, since disco, since soul\u2014I&apos;m proud of De La for using their voice.

Previously, she was senior correspondent for Reuters in Afghanistan.\nLast July, as I prepared to leave Kabul after a two-year stint as a journalist for Reuters, I visited La Taverna du Liban, a small Lebanese restaurant a few blocks from where I lived and worked.\nThere was no electricity that day, and the waiter shrugged politely when I mentioned it. I wasn\u2019t a regular at Taverna\u2014this was my third visit\u2014but I frequently ordered its takeout. I was saying goodbye to three Afghan friends, and we ate falafel and homemade hummus, served with warm bread and mint lemonade.\nWe sat in semi-darkness, chatting about their futures. One of them, a woman in her mid-twenties, is university-educated, speaks impressive, self-taught English and has an unwavering devotion to Che Guevara. She grew flustered when I asked her why she resists the temptation to seek a new life abroad, as some of her relatives have done. \u201cHow can Afghanistan get better if there are no good Afghans living here?\u201d was her response.\nHer words, already poignant, are now amplified.\nThe Taliban swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, which targeted a place with \u201cliquor in the plenty,\u201d but later changed its tune, saying the killing spree was payback for a deadly NATO airstrike on Afghan civilians.\nThe names of the dead foreigners read like an invite list to any of the get-togethers or parties regularly held in Kabul and attended by members of the international community. They included a senior U.N. official from Russia who focused on peace talks with the Taliban, a Lebanese citizen and local head of the International Monetary Fund, a 27-year-old American woman who had come to teach Afghan girls, a Pakistani citizen from UNICEF. All the foreigners were in the country to help the Afghan people. An outpouring of grief soon followed for the slain Lebanese owner of the restaurant, Kamal Hamade, who was much-loved for his kindness and commitment to a country growing more dangerous by the day. There was even some online commotion about the whereabouts of his dog.\nUnlike other attacks in Kabul\u2014and there were many during my time there, but we could usually bounce back\u2014the Taverna aftershocks are still reverberating a week later.

From playing the game's demo, Bravely Second seems like simply more of the classic JRPG gameplay you know and love.\nThe Tokyo Game Show demo was rather simple: in an unvoiced cut scene, our heroes learn that a young boy has been kidnapped by a group of brigands who have escaped into the woods. Thus, your mission is to rescue the poor boy before it's too late. So you head to the woods, do some turn-based battles, fight the boss, and rescue the child to reach the end of the demo.\nThere is not much to say about how Bravely Second plays. Its battles work identically (as far as I could tell) to the first game. All the strategy is built around using the \u201cdefault\u201d command (which defends and saves an action for your next turn) and the \u201cbrave\u201d command (which allows you to use the turns you've saved up) to defeat your enemies.\nThe biggest change I saw in the demo was the dungeon layout and presentation. The camera in the forest was almost side view. Therefore, to traverse it, you were constantly moving in and out of the various layers of the background. It was a creative use of the 3DS' 3D capabilities, and I look forward to seeing if this design is prominent in the full game.\nThe other addition the demo was the new wizard class which allows you to not only cast a spell but modify it\u2014i.e., speeding up its priority, making it damage over time, or making it affect all enemies or allies\u2014at the expense of an extra brave point.\nBut really, when it comes down to it, the Bravely Second demo seemed like more of the same.

The original series aired on the genre-focused cable network for five seasons, until it ended (unceremoniously) in 2018. This new series looks to follow the route laid out by AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead spinoff (which is also a prequel) Fear the Walking Dead, by showing the early days of the apocalypse from the perspective of an entirely new group of characters coming to grips with the unthinkable happening.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Netflix would be interested in a prequel series to the cultish popularity of Z Nation, though from the looks of the trailer, Black Summer is something of a departure tone-wise. That may be okay, as often the best parts of zombie movies and TV shows aren\u2019t the efforts by the survivors of the apocalypse to rebuild society or find a cure for the zombie plague that\u2019s ruined things on Earth. Instead, it\u2019s how the stories capitalize on the slow build up of tension that is the early days of a zombie outbreak, before all hell breaks loose and suburbanites are taking to the streets armed like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando.\nThe tone of the trailer is quite dark, painting a stark picture of what sort of series Black Summer is going to be, and, apparently, how much it will differ from the series it\u2019s meant to be the progenitor of. Part of setting the tone of the zombie apocalypse includes going all-in with regard to the horror angle (at least in terms of what\u2019s seen in the trailer), in particular the moment when a zombie is chasing a young man through an air duct. It\u2019s a claustrophobic sequence that looks like Black Summer is going to make good use of the lack of restrictions on Netflix.\nFrom the washed-out color palette to the rag-tag group of survivors to the speedy zombies chasing them, Black Summer looks as though it has borrowed a great deal of its aesthetic from Zack Snyder\u2019s 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. That will likely be enough to get some viewers excited about this latest addition to the zombie genre, but the question still remains if casual fans will tune in for yet another tale of the undead bringing the world to its knees.\nBlack Summer premieres Thursday, April 11 on Netflix."}

Melamine resin is a hard, sturdy plastic material often used to create inexpensive furniture and cabinets. Its very durability, however, can make melamine difficult to cover with paint. Prepping and priming are essential to achieving the best results. By taking extra time with these preliminary steps, you can freshen and transform your melamine wardrobe. This is also an excellent way to repurpose an old melamine piece that you might otherwise discard.\nUnscrew all hardware from the wardrobe using the appropriate screwdriver. This is a good time to soak the hardware clean before either painting or polishing it.\nFill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of mild dishwashing detergent. Wet a sponge in the water and scrub the wardrobe of dirt and grime. Dry thoroughly with a clean towel.\nLightly sand the wardrobe using a fine-grit sandpaper. This helps the primer adhere more readily to the surface.\nSlightly dampen a clean cloth and wipe any dust from the surfaces you sanded.\nApply a primer made especially for covering melamine surfaces, using either a paintbrush or small roller. Check the primer\u2019s label to determine how long to wait before applying paint.\nLightly sand any areas that show surface imperfections.\nApply a light coat of enamel paint to the wardrobe, using a paintbrush or roller. A second or even third coat of paint may be necessary, depending on how well your paint is covering. Follow directions on the paint can to determine how long the paint needs to dry between coats.\nFinish with a light coat of polyurethane, if desired. This will make your paint job extra-durable.\nWhen the paint or topcoat is completely dry, reattach the wardrobe's hardware.\nA light coating of primer is all that is necessary, so avoid a heavy hand in its application. Don\u2019t expect the primer coat to completely cover the color of the melamine surface. It will, however, make the paint adhere much more easily than if you used no primer at all.\nBruno, Gwen. \"How to Paint a Melamine Wardrobe.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/paint-melamine-wardrobe-20245.html.

Two weeks ago, the school committed that sad act of architectural vandalism, despite the protests of preservationists and the fact that the building was designed to be demountable.\nLosing one historic art barn is bad, but Texas may just lose another; a similar scenario is now playing itself out at the University of Texas at Dallas, where administrators have already intitiated the process of closing down that school's so-called Art Barn, an architectural landmark in its own right. In a memorandum circulated to top administrators this week, UTD President David Daniel described the building as \"near the end of its useful life.\" Current plans are to transform it into a storage center after the spring semester.\nOpened as the Fine Arts Building and now officially the Visual Arts Building, the Art Barn was designed by Lawrence Wood of the Dallas firm Fisher & Spillman. It opened in 1976 at what was then the far north end of campus. With wide panels of vertical white siding, porthole windows on its southern flank, and a staggered profile to the north, it has a distinctive graphic profile amplified by the bright Texas sun. The simple geometry of Its sheer planes offers a welcome and relieving contrast to the the largely undistinguished concrete architecture that characterizes so much of the campus. Rice's Art Barn was clearly an influence on the design, which also reflects Wood's interested in photography.\nIn 1979, it was honored with a merit award from the Dallas AIA.\nToday, the building betrays the wear of its age, and the economy with which it was constructed\u2014just $26 a square foot. In his memorandum to staff, President Daniel cited a host of concerns about its continued viability, including issues with fire-safety, plumbing, insulation, and energy efficiency. Dennis M. Kratz, dean of the School of Arts and Humanities, cited an engineering report that quoted a figure of more than $4 million for repairs\u2014quadruple the original construction budget.\n\"I believe it is clear that spending millions to bring a deficient building up to code is not a responsible choice,\" President Daniel wrote in his memorandum, concluding that the building would \"need to be replaced with a facility that more safely and effectively serves the needs of the students.\" Options for that replacement would be significantly smaller and either located \"outside the core campus\" or \"at a sensible location close to the main campus.\" The justification for the downsizing is that some of the Art Barn's functions were cannibalized by the $60 million Arts and Technology Center (ATEC), which opened last year.\nA number of fine arts faculty, students, and alumni dispute the administration's arguments\u2014in particular the costs for repair\u2014and have begun to galvanize a movement to save the building. They are, in particular, concerned about the loss of their principal gallery space, and their prime location on a campus that has grown around them.\n\"It's like gentrification,\" says Greg Metz, a lecturer in the visual arts who has become the leading advocate for the building. \"We were on the outskirts and now that we've become the center of campus they want to get rid of us.\" They fear that the administration's current plan to close the building, remove a mezz"}

It involves BGP (border gateway protocol), which is used by networking equipment to direct traffic between different providers. Changes in the network are \"announced\" by providers using BGP, and propagate across the internet to other providers over time.\nBut mistakes in BGP announcements can cause traffic to go where it isn't supposed to, often disrupting services. When such changes are made for malicious purposes it's known as route hijacking, but there is no suggestion that Hathway's action was intentional.\nRoute hijacking can give a network full visibility into the traffic it has commandeered, putting it at risk if it is not encrypted. Organizations have few courses of action and must wait until global routing tables are corrected.\nHathway's BGP error was accepted by its transit provider Bharti Airtel, which then broadcast the changes. The incorrect routes were accepted by other network providers including Cogent, Level 3, Orange, Singapore Telecom and Pakistan Telecom, Madory wrote.\nNetwork providers have ways to verify that routing changes are being executed by the entity that legitimately controls the IP addresses in question.

All this means that if you really want to keep your hipster cred up, you\u2019ll need to find another way of doing it \u2014 like, say, 3D-printing your very own modular turntable.\nFortunately, a new Kickstarter campaign promises you that exact opportunity. A collaboration between Swiss hi-fi manufacturer Lenco and Dutch 3D-printing company RepRapUniverse, the Lenco-MD is claimed to be the world\u2019s first 3D-printed record player. It\u2019s an attempt to bring together the worlds of vinyl lovers and tech tinkerers and makers to create what its designers clearly hope will be the start of something beautiful. The first functional prototype of the Lenco-MD was shown off at this year\u2019s IFA Berlin consumer electronics event, where it was ranked as one of the top-three inventions.\nThe innovative modular part of the concept refers to the fact that each Lenco-MD boasts two empty module slots. These can be used to upgrade turntables by adding features like speakers and Bluetooth wireless streaming in the form of plug-and-play modules. These are currently in development, although the idea is that users will also be able to design and create their own, which can then be shared with the rest of the community. It\u2019s a pretty original idea, and one that could certainly add to the device\u2019s functionality provided Lenco-MD takes off.\nAs ever, we offer our usual warnings about the potential risks inherent in crowdfunding campaigns. These can include products not turning up as promised, being delayed, or occasionally not shipping at all. If you\u2019re still willing to give the Lenco-MD a go, however, head over to its Kickstarter page to pledge your cash.\nThe record player is available in multiple bright colors. More importantly, there\u2019s the option to either pay 99 euros (around $113) for the 3D-printing files, plus the necessary non-3D-printed components, or 199 euros ($226) for a fully printed version that\u2019s ready to go.

The killings, prosecutors said, became more violent and furious as time went on.\nOrange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas called the slayings a \"serial thrill-kill spree\" and suggested that Ocampo had other killings planned when he was chased down and arrested after the fourth slaying.\nNow, investigators want to know if the Iraq war veteran is connected to the Yorba Linda case.\nShortly after Ocampo's arrest, investigators began to look for links to other crimes, including the double homicide in Yorba Linda, said Sgt.

They had seven errors in the first 17 points, leading to easy Dunbar points.\n\"We knew they were missing a couple of players, but we expected them to put up more of a fight,\" Hill said. \"Then we knew, in the second game, they weren't going to quit, that they'd be angry we'd done that to them.\"\nHill was right about that. The Devils responded to the first-game drubbing with a 4-0 run to start the second game.\nTo see Henry Clay respond pleased Coach Dale Grupe, whose team came into the match on a 12-game win streak.\n\"They definitely could have been rattled after that first game,\" Grupe said. \"(Dunbar) came out strong and took it to us, but we didn't help matters by shanking passes all over the place.\"\nThe lead ballooned to 20-12 behind good play from Kate Stromberg, who had five kills and seven blocks for the match.\n\"I was confident we'd eventually settle down and make a match of it, and we did,\" Grupe said. \"I was quite pleased with the match, but it would have been nicer to win.\"\nIn the decisive third game, Dunbar grabbed another quick 6-1 lead behind three kills by Hatcher, who heard \"traitor\" taunts from the Henry Clay student section all night. She played for the Devils her freshman season before transferring to Dunbar.\nThe Dogs' lead expanded to 11-3 before Henry Clay stormed back with a 12-1 run to take a 15-12 lead. A hitting error was called to tie the game at 19, and then Dunbar used a 5-0 run to lead 23-19.\nHenry Clay wasn't done yet, though. They made it 24-23 before eventually falling 25-23.

However, their co-stars are now starting to come into the spotlight. Thanks to the recent Vanity Fair cover story on the film, we learned new character names (like Gwendoline Christie's Captain Phasma) and discovered that Adam Driver is the actor behind the villainous Kylo Ren.\nAnother thing we learned in that piece is the identity of Lupita Nyong'o's character (initially rumored to be called Rose): an alien by the name of Maz Kanata. Based on an image of the Oscar winner on set, it became apparent that the character would be brought to life by motion-capture technology, with a digital creation filling in for the actress in the final product. Now, we know what that creature will look like.\nIndie Revolver posted a production painting of Kanata, who is described as a pirate with \"Galactic travelers, smugglers, and other assorted riffraff\" in her castle.\nAs you can see, it's obvious why Abrams opted to use CGI to make Maz a reality. While the production team is doing everything they can via practical effects (including those who live in Kanata's castle), there are some things you cannot do with real-world materials. Of course, some will say that Maz could have been a puppet a la Yoda in Empire Strikes Back (as was originally reported), but motion-capture technology has evolved so much this century that filmmakers can easily create photorealistic beings through an actors' physical performance and state-of-the-art digital effects (see: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). This method has proven to work several times before.\nEven though this is our first real look at Kanata, it technically isn't her debut. Indie Revolver also revealed that she is briefly featured in a shot from the second teaser trailer, where she hands Luke's original lightsaber to an unknown individual (Leia? Rey?) and is seen in profile.\nWhile that revelation doesn't spill a lot of juicy details that fans are still eagerly awaiting, it is enough to raise even more questions about the film. Many will be wondering what Kanata's relationship to the lightsaber is. One of the (false) rumored trailer descriptions from a while back allegedly used dialogue from Maz as a voiceover, where she referred to Luke as \"the one who taught her.\" Based on that speculation, it sounds as if she is a Force-sensitive being who is in hiding under the guise of a smuggler (in the vein of Jabba the Hutt). If Luke did indeed take her in as an apprentice, then it's plausible Maz has knowledge of why the lightsaber is significant, and has vital information Finn and Rey need for their quest.\nIn a way, Maz could could be the new trilogy's homage to Yoda, in that she doesn't look like the \"great warrior\" one would expect from someone strong with the Force, but proves her worth through powerful words of wisdom. Going off of the facial expression she is making in the painting, it certainly looks like Abrams has intended for her to have been through the wringer a few times and whatever experience she has will be a valuable asset for the protagonists as they progress through their journey.\nWe still have a ways to go before"}

At the time, Fulop estimated taxes, payments in lieu of taxes and other payments would historically yield about $315 million in additional tax revenue and about $18 million per year.\n\"Today was an important win for the city as the judge refused to dismiss the lawsuit as the Port Authority requested. This is validation that our complaint has merit and can now move forward,\" said Mayor Steven Fulop.\nIn addition to operating the region's major airports, bridges and tunnels and the World Trade Center site, the Port Authority owns four PATH rail stations in Jersey City, a PATH command center, parts of the port complex and other properties.\nOne of those properties, the Journal Square rail complex, would generate about $9 million annually if it was on the tax rolls, but under an existing Port Authority contract yields about $87,000, according to Richard Rudin, an attorney representing the city. Rudin argued the changing nature of the property over the years should warrant a larger payment, citing legislation that requires the payments to be \"fair and reasonable.\"\nCraig Domalewski, an attorney representing the Port Authority, countered that the same legislation exempts the Port Authority from taxes since the property is deemed to be for a public use, and holds that the Port Authority can -- but is not required to -- enter into an agreement to make payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\nWigenton dismissed one count that sought to prevent the Port Authority from capping PILOT payments in Jersey City because it treats other municipalities differently on the same issue. She also dismissed a count that sought to force the Port Authority to sell properties it had acquired, \"many of which are vacant and unused and have been so for years\" and aren't subject to taxation, according to the lawsuit.\nFor example, Rudin claimed today that the Port Authority owns 12 million square feet of space in the port complex in Jersey City that it doesn't use and doesn't pay taxes on.\n\"Acquiring property for future use and taking it off the tax rolls is not sufficient and doesn't comply with their statutory authority,\" Rudin said."}

Hot on the heels of the Balenciaga bicycle, which went on sale in June, comes the Gucci D\u00e9cor collection, revealed just yesterday. If you're looking for something some wheel bit more street cred, Supreme released a motorbike last month too.\nWhile men's fashion week was once the preserve of hyperstressed journalists with Moleskines, and box-jawed models in sharp suits and chunky knits, a more youthful, vibe infiltrated many of the shows. Nothing quite sums this up like 18-year-old Canadian singer Shawn Mendes closing the Emporio Armani show in Milan wearing one of the label's new smart watches.\nVersace took a youthful turn this season too, reappropriating their classic '90s silk shirts and jackets, alongside baby pink color block combos and preppy jumpers.

Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Daniel Kahneman argues that humans employ two different cognitive systems to evaluate new information. The first uses fast rules of thumb\u2014heuristics that are triggered by emotional reactions to new situations\u2014while the second relies on slower, systematic reasoning. People adopt many rules of thumb from groups with whom they share cultural or ideological commitments. This theory implies that when people are challenged with new information or arguments, they find it quicker and easier to believe what their peers believe.\nThe Republican brain hypothesis. This idea relies on research that shows a negative correlation between political conservatism and the traits of open-mindedness and critical reflection. Those findings suggest that conservative cognition asymmetrically relies on fast rules of thumb to make decisions and that conservatives are less likely than liberals to engage in cognitive reflection. Consequently, while liberals evaluate information with the aim of developing useful public policies, mule-stubborn conservatives dismiss discomforting scientific facts and spend their time just \"standing athwart history yelling Stop.\"\nThe expressive rationality thesis. Perhaps beliefs about issues such as the riskiness of climate change or nuclear power constitute part of what it means for people to belong to specific groups. Shared beliefs form part of their identities. People assess new information so that their conclusions signal their trustworthiness and loyalty to social groups.\nBoth the public irrationality thesis and the Republican brain hypothesis claim that ideological polarization arises from overreliance on cognitive rules of thumb. In the case of expressive rationality, people who are good at cognitive reflection will be better able to rationalize their beliefs in the face of any contrary evidence. If liberals really are more inclined toward cognitive reflection, Kahan writes, that implies they \"are all the more likely to succeed in resisting evidence that challenges the factual premises of their preferred policy positions.\"\nThe Yale researchers asked 1,600 Americans to place themselves on a continuum stretching from \"strong Democrat\" through \"independent\" to \"strong Republican.\" Next they were asked if they considered themselves \"very liberal,\" \"liberal,\" \"moderate,\" \"conservative,\" or \"very conservative.\" Once sorted by partisanship and ideology, the participants completed a short cognitive reflection test.\nOnce participants had completed the cognitive reflection test, they were divided into three experimental groups. In the first group, subjects were told that \"psychologists believe the questions you have just answered measure how reflective and open-minded someone is.\" In the second group, subjects were told that people who are not skeptical of climate change tended to get more answers correct. The third group was told the opposite, i.e., climate-change skeptics got more answers right. Then each group was asked how valid they thought the test was as a measure of open-mindedness.\nRecent polling finds that conservatives are more likely than liberals to be skeptical about man-made global warming. Thus the Republican brain hypothesis would predict that right-wing subjects would be more inclined to see the cognitive reflection test as valid when told it suggests that climate-change skeptics are more open-minded. On the flip side, if left-wing subjects really are more natively reflective, their assessment of the test's validity should not depend much on the putative correlation between one's score and one's views regarding climate change.\nThe public irrationality thesis predicts that motivated reasoning, i.e., jumping to conclusions congenial to one's social group, will be more common among people who score low on"}

Catastrophic flooding and destructive winds are expected.\n\u201cGuess all the trout have been washed down to the Chesapeake Bay,\u201d was a recent comment I heard from a friend who was talking about the high water and flooding caused by the recent heavy rains.\nThe recent raging high water has been swift and powerful, wiping out bridges and tearing up roads, flooding basements and causing a host of other problems. Trout and other fishes that live in these once peaceful waters seem to be able to survive \u2013 for the most part.\nKen Kelbaugh walks through flood waters coming from the West Branch of Codorus Creek after checking on his property and clearing debris on July 24, 2018.\nThat muddy, swift water that maybe overflowing is moving a lot faster than a layer of water near the creek bottom. Trout and other fish will find refuge behind a log, rock or near the streambank. That is not to say some younger fish will not be swept away in the stronger current. Typically a fish will do its best to avoid that milky brown mixture of silt and debris.\nA fish\u2019s survival will also depend on what happens to the stream bed during the flood.\nAnglers may see some changes in their favorite fishing hole, and it may even have disappeared as the waters shift the gravel on the creek bottom.\nMore: Outdoors: Remember the fish or deer that got away?\nHigh water, of course, is destructive and dangerous, but it can also be beneficial to habitat along a stream. Evidence is shown on the Codorus Creek, near Porters Sideling. This past weekend, a visit to the creek showed that recent flooding was helpful to some sections of the stream.\nMud and silt on parts of the stream bottom that suffocated macro invertebrates and the insects trout feed on was scoured away leaving clean gravel to provide fresh spawning areas for fish and places for macro invertebrates to reestablish.\n\u201cThe extent that flooding contributes to fish mortality often depends upon the severity of the event, the timing of the flood, as well as the life stage of the trout at the time of the flood. Typically, adult trout would be expected to handle flooding better than younger trout, as during a flood most trout will seek refuge from the strong currents in places like backwaters, eddies and along the stream bank until the flood waters begin to recede.\n\u201cDuring recent floods we may have lost some fish that became stranded in backwater pools as the floodwaters receded. However, on most waters we would not expect a high rate of fish loss from floods. Conversely, flood events in February of 1984 and January of 1996 occurred at a time when most of our young wild trout were still in the sac-fry stage before they emerged from the gravel of the streambed. Subsequently, during both of these years we noticed a numerically weak year class of young-of-the-year trout in many of our streams that support wild trout.\n\u201cFortunately, wild trout populations tend to be quite resilient and numerically stronger year classes in the years that followed allowed many of these populations to rebound from these events. Generally wild trout fare better in floods that occur in the fall as most have already spawned.

But Jairo Reynes, a 24-year United Parcel Service worker at the company\u2019s Maspeth hub in Queens, N.Y., was fired for being early.\nThe real reason for Reynes\u2019 firing was because he signed a mass grievance against UPS for ignoring seniority rules with respect to starting times.\nReynes\u2019 firing was a provocation aimed at Teamsters Local 804. The local\u2019s membership responded by staging a protest for 90 minutes on Feb. 26.\nUPS \u2014 the 53rd largest U.S. company in the 2012 Fortune 500 list, with $54 billion in revenue \u2014 retaliated by firing 250 workers.\nLocal 804 was the home local of the late Ron Carey, who as International Teamsters president led the 1997 strike against UPS. That\u2019s the last time a big company was successfully struck in the U.S.\nThe present mass firing is a challenge to the entire labor movement, and it is happening right in New York City.\nUnion members are fighting back. Local 804 held a news conference on April 3 at New York City Hall. \u201cUnion members from Teamsters locals all across the city were joined by [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] workers from Transport Workers Union Local 100, Service Employees 32BJ and members of Communication Workers of America and other union supporters,\u201d reported FightBack! News on April 3.\nTeamsters point out that UPS got a $43 million contract to deliver packages for city and state agencies. At the same time former Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave the outfit a sweetheart deal by wiping off nearly $16 million annually in parking fines.\nIn return UPS is trying to fire Domenick DeDomenico, who was struck by a car last year while delivering packages. The union brother was in a coma for 10 days, had brain surgery and received physical therapy.\nAfter DeDomenico returned to work, UPS sought to get rid of him for delivering 11 packages an hour instead of 13. This loyal Teamster with a 13-year-old son now has a second discharge notice for being one of the 250 workers who stood up to UPS.\nThe wealthy and powerful are rooting for UPS to smash the Teamsters. With huge job cuts in manufacturing, UPS has one of the largest number of union workers of any U.S. company.\nThe war against the Teamsters is decades long. By deregulating the trucking and airline industries, former President Jimmy Carter set back the entire labor movement. This so-called reform opened the door for union busting in both industries and smashed the Teamsters\u2019 master freight contract.\nAnother motive for the UPS mass firings is the corporate plan to privatize the U.S. Postal Service. Along with FedEx, UPS is a prime contender to take over the best parts of the postal service when big business takes over. In order to do so, UPS feels it has to break the Teamsters.\nUPS has led the corporate charge toward part-time work with few benefits. Alongside full-time employees at UPS, who are often forced to work overtime, are tens of thousands of part-timers. They have to work as long as 11 to 13 years before they can hope to get a full-time job.\nTeamsters have fought heroically for nearly 40 years against"}

Defense attorney Stacey Graus said his client showed no signs of impairment and the crash was the result of road rage.\nProsecutors say Greis was under the influence of marijuana and was legally drunk when the Honda Pilot he was driving hit the Pollitt family's Honda Accord, on Staffordsburg Road Oct. 26. He faces five counts of wanton murder for the deaths of Rodney Pollitt Jr., 26, Samantha Malohn, 27, and their three children, Hailieann, 9, Brenden, 8, and 6-year-old Cailie.\nA simulation of Greis' version of the crash, showing the Pilot could have successfully passed had Phillips maintained a speed of 55 mph or 65 mph and allowed Greis by, was shown to the jury on Friday.\nSanders pointed out that by Greis' own testimony, he drove more than a quarter-mile on the wrong side of a double-yellow line. Gilreath agreed.\nThe prosecutor then had the expert use a stopwatch to demonstrate just how long Greis would have been on the wrong side of the road while traveling at consistent speeds -- all above the Staffordsburg Road limit.\nThe jury sat as the stopwatch ticked off 17.9 seconds for 60 mph, 15.02 seconds for 70 mph and 13.14 for a speed of 80 miles an hour.\n\"Did you look at what would have happened if Mr. Greis had chosen to brake instead of accelerate?\" Sanders asked.\nGilreath said the Pollitts did nothing to cause the crash and could do nothing to avoid it. He said he does not disagree with work done by the Kentucky State Police. He said the non-contact vehicle driven by Phillips was an integral factor in this case.\nSanders said had Greis braked -- and data shows he did not -- in the five seconds before impact, Rodney Pollitt Jr. might have had options to avoid the crash.\n\"When Mr. Greis chose to go 100 percent on the accelerator instead of 100 percent on the brake, he took away the only chance the Pollitt family had, didn't he?\" Sanders asked.\n\"It was a poor decision on his part,\" Gilreath answered. \"We have no idea what the outcome would have been.\"\nThe defense rested its case Tuesday.\nBoth sides will give closing arguments on Friday, as the jury will not be back in court until then due to the judge's schedule.\nJury deliberations are also expected to begin Friday in Room 6A"}

Children, the elderly, and communities living in poverty are among the most vulnerable.\"\nYou can zoom in to your specific area to see exactly what threats exist locally.\nAlong with the maps is information about what to do in response to climate-caused health threats.\nThe NRDC bases the map on analysis of data gathered from the EPA, the US Department of Agriculture, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other resources. The group found that, \"[P]eople with asthma, allergies, and other respiratory diseases face the most serious threats, since exposure to increased pollution heightens sensitivity to allergens, impairs lungs, triggers asthma attacks, sends people to the hospital, and even results in premature death.\"\n\"Climate change is real and in many cases is already affecting people and natural ecosystems,\" said Kim Knowlton, senior scientist in NRDC's health and environment program. \"Our analysis will help people across the country find out exactly how climate change affects their state. From the dangers of extreme heat and increased flooding to the spread of ragweed whose pollen causes allergies or mosquitoes that can spread disease, climate change does not discriminate and local communities need to be better prepared.\"\nThis map is one place to start your research on what risks you may need to prepare for as things heat up."}

The Tories' lead has increased by 2% since their annual conference at the beginning of October.\nPolitical parties normally expect some bounce in the polls after a conference, as ministers make major speeches and generate favourable media coverage.\nAlthough the Tory conference generated many negative newspaper headlines, research shows that major policy announcements made by cabinet ministers were in fact widely popular with the public.\nTheresa May's plans for a \"hard\" Brexit and Amber Rudd's \"British jobs for British workers\" plans both enjoy wide support, mainly from those who voted to leave the European Union.\nThe Tories may also have taken some support from UKIP, whose support fell by 2%. The party was embroiled in scandal last week when two prominent MEPs from the party were involved in a serious altercation, and one was hospitalised.\nA 17-point margin is the joint second highest result recorded for the Conservatives by ICM, whose polling goes back to 1992.

{"idx": "37525", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: On a recent visit to Norway, a German supporter of the ICFI visited the house in which Leon Trotsky took refuge some time after he was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1929. This reader provided the following account of this period of Trotsky\u2019s exile.\nIn 1935, after the French authorities refused to allow Trotsky to stay in the country any longer, no other European country was prepared to grant him exile. At that time, France was negotiating an alliance with Stalin and was about to establish a popular front government with the support of the Stalinist Communist Party of France.\nIn Norway, the Social Democratic Workers Party had just come to power. This party regarded itself as standing to the left of the Second International and had even belonged to the Communist International for a time, having then broken with it in 1923.\nWalter Held, one of Trotsky\u2019s supporters who lived in exile in Norway, had turned to Olaf Scheflo, a party leader who was sympathetic to Trotsky, and finally received a promise that Trotsky could stay temporarily in Norway.\nAfter some problems caused by senior government officials who were opposed to his stay, Trotsky received a six-month visa, which was linked to a number of conditions. Trotsky had to promise the government that he would refrain from political activity and would reside some distance from the capital Oslo. As Isaac Deutscher writes, Trotsky did this on the assumption that he was being asked not interfere in the internal affairs of Norway. The government would later maintain that it had asked him to refrain from all political activity.\nKonrad Knudsen, one of the editors of the social democratic newspaper Arbeiderbladet, tried in vain to rent a house for Trotsky and finally invited him and his wife Natalia into his own home. Although he did not agree politically with his guest, his whole family enjoyed friendly relations with the Trotskys and did everything possible to make their stay a pleasant one. After Trotsky had partly recovered from a severe and persistent infection, he began to work on The Revolution Betrayed, one of his most important books, in which he made his analysis of the degeneration of the Soviet Union, the first workers\u2019 state, into a bureaucratic regime.\nIt was at this time that the period of murders and purges began in the Soviet Union. Not only was virtually the entire Bolshevik leadership wiped out, but also hundreds of thousands of members of the intelligentsia, the military, those active in the field of culture and countless ordinary Soviet citizens were detained in penal camps and/or murdered. The principal defendant of the show trials, with their fabricated charges and predetermined verdicts, was Leon Trotsky.\nTrotsky\u2019s visa was not extended, and he had to leave Norway after Stalin threatened the Norwegian government with a trade boycott and other sanctions.\nIn The Revolution Betrayed, Trotsky came to the conclusion that there were only two possibilities for the future of the Soviet Union: either the working class would overthrow the Stalinist bureaucracy through a political revolution and restore Soviet democracy, or the bureaucracy would reintroduce capitalist property relations and become a new ruling class. Trotsky\u2019s prognosis was tragically confirmed by the realisation of the latter alternative at the end of the 1980s.\nThe house in which Trotsky wrote this book stands just a few hundred meters from European Route 16, which runs from Oslo to Bergen, some 60 kilometres north of Oslo. In this small locality hardly anyone today knows about Trotsky. There"}
{"idx": "37526", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Liberia held its presidential elections on October 10, 2017, which marked the first peaceful transfer of power in the country since 1944. President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson, who has led the country coming out of a devastating civil war, is stepping down as President after her constitution-mandated two-term limit.\nWith some 22 parties contesting for the elections on October 10th, and with more than 2 million citizens voting, Senator George Weah of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) received 38% of the vote and Vice President Joseph Boakai of the ruling Unity Party (UP), came in second with 28%. The Liberian constitution requires that for the election winner to win outright, he or she must receive at least 50% of the vote, and since that did not happen, a run-off election was slated for November 7th.\nA number of international election observers, including representatives from the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center, said the October 10th election was largely free and fair, despite a few irregularities at some of the polling places.\nOn November 6th, the Liberian Supreme Court halted the presidential run-off election, which was scheduled to take place on November 7th, and thus delaying the first democratic transfer of power in the West Africa country in over 60 years. In a ruling, the court ordered the National Elections Commission to more fully investigate complaints from Charles Brumskine, the third-place finisher in the October 10th election, that the vote had been marred by widespread fraud.\nAccording to the Liberian constitution the transfer of power is scheduled for early January 2018. Given the tumultuous history of Liberia over the past several decades, it is really important that this process moves forward expeditiously as soon as possible and that the run-off elections are held. Anxiety and uncertainty amongst the populace is now growing, with concern that any extended delay will only add confusion and certainly not bode well for a peaceful transition of power.\nThe African Union and the Economic Community of West African States are working with political parties and the government to resolve the political impasse that has gripped the Liberian nation since the release of the results of the October 10 polls.\nIn a joint statement released in Monrovia, the Economic Commission of West Africa (ECOWAS), the African Union's liaison in Liberia, and the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) stated, while they all support and encourage the channel of due process followed by the aggrieved parties, the National Election Commission, and the Supreme Court, they are encouraging all concerned to continue utilizing the established legal mechanisms to achieve resolution. They said the current situation is thwarting the completion of the election process before the end of the constitutional mandate in January 2018. \"We wish to make it clear that the destiny of Liberia and its peace and development trajectory remain the responsibility of all Liberians, while the international community will continue to facilitate any possible assistance that may be deemed necessary to fast-track the country's development beyond the elections,\" the statement read.\nIn a joint statement, the European Union Delegation to Liberia and the Embassies of EU Member States present in Liberia (France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) applauded both the Liberian people and Liberian political leaders for their political maturity with the peaceful conduct of elections including the use of legal means to address their claims and concluded \" It is now the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure that the electoral process continues in a manner which respects the will of the"}

{"idx": "37528", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Thanks to the war in Iraq, sending a sizable U.S. force to Darfur is not an option. Units in Iraq are already on their third tours, and the crumbling Afghan peace demands ever-more resources. Moreover, sending Americans into another Islamic country is unadvisable, given the ease with which jihadis could pour across Sudan\u2019s porous and expansive borders. Making Darfur a magnet for foreign fighters or yet another front in the global proxy war between the United States and Al Qaeda would just compound the refugees\u2019 woes.\nSo what could be done short of invasion if, as some fear, the peace talks break down? Mark Leon Goldberg of the American Prospect recently wrote a piece noting that the Bush administration could deploy much more diplomatic pressure than it has in the past, and that there are plenty of steps short of invading that could go very far to halting the violence.\nUnfortunately, as Marisa Katz reports in the TNR issue, the administration\u2019s policy towards Khartoum over the past three years has generally been unabashed appeasement\u2014partly because Sudan\u2019s genocidaires such as Salah Abdallah Gosh have offered cooperation on terrorism issues (although one official tells Katz that this cooperation hasn\u2019t been all that valuable). Now the administration\u2019s stance appears to be changing of late, and for whatever reason, Robert Zoellick seems to have been able to pressure most of the parties involved to agree to a tentative peace deal, although this is one of those things on which we\u2019ll really have to wait and see.\nFinally\u2014and perhaps most importantly\u2014Eric Reeves, who has done better and more extensive work on Darfur than any journalist over the past three years, surveys the vast humanitarian wreckage in Darfur and points out that even if the fighting stops (again, a big \u2018if\u2019), the area is still going to be an utter disaster. Millions are displaced. Agriculture has been ruined. The next generation of Darfuris will grow up without having learned the necessary farming skills to sustain themselves. There are refugee camps that are bordering on permanence. Massive foreign aid and assistance will be needed. Massive, but doable. Yet Western countries have rarely, if ever, been good about helping refugees in post-conflict environments, or devoting the requisite resources to alleviating poverty and the like. That will need to change, and it would be unimaginably catastrophic to ignore Darfur just because the fighting has stopped."}

And then there\u2019s mead, or honey wine.\n\u201cHoney lovers stick together,\u201d said Cobey, quoting a bumper sticker in the Harry H. Laidlaw Jr. Honey Bee Research Facility on Bee Biology Road, UC Davis.\nThe average worker bee produces about 1/12th teaspoon of honey in her lifetime; on one collection trip, she visits 50 to 100 flowers. The workers in a beehive may collectively travel 55,000 miles and visit more than two million flowers \u201cjust to gather enough nectar to make a pound of honey,\u201d Cobey said.\nExtension apiculturist Eric Mussenof the UC Davis Department of Entomology faculty says the bees\u2019 floral source determines the color and flavor of honey.\nThe standard colors are water white, extra white, white, extra light amber, light amber, amber and dark amber, he said. The lighter colors tend to be mild and the darker colors, more robust.\n\"The milder flavors are good for drizzling over pancakes and oatmeal or for vegetable dishes,\" Mussen said. \"The darker, more robust colors, are excellent recipe ingredients, providing substantial honey flavor and resistance of the final product to 'drying out.'\"\n\"For great lemonade,\" he said, \"try mixing one cup of freshly squeezed lemon with one cup of liquid honey, and add water to fill a quart.\"\nNot everyone should eat honey. The general rule of thumb is not to give raw honey to infants under a year old because of their underdeveloped immune systems and the possibility of their ingesting microorganisms.\nHoney is comprised of sugars, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids. Honey is not only a treasured sweetener, but is valued for its protective antioxidant levels; as a cold and sore-throat home remedy; and as a beauty aid (cleansing scrub, skin moisturizer, hair conditioner and antibacterial mouthwash).\nNew Zealand produces the highly prized manuka honey, praised for its medicinal or antibacterial properties. It's made from the manuka or tea tree (Leptospermum scoparium).\nMussen, who writes \u201cfrom the UC Apiaries,\u201d a newsletter published bimonthly and available free online on the Department of Entomology website, says that all honey marketed for sale in California must meet certain specifications, according to the California Food and Ag Section 29611. Every container must include the name and address of the producer or distributor of the extracted honey; the net weight of the honey in the container; and one of the U.S. grades established for honey by the U.S."}

One teammate would say that they had to put him in centerfield just to get him away from everybody. But, of course, the real reason they put him in centerfield is because no one ever played the position better. Blair would play shallow -- absurdly shallow, really, close enough to pass notes to the second baseman -- and this meant he could steal more bloops and low line drives than just about anybody in the game.\nIt also meant that he had to often do one of the hardest things for an outfielder -- that is, go back and chase down balls hit over his head. Blair was a genius at this. Earl Weaver used to say he never once saw Paul Blair's first step -- Blair seemed to make it before the ball was even hit.\nHe played center field almost every day the Baltimore Orioles from 1965 to 1976, and in those 12 years, the Orioles 95-plus games six times, won four pennants, won two World Series, and people always said it was because of pitching and the three-run homer. Sure. But his defense was a big part of that pitching. And Blair, though he wasn't much of a hitter, did bang 16 of those three run homers and scored on many more of them.\nI should expand on that part about Blair not being much of a hitter -- he was a very good hitter in 1967 and 1969, and still a good hitter in 1970. But it was 1970 he was hit in the face with a pitch by Ken Tatum -- and there's a very clear before/after story. From 1966 to 1969, Blair hit .270/.321/.423 which was very good for that era -- good enough for a 115 OPS+.\nFrom 1971 to 1975, Blair hit .252/.297.378 with a 94 OPS+. It's hard to say what effect the beaning and subsequent facial surgery had on his hitting psyche and confidence. Defensively he was still a marvel.\nIn 1977, he was traded to the New York Yankees, and he was never again an every day player, but his quote about the Yankees is still memorable: \"We're loved and hated, but always in larger doses.\""}

Nationally, more than 45 percent of high school linebackers are obese, and the number of overweight students entering college level-sports is increasing.\nIn a peer-reviewed literature review published this summer in the Nestle Nutritional Institution Workshop Series, OSU researcher Melinda Manore looked at the benefits of teaching athletes how to consume what she calls a low-energy-dense diet, or high-fiber, high-water, but lower-fat foods. She said too many athletes are pushed into fad diets or try to restrict calorie intake too much in a way that is unhealthy and unsustainable.\nIn the paper, Manore outlined some strategies that athletes can use to maintain a healthy weight and remain performance-ready. It\u2019s important, she said, to adopt a low-energy-dense diet, which includes a large amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish, and low-fat dairy. Avoid beverages high in sugar, especially soda and alcohol. Manore said half of a plate of food should be filled with fruits and veggies, and processed food should be avoided.\nEat breakfast. Data from the National Weight Control Registry shows that 80 percent of people who lost at least 30 pounds in a year and kept it off were breakfast eaters. Eat a breakfast rich with high-fiber whole grains, fruit, high-quality protein such as egg whites, and low-fat dairy. Skip the processed cereals.\nGet plenty of protein. Most athletes get plenty of protein, but they may not be strategic about making sure to refuel after exercise, and spreading their protein intake throughout the day. Depending on the goals, some athletes may need to get as much as 30 percent of their calories from protein, but many get that in one large meal. Spreading that protein out throughout the day is a better strategy; and nuts, beans and legumes are a great source of protein, not just meat.\nExercise regularly. This may seem obvious for an athlete, but many seasonal athletes can pack on pounds during off-seasons, making it that much harder to get performance-ready.\nAvoid fad diets. Combining severe calorie restriction with intense training can result in metabolic adaptions that actually can make it more difficult to lose weight. Severe weight loss also makes an athlete stressed out and tired, and that is never good for sport.\nWhile her paper is aimed at competitive and recreational athletes, Manore said all of these tips can apply to anyone who wants to change their diet and head in a healthier direction."}

One fell dead on the spot while the other managed to scamper off into the overgrown jungle.\nWe also had a terrible brush with some six or seven hippopotami in shallow water. I would have shot several of them but I have been advised against doing so by our guide, Mutubu, as I have previously ruined three of our watercraft trying to accomplish the very same thing. I am quite sure that these beasts communicate telepathically. The brood this morning knew we had taken shots at their kind earlier in the week, so they waited for us today, lurking in the shallow waters.\nLast week, the 15th I believe, we ran into a pack of native women in Ekaturaka, a large town on the left bank of the river. It was here I was to face my biggest challenge of the excursion to this point.\nOur boat needed repairs after a chance meeting with African crocodiles (another animal Mutubu has since forbade me to shoot at). While in port we happened upon a supply of native intoxicants (we also found alcohol). These ravishing specimens captured my attention with their smooth ebony skin, massive ocular ports, and the largest, firmest bottoms I have ever been witness to.\nI fancied one of the natives in particular, she did not have a discernable name so christened her Gluconia. If there ever was a name for a country that was overrun with ample-cheeked women it would be named Gluconia, I am sure of it.\nThat night a feast was held in our honor. We partook of large brownish green tree-frogs (Rana albolabris) and red-assed monkey testicles. Our libation was a rather interesting concoction; apparently it is produced by crushing native berries in a water-tight container, then many of the aforementioned women expectorate saliva into the basket until the container is nearly full. At that point the villagers seal the whole thing up and let it ferment for a period of weeks. The end result is not pleasing to the eye but it makes for a tremendous ice-breaker.\nGluconia and I spent the night swapping tales, mine of blowing holes in things while hers tended to be a series of clicks and pops, much like Morse code. I nodded politely, all the while waiting to steal a glimpse of her ginormous posterior.\nFriends, Romans, Countrymen I did a good bit more than steal a glimpse that night. When I awoke, not only did I apparently wrestle with a red-assed monkey I also found out that I was betrothed.\nThe entire ceremony the previous night was intended to marry off Gluconia and I took the bate like a fool.

You have a live-in aide - but it\u2019s not human. Your personal robot reminds you to take your medicine, monitors your diet and exercise, plays games with you, and even helps you connect with family members on the Internet.\nSome technology experts see this as the answer to a predicted shortage of caregivers to serve our rapidly aging population. Labs around the world are working on this, and already some robots are being marketed successfully. Robots have been designed to help people with physical rehabilitation, assist in a nursing home, and even provide \u201ctelepresence\u201d - in which a robot acts as an avatar, a physical presence for someone you communicate with at long distance.\nA conference in San Francisco last week on innovation and aging featured a keynote address by Cynthia Breazeal, founder and director of the Personal Robots Group at MIT\u2019s Media Lab. Breazeal\u2019s research focuses on robots that can make social and emotional connections with people. Her lab has developed a range of robots ranging from small six-legged devices to small stationary machines that mimic human expression and communication.\nThis isn\u2019t a new concept: In Japan, a cuddly social robot called Paro has been available for a decade. Paro looks like a baby harp seal and is designed to have a calming effect, even eliciting emotional responses from patients in nursing homes and hospitals.\nBreazeal\u2019s lab has designed a robot called Nexi that can blink, shrug, and make facial expressions; another, called Autom, is designed to help people lose or maintain weight. And telepresence robots can gesture and pick up non-verbal cues.\nLast week\u2019s conference was hosted by Aging 2.0, an organization focused on incubating and launching businesses for the 50-plus market. Breazeal says we\u2019re not far away from practical application of robots for caregiving at a distance, with the most basic devices - those that sits in a stationary spot in your home - costing no more than a laptop computer.\nNo doubt, the demand for caregiving help will be there.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that demand for direct caregivers (including nursing aides, home health aides, and personal care aides) will far outstrip supply in the years ahead. The number of available jobs is expected to jump 48 percent, while the number of likely workers will rise just 1 percent.\nAnd fewer family members will be available to help out. AARP projects that the number of family caregivers available to support aging parents will plunge in the years ahead. In 2010 there were seven potential caregivers for every person over 80. By 2030 the ratio will drop to 4 to 1, and will be 3 to 1 in 2050.\nStill, there\u2019s something unsettling about the idea of machines caring for our elders. It may make sense to use technology to remind us to take our medicines. But emotional bonding?\nthe villages movement, co-housing projects, and simple house-sharing arrangements (reut.rs/1k6mxGw)."}

According to the researchers, if we continue to aggressively increase our shale production, fracking\u2019s water footprint could grow by up to 50-fold in some regions by 2030, reports Phys.org.\nLook at it this way - that is just 11 years from now. The use of such a large amount of water raises concerns over its sustainability, particularly in semiarid and arid regions in the American southwest and in other areas where groundwater is already limited or stressed.\n\u201cPrevious studies suggested hydraulic fracturing does not use significantly more water than other energy sources, but those findings were based only on aggregated data from the early years of fracking,\u201d said Avner Vengosh, professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment.\nVengosh points out that in the past decade, more reliable and verifiable information and data has been collected on fracturing operations. Vengosh notes that there has been a steady increase in fracking's water footprint, \"with 2014 and 2015 being a turning point where water use and the generation of flow back and produced water began to increase at significantly higher rates.\"\nThis rapid increase is due to hydraulic fracturing becoming more efficient, and to recent changes in drilling practices as fossil fuel companies strive to make wells more productive. For example - Inside Climate News notes that well operators have increased the length of the horizontal portion of wells drilled through shale rock to reach the oil and gas deposits.\nBy increasing the length of the horizontal pipes, there has also been an increase in the amount of water, sand and other materials, including chemicals pumped into the wells. \"This is changing the paradigm in terms of what we thought about the water use,\" Vengosh said. \"It's a different ball game.\"\nSome counties in Texas, already arid anyway, are going to begin feeling the impact of fracking soon.

But the new Brookhaven center marks a new direction for the lab, a facility for advanced scientific research where national security projects account for about $25 million of the $400 million annual budget.\nDr. Sakitt, formerly an assistant director of planning and policy at the lab, said the center planned programs to encourage students and others with technical skills to pursue careers in national security. He said it would also involve scientists in solving technical problems.\nThe center will be part of the lab's Department of Advanced Technology, where scientists work on a number of nonproliferation programs for government and international organizations.\nThese include programs to prevent theft and diversion of materials from dismantled nuclear weapons that could be reused in new weapons. They also include programs to help prepare and verify technical aspects of treaties for eliminating chemical weapons and reducing and dismantling stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\nSome of the work involves fissile materials, or materials that can be used in nuclear weapons, in former Soviet states including Russia. International concern is focused there because economic crisis has left workers in nuclear facilities unpaid for months and vulnerable to the temptations of stealing and selling these fissile materials.\nDepartment scientists involved in these and other programs will assist in the new center. ''We will try to compliment this very technical work with an outreach to the academic community to involve academic people in discussions about these issues,'' Dr. Sakitt said.\n''When they go back home to their institutions they'll have been exposed to all these concepts and they'll take back materials that will be useful for teaching courses,'' said Dr. Sakitt.\nTargeted students would have training or background in engineering or physical sciences. In addition to technical training, they would also study arms control treaties.\nThe center also plans programs for select groups of students in political science to acquaint them with nonproliferation technologies. ''When they go into policy areas of national security, they will then have enough understanding that they can converse with the military and scientists and not be completely ignorant of how these technologies work,'' Dr. Sakitt said.\nSuch knowledge, he said, would help assure that nonproliferation treaties for chemical and biological weapons included provisions that improved verification.\nExperts on international security say grave threats come from terrorist and sub-national groups like one headed by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist and exiled Saudi businessman suspected by the United States in conventional-explosive attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last month that killed more than 200 people.\nWith many experts predicting these groups will attempt attacks within the United States, Dr. Sakitt said the center planned a lecture series by experts describing threats from terrorism in U.S. urban areas involving nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\nDr. Marvin Resnikoff, a physicist and a senior associate at Radioactive Waste Management Associates in Manhattan, said the lab center should offer programs tracing how the ''Atoms for Peace'' programs begun in the 1"}

He and his Thai colleague, Chutima Sidasathian, have been charged with bringing the Royal Thai Navy into disrepute and an offence under the onerous Computer Crimes Act.\nThe pair face up to seven years in jail but have said they will go to prison rather than seek bail unless the Royal Thai Navy withdraws the ''foolish and unjust'' charges relating to publication of a single paragraph from the Reuters news agency in July.\n''It's understood in all democracies that no military should be beyond criticism,'' the women write in their letter to the Navy chiefs of Australia, the US, Britain and New Zealand.\nThe United Nations human rights chief, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists and several other international rights organisations have issued statements calling on the Royal Thai Navy to drop the charges.\nPhuket police say similar charges are also being pursued against Reuters and the two journalists who wrote the agency's special report on the Rohingya boatpeople.\nAn Australian embassy official said on Friday that a police officer investigating the matter told her that the Phuketwan journalists are likely to face court in March or April.

Elizabeth Neo with more.\nSINGAPORE: A mobile app for members of the public to report errant retailers and GPS trackers to monitor personal mobility devices (PMDs). These are some ways in which the government can rev up enforcement on errant users and retailers, several MPs suggested during the Parliamentary debate on the Land Transport (Enforcement Measures) Bill on Monday (Sep 10).\nBefore the Bill was passed, Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min highlighted some of its key points, including compulsory registration of e-scooters from early 2019 and ensuring that all motorised PMDs be compliant with fire safety standards from 2021.\nAdditionally, Dr Lam said that the Bill will strengthen the Land Transport Authority\u2019s enforcement capacity by enabling the appointment of outsourced enforcement officers and giving them limited enforcement powers.\nMP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Joan Pereira stressed that the Government will need to consider having more enforcement officers or use technology to make an impact against PMD users and cyclists who break the law.\n\u201cSo far, the enforcement has been a bit of a hit and miss. It is not easy to catch errant ones as there are so many users and they are everywhere, even riding their devices along common corridors and void decks of our HDB blocks, shopping malls, hawker centres, and even community centres and MRT stations,\u201d said Ms Pereira.\nIn order to keep pace with the number of PMDs users. Ms Pereira suggested installing microchips with GPS tracking capability in PMDs.\nHer fellow MP from Tanjong Pagar GRC Melvin Yong also suggested that LTA use technology to reduce the reliance on manpower for enforcement.\nHe recommended having a common fleet management system to track and monitor the use of all active mobility devices so as to efficiently deploy limited ground resources. MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Gan Thiam Poh suggested using street cameras to identify reckless users.\nIn addition to enforcement action against the users, MPs also stressed the importance of compliance from retailers.\nDr Lee Bee Wah, MP for Nee Soon GRC, suggested that the Government take \u201cstrong enforcement action\u201d on outlets which sell devices that do not comply with the new regulations, or perform illegal modifications on PMDs.\nMP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Ang Hin Kee called for LTA to introduce a mobile app for members of the public to report retailers who advertise or sell illegal devices.\nFor the benefit of prospective buyers, Mr Ang also recommended that LTA compile a list of PMD retailers who sell devices that comply with the government\u2019s regulations.\nMANDATORY INSURANCE FOR PMD USERS?\nAdditionally, the MPs also discussed the possibility of imposing mandatory insurance for PMD users.\nThis, said Mr Yong, would enable victims in pedestrian accidents involving PMD users to receive a \u201cjustified\u201d compensation. Offending users too would not be able to escape the consequences of their actions, he added.\n\u201cAdopting a similar liability and compensation framework as per motor vehicles could go a long way in ensuring that the victims would not be overly burdened by medical expenses in the event of a serious accident,\u201d Mr Yong said.\nMr Zain"}

Putin that as recently as a few months ago was widely perceived as far-fetched. But the result will be hundreds of thousands of people thrown out of work.\nAnd in a move that at times seems to have taken on almost farcical overtones, the Kremlin has offered the gambling industry only one option for survival: Relocate to four regions in remote areas of Russia, as many as 4,000 miles from the capital.\nThe potential marketing slogans -- Come to the Las Vegas of Siberia! Have a Ball near the North Korean Border! -- may not sound inviting, but that is in part what the government envisions.\nAll the same, none of the four regions are prepared for the transfer, and no casino is expected to reopen for several years. As of July 1, not even two decades after casinos began proliferating here in the free-for-all post-Soviet era, the industry's workers will be out on the street.\n\"This is shaking my life to the core -- such a blow for me and my family,\" said Irina Mysachka, 32, a single mother who is a supervisor at the Shangri-La Casino in Moscow, which appears as orderly and preened (if your tastes run to fire-breathing neon dragons and other Oriental kitsch) as any similar luxury venue in the United States.\n\"The authorities are taking this step without thinking at all,\" she said. \"They have not considered what this decision means for the workers.\"\nUnable to locate a job in Moscow, she said she was going to leave her 5-year-old son, Yegor, with her mother and venture abroad.\nAleksandr Osin, 24, who has been at Shangri-La for five years, said he would try his luck in the insurance business, but was not hopeful.\n\"We all thought that this was some kind of government thing that would not happen,\" he said. \"But now we know.\"\nThe law that started the whole process was introduced in 2006 by Putin, then the president and now the prime minister, who spoke of the perils of the blackjack tables and the one-armed bandits, of shady characters having a grip on the industry.\nThe casinos have repeatedly asked for a reprieve, proposing a regulatory body to cut down on abuses, and lately pointing out that the ban would create hardships for workers during the economic crisis. The industry has also said it pays more than $1 billion a year in taxes.\nBut Putin and his protege, President Dmitri A.

Windows, however, still rules the roost.\nLinux sales lost some ground to Windows last year, but they're expected to climb in coming years as distributors of the alternative operating system create new revenue streams.\nAccording to market research firm IDC, Linux sales declined nearly 5 percent in 2001 to $80 million, but are expected to grow to a $280 million market in 2006.\nMeanwhile, Windows sales climbed 11 percent to more than $10 billion last year, according to IDC analyst Al Gillen.\n\"The Linux operating system market, from a revenue perspective, accounts for one half of 1 percent of the total operating system revenue each year, or roughly two days' worth of Microsoft's operating system revenue,\" Gillen said. \"On the second day of January, Microsoft had generated more operating system revenue than the Linux community (will for the entire year).\"\nIDC based its projection of $280 million in sales within four years on efforts by Red Hat, SuSE and others to wring more money from Linux, in part by making it more difficult for users to obtain the software for free, Gillen said. \"What we're expecting the revenue to come from is the fact that the Linux vendors are moving toward a model where they're trying to drive revenue per server,\" Gillen said.\nFor example, Red Hat doesn't offer downloads with which others can easily create installation CDs for its high-end Advanced Server edition. And while the software may be installed on multiple computers--unlike Windows--Red Hat charges per server for subscriptions to the Red Hat Network for online services.\nWhile experts still can assemble the required Linux components for free and create the same package that companies sell, customers will be leery of using that sort of customized software, Gillen said.\nLinux, a clone of the venerable Unix operating system, began 11 years ago as the programming project of Linus Torvalds, but now it is collectively developed by hundreds of programmers across the globe. Linux has gained real-world credentials, most prominently as a central part of IBM's strategy to compete with Sun Microsystems and Microsoft.\nLinux is an open-source project, meaning that it's free to share, change or distribute its underlying programming instructions, called source code. In contrast, tight controls govern who may see and change the source code of operating systems such as Sun's Solaris and Microsoft's Windows.\nDuring the dot-com mania, Linux was one of the hot trends that captured investor attention. The first Linux company to hold an initial public offering, Red Hat has solidified its role as the dominant Linux specialist.\nRed Hat garnered nearly three-quarters of the revenue in 2001, Gillen said. \"The rest of the players are bit players. Most of what's left is held by SuSE. Everyone else is in the low single digits or smaller,\" he said.\nLinux is best suited for use in servers, the higher-end computers that often run 24 hours a day handling tasks such as corporate e-mail. Most Linux revenue came from this market, Gillen said.\nIDC declined to release the numbers of copies of Linux that were sold, but said the number stayed about level from 2000 to 2001. The number of copies that sold for \"client\" computers such as desktops and workstations, however, increased nearly 50 percent over 2000"}

I was 15 when he was hospitalized for his first attempt \u2014 his life thereafter owed to the vulnerable courage he demonstrated by calling 9-1-1 on himself. I was 26 when, after a long recovery, he spiraled downward again. 27 when we intervened and got him to go back to therapy. And then, I was 28 when I stood in front of his house last year \u2014 just before Thanksgiving \u2014 and learned that his life had ended. That our brave fight was over.\nI am one of all too many who knows this kind of pain. But, I can honestly say that starting a conversation and raising awareness for suicide prevention has been a powerful experience. To feel yourself linking arms with millions of loving strangers \u2014 holding the same candle of hope \u2014 is more moving than words can express. When it comes to stigmatized illnesses, removing the shame is paramount for sufferers and survivors alike. If we\u2019re able to expose an otherwise silent, hidden wound, it gives us a fighting chance, right?\nThat\u2019s the next critical question we need to answer in the fight to prevent suicide. And I know it, because that\u2019s the question I asked myself about my dad\u2019s depression. His was the kind that wasn\u2019t shy or quiet. His was the kind that allowed itself to be talked about and worked at \u2014 tirelessly, and for years. But eventually, his depression refused our help. It quit therapy, said it would like to try recovering in his way, and requested our respect. With unspoken words, it made us fear what could lay ahead, while simultaneously rendering any emergency response a needless overreaction.\nSix months later, after arriving at the day we desperately tried to prevent (him most of all), I often found myself wishing I\u2019d had psychic powers \u2014 ones that would have allowed me to know where and when to intervene. And I would have in a heartbeat. I would have dialed 9-1-1 (on his behalf, this time) if I had needed to. I would have withstood the heartbreak of seeing my father taken to the hospital against his will. I would have dealt with his denial, and the resulting upset from others. I would have even allowed my dad to disown me for the rest of his life if it came to it. I really, really would have.\n\u2026And I am deeply ashamed to admit it.\nWhy? Because in going against his will \u2014 instead of working in a more loving way with him to try to change it, I would have disregarded the highest of all human values: Compassion.\nCom\u00b7pas\u00b7sion \u2013 Literally: feeling \u2014 or suffering \u2014 together. The word compassion reminds us that it is with one another (com-) that we exercise empathy (-passion).\nIn those final months, compassion was the thing that we shamefully kept quiet. It wasn\u2019t the wound of depression that we hid, but the heart of the matter itself. And it\u2019s our hearts that we need to use \u2014 both as a society and as individuals \u2014 when dealing with an illness that we have trouble wrapping our minds around. In addition to a better understanding of the issue, there are a lot of things we need more of in the fight against suicide: effective medicine and healthcare, diversified options for therapy and other treatments. But on a human level, compassion is a critical part of the answer to the \u201cWhat do we do next\u201d question \u2014 the one that comes after raising awareness.

Gov. Rick Perry last week added the proposal to the legislature's special session agenda. A similar bill failed during the regular legislative session.\nThe issue drew an overflow crowd of advocates and opponents of the measure, with both sides staging rallies in anticipation of the hearing. In a weekend rally in favor of the legislation, a leading proponent blamed the Legislature's inaction on the issue on the number of Hispanics who serve in the Legislature.\n\"If you want to know why we can't pass legislation in Texas it's because we have 37, no 36 Hispanics in the Legislature. So, that's part of our problem and we need to change those numbers,\" said Rebecca Forest, a co-founder of Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas. \"We need to do something about that in fact.\"\nHer remarks drew condemnation from the state's top three elected officials, all of whom support the \"sanctuary city\" legislation as needed tool for law enforcement.\n\"The governor certainly does not agree with such misguided and unproductive comments. This is not about race or politics - it is about public safety. We must ensure our peace officers have the discretion they need to keep Texans safe,\" said Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier.\nHouse Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, called Forest's statements \"divisive and intolerant that have no place in our (Republican ) Party or in the Texas House of Representatives, where our Hispanic members bring a diverse and valuable perspective to the legislative process, just as our Hispanic citizens do in our state.\"\nDemocratic Party officials seized on Forest's remarks as evidence that the legislation is inspired by racism.\n\"While Ms. Forest's comments are incredibly offensive, it's about time a Republican was finally upfront about their Party's hateful attitude toward Hispanics,\" said Anthony Gutierrez, spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party.\nGeorge Rodriguez, president of the San Antonio Tea Party, said he attended the rally, heard Forest's comments and \"corrected\" her at the podium.\n\"That was an unfortunate choice of words,\" Rodriguez said Monday. \"I completely disagree with that. The problem is not that we have too many Hispanic legislators. The problem is that we have Hispanic liberal legislators. What we need to do is find conservative Hispanics to run for office so we can have conservative Hispanics that can vote on these issues.\"\nLaw enforcement leaders and public officials across the state oppose the measure, which they say would sap the limited resources of local law enforcement personnel and trigger a lack of trust by Hispanics, who would be less likely to report crime.\n\"Texas is not Arizona. Our culture, history and economy are based on genuine and pragmatic goodwill toward all residents in our state,\" said Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff. \"We don't need the negative attention that would come to our state with enactment of laws perceived as anti-Hispanic.\"\nHouston Police Chief Charles McClelland Jr. estimated it would cost HPD more than $4 million to train 5,000 officers on immigration"}

But investors should take these claims with a grain of salt.\nFor most of 2017, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock moved steadily higher. However, the iPhone maker stumbled in the last week of the year, due to several reports suggesting that demand for the new iPhone X isn't living up to expectations.\nThere's bound to be some level of uncertainty about how the iPhone X is doing until Apple releases its next earnings report. (Even then, management isn't likely to report iPhone X sales separately.) Still, the doom-and-gloom claims that captured a lot of media attention last week are almost certainly inaccurate.\nIs Apple slashing iPhone X orders?\nLast Monday, Taiwan's Economic Daily News spoiled Apple shareholders' Christmas by reporting that the company had cut its iPhone X sales forecast for the upcoming quarter by a stunning 40%. The new forecast is 30 million, down from 50 million, according to the report.\nAt least two other Asia-based analysts also reduced their iPhone X shipment estimates recently, according to India's The Economic Times. They joined a recent chorus of analysts who have argued that the iPhone X doesn't have enough innovative technology to justify its high price point.\nSeveral publications have claimed recently that iPhone X demand is fading. Image source: Apple.\nHowever, other analysts have cast doubt on these bearish reports. The week before Christmas, prominent analyst Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley named Apple her top pick for 2018, based on rising demand for the iPhone X in China. Meanwhile, Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities stated that the Taiwanese media reports may have erroneously referred to the iPhone X, and that the cuts actually related to the cheaper iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models.\nThe recent reports alleging that Apple is slashing its sales projections for the iPhone X are based on supply chain data, which is notoriously unreliable as a predictor of iPhone sales. Yet the most widely covered report -- the one stating that Apple had cut its iPhone X sales forecast from 50 million to 30 million -- is particularly suspicious.\nTo be quite blunt, the idea that Apple might sell 50 million iPhone X units next quarter is highly implausible. Given that the model has a starting price point of $999, unit sales of 50 million would translate to more than $50 billion of revenue. Including the rest of Apple's iPhone models and its other product lines, this would imply quarterly revenue of close to $100 billion, up from $53 billion a year earlier.\nFor comparison, even the most bullish analyst on Wall Street expects Apple's revenue to hit \"only\" $83 billion next quarter. The average revenue estimate is around $69 billion. Thus, it's extremely unlikely that Apple ever expected to sell 50 million iPhone X devices next quarter. This in turn suggests that the sources for this report aren't reliable.\nShipping about 30 million iPhone X units next quarter would actually be a solid result for Apple, given that other models are also selling reasonably well. Indeed, the X accounted for only 30% of U.S. iPhone sales in its first month of availability, according to a recent report from research company CIRP.\nThat figure was probably depressed due to supply constraints. It's also possible that the iPhone X represents a higher percentage of iPhone sales outside the U.S., especially in status-conscious China. Yet even if the iPhone X accounts for 40"}

{"idx": "37585", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: I must be feeling controversial, because I'm about to start trouble early on a Wednesday morning: When, at the end of last week, President Obama proposed a new college rating system that would hold colleges accountable for affordability, and in tandem, for enrolling greater numbers of low-income students, I sighed with frustration. This is not because I disagree with the president that college has become unaffordable to all but a small percentage of extremely affluent applicants, or that something must be done to rein in stratospheric tuition costs at American universities--whose growth has far surpassed wage increases over any given time period--which saddle new graduates with tens of thousands of dollars in debt before they are even gainfully employed.\nRather, my quibble with the new plan is that it does nothing to dislodge the university system's hegemony over the employment market, such that the price of entry to most professions will continue to be a bachelor's degree. And herein lies the fallacy: Not everyone should go to college (irrespective of its affordability to a given candidate), especially not directly out of high school, and not every profession should require a bachelor's degree to begin climbing the professional ladder--particularly when so many careers teach relevant skills on-the-job nowadays.\nThe concern over low graduation rates in America ignores the fact that college is no longer the great equalizer it was once believed to be; college graduates find dismal job and employment prospects, crushing mountains of student loan debt, and low projected earning potential. Finding ways to mint more college graduates does not address any of these problems.\nMoreover, employers are increasingly finding that college graduates lack the skills to compete in the workforce. Much of this ill-preparedness dates from secondary schools, wherein students are pushed into colleges while still needing extensive remedial coursework, and thus never catch up with their peers who came to college prepared, simply because the education system is unwilling to let go of the prevailing \"college-for-all\" mentality. The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) make a pretense of focusing not only on college-readiness but also on career-readiness, but that's all it is--a pretense. There is no career-tech or trade education to speak of, and--at least in the case of the literacy standards, with their requirements that students consistently make literary connections to Ovid and the Bible from 10th grade onward--only vague allusions to any path other than college, belying any recognition that not all students have the same goals, skills, or interests.\nDon't get me wrong, this is a problem that needs to be solved as much by higher education as by the Department of Labor, through painstaking efforts to foster skill-based jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree, and making it incumbent upon corporations to end the discriminatory practice of stating that a college degree is required in entry-level positions wherein it is not needed. And, by that same token, college should be available and affordable to any student who truly aspires to post-secondary education, for personal or professional goals. But to say that college is the only path, or to address solely the problem of college costs without looking at the issues on either side--varied post-secondary-school goals on one side (not all of which include college), and high rates of unemployment and debt on the other--is to put a band-aid on a problem that is much more far-reaching than simply the price of tuition.\nIt is no less elitist or classist to say, \"Everyone should get a bachelor's degree,\" than"}

Stalls of rickety tables hold small pyramids of onions, tomatoes, bananas, and peanuts, watched by women who have planted, grew, weeded and watered each plant.\nDespite the ZATDC being so close, Ngoma was unaware of its existence. None of the other stallholders had heard of it either. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get training, but we haven\u2019t seen the Chinese, and government hasn\u2019t told us anything. The government doesn\u2019t support us in loans or help us be better farmers,\u201d said Ngoma. The other women nodded in agreement.\nThe programme is part of the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) \u2013 an initiative to reduce poverty through agricultural training \u2013 and its action plan includes three commitments related to women: equality, employment and self-development.\nIn a country where 65% of farmers are female, the centre offers an opportunity to improve women\u2019s livelihoods. However, according to the Agency for Cooperation and Research in Development (ACORD), only 42 of all farmers trained atZATDC are female.\nAccording to the UN, small-scale farmers produce more than 80% of the food requirements in Zambia but productivity is low, with little left over for selling.\nIn neighbouring Tanzania, 80% of farmers are female. Here, the ATDC is located in the tobacco highlands region. Lush small farms, bursting with wheat and rice fields, dominate the landscape. The centre is deep inside the village of Dakawa, surrounded by a high wall, some 250km north of Dar es Salaam.\nBut less than a kilometre down the road, farmers were mystified as theyhad had no idea what went on behind the centre\u2019s walls. \u201cThey\u2019ve been here for years, but we don\u2019t see them.

Yet, the reality plaguing global powerhouses like Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP proved the exact opposite.\nWhile experiencing an influx of funding and increased cash flow from inflated prices, these massive industry leaders experienced nearly decade-long declines from 2005 to 2014. This downfall was primarily ignited by a rise in operational costs stemming from increased taxes, service costs and development fees. Consequently, more than 250,000 oil workers lost their jobs, over two-thirds of oil rigs were decommissioned and a long list of the top players found themselves filing for bankruptcy.\nAs the challenges to scale continued, big oil companies also suffered from extreme functional and structural inefficiencies. Using outdated technology and methods for measuring productivity delayed much needed internal growth. Losing billions annually, oil companies needed an immediate solution for working smarter, while gaining lost ground and revenue.\nToday, in an era marked by progressive strides toward solar and green energy, fueled by conversations about climate change and shifts in the global economy \u2014 the oil and gas industry remains a massive market responsible for generating substantial portions of the world\u2019s wealth.\nFounded in 2009, Seven Lakes Technologies is an enterprise software company that provides smart solutions to upstream oil and gas companies.

As with many other industries, AI automates the monotonous tasks. AI allows pumpers to focus on high-value problems, and not get bogged down with data finding missions. AI recognizes subtle patterns in well data and helps predict when each well will need servicing long before a problem occurs. AI oil and gas systems gradually understand each operational element better, allowing it to quickly identify patterns and, most importantly, generate better predictions, instantaneously and continually.

Which by the way received an A from her professor (sorry Mom is proud). I have visited this pet store as well, and this is just typical of what I have seen too. Hope you enjoy!!\nIn Orange County, the heart of Southern California, buying a pet is just like buying another expensive accessory to complete an outfit. Women peruse the aisles of Russo's Pet Experience at the Fashion Island shopping center in an attempt to either find the pet that will fit perfectly into their designer Louis Vuitton bag or in search of a matching collar to slip onto their pet to avoid a clashing outfit. These women of the OC are regulars in Russo's; they shop with their blonde sun-kissed children for new toys. The children run around the store petting the puppies and knocking on the glass cages- startling the kittens to attract their attention. The children are still innocent and lack the superficial attitude that is sure to come with time in the lavish life of a Newport Beach trust fund baby. While not all the costumers that frequent Russoe's can be categorized into this materialistic genre, one particular family in the store today falls into this stereotype.\nThe family is small and consists of a mother and her son. The mother is tall and blonde, very thin and dressed head to toe in designer clothing- all in the latest fashion of course. She appears to be more concerned with fluffing her hair and fixing her lip gloss than with her child's desperate wish of getting a new puppy. \"Mom, look at the one in the corner!

The little boy seemed to be about nine or ten years old and completely thrilled with the idea of fulfilling his childhood fantasy of having a chocolate lab as his new companion. His mother doesn't seem to hear her son's plea for the chocolate lab puppy as she furiously types away on her Blackberry. She finishes with her phone, places it in her hand bag, and before she directs her attention toward her son, she pulls a Brighton compact mirror out of her purse and takes a look at her perfectly polished makeup.\n\"Mom, Mom, Mom\", the son cries out, in an attempt to pull his mother's attention toward the puppy of his dreams. The mother is still stalling at the front of the store, apparently not being able to walk and text at the same time.

As she talks to the puppy in a baby voice from the other side of the glass cage, it becomes obvious that her excitement is not as genuine as her son's . Her enthusiasm for the potential new pet begins to fade quickly. Her Blackberry beeps and she digs through her purse, directing her attention away from her son..\nJudging from the lack of attention from his mom to the chocolate lab puppy, the little boy has now figured out that he will not be getting the chocolate lab puppy.

Quite a bit of the movie is already in the can, with even more footage to be shot into the New Year. Some of the scenes completed include Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron and Carrie Fisher as General Leia. Only, the Leia scenes are being done without the presence of Carrie Fisher on set, who passed away in December 2016 just a few days after Christmas. Oscar Isaac is opening up about the experience of shooting Poe and Leia scenes alone.\nPoe shared most of his screen time with General Leia in The Last Jedi, when Luke's twin sister wasn't off recovering from her Mary Poppins flight through space. The recent comics have indicated that Leia's blast into the backend of the galaxy really wrecked her health, and the effects are suspected to bring about her untimely demise as a character.\nAs most fans know by now, J.J. Abrams will be using discarded footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. While Carrie's own physical appearance won't be manipulated by a few finger strokes of the computer, it's sounding more and more like she will get a new digitally altered wardrobe, and it's possible that there will be some voice and mouth manipulation for newly created dialogue. That's all speculation at the moment. Some of the funnier forces online refer to the on-screen resurrection of Leia as J.J. Abrams' Plan 9 instead of Episode IX, because it mirrors Ed Wood's resurrection of Bela Lugosi in Plan 9 From outer Space, which utilized old film of the late actor to sell that cult classic sci-fi trash. Let's hope Episode 9 proves to be better than Plan 9. Because if it's not, this franchise really is in trouble.\nNo story points for Star Wars 9 have been revealed at this time, though that hasn't stopped many from speculating about the plot, which will bring the Skywalker saga to a close after 9 movies and countless novels, comics, and a handful of animated TV shows. So it's not known exactly what General Leia will be doing in the movie. Asked about that aspect of the sequel, Oscar Isaac says that the movie handles Leia's story in, 'A really beautiful way'. And that the end of her story is, 'beautiful'. It also sounds like we're getting more Leia than expected.\n\"The story deals with that quite a bit. It's a strange thing to be on the set and to be speaking of Leia and having Carrie not be around. There's definitely some pain in that.\"\nOscar Isaac is quick to assure everyone that J.J. Abrams and his team will not disappoint fans with how they handle Leia's ultimate exit from the franchise. The actor goes onto say that having The Force Awakens director back in the captain's seat has allowed for things to be 'remarkably looser'.\n\"Since everything just feels way looser and people aren't taking it quite as seriously. I think that that energy is gonna translate to a really great movie.\"\nAfter Star Wars 9 wraps, Oscar Isaac will be taking a year long break from acting. It has been rumored that the first Star Wars 9 trailer will drop during the Super Bowl, at which time J.J. Abrams should be done shooting and starting the post-production process for release that December. For those hoping to get their first look at Luke and Leia in the Super Bowl"}

The Pope defined the Church in the country as \"young and dynamic.\u201d He also explained the fundamental role of the laity, martyrs and youth in its history.\nIn recent days I made an Apostolic Journey to Korea and today, together with you, I thank the Lord for this great gift. My journey enabled me to visit a young and dynamic Church, founded on the testimony of martyrs and filled with missionary zeal, in a country which is a point of encounter between ancient Asian cultures and the perennial newness of the Gospel: both are encountered.\nOnce again I wish to express my gratitude to my dear brother Bishops of Korea, to the President of the Republic, to the other Authorities and to all those who collaborated in my visit.\nThe significance of this Apostolic Journey can be summed up in three words: memory, hope and witness.\nThe Republic of Korea is a country whose economic development is remarkably rapid. Its inhabitants are hardworking, disciplined and organized, and must maintain the strength inherited from their ancestors.\nIn this setting, the Church is the guardian of memory and hope: she is a spiritual family in which the adults pass on to the young the torch of faith received from their forebears. The memory of past witnesses becomes a new witness in the present and hope for the future. One can read, from this perspective, the two principal events of this journey: the beatification of the 124 Korean Martyrs, who join those canonized by St John Paul II 30 years ago; and the encounter with young people on the occasion of the Sixth Asian Youth Day.\nA young person is always a person in search of something worth living for, and a Martyr bears witness to something, rather to Someone worth giving one\u2019s life for. This reality is the Love of God, which was made flesh in Jesus, the Witness of the Father. In two moments of the journey dedicated to young people, the Spirit of the Risen Lord filled us with joy and hope, which the young people will take back to their countries, and that will do so much good!\nIn Korea the Church also safeguards the memory of the primary role played by lay people, both at the dawn of the faith and in the work of evangelization. In that land, in fact, the Christian community was not founded by missionaries but by a group of young Koreans in the latter half of the 1700s. They were captivated by several Christian texts which they studied in depth and chose as their rule of life. One of them was sent to Peking to receive Baptism and then this layman baptized his companions. From that first core a great community developed, which from the very start and for about a century was subjected to violent persecution, with thousands of martyrs. Thus, the Church in Korea was founded on faith, on missionary commitment and on the martyrdom of the lay faithful.\nThe first Korean Christians chose the apostolic community of Jerusalem as a model, practicing fraternal love which overcomes every social difference. This is why I have encouraged modern Christians to be generous in sharing with the poorest and the excluded, in line with Chapter 25 of the Gospel according to Matthew: \u201cas you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me\u201d (v. 40).\nDear brothers and sisters, it is seen in the history of the faith in Korea that Christ does not nullify cultures, he does not suppress the journey of the peoples who, over centuries and millennia"}

The strategic objective of the ISIS leadership seems to be to create a new generation of ideologically committed fighters wedded to its vision of a so-called global Caliphate and utterly desensitised to the use of extreme violence to destroy unbelievers and apostates that stand in their way.\nObservers on the ground in Raqqa, for example, the putative capital of ISIS in Syria, have testified how hundreds of orphaned Syrian children were brought together into converted schools where they were from day one, immersed in the virulent extremist ideology of ISIS on the one hand and trained to handle weapons on the other.\nMoreover, recent videos uploaded by ISIS \u2013 sadly, only a click away \u2013 have documented \u201ctraining exercises\u201d where so-called \u201cCubs of the Caliphate\u201d engage in \u201csearch-and-destroy\u201d type missions to hunt down terrified captured prisoners and execute them in cold blood. Southeast Asia is not immune to these disturbing trends.\nBy some estimates, about a thousand fighters and their families from the region, mainly Indonesians and Malaysians, but also a handful of Singaporeans, have made their way to Syria. There, they have been organised into a Malay-speaking unit under ISIS command, called Katibah Nusantara (KN), or the Malay Archipelago Unit.\nMore to the point, the children of KN have been training in the so-called Azzam Academy \u2013 named after the ideological mentor of Al Qaeda icon Osama bin Laden \u2013 and a Malay-language video uploaded on social media in 2015 proclaimed that these next generation of Southeast Asian fighters would aim to \u201cfinish all oppressors, disbelievers, apostates\u201d.\nWhile there are many formal definitions of youth adopted by international bodies such as the United Nations Secretariat and the World Bank, a fairly common standard identifies \u201cyouth\u201d as someone aged between 15 and 35. On the other hand the UNICEF Convention on the Rights of the Child adopts a definition of \u201cyouth\u201d as \u201cchild until 18\u201d. In any case, many observers have opined that ISIS is a \u201cyouth organisation\u201d. The question is why.\nThe answer is complex, but three factors appear pertinent.\nFirst, neurologically, youth are very sensitive to contextual pressures. If the social milieu is defined by amicable intergroup relations, the brains of young people will be hardwired accordingly to promote similar social arrangements when older. Conversely if youth \u2013 like the unfortunate Cubs of the Caliphate \u2013 are socialised into out-group violence and trauma from young, their neurological architecture will be configured differently, creating a potentially lifelong affinity for violence and visceral antipathy toward certain out-groups.\nSecond, family structure has been shown to affect the emotional stability of youth. Research worldwide suggests that the absence of strong, stable parental influence in the formative years creates a psychological instability and need for both external structures of emotional support and absolute cognitive certainty.

But if you have a few hours, a few beers, some leather and a needle and thread, you too can make a gorgeous, top-quality bag of your own. No sewing machine required.\nYou'll need everything you see here; click this or any photo to enlarge. Clockwise, from left: A cutting mat and ruler; Wood glue or PVA glue; A magnetic purse clasp; A hammer; A measuring tape; A flat chisel; Linen thread, such as that suitable for bookbinding; Sewing scissors; A rotary cutter; An awl; A lump of beeswax; And four strong, long needles, such as those used for bookbinding. Technically, you don't necessarily need the cutting mat, the ruler, or the rotary cutter \u2014 you could do all your measuring and cutting out with a tape measure and your sewing scissors. But with leather, I personally find it a lot easier and more precise to use the rotary cutter.\nLast but in no way least, you'll need some leather. If you live in a city where you can obtain leather at a good fabric or specialty store, you're in luck! I found this most excellent goat skin at a spot in New York's Garment District last Friday. But if you don't, you can also buy leather online from a number of retailers \u2014 call and ask questions, to check you're getting what you think you're getting \u2014 and there's plenty of leather and bag findings available on eBay. The obvious drawback with buying leather sight unseen is that you can't touch it until it arrives, but I've had wonderful results from eBay leather finds. When I decided to teach myself how to work in leather, I made my first three bags from a giant half cowhide I got on eBay for like $40.\nIf you've never worked with leather before, you should know that it's sold priced per square foot, and, like denim, its heavy-dutiness is measured in weight per square foot \u2014 the higher the number of ounces, the thicker the hide. Many leather retailers will only sell whole hides, but you can find partial hides readily on eBay. For this bag, you'll need a small hide or a part of a hide, totalling about 5-6 square feet. And you'll want to use at least 6oz. leather. Leather needn't be expensive \u2014 my goat hide was $44.37, a fraction of the cost of a new handbag, let alone a nice leather one, and I have enough left over to make a wallet or a coin purse \u2014 but it's worth paying for quality: you want full-grain leather (that's leather that hasn't been cut laterally, or \"split,\" in order to double or triple the area of the hide), not a resurfaced (\"corrected-grain\") split. Leather is skin; it has a kind of integrity that you don't want to interrupt, if at all possible. Compared with corrected-grain splits or top-grain leather (which is the uppermost part of a split hide), full-grain leather is stronger, develops a nicer patina, and performs better over time.\nIf you don't want to make a leather bag, you can still use this tutorial \u2014 just cut the pattern in a different fabric,"}

Janis, a respected plastic surgeon, helped save Wiens' life immediately after the accident. Like any ambitious doctor in the United States, he attends every medical conference he can. At one symposium, Janis listened to a presentation by Bohdan Pomahac, the director of the Burn Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston.\nPomahac, a native of the Czech Republic, reported on the initial experiences with partial face transplants. But, more importantly, Pomahac had access to a generous research budget that would enable him to fund at least half a dozen transplants. The US Department of Defense has awarded him a $3.5 million (\u00802.5 million) grant to conduct further research on facial surgery, which could also benefit wounded soldiers.\nJanis first told Pomahac the unfortunate story of Dallas Wiens at the conference. When Pomahac saw Wiens for the first time, he almost rejected him as a candidate. Pomahac had seen few faces in his career as badly damaged as Wiens'.\nNevertheless, Pomahac had his team take a closer look at Wiens, analyzing his tissue, his blood vessels and his nerves. They made 3-D images of his head, a model of his damaged skull and models of the missing bone segments that would have to be taken from a donor at a later date.\nThey also spoke with Wiens who -- contrary to his doctors' predictions -- had learned how to speak again. Indeed, it is quite possible that Wiens' positive attitude, his characteristically Texan optimism and his unbroken faith in all kinds of things ultimately convinced the team in Boston to accept him as a candidate. Wiens was fearless.\nHe wanted his chance, and he would get it.\nBoston is sacred ground for doctors the world over. Harvard Medical School is surrounded by several major hospitals and famous research centers that together cover the area of a small city. In one of the buildings, the \"Ether Dome,\" the first operation performed with ether anesthesia took place in 1846, and on Dec. 23, 1954 Joseph Murray, who would later receive the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, performed the first successful human kidney transplant between identical twin brothers.\nIn the early days, organ transplantation was a grim guessing game. Few patients survived the procedures, or they died because overdoses of X-ray radiation had overly weakened their immune defenses. The equipment, the computers and the analytical technology with which humans can now be dissected down to the cell level simply didn't exist at that time.\nBy comparison, when it was lying on the operating table at Brigham in March 2011, Wiens' body was like an open book. Only two people before him, one in Spain and one in France, had received complete donor faces, and now it was his turn.\nThe video of the 15-hour operation, edited down to a few minutes, makes the procedure seem much less complex than it actually was. It shows a group of doctors standing quietly around the table, wearing extremely powerful loupe systems on their heads. There is also a blue refrigerated box with a white lid. It presumably held the donor face preserved in a sterile plastic bag placed inside another bag filled with water that was, in turn, surrounded by ice.\nThe basic goal of the operation was to remove the face from the dead person along with all underlying tissue, nerves"}

We\u2019re seeing local retailers that specialize in things ranging from perfume and novelty gifts cut their signature inventories to create space for sandal selling.\nWhat could possibly be causing the hotness of the footwear other than actual heat? The short answer seems to be Latin America. Filipinos have always favored rubber sandals because of their affordability and their practicality in the context of a tropical country that never gets that cold. The problem was that rubber sandals eventually became a stigma of poverty as they were so accessible. They became associated with the term \"pambahay\" (meaning, fit to wear only inside your own home). Then fashion flip flop brands like Havaianas and Dupe from Brazil as well as Reef from Argentina broke through the borders. All of a sudden, rubber sandals didn\u2019t have to be cheap or pedestrian.

Zoellick said Wednesday after a round of meetings on the subject in Beijing.\nHis comments suggested that China, despite heavy lobbying, had left doubts as to whether it would back a proposal by Britain, France and Germany, supported by the United States, to involve the United Nations Security Council in deciding how to handle Iran's nuclear program, including whether to impose penalties.\nMr. Zoellick said he emphasized that he viewed the United States and China as having a common interest in preventing Iran from developing atomic weapons, as well as a mutual concern about energy security in the Middle East, and he said he believed China shared those \"core principles.\"\nBut he called the diplomatic discussions fluid and said differences remained over what steps should be taken to respond to what Western powers say is a covert program by Iran to build nuclear bombs.\n\"It would not surprise me that China would not want to take exactly the same course as the E.U.-3 and the U.S.,\" Mr. Zoellick said during a brief stop in Chengdu in southwestern China after meeting with Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, and Li Zhaoxing, its foreign minister, in Beijing. The E.U.-3 refers to Britain, France and Germany.\n\"We will see how close we can come,\" he added.\nChina is considered crucial if foreign powers hope to use pressure to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China could use its veto power to scuttle any penalties. Europe and the United States have argued that diplomatic steps to constrain Iran's nuclear program will have greater effect if China and Russia support them.\nBut China has long opposed the use of penalties in international affairs and has argued that continued negotiations are the best way to resolve the nuclear dispute with Iran, as well as the one involving North Korea.\nA spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Kong Quan, repeated Tuesday that China preferred to steer Iran back to negotiations rather than to talk of penalties for not complying with its commitments to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nMr. Kong said China was \"conscientiously studying\" a draft proposal by the Europeans to have the atomic energy agency refer the matter to the Security Council, and he did not rule out supporting the proposal.\n\"But on the other hand, we believe that further applying diplomatic efforts and diplomatic means to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue remain relatively suitable and better options,\" he said at a briefing.\nIran supplies about 12 percent of China's oil imports, which have become increasingly crucial to its booming economy, and the two nations have signed agreements to increase oil and gas shipments. Chinese foreign policy specialists say Beijing has signaled a greater willingness to discuss imposing penalties on Iran than on North Korea, which has openly acknowledged defying international agreements to pursue atomic weapons.\nThat may be partly because China has not traditionally sought to exert as much sway in the Middle East as it has in North Korea, and because Iran recently broke off negotiations with Europe over its nuclear program, provoking a relatively sharp reaction from Beijing.\nBut they say it remains an open question whether China will back strong-arm tactics against Iran, abstain from any decision on the matter or, in a move that it could put it in conflict with other major powers, reject the use of penalties altogether.\nMr. Zoellick has urged China to be more assertive with Iran to show that it"}

Pebbled surface is grippy without being sticky. Easy to balance. Nice to look at.\nI love the smell of neoprene in the morning, and that\u2019s not just an Apocalypse Now reference. It\u2019s the truth. If you've ever surfed, the smells of neoprene, wax, and salt water all have powerful memories attached to them.\nIt\u2019s just too bad that neoprene, as a material, is terrible for the environment. It\u2019s made from petrochemicals in a process that is extremely energy-intensive, and it doesn\u2019t ever break down. Before people started cutting and sewing it into wetsuits to help maintain your core temperature in the water, the material was used to line landfills. It\u2019s gross.\nShields, a former environmental attorney, saw piles of used and damaged wetsuits and realized that there was a problem in the surfing industry. He started collecting the neoprene in bins in surf shops up and down the West Coast\u2014from British Columbia to Ensenada, Mexico\u2014and remade it into premium-quality yoga mats. The name \u201cSuga\u201d comes from combining the words \u201csurfing\u201d and \u201cyoga\u201d and was founded in that epicenter of surfing, yoga and karmic goodness known as Encinitas, California.\nIn addition to used wetsuits at surf shops, he\u2019s also working with wetsuit manufacturers to collect their scraps. Suga mats are then made in American factories for distribution.\nI\u2019ve been using a Suga mat for a week. The regular-sized Suga is slightly larger than the standard yoga mat\u2014six feet long, instead of 68 inches\u2014and has a distinctive, mottled black and gray surface that is studded with different colors. They also sell an XL mat that measures 75 inches by 26 inches. It looks and feels, more or less, like shredded wetsuits repurposed into a yoga mat.\nThe dimpled surface feels grippy and the material absorbs moisture from my sweaty hands and feet. As you would expect from a mat made from wetsuits, it\u2019s also easy to clean. Brushing off dirt and dog hair has been easy, but, like a wetsuit, you can also hose it down and let it dry.\nThe mat is extremely durable. My dogs often mistake my yoga mats for an impromptu dog bed, and my mats quickly become stippled with claw-sized craters. So far, the Suga Mat has survived my pets unscathed. The mats also come with a 30-day warranty, and you can send your used mats back to Suga for recycling. You can also purchase a Suga C2G (Cradle to Grave), which guarantees you a yoga mat for life. If the mat gets damaged, send it back to Suga for recycling and get a new one.\nI have two complaints. First, with its 5mm thickness, this mat is pretty heavy (they also sell a travel yoga mat that is 3 mm thick and weighs less than three pounds). It\u2019s significantly heavier than my usual Gaiam foam mat. That\u2019s because the mat is significantly denser as well, which is my second complaint. In comparison to my other yoga mats, it feels less cushy.\nMany yoga mats use soft open-cell foam"}

Gangs may have been involved; one arrest has been made.\nThe shooting is one reason why gun-control advocates here are pushing hard for a stiff gun-possession law in Boston. The legislation, called a home-rule petition, would ban anyone under 21 from owning a firearm. It would also make it a crime to sell a gun to anyone under 21.\n``This home-rule petition ... would give police an additional tool to legitimately stop and investigate people who objectively appear to be under the age of 21 and carrying a firearm,'' says Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph Martin II.\nThirteen states and Washington, D.C., have enacted similar laws, says Deahdra Butler-Henderson, president of Citizens For Safety, a city crime-watch group.\nFor Boston, the home-rule petition would increase penalties for the possession or sale of handguns. Fines would be raised to $1,000 and jail terms increased to up to 2-1/2 years.\nThe measure can become law only if is it passed by both houses of the Massachusetts legislature and signed by the governor.

Those in the red zone face paying the tax, while anyone in the orange section could be taxed if they make additional voluntary contributions. Charts have been compiled for pay rises of 5pc and 10pc; inflation is assumed to be 2pc.\nThe tax charge is based on the value of the notional fund that would be needed to pay your eventual pension, irrespective of your actual contributions. Because your pension entitlement rises for each year of membership of a final salary scheme, the value of this \"fund\" also rises every year.\nThe rise in value of your \"fund\" is bigger if you receive a pay rise. Under the tax rules, the \"fund\" is worth 16 times the income you are entitled to. If the value of the fund, calculated on this basis, exceeds the value a year previously by more than the annual tax-free allowance (after an allowance for inflation) (after an allowance for inflation), you have to pay tax on the excess.\nThe increase in value of the fund is added to your income for tax purposes, so you pay the pensions element at your highest rate. The increase in the value of your pension could even take you into a higher tax bracket altogether.\nCurrently, employees can also carry over three years' unused annual tax allowances.\nIf you are hit with a tax bill, you may have the option of paying it from your pension rather than from your pocket. But working out which is the better option is complicated.\n\"For final salary members, paying the tax directly or through the fund is a complex decision,\" said Chris Noon, a partner at Hymans Robertson. \"Generally, if the rate at which the trustees convert pension into cash to pay the tax is neutral, paying the tax through the fund is usually a better option.\n\"However, these 'commutation' terms are typically poor value, meaning that additional thought is required in considering which option to take.\""}

But as it turns out Fahmy is also a painter and a sculptor.\nIt had been sunny on Sunday 9 November but by the time I reached the Picasso Art Gallery the late afternoon had brought a cold breeze to Zamalek. Entering the well-lit hall, I was greeted by Fahmy\u2019s warm smile while Albinoni\u2019s Adagio in G Minor played.

Fahmy\u2019s interest in art comes as no surprise, though imagining him with paints and brush will no doubt raise eyebrows.\n\u201cOver the past years, the media world held me into its web but I\u2019ve always admired visual art and this exhibition is the culmination of a 30-year personal journey with art and life,\u201d Fahmy explains as he walks me through his work.\nWhenever he had the opportunity, whether in Egypt or abroad, he would visit venues where treasures of the art world were on display, admiring the different schools and techniques that have emerged through the centuries.\nThis recalled numerous stories he had told me \u2013 Fahmy is a great storyteller \u2013 of his travels, especially to France, where he would spend a lot of time at the Louvre, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and many other spaces, often taking his daughter along so she could share in his passion.\nAnd even now, once Fahmy hears of anyone travelling, he will instantly start recommending museums and galleries at the destination.\n\u201cVisual culture is very important to me, and its variety fascinates me. I have never restricted myself to one form or preferred one trend over another,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cForms and Colours\u201d is not an accidental title, nor is it merely a catch-all phrase to describe a heterogeneous collection.\nThe show reflects Fahmy\u2019s understanding of the visual world and the different if still coherently connected ways in which he transposes it onto canvas.\nIf we were to insist on classifications, we might say that his work reflects a mixture of cubism and abstraction (expressionism and tachism) with elements of impressionism and art nouveau. Fahmy mixes and matches techniques, using sfumato and divisionism but perhaps most consistently impasto, which dominates many works.\nBut since he doesn\u2019t care too much about the technique he\u2019s employing or the art school to which this technique subscribes \u2013 he says he only wants to express himself in the most suitable way \u2013 it seems more sensible to enjoy the forms and colours, avoiding classifications altogether.\n\u201cThe French painter \u00c9douard Manet said that visual art is much richer and much more important when it is a reflection of nature and its components. By this he means that the role of visual art is to teach us how to look, how to perceive,\u201d Fahmy says, carefully choosing his words as he explains how the shapes and colours in his work reflect a deeply personal perception of the world and of emotion.\nAs a child of that centuries-long process, Fahmy has a mind soaked in imagination."}

Today it may have finally figured out how: Buy a supermarket.\nIn its biggest acquisition ever, Amazon has agreed to buy the Whole Foods supermarket chain for $13.7 billion. Given the Everything Store\u2019s adventures in groceries so far, this promises to redefine what a trip to the grocery store looks like.\nAlthough the deal surprised a lot of people, the e-commerce giant has long wanted to figure out the online groceries game. It started testing delivery concepts in August 2007, when it unveiled Amazon Fresh\u2014delivering produce and pantry staples through its fulfillment centers. Yet even after a decade\u2014eons in Silicon Valley time\u2014it's still trying. Turns out, the instant gratification business doesn't quite work with fresh food.\nStill, the market is just too lucrative\u2014and too primed for disruption\u2014for Amazon to simply give up.\nA recent report from the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen found that the US grocery sector could grow five-fold in the next decade, with consumers spending upward of $100 billion by 2025. While around a quarter of US households currently shop online for groceries\u2014up from 20 percent just three years ago\u2014more than 70 percent will do so within 10 years, according to the report.\nAmazon saw the potential here early on, but Amazon Fresh still hasn't caught on in any meaningful way. Selling fresh food requires a more hands-on experience than delivering the typical Amazon package does. A lot of the stuff you buy in a grocery store spoils easily, which means you have to get them home quickly\u2014plus, someone has to be there to receive the goods. That can be tricky, given how Amazon likes to optimize delivery routes and bundle items to maximize efficiency. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with milk,\u201d says Goldberg.\nThat explains why Amazon has shifted from figuring out how to deliver fresh food to remaking the grocery store.\nTake AmazonFresh Pickup, which launched in March. Customers order groceries online, then drive to an Amazon-run store, where employees bring the bags right to their car. Walmart and Kroger offer similar services, but need two to four hours to get an order together. Amazon does it in 15 minutes.\nAnother Amazon concept looks even further into the future. In December, Amazon launched a beta of Amazon Go, a supermarket with no cashiers. Just grab and go; embedded sensors and other technology keep track of what you bought. So far, only Amazon employees can shop at one Amazon Go location by the company's headquarters; technical issues have kept the company from rolling it out.\nBoth models aim to minimize friction in the shopping experience\u2014and, it should be said, reduce labor costs. In Amazon's world, you don't even get out of the car. And if you do enter a supermarket, you can get what you want without so much as reaching for your wallet or phone.\nBefore that can happen, though, Amazon must make sure its wild ideas will work at scale. \u201cThe question is, how can they accelerate this?\u201d says ChannelAdvisor executive chairman Scot Wingo, an analyst who tracks Amazon closely.\nLooking beyond delivery methods, Amazon could use Whole Foods stores to market its own electronics and products.

The solar-powered rover has been in operation for nearly 15 years \u2014 but if its batteries dip below 24 volts of electrical charge, it\u2019s programmed to put nearly all its systems into sleep mode and wait until the batteries are sufficiently charged up.

Anyone who's played a video game (and the film is certainly evocative of one, with its soldiers clanking around in multi-weapon mech suits) will immediately realize how cleverly the premise evokes the experience: Cruise's William Cage can try anything, die in the process, and reboot. There's no further save point, but at the very least he can learn from his experience.\nThe premise seems annoyingly cute on paper (not helped by the \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" advertising) but director Doug Liman and writers Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth quickly know how much fun they can have with it. Cage is a PR tool for the military in its losing war with the squid-like \"Mimic\" aliens who have already conquered Europe, but at the beginning of the film he's dropped into the front lines after resisting orders to do so. The first go-round introduces his bullish sergeant (a scenery-chewing Bill Paxton) and fellow squaddie meatheads, and from afar we hear of the heroic exploits of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Then they're dropped into battle and everything goes horribly wrong.\nLiman makes you feel the carnage of the battle and Cage's utter inexperience, even though anyone who's seen any advertising for this film knows it'll end with him dying and resetting. He hasn't had a hit in years, but Liman has always been a dynamic director, particularly when it comes to action\u2014Go had the verve of a film with ten times the budget, he set up the visual motifs Paul Greengrass expanded on in the Bourne films, and he even did his best to liven up the terminally flat Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\nThe lived-in mech suits recall Edge of Tomorrow's Japanese origins\u2014the film was based on a Japanese 'light novel,' an illustrated book aimed at teens\u2014and the \"Mimic\" aliens are wonderfully designed. Liman's team understands that if you're going to create creatures from pure CG, don't just make them look like animated puppets. The Mimics are a roaring mass of tentacles and flashing lights, vibrating with each step and whirling around the screen whenever they attack. They're a genuinely baffling threat.\nBut the film really comes into its own once Cage starts resetting. Then he can meet Rita, who he encounters on the battlefield and eventually realizes once shared his affliction. He can beef up his action credentials, of course, experiencing the same battles over and over again and training alongside Rita mercilessly for what we can only assume is a countless amount of days. Edge quickly starts jumping forward, making the safe call that the audience gets what's going on. We don't need to see Cage re-start every day, and eventually our perspective shifts to Rita, who's a little surprised but quickly on the ball for every new day, as the extent of Cage's experiences become too vast for us to comprehend.\nBlunt is by far the best screen"}

The upshot is that customers are buying for the long-term, which in turn has an effect on what products make it to the marketplace.

The proof, Strassel says, is that the president's stated goal--that \"80% of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources\" by 2035--can only be met if companies are forced to shift how they produce their energy. What's new here, Strassel notes, is that the energy portfolio tack no longer allows companies to shoulder a tax burden in exchange for carbon output. Instead, they're being given a mandate. Further, Strassel says, the speech appeared to embrace options such as clean coal and nuclear power, but these are merely words to \"lure Republicans into negotiations ... and gives cover to nervous coal state Democrats.\" The reality, she says, is that \"these promises mean little.

If you want to be someone who contributes to world historical debates, you almost certainly won\u2019t succeed if you start off by contributing to world historical debates. The most important thing to do is to be talking about the things that have, as we might put it, world historical resonance but at the level at which you can be influential. If your contribution to the conversation then gets picked up and becomes part of a larger conversation or part of conversations happening elsewhere as well, then so be it and so much the better.\nSo I don\u2019t think intellectuals do very well talking about the need for the world to be democratic, or the need for human rights to be better respected worldwide. It\u2019s not that the statement falls short of the desirable, but it contributes very little to either achieving its goal or adding to the rigor of the conversation. Whereas the same person, really showing exactly what\u2019s defective about democracy and democracies, sets a much better base for the argument that ours is a democracy that others should be encouraged to emulate. Merely saying that ours is a democracy or saying that I\u2019m not interested in ours but I want to help make yours encourages the response: well, go away and fix yours and then maybe you\u2019ll have a foreign audience, and so on. So in order to be international, we have to be national first.\nWhat should we be caring about today? We are at the end of a very long cycle of improvement. A cycle that began in the late eighteenth century and that, notwithstanding everything that\u2019s happened since, continued essentially through the 1990s: the steady widening of the circle of countries whose rulers were constrained to accept something like the rule of law. I think that it was overlain from the 1960s onward by two different but related spreads: of economic and individual freedom. Those two latter developments, which look as though they are related to the first one, are in fact potentially dangerous to it."}

Since that time, not only have they delivered on their promise, they've far exceeded expectations. \"Detail Kommander's electronic payment platform has achieved a 100% payment and collection rate for all client agencies and officers since day 1, and they no longer have to worry about slow or non-payers for their extra duty work\", said retired Chief Bill Kicklighter, CEO of Kommander Software.\nDetail Kommander is the first software to bring Off Duty and Extra Duty management into the 21st century. Payment and collections are just one part of the overall reengineered process for Off Duty Detail management, but it's an important one. Detail Kommander's electronic payment platform is the very first of its kind and continues to separate Detail Kommander from any other system in the industry\", said Bill Kicklighter, CEO. \"As a former Chief, I know that many agencies try to use a scheduling system to manage their Off Duty Details, but there is so much more to secondary employment than simply scheduling\". The industry was in great need of a solution dedicated to solving all of the challenges associated with off duty or extra duty detail management, and with Detail Kommander, law enforcement and public safety agencies nationwide finally have that complete solution.\nUsing an innovative approach that combines advanced software engineering and financial technology, Detail Kommander provides immediate benefits and efficiencies to agenciesand officers, as well as businesses hiring off-duty law enforcement personnel. From electronic payment by the business to officers and/or agencies receiving funds by direct deposit, Detail Kommander streamlines the entire process in a way never imagined. It's the first ever end to end electronic solution and it allows agencies to maintain complete control over the entire process, including payments.\nDetail Kommander offers proprietary features such as a Custom Fairness Engine, Officer Rating System, Officer Status Updates and Electronic Payment options. An automated, fair process for posting, signing up and selecting officers for off-duty jobs is critical, as is a method to ensure officer's times on the job are recorded. Detail Kommander allows agencies to use their own policies and practices to customize the application while taking advantage of powerful software engineering that does the heavy lifting and task work for them.\n\"We couldn't be more pleased with the response by agencies to Detail Kommander\", said Jordan Clark, Business Development Manager. \"We are so proud to support first responders and provide them with a tool that saves their agencies significant time and money.\"\nDetail Kommander is a great solution for any size agency, large or small, and it's extremely budget friendly. Most agencies can even obtain it for no cost.

His current totals already place him among the Griffins\u2019 top all-time single-season performers in first goals (T2nd), power play goals (4th), points (9th) and assists (12th).\nOn Feb. 7, Haydar became the 73rd player in AHL history to reach 500 career points, a distinction that briefly was his alone among active players. He posted a 10-game point streak from Feb. 20 to March 13 that tied for the seventh-longest in franchise history and included his first hat trick as a Griffin, on Feb. 27 at Syracuse.\nHaydar has captained the Griffins to their 10th playoff berth in 13 seasons, leading the way with his remarkable offensive consistency. He has registered points in 39 of Grand Rapids\u2019 last 50 games, never going without a point for more than two consecutive contests during that stretch.\nHaydar earned the second postseason all-star honor of his career through voting by AHL coaches, players and media in each of the league\u2019s 29 member cities, adding to his 2006-07 First Team selection as a member of the Chicago Wolves. He is the first Griffin to be chosen for an AHL All-Star Team since 2005-06, when Donald MacLean (First Team LW), Jiri Hudler (Second Team LW) and Bryan Helmer (Second Team D) were tabbed.\nOne of the most decorated players in AHL history, Haydar became the league\u2019s all-time leading playoff scorer last season while leading Chicago to the Calder Cup, which followed his first AHL championship as a member of the 2003-04 Milwaukee Admirals. His personal honors have included the 2002-03 Dudley (Red) Garrett Memorial Award as the league\u2019s outstanding rookie, the 2006-07 Les Cunningham Award as the AHL\u2019s most valuable player, the 2006-07 John B.

A pediatrician \"saw a little uptick in the kids' [body mass index], and he kind of pulled me aside,\" she said.\n\"I was shocked at first because I thought I was doing what I was supposed to do, and I hadn't noticed any changes in my kids, so it was a little bit shocking and a little disorienting,\" Obama said. \"But I went home, and it was kind of a wake-up call, and we made some changes even with busy schedules.\"\nThe changes, she said, included smaller portion sizes, more cooked meals, a dessert ban on weekdays and substituting sugary drinks with milk, water and fresh-squeezed juices. \"The point is that small changes made a difference,\" she said.\nThat interview aired hours after she announced the Let's Move initiative at the White House. The program focuses on what families, communities and the public and private sectors can do to help fight childhood obesity, which she and health experts have termed an epidemic in the United States.\n\"There are more and more kids with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure today than ever before.

Source: CIA World Factbook.\nOn December 21, around the time that half the world was busy decking the halls with boughs of holy, in the small and hidden African country of Djibouti, up to nineteen people were shot down in the street by the government\u2019s security forces. According to Voice of America, troops targeted the commemoration of a late religious leader that had been very influential among the nation\u2019s opposition circles. Indeed, a leading opposition figure, Ahmed Yusuf, was wounded in the raid, along with an opposition MP and dozens of civilians.\nThe United States State Department issued a statement urging restraint and respect of the freedom of speech by the government, but it remains to be seen whether Washington\u2019s appeals will fall on receptive ears. What\u2019s more, the attacks come at a delicate time, as Djibouti is slated to hold a crucial presidential election later this year, in April.\nNestled up against the Red Sea, Djibouti is a little bigger than the US state of New Jersey, and shares land borders with Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Formerly a part of the Land of Punt, Djibouti voted its way to independence from its French colonial masters in 1977. It\u2019s the home of about 800,000 people, mostly Muslim, and, though multi-ethnic, it is relatively free from conflicts among those groups, thanks in part to the autocratic regime of incumbent president Ismail Omar Guelleh.\nA recent expose written by the Daily Beast\u2019s Tim Mak paints a harrowing image of a country exploited by a venal political class at the expense of an oppressed population. Initially elected to the presidency in 1999, Guelleh is seen by many as a run-of-the-mill tyrant, crushing opposition and consolidating power as he goes. When Djibouti found itself caught up in the Arab Spring of 2011, Guelleh\u2019s henchmen quickly and harshly put down the protests, and Guelleh won a controversial election boycotted by opposition parties whose candidates were twice jailed prior to polling. Predictably, the aging Guelleh announced late last year that he intends to run for a fourth consecutive term.\nDjibouti\u2019s Isma\u00efl Omar Guelleh. Photo by Robert D. Ward, US Government, Wikipedia Commons.\nUnlike other African strongmen that have been on the receiving end of Western criticism, Djibouti\u2019s Guelleh was largely spared. Why? Because the small African country has deftly leveraged its single strength, its strategic location at the mouth of the Red Sea, to cram the armies of seven militaries on its shores. Japan has its only post-World War II military base there, the French still maintain a military presence, and so do the Americans, Italians, Germans, Spanish, and soon the Chinese.\nArguably the most important and only US military base in Africa, Camp Lemonnier, is located on a spot first used by the French Foreign Legion.

The Bravo blast \u201crepresented as revolutionary an advance in explosive power over the atomic bomb as the atomic bomb had over the conventional weapons of World War II,\u201d historian-lawyer Jonathan Weisgall notes.\nThe massive U.S. hydrogen bomb explosion codenamed Bravo detonated on March 1, 1954, over the Pacific Ocean.\nAlso unlike Hiroshima\u2019s A-bomb, Bravo was laced with plutonium, a most toxic element with a radioactive existence of half a million years that may be hazardous to humans for at least half that time.\nAnd, unlike the atomic airburst above Hiroshima, Bravo was a shallow-water ground burst. It vaporized three of the 23 islands of tiny Bikini Atoll, 2,600 miles southwest of Hawaii, and created a crater that is visible from space.\nA fireball nearly as hot as the center of the sun sucked unto itself water, mud and millions of tons of coral that had been pulverized into ash by the incredible explosion; these clung to tons of radioactive uranium fragments. The fireball swooshed heavenwards, forming a shimmering white mushroom cloud that hovered over the proving grounds of Bikini and Enewetak atolls, whose inhabitants had earlier been evacuated.\nWafting eastward, the cloud powdered 236 islanders on Rongelap and Utrik atolls and 28 U.S. servicemen. The islanders played with, drank and ate the snowflake-like particles for days and began suffering nausea, hair loss, diarrhea and skin lesions when they were finally evacuated to a U.S. military clinic.\nBravo bequeathed the world a new word: fallout. Even before Bravo, experts, but not the public knew that the radioactive powder of atmospheric nuclear weapons explosions was invisibly dusting the continental U.S. and touching others worldwide. But Bravo for the first time revealed to the world a new kind of invisible menace, a danger that could not be smelled, seen, felt or tasted.\nBravo exposed radioactive fallout as, what Weisgall calls, \u201ca biological weapon of terror.\u201d It visibly ushered in the globalization of radioactive pollution.\nFor the islanders, Bravo also ushered in 60 years of sufferings and a chain reaction of U.S. cover-ups and injustices, as detailed below. Over the decades, their pleas for just and adequate compensation and U.S. constitutional rights they had been promised were rejected by the U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, by Congress and by executive-branch administrations headed by presidents of both parties.\nSince then, Obama has initiated a \u201cpivot\u201d to the Pacific by beefing up and re-positioning U."}

Matt Cullen, president and CEO of M-1 Rail, the organization that runs the Detroit streetcar line, said Tuesday that wait times have been cut to 15 minutes during peak times on weekdays \u2014 a 15 percent reduction \u2014 and he hopes to get it down to 12 minutes or less. Officials will post ridership, headway and schedule times to continue to improve wait times.\nOver the past month, average daily ridership has been 5,500 passengers, M-1 Rail said in a news release. That's higher than the 3,300-4,000 per day the line has previously said it averaged in its first month. From June 12 through late July, ridership averaged 5,150 per day.\n\"We thought that we would be busiest in the rush hours, but we've been busier during the course of the day,\" Cullen said. \"That might be because of school being out and we had a ton of people that were just coming down here to experience the city in that way. But we've had good progress in every regard.\"\nThe streetcar line went through teething pains in its first months, including lower-than-expected rider numbers, which prompted the Kresge Foundation to donate $650,000 to keep rides free until Labor Day, Kresge President and CEO Rip Rapson said.\nM-1 Rail also said accuracy of the system that predicts train arrivals has improved and trains are arriving within 2 minutes of their expected arrival on 65 percent of the trips so far in August. The line said it expects to continue to improve that figure.\n\"The feedback has been terrific. The business community, I think, is very excited of the fact that we are not under construction any more,\" Cullen said. \"They've been very patient with us. But now not only are we not under construction, but we're really starting to bring thousands of people a day up and down the corridor, which has been very significant in that regard.\"\nLombard, Ill.-based transportation management firm Transdev Services Inc. is the QLine's the system's third-party operator under a five-year, $15.5 million contract signed in January 2016. Cullen said the company has hired all local staff, with the exception of one person.\nQLine ridership is expected to decline once it starts charging a fare. To combat the expected decline, the QLine plans more passenger education, additional ticketing locations aside from its on-platform kiosks and continued work on improving streetcar travel-time efficiency.\n\"Some people have noted the challenges in that the setup is not really for the kind of system that we have, so we've been tweaking that to make sure it works better,\" Cullen said. \"We want people to have a good sense of when [the streetcar] is coming, but it's difficult to say exactly when it's coming.

The motion suggested that allowing the prisoners to be heard now would also interfere with a 180-day review Obama ordered in January into policies regarding interrogation and detention of terror suspects.\nLin asked Bates to suspend his order, arguing that proceeding with the cases \u201cwould impose serious practical burdens on, and potential harm to, the government and its efforts to prosecute the war in Afghanistan.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s stance in the case is aligned with that of the Bush administration \u2014 and infuriating to detainee lawyers. The new administration\u2019s latest arguments, that interference by the courts could aid America\u2019s enemies, is provoking more anger.\nAn attorney for Bagram detainees, Tina Foster, said in a statement Friday that the Obama team\u2019s action signaled \u201ca particularly dark day in American history.\u201d She said Obama was betraying his rhetoric about returning to the rule of law. \u201cThe time has long since passed for issuing platitudes about ending torture, rendition and indefinite detention. President Obama today becomes complicit in the unjust and illegal detention of our clients \u2014 who deserve better,\u201d Foster said.\nIn his ruling, Bates said the prisoners\u2019 claim that they were captured outside Afghanistan was pivotal. He said the government should not be permitted to deposit inmates at Bagram simply to put them beyond the reach of the courts. Lin countered that none of the prisoners claimed to have been captured or held previously in a place where they would have had recourse to U.S. courts.\nThe government\u2019s latest motion hints at a possible compromise to be pursued before the appeals court: considering Pakistan to be part of the Afghan theater of war. That would allow prisoners detained in Pakistan to be held at Bagram without recourse but still permit those whisked there from around the world to bring challenges to their detention."}

In this case, Messenger had been used to send messages to Buddhists and Muslims with the aim of creating conflict on September 11 last year.\nThe Myanmar issues have, I think, gotten a lot of focus inside the company. I remember, one Saturday morning, I got a phone call and we detected that people were trying to spread sensational messages through \u2014 it was Facebook Messenger in this case \u2014 to each side of the conflict, basically telling the Muslims, \u201cHey, there\u2019s about to be an uprising of the Buddhists, so make sure that you are armed and go to this place.\u201d And then the same thing on the other side.\nSo that\u2019s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm.

But this is certainly something that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to.\nThat claim has been rejected in a letter signed by six organizations in Myanmar, including tech accelerator firm Phandeeyar. Far from a success, the group said the incident shows why Facebook is not equipped to respond to hate speech in international markets since it relied entirely on information from the ground, where Facebook does not have an office, in order to learn of the issue.\nThe group \u2014 which includes hate speech monitor Myanmar ICT for Development Organization and the Center for Social Integrity \u2014 explained that some four days elapsed between the sending of the first message and Facebook responding with a view to taking action.\nIn your interview, you refer to your detection \u2018systems\u2019.

There's now suggestive evidence that our faith in the authentic \u2013 especially when the authenticity is supported by effective marketing campaigns \u2013 is a deep-seated human instinct, which emerges at an extremely early age. Consider a clever experiment led by the psychologists Bruce Hood and Paul Bloom. The scientists tested 43 children between the ages of three and six. The children were shown a \"copying machine\" \u2013 it was actually tachistoscopes that were modified to have flashing lights and buzzers \u2013 and told that it could make an exact copy of any object. After the machine was demonstrated for the kids \u2013 the scientists \"copied\" a block and a rubber animal \u2013 Hood and Bloom then told the kids that the machine could also duplicate toys. A \u2018\u2018stretchy man\u2019\u2019 was then placed in the box and the illusion repeated. Interestingly, the young children actually preferred the \"duplicate\" toy and chose it 62 percent of the time. The kids didn't worry about the \"authenticity\" of the stretchy man.\nBut Hood and Bloom didn't stop there. They also had many of the young kids bring in their \"attachment objects,\" such as their favorite blanket or stuffed animal. (I still remember losing Johnny, my stuffed penguin, at the tender age of five. Grief.) The scientists then offered to \"copy\" the object for the kids. Four of the children simply refused \u2013 they wouldn't let their blankie anywhere near that nefarious device. But even those kids who allowed their attachment object to be \"copied\" almost always refused to see the objects as equivalent. The new duplicate was a bootleg blankie, an ersatz stuffed animal. Even though the children were assured that the objects were identical, they intuitively believed that the copy wasn't the same. It lacked a history, a bond, a sentimental attachment. It was inauthentic."}

For a bit of context to this pack, Alvin Gottlieb had founded his own pinball company in the early '90s, though for legal reasons he couldn't pursue his interests with the Gottlieb name. Though it was a short-lived venture, his company had produced eight pinball tables between 1991 and 1994. Fortunately, FarSight Studios has brought two of their more famous tables to the digital medium, to preserve the uniqueness that the company had brought to pinball. Cubed3 explores how these tables fare on the Nintendo Switch.\nThe two tables on offer in this pack are Al's Garage Band Goes on a World Tour and Pistol Poker. Beginning with World Tour, this table has a rockin' theme to the table, with a groovy backing track. Created in 1992 by Alvin's son Michael and Jerry Armstrong, it sets the challenge of touring around the world with a rock band. While the table is littered with some cool features such as a Guitar Mini Playfield and a Spinning Ramp, there is not much else ultimately going for it.\nWorld Tour is a tight-knit table with a lot of \"kill\" spots that can quickly end the game. This is not for pinball beginners, as the hits require a bit of skill to pull off a series of successive free-flowing ball movements. But other than that, the table does everything else as well as it should, while it's not a complete knock on FarSight Studios for the tables lack of a \"wow\" factor - perhaps another table from Alvin's slim library might have fared better. While having that sense of awe and wonderment isn't necessarily a requirement, when it must compete with the other tables in the pack, it is hard to justify getting this pack over some of the other offerings.\nThat's where Pistol Poker comes into the fray. Designed a year later by Michael Gottlieb and Wally Welch, this was the last game created by Alvin G & Co, and it is also their best table. Not only does it feature one of the better Western-themed soundtracks but blending in cowboy motifs with a few hands of Poker & Blackjack to earn chips to reach bigger scores sounds like a bonafide winner. The art style on the table is packed with personality of the cowboy-theme - made even more fitting with the neighing horse sound byte and the \"yee-haws\" to go with it.\nPistol Poker is a fast-paced table, though it is easy to activate the card-drawing mechanic on the back glass. Building up from a pair through to the Royal Flush is the aim, while the Megamode Multiball can be easy to achieve - but hard to maintain. Still, the challenge of acquiring chips and completing hands is where the fun of this table lies. Because of it, many hours can be spent here trying to not only reach the high scores, but to also get some genuine amusement out of as well. It is a challenging enough table for those looking to master it, but the barrier to jump in isn't as high as World Tour for instance.\nWhile being the Best in the West in Pistol Poker is the main selling point for the Alvin G and Co. Pack, it has to carry a heavy load when the only other game on the pack lacks the rich features and fun gameplay. Al's Garage Band Goes on a World Tour may have some nostalgic value for"}

Start with telling your spouse that you realize there are certain aspects to your personality that have to change. Then work on taking the edge off.\nIf you are the spouse of a power-driven individual, Ferretti advises that you take the confrontation past the marriage itself. \u201cI think one of the things would be to ask your spouse to take look at their other relationships with friends, siblings, kids, parents.\u201d If your partner has problems with all relationships, not just the one he or she has with you, there is an opportunity for a broader understanding of the problem."}

I have no idea where the remaining 90 percent which passes under the noses of the Interior Ministry and its officers or customs inspectors go, or who consumes and poisons themselves with these dangerous substances.\nDefinitely, the demand for this poison will be big in the new generation, simply because an expatriate who is barely making ends meet does not think of spending his hard-earned money on this expensive product.

As a result, the body retains excess fluid and waste from the blood, which can cause other health problems.\nAbout 96 percent of those with early kidney disease don't know they have it. The same is true of nearly half who have severely reduced kidney function but aren't on dialysis, said Longino, who's a kidney transplant recipient.\n\"Additional federal resources must be allocated towards increasing public awareness about the disease and advancing programs targeted towards prevention and early detection,\" he said.\nLongino added that leaders in the health care industry need to make kidney disease a priority. \"The earlier we can diagnose someone with kidney disease, the better their long-term outcomes,\" he said.\nThe CDC study also found that women are more likely than men to develop chronic kidney disease, 16 percent versus 13 percent.\nHowever, men are 64 percent more likely to progress to kidney failure, a point at which patients require dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.\nChronic kidney disease is more common in black people, at 18 percent, than Hispanics, at 15 percent, or white people, 13 percent of whom have it. But, Hispanics are 35 percent more likely than others to progress to kidney failure, according to the CDC.\nRisk factors for kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and family history.\nThe researchers said rising rates of diabetes and high blood pressure may help explain the increase in kidney disease.\nTo learn more, visit the National Kidney Foundation."}

Instead, the culprit was a dramatic drop in consumer demand for cars, a shift that Canada\u2019s entire auto sector must grapple with as it vies to remain competitive in a global industry.\nThese days, consumers want crossovers, sport utility vehicles or trucks \u2013 if they\u2019re buying vehicles at all. In Oshawa, workers built sedans.\nGM announced Monday it will shutter eight plants \u2013 one in Canada, four in the U.S. and three outside North America \u2013 by the end of 2019, a global restructuring that will slash 6,700 production jobs and save the company US$6 billion annually. It will invest that cash in electric vehicles and self-driving cars, industries of the future, instead of cars like the Chevy Impala that evoke memories of the past.\nOshawa\u2019s assembly plant will be the largest closure with 2,973 job losses, followed by the plants in Ohio and Detroit.\nDavid Paterson, General Motors Canada\u2019s vice-president of corporate affairs, said the Oshawa plant has some of the highest quality production and insisted GM has \u201coutstanding\u201d support from the Canadian government. But he said it was particularly vulnerable since it made cars and operated at one-third capacity for the past several years. GM chief executive Mary Barra is not prepared to run plants at that capacity when it needs cash to invest in self-driving cars and electric vehicles, Paterson said.\nGM will also downsize the number of salaried employees, contract staff and executives in the restructuring. It comes as auto production passes a peak in Canada and the U.S., said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Markets.\nU.S. auto sales topped out at 17.5 million vehicles in 2016, but production fell to 17.2 million in 2017. BMO estimates it will slide to 17.1 million this year. In Canada, production peaked at 2.07 million cars last year and is expected to slip just below two million in 2018.\n\u201cThose are still pretty healthy numbers but it reinforces that we are past the peak in this cycle,\u201d Porter said.\nThe Oshawa plant, which made the Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac XTS and previous generation Silverado and Sierra trucks, contributed six per cent of total Canadian auto production. In Ontario, the auto industry accounts for about 2.5 per cent of the GDP without including spinoff industries, Porter said.\nThe news sent workers reeling, with some walking off the job Monday as their union, Unifor Canada, promised to fight for their jobs at the facility, begun a century ago.\nClosure has loomed over Oshawa before, Unifor noted, but GM invested $500 million into the plant so it could build trucks as well. It launched the Silverado and Sierra lines in February, but those will also be discontinued.\nWhile industry watchers expected GM to reduce production at the plant, the complete closure of operations was unexpected, said Scotiabank economist Juan Manuel Herrera Betancourt.\nGM production in Canada declined from a peak of one million units in 2007 to 330,000 projected for 2018, he noted, reflecting reduced auto demand and a shift of some production to Mexico.

These acquisitions, he said, were bargains for Indian companies hunting abroad, and they would have to infuse more capital now to revive the cheap assets they invested in.\nDo you think business sentiments about India have changed in the two years since your previous visit?\nIf you look at BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations, of course it has changed. We have growth rates of 50% in companies. If it continues for some years, it will mean a lot of change for German business. That is why we see a change in the focus.

They will not buy from the market. What Indian companies do in Europe, they buy customers. In a greenfield project you may not need an Indian partner.\nGerman companies such as Volkswagen, Daimler and Bayer are making investments. But you may not forget that in Germany there are a lot of medium-sized companies that are family owned and they are all here. So there are big companies that announce their investments and smaller companies that do not. Half of the investments are made by these medium sized companies.\nLately, Indian subsidiaries of German companies have been buying out their minority shareholders. Why?\nIt is not in India alone; they do it all over the world. Minority shareholders will always have questions. If you look at companies, normally you have 100% shareholding.

(Vanda) (Nasdaq: VNDA) today announced the results of a HETLIOZ\u00ae (tasimelteon) driving study to measure next day performance. Tasimelteon did not impair measures of driving performance, whereas the active control, zopiclone, showed significant impairment.\nIn this triple crossover study, 48 healthy volunteers drove 100 km in a validated driving simulator the morning after taking a bedtime dose of either tasimelteon 20 mg, zopiclone 7.5 mg or placebo. The volunteers were instructed to operate the driving simulator for approximately 1 hour with a speed of 55 mph while maintaining lane position.\nTreatment with tasimelteon 20 mg at bedtime demonstrated no next day driving impairment compared to placebo. Treatment with zopiclone 7.5 mg dosed at bedtime was associated with a meaningful and significant increase in Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP), a measure of lane weaving, compared to the placebo treatment. Results for SDLP, the primary endpoint, are shown below.\nHETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved for the treatment of Non-24 Hour Sleep Wake Disorder.

D. Salin- ger and take his picture. If the phrase \"take his picture\" had any sense of vio- lence or, at least, violation left in it at all, if it still retained the undertone of cer- tain peoples who are convinced that a photographer threatens them with the theft of their souls, then it applied here. There is no mystery why the Post pur- sued its prey. For whatever reasons (and one presumes they are not happy rea- sons), Salinger stopped publishing long ago-his last story, \"Hap- worth 16, 1924,\" appeared in The New Yorker in 1965-and he has lived a reclusive life ever since. His withdrawal became for journalists a story de- manding resolution, in- tervention, and exposure. Inevitably, the Post got its man. The journalists took Salinger's picture. ('We're sorry. But too bad. He's a public figure.\") The paper ran a photograph on the front page of a gaunt, sixty-nine-year-old man recoiling, as if anticipat- ing catastrophe. In that instant, the look in Salin- ger,s eyes was one of such terror that it is a wonder he survived it. \"CATCHER CAUGHT\" the headline screamed in triumph. On the day Salinger's picture appeared in the Post, another novelist of stature, Don DeLillo, be- gan thinking about the Inescapable and mystical power of the image in the media age, and, closer to home, about his own haJf- hearted attempts to keep BY DAVID REMNICK his distance from the mass-media ma- chinery. From the start, he had been shy of exposure outside the exposure of the work itself. When he published his first novel, \"Americana,\" in 1971, he had asked that the author's note on the jacket read, simply, \"Don DeLillo lives and works in New York City.\" No offense intended, but he preferred to keep it that way. Mter living in the Bronx and Man- hattan for many years, DeLillo and his wife, Barbara Bennett, eventually settled a half hour's train ride north of the city, in Westchester County. They live in a \"\"\" \"\"\" \\ -,- \\ 11- >!> l' /1\" '\" \u00e7-< , --\", \"'! \\. green, quiet place lousy with lawyers, doctors, editors, and bankers. They both work at home: DeLillo as a novelist in his upstairs study, Bennett as a land- scape designer. (She used to be an ex- ecutive at Citibank.) DeLillo does not teach, he rarely gives readings, and he keeps interviews to a minimum. When friends would ask his credo, DeLillo would say he lived by the words of Ste- phen Dedalus: \"Silence, exile, cun- ning-and so on.\" But what DeLillo learned from the picture in the Post, and what he has very likely learned through his friendship with Thomas Pynchon, is that the price of complete withdrawal is even greater than the price of media whoredom. Not long after seeing the picture of Salinger, DeLillo began writing \"Mao II,\" a book with a novelist"}

He was mentally ill, said his father, and often wandered the neighborhood. On Wednesday, he was walking around busy Utica Avenue pointing a metal object at people, according to video released by the NYPD. Multiple 911 calls described a man who seemed to have a gun.

Vassell was also a well-liked figure in the community, often seen on those blocks and cared for by friends.\nPerhaps, this could have ended differently. Suppose the NYPD\u2019s \u201cneighborhood policing\u201d program, which aims to build ties with communities, could have alerted officers to Vassell\u2019s history?

The safe burial of people who have died from Ebola is a critical intervention in preventing disease spread, as dead bodies are particularly infectious.\nThe efforts of the Red Cross and other responders are also hampered by considerable funding shortfalls.

Longstanding disagreements over poor management and work pressure combined with labor-law violations prompted China Airline pilots to call a strike on February 8 amid Asia\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday.\nTalks between the Taoyuan Union of Pilots, China Airlines management, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) resulted in a complete impasse Monday after the airline refused to meet the pilots\u2019 demands over working hours. Union representatives want the airline to roster three pilots instead of the current two on flights lasting more than seven hours to counter fatigue and reduce flight risks. China Airlines rejected the union\u2019s demands on the grounds that the extra manpower would result in a spike of annual operating costs.\nChina Airlines mainly serves regional routes to destinations in Northeast and Southeast Asia; some 40 percent of all flights last seven hours or more. On a seven-hour flight, the union said pilots actually work for at least nine hours and may get only five to six hours of rest time between flights. Following the first round of negotiations, the airline agreed to schedule three pilots on eight-hour flights, arguing its rostering policy aligned with global industry standards.\nAccording to a China Airlines spokesperson, the strike between February 8 and February 11 resulted in a loss of $3.41 million in revenue after the cancellation of 80 flights. Although some 600 of the airline\u2019s 1,300 pilots have participated in the strike, the Taiwanese flag carrier has managed to maintain 90 percent of its schedule.\nWhile pilot working hours remains the key sticking point, the union has also called for China Airlines\u2019 chairman Nuan-Hsuan Ho to step down from his position, which he has held since 2016. In a statement released on Friday, the union said the airline had violated the Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act 33 times under Ho\u2019s leadership. Additional demands include the dismissal of managers who have harmed employer-employee relations; greater transparency over recruitment, training programs and promotions; a year-end bonus comparable to that of Taiwan\u2019s EVA Air; and protection of employees involved in union activities."}

Along with similar announcements from LG and TCL, 8K has become the TV trend of the show.\nSamsung also released a new oven range \u2014 the Dual Cook Flex. It allows you to cook two completely different meals at once in the same oven. which is good for a main and dessert situation, or if you have family members with different dietary requirements.\nMy favourite feature is that the flexible door allows you to open the upper compartment without impacting on the hit of the lower compartment. However, it doesn't go the opposite way \u2014 you can only check on the lower compartment by opening the entire door.\nIt's quite cool, but it also wasn't a new announcement. The Dual Cool Flex was first introduced in April this year.\nAnd that was about it for new things to see in Berlin from Samsung. Though its range is big enough to warrant its own massive building, those familiar with its impressive smart home range won't find much that's surprising.\nWe still only know a few snippets of detail about the Galaxy Home. Information was so scarce at Unpacked that we couldn't even get official product photos.\nMost of what we know revolves around the speaker element \u2014 it includes AKG, full-range speakers and a subwoofer as well as SoundSteer to provide a surround sound experience anywhere in a room. It also has far-field voice recognition for when you want to talk to Bixby.\nLastly, it was a announced that a partnership between Samsung and Spotify has been forged to create a seamless music experience between Samsung devices, including its phones, TVs, Galaxy Home and even its Family Hub fridge range.\nBut that's still all we have for now. No extra features. No pricing. No ship date.\nI doubt I'm the only one disappointed by the lack of Galaxy Home presence at IFA. Being a consumer electronics and home appliances show, it feels like the ideal place for its debut.\nAlas, we'll have to wait a bit longer.\nIt's possible that more info will come out of Samsung's Developers Conference in November, though I would be surprised to see a release before Christmas.

They must find ways to reach new customers and increase profits. One strategy for accomplishing this is diversification.\nDiversification is a growth strategy that involves adding products, services and markets to your company's core business. Putting your corporate eggs in many baskets is one way to minimize risk.\nDiversification in business can mean expansion through new product lines or services. You can use this strategy to take advantage of momentum in a new market, or to minimize the risk of your core market shrinking.\nMany businesses experience phenomenal growth in their early years then plateau. The most common reason for the slowdown is that leads stop coming in. Perhaps you\u2019ve reached maximum penetration in your existing market or a new, low-cost competitor has stolen your thunder.\nAdding new product lines, or entering a new market is one way to reignite growth. This strategy is known as market diversification. The aim is to open up new markets and new customer groups, thus improving your company's performance. Depending on your goals and resources a diversification strategy may be internal, external or a combination of both.\nLaunching a new product after research and development, market analysis and the production or purchase of goods, is called internal diversification. External diversification occurs when a company expands it activities through mergers, acquisitions, alliances with complementary companies or licensing new technologies.\nMotives for diversification can be complex but perhaps the most basic is survival. By definition, a company that focuses on a narrow range of products or services will only have access to a finite customer pool. At some point, you're going to reach maximum penetration and the costs of running your company may outstrip its potential for growth.\nMoreover, a one-trick pony business is extremely vulnerable to factors over which it has no or limited control. Rising raw materials prices, new competitors entering the market, changing customer tastes \u2013 these events can be catastrophic to your sales and revenue stream. Diversification places your eggs in many baskets. So you\u2019re not defenseless if one area of your business takes a nosedive.\nIn the case of seasonal businesses, diversification can help stabilize your cash flow throughout the year. For example, an ice cream truck is likely to sell the bulk of its product in the summer. If the business remains committed to selling only ice cream, it would have to sell enough during the summer months to keep the books in balance during the off-season. An alternative would be to diversify into a selling a product that appeals during the fallow months; coffee for example.\nDiversification is not just about survival. It can also be a proactive growth strategy. Adding new products and services to your line can gain you entry to an attractive new industry full of new customers and high sales potential. It can also kick start growth again, especially if you know how to take advantage of momentum in the market.\nA toothpaste manufacturer adds toothbrushes to its product line.\nA women\u2019s' fashion shoe manufacturer develops a line of children's shoes.\nA men's shirt retailer offers a range of complementary ties, cuff links or even suits.\nWith horizontal diversification, a business can reduce some of its risk exposure while exploiting certain synergies. Using the example of the shoe manufacturer, the additional cost of producing children's shoes should be manageable since the tools, equipment and technical skills to manufacture shoes are already in place. Current customers with children and new customers would be your target market.\nThink about all the steps that are involved in getting a product"}

What was all the rage a few months back can slide into oblivion as soon as some new trend hits the market. But some looks and styles are either classic or strong enough to stay perennially in vogue, and as we enter 2018, it is the perfect time to look back at some of the hair and makeup trends that ruled 2017 and have no chance of dying out any time soon.\nInstep got in touch with renowned image consultant Nabila in a bid to know more about quirky hair and show-stopping makeup trends.\nHere are some of the best beauty trends that continue to make waves.\nBe it on fashion runways or red carpets, flawless dewy skin with strobing took centre stage. Strobing gives a very natural dewy skin without the harsh lines and layers of foundation. The natural glow gives an automatic radiance and youthful appeal. According to Nabila, strobing is a technique that adds a hint of shimmer and a beautiful glow.\n2017 was all about flaunting metallic shades. We saw fun silvers, bronze and golds shining bright on the eyes, nails and in some instances even on the lips. Though metallics were a trend for summer, this trend lingered on. \u201cOur makeup trends for 2017 had cosmic metallic finishes; I see it making its way through Spring/Summer2018,\u201d observed Nabila.\nGlittery makeup ruled this year and we witnessed the sparkly craze on lips, nails and even on the eyes in the form of glittery eye liners. \u201cSparkling eyes, lips, and nails, we just love glitter. Apart from glitter, blingy rhinestones were also used in makeup,\u201d noted the expert. The main aim was to take makeup to a fun new level by adding shimmering rhinestones to the face, especially at the outer corner of the eyes.\n\u201cLong bob, also called lob was one of the hottest hairstyles in 2017,\u201d shared Nabila. Lob is one cut that somehow manages to look universally flattering on all hair types and face shapes and it\u2019s a classic so there\u2019s no fear of it going out of style.\n\u201cOne hair dyeing technique that made waves in 2017 was the freehand hair colouring technique,\u201d Nabila told Instep. Freehand hair colouring ensures a smooth stroke of colour while giving a blended yet natural look with no harsh or obvious lines. It\u2019s a great method if you want to refresh your colour but don\u2019t want to go for a bold colour overhaul.\nRegarding hair trends, Nabila said, \u201cIn 2017, variations of ponytails became talk of the town. And aptly decorated and highly embellished pony braids were one such style that gave a fun twist to the good old ponytail.\u201d Adding braid creates a lot more texture and dimension to a standard ponytail giving that effortlessly chic look.\nThere were a number of nail trends on show in the year 2017. When asked about nail trends, Nabila shared that Ombr\u00e9 nails and Swarovski crystal art work were really popular and will be seen trending through 2018 as well.\nAccording to the stylist, \u201cPastel hair colours ruled 201"}

{"idx": "37814", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Find out what you need to do to get started with a retirement account.\nSaving for retirement is a must-do for workers today, and opening and contributing to an IRA can be the best way to save. These retirement accounts offer tax benefits, some of which depend on whether you choose a traditional or a Roth IRA. To make sure your contribution will qualify for these tax breaks, you should know the maximum annual contribution limits and how they relate to your salary or other earned income. There are also other rules that govern IRAs that you should know as well. Below, we'll take a closer look at IRA qualified contributions and how you can use them to help you enjoy a financially secure retirement.\nCertain rules apply to all IRAs, regardless of which type you use. There's a maximum contribution amount that you can make to IRAs each year. For 2016 and 2017, that amount is $5,500 for taxpayers who are younger than age 50. For those who are 50 or older, an additional catch-up contribution is available, bringing the total maximum up to $6,500.\nThese amounts go up periodically based on inflation. However, with rates of inflation having been low lately, the amount hasn't risen since 2013.\nTaxpayers with incomes above certain limits can't make Roth IRA contributions. A phase-out range exists below the absolute upper limit, in which only a portion of the annual maximum contribution is available for Roth IRA contributions. The chart below gives the details by filing status.\nSay that you're single and looking to make a 2016 Roth IRA contribution. If your adjusted gross income is more than $132,000, then you can't make any Roth contribution. If your AGI is below $117,000, you can make a full contribution. In between, you'll be able to make a partial contribution. For instance, if your income is halfway between the low and high end of the range, then you'll be able to make a 50% Roth IRA contribution of $2,750 for those under 50 or $3,250 for those 50 or older.\nUnlike Roth IRAs, you can always contribute to traditional IRAs. However, in some cases, those contributions won't qualify for a tax deduction.\nAgain, the upper end of the range indicates where no deduction is allowed. Between the lower and upper end of the range, a prorated deduction is allowed. Below the low end of the range, you can deduct the full amount of any qualified contribution you make.\nThose who are looking to use an IRA have until the tax filing deadline for the tax year in which they want to make a qualified contribution. For the 2016 tax year, that means you have until April 18, 2017, to contribute to an IRA.\nIRAs are great tools to use in saving for retirement. By knowing how to make an IRA qualified contribution, you can ensure that you'll get all the benefits available to retirement savers who use these tax-favored retirement accounts for their financial planning. That will help you retire richer and with more confidence in your financial picture."}

High-altitude drones that blanket swaths of the earth with Internet access. Computers that think like humans. Virtual worlds where you can hang out with friends on the other side of the country or the planet.\nAll are big technology bets that sound like they were just beamed down from the USS Enterprise, not dreamed up inside the Silicon Valley company that built the world's largest social network. But this is what Schroepfer has been asked to do by Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg: Peer 10 years into the future.\nThe assignment clearly energizes Facebook's techie in chief, whose eyes sparkle when talking about these three major initiatives that he says will propel Facebook \u2014 and technology \u2014 forward. He says even the notion that people will gather in virtual spaces when they are miles apart will one day be commonplace.\n\"Human bonds are about shared experiences and shared memories. This is the ultimate tool for that. It is effectively a teleporter,\" Schroepfer says of Facebook's virtual-reality device Oculus. \"It's the closest thing we will ever do to re-materializing you Star Trek-style.\"\nThe stakes could not be higher for Facebook.

All of these projects have a 10-year timeline. And Facebook says it plans to take a slow approach to making money from Oculus VR, which it bought last year for $2 billion.\nSchroepfer tells USA TODAY that it's a matter of survival in an increasingly competitive industry. Facebook has to be willing \"to invest in disruptive technology and disrupt ourselves,\" he says.\nFacebook learned that lesson the hard way. It very nearly missed the last major computing platform switch to smartphones from desktop computers, a misstep that loomed ominously over its initial public offering.

In 1807, after his release, Lowry rewrote this memoir from memory. The result, as edited by Millyard, is a highly readable, generally amusing tale of a gentleman\u2019s life in the Royal Navy at the height of the age of fighting sail, during which Lowry served mostly in the Mediterranean, seeing Naples, Egypt, France (where spent time as a prisoner of war), Sicily and North Africa. His account is peppered with worries about money, drinking bouts, loose women, battles both at sea and ashore, exotic places, and many anecdotes.\nThere are numerous comments and annotations by editor Millyard, which help the reader better understand some of the more obscure history or aspects of common life around the turn of the nineteenth century.

They would also extend the age at which people can contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts beyond 70 [1/2]. And would allow the purchase of annuities, which are attractive because of their lifetime income streams.\nThe bipartisan Senate bill is sponsored by the heads of the Finance Committee, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. That version includes a tax credit to incentivize automatic enrollment and provisions aimed at establishing more flexible multi-employer plans.\nIn the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, has indicated he intends to include retirement account provisions in a so-called Tax Reform 2.0 package expected to reach the floor this fall.\nIt's not yet clear what will be included in Brady's package, and the fate of the legislative efforts is uncertain in an election year.\n\"This bill has a good chance of passing because it has strong, bipartisan support,\" said Michael Kreps, a principal at Groom Law Group in the District of Columbia who specializes in retirement law.\nKreps said key elements in the RESA legislation that could change 401(k)s significantly, including a provision that would allow 401(k) plans to more easily offer a guaranteed retirement income.\nUnder current law, employees with 401(k) plans are left to sort it out. \"It's hard to convert your retirement savings into income,\" Kreps said.\nThe legislation would allow employees in private companies to buy an annuity. \"It's called longevity risk,\" Kreps said. \"An annuity would go a long way toward eliminating the fear of that people would outlive their savings.\"\nMany employers are reluctant to offer annuity options because of concerns about lawsuits from the 401(k) plan participants in the event that the annuity provider does not -- or cannot -- make good on the payments.\nThe legislation offers employers a \"fiduciary safe harbor\" from liability in the event that the insurance company stops making payments.\nAnother solution to longevity risk is to allow employees to take a portion of their 401(k) balance, such as 10 percent, and buy an annuity that would kick in later in life, such as at age 85.\n\"It gets at one of those behavioral impediments,\" Kreps said. \"There's something psychologically difficult for people when asked to hand over their life savings to an insurer. But if you give an insurer 10 percent and you still control 90 percent, then you have a backstop if you live too long.\nA major component among the legislation's 26 elements is a provision that would allow small companies to join together to create pools of 401(k) plans, known as multiple-employer plans (MEPS).

This day was established on 18 December 2014 by General Assembly resolution A/RES/69/145 which was initiated by Sri Lanka. Following a lengthy consultation process, at the UN and outside, during which some delegations, including some Europeans expressed reservations, the resolution was eventually adopted unanimously. It received solid support from youth delegations from around the world.\nWorld Youth Skills Day resolution was a landmark UN initiative and had its origins in a visionary statement made by President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka at the 2013 UNGA. The idea was subsequently championed by the Sri Lankan Minister for Youth Affairs, Dulles Alahapperuma. The Sri Lankan delegation, at the time, worked the corridors tirelessly until the scales were tipped and the adoption of the resolution became certain.\nResolution A/RES/69/145 built upon the World Programme of Action for Youth of 2007, International Youth Day in 1999 and the Colombo Declaration on Youth of 2014, which, for the first time, was adopted with the concurrence of both youth and official delegations. The Colombo Declaration on Youth required youth needs to be mainstreamed in policy making.\nWith an increasing number of unemployed youth worldwide, the majority of whom are in developing countries, the United Nations was activated to take action to help young people to achieve their intrinsic potential.\nThe World Youth Skills Day 2018, as did all youth skills days before, aims to encourage the acquisition of marketable skills and training by the young. By acquiring core professional and lifestyle skills, young people will be able to contribute to the development and growth of their own communities.\n\u2022\tSDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.an you get involved?\nThe youth component of the global population is increasing and a new problem of critical magnitude is slowly creeping upon policy makers, especially in developing countries. Many developing countries, consistent with their commitments under the Millennium Development Goals, some with great difficulty, have provided basic literacy and health care to their populations.\nMany youth now survive in to old age. But providing meaningful employment to these millions who possess basic literacy has not been successfully addressed. The key challenge today is the paucity of marketable skills among youth. An educated and skilled workforce is also a key factor in attracting investments.\nWhile the situation for all youth remains a challenge, the unfortunate tendency for young women in many developing countries to fall behind even further compared with their male counterparts due to the lack of employable skills and social attitudes has been highlighted frequently. Equipping young women also with employable skills will enhance the economic potential of a country dramatically.\nThe modern skill sets required to operate in a high tech environment, including in the areas of management, environment conservation, ICT, banking, transport, aviation, etc, are simply not being provided in quantity. The result is a burgeoning, restless and disenchanted generation that could cause social and more serious problems, instead of being an economic asset.\nThe world today is home to the largest generation of youth in history. 90% of young people live in developing countries.

The board's vote is scheduled Thursday. Read the draft.\nTeachers' union contracts are rare in Louisiana. New Orleans was one of the few systems that had one, and that was dissolved after Hurricane Katrina. Most public schools are now charters, and some teachers say they lack job security.\nFranklin is consistently named one of the best public schools in the country.

{"idx": "37835", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS are among the best investments government can make, yet neither state nor federal aid is keeping pace with college prices, inflation and trends in family income. So Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s decision to end the Hope Scholarship program and boost to $90 million the state's purse for tuition grants based on family need is particularly timely.\nThe same circumstances underscore the imprudence of President Bush's proposal to earmark a portion of federal Pell Grant aid to promote a pet project - even if its educational mission is laudable.\nMaybe the governor can school him on the value of making need-based aid the priority right now. It's the right thing for Maryland to do after chopping higher-education funds last year and holding them flat in the proposed 2005 budget. The university system responded by raising tuition an average 30 percent over two years, and now the least able to pay are struggling. The Maryland Higher Education Commission, which administers all state aid, has a record waiting list of 5,000 applicants.\nTo meet the burgeoning need, Mr. Ehrlich is justified in redirecting millions from the state's Hope Scholarships, which began in 1998 as awards for high-achieving students pursuing science and technology degrees.\nSince 1998, the nation's wealthiest families have grown richer, while the average income of the neediest has declined. Federal studies show college costs today consume a much greater share of poor families' resources than they once did.\nTuition and mandatory fees for full-time undergrads at College Park were $4,805 in fall 1998; they are projected to be $7,426 for fall 2004.\nWould somebody mention this to President Bush? Hearts pounded when he announced during the State of the Union address that he proposed \"larger Pell Grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school.\"\nBut he left out the particulars. In the federal budget to be unveiled today, he proposes bonuses of up to $1,000 each for the minuscule slice of the Pell Grant-eligible population that signs on to the State Scholars program. To earn the bonus, the teens would complete a slate of courses that in some cases is more demanding than their states' own graduation requirements: It includes four years of English; three years of lab science; three years of math; and two years of a foreign language. Maryland is one of the 12 participating states: Harford and Frederick are the pilot counties.\nImpressive it may be, but rewards should come from some other pot.\nTurning $33 million of the $12 billion federal investment in Pell Grants into achievement-based awards strays from the program's intent and tradition of helping students based on family need. Though it has grown to serve roughly 5 million students, it has been covering a declining share of their college tab. The elder President Bush made a similar proposal in 1992; Congress didn't fund it. A revised attempt in 1998 met the same fate, as should this one.\nIt would be better to propose substantial increases in the Pell Grant allocation and the size of students' awards for 2005."}

Pat Roberts\u2019 (R-Kan.) Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act (SAFE) Wednesday. The bill, dubbed by opponents as the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act, would have prevented states\u2014namely Vermont\u2014from requiring labeling of GMOs and stopped pending state laws that require labeling to go into effect.\nJeff Harmening, head of General Mills\u2019 U.S. retail operations, addressed the national GMO debacle in a letter and explained that since his cereal company will be forced to label GMOs in Vermont by July 1\u2014which is when the state\u2019s labeling mandate takes effect\u2014it should also extend GMO labeling to products sold across the nation.\nI have been eagerly awaiting a resolution of the GMO labeling debate in Washington and am disappointed that a national solution has still not been reached.\nAs the discussions continue in Washington, one thing is very clear: Vermont state law requires us to start labeling certain grocery store food packages that contain GMO ingredients or face significant fines.\nWe can\u2019t label our products for only one state without significantly driving up costs for our consumers and we simply will not do that.\nThe result: consumers all over the U.S. will soon begin seeing words legislated by the state of Vermont on the labels of many of their favorite General Mills products.\nThe Cheerios maker\u2019s announcement was praised by GMO labeling proponents. Scott Faber, the Environmental Working Group group\u2019s senior vice president of government affairs, said the decision reflects the sentiment of the majority of Americans who want to know if they\u2019re eating GMOs.\nGeneral Mills has shown real leadership by committing to provide consumers basic information about their food. More than 60,000 consumers thanked Campbells when they announced their commitment to greater transparency, and I am sure consumers will reward General Mills for trusting consumers to make their own choices. I applaud their leadership for recognizing that consumers simply want to know what\u2019s in their food and how it\u2019s grown.\nSenators on both sides of this issue now need to realize that the market place is moving far faster than our legislators, and that the time has come to enact uniform mandatory legislation that makes it easy for consumers to see at a glance whether their foods contain GMOs. If large companies like General Mills and Campbells are accepting that this is what consumers want, then so should our political representatives. It is now time to put this debate behind us and realize that the citizens have spoken.\nBesides Campbell Soup, a number of major American companies, such Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Chipotle and Whole Foods have either abandoned GMOs or require labeling. Coincidence or not, Campbell has also seen its stock price rise in after making its announcement to ditch GMOs.\nAccording to Green America\u2019s GMO Inside, General Mills\u2019 food products are \u201cchock full of corn, soy and sugars\u2014ingredients that are almost always genetically modified in the United States,\u201d including America\u2019s favorite cereal, Cheerios.\nThe labeling of GMOs has been a contentious food fight in recent years.

{"idx": "37846", "prompt": "Continue the following text: There are as many suggestions about what makes a good or bad IT project as there are projects themselves . . . or, at least as there are commentators to pick holes in them.\nAside from external issues, such as the trustworthiness and proficiency of vendors, and the stability of the environment and marketplace, experts say there are a number of internal factors that you should have a handle on before you undertake any major project.\nThe common threads, regardless of who you talk to - consultant, vendor, business manager or IT manager - are executive sponsorship, people, communications and planning. Handle them well, and you are almost guaranteed success. Handle them badly and you are heading for an inevitable fall.\nBill Gibson, CIO of the Australian Taxation Office, reckons executive sponsorship of major projects is the absolute, no-question-about-it, number one critical success factor. \"Unless you have that, and it's there for the duration, you are already going to put the project at risk.\"\nAt the ATO that level of commitment is best exemplified by the ongoing \"ATO Change\" program. The organization's most senior managers - Commissioner Michael Carmody, and Senior Commissioners D'Ascenzo, Granger and Farr - spend two to three hours together at a meeting every fortnight reviewing progress and assessing deviations. According to Gibson, they expect to be informed against a set of eight specified outcomes, and any significant deviation must be approved by them.\nCurrently into the second year of a four-year schedule, Gibson expects the commissioners' active involvement in ATO Change to continue for at least the next 12 months. Not quite the duration, but nonetheless a significant indicator of executive interest. \"I don't see many other organizations making that sort of commitment,\" Gibson says.\nThis is not exactly a new concept, however. In 2002, Olin Thompson published an article titled \"Who to Blame for Project Failure\" on the technologyevaluation.com Web site, in which he said that \"for most failures, we need to look up within the organization\".\n\"Enthusiasm and commitment for a project does not 'trickle up' through an organization, it 'trickles down'. Only the person at the top can set the tone, have enough power to enforce decisions, allocate the resources, resolve conflicts and give direction to others, whether explicit or implicit. Only the person at the top can create enthusiasm and commitment,\" Thompson wrote.\nOf course, enthusiasm and commitment alone, while admirable, will not ensure successful completion of a project. No one yet has created the self-raising project, so you need people to start, manage and complete it. And they need to be the right people.\nGetting the right or the best people can be a challenge from the outset. Demand for the time and skills of the best will inevitably be high, even without the extra burdens of a special project. It is a lot easier to get the people no one wants. But settling for less than the best can cause problems beyond simply the inevitable stuff-ups.\nMike Smith, executive director for EDS Australia's government group, says that during the \"whole-of-government\" outsourcing projects, disgruntled people were an issue. These could be people who philosophically objected to government outsourcing, or those who felt that their once-colleagues who moved across to the private sector outsourcing supplier were traitors to the system.

He said: \u201cI think he has done well. He\u2019s made a couple of mistakes, every goalkeeper does, but he\u2019s proved himself. He\u2019s made some great saves, enjoyed some shut-outs and has shown himself to be a good, steady goalkeeper.\nFenlon snapped Williams up on a two-year deal having released Graham Stack and with contract talks with Mark Brown stalling. The manager revealed he\u2019d been on Williams\u2019 trail long before succeeding Colin Calderwood at Hibs, making the journey from Dublin to watch him in action and then, once he\u2019d taken the reins at Easter Road, dispatching goalkeeping coach Scott Thomson to monitor him last season. Williams spurned the advances of a number of Championship clubs to become part of Fenlon\u2019s revolution \u2013 one which saw no less than nine new faces arrive, along with the return of James McPake and Leigh Griffiths \u2013 and McArthur believes the manager\u2019s homework has paid off.\nHe said: \u201cPat obviously had his eye on Williams for some time, he\u2019s cast his net wide and has brought in a goalkeeper he can rely on. To me he appears to be a steady character both on and off the pitch and that\u2019s what you need in a goalkeeper, someone who keeps his head down, works hard and is level-headed.\nHaving arrived at Easter Road at a time of flux as Fenlon began to put his own mark on the team, Williams had to forge a new partnership with those in front of him and was just beginning to do so when injuries to McPake and Tim Clancy forced Fenlon into a rethink at the back.\nDespite having to acquaint himself once again with a new-look backline, McArthur feels Williams\u2019 class has shone through, even if he found himself picking the ball out of the net three times against Inverness at the weekend. McArthur said: \u201cWhen you look at a scoreline like that [3-0], the first assumption is the goalkeeper\u2019s had a bad day.\n\u201cHowever, after watching the highlights of the game, it was clear Williams was blameless at each of the"}

This is one of those times. The BIO Investor Forum attracts an odd mix of some little companies hardly anybody has heard of, some promising startups, a few public companies I would like to forget, and a decent smattering of investors and business development types all trying to figure out the next shrewd thing to buy.\nWhile there might not have been much earth-shattering news from BIO Investor Forum yesterday, I did sit in on a few sessions with companies from around Xconomy\u2019s 6-city network. Here are some of the highlights from a few companies that I monitored in and around the conference.\nThe adjuvants that Immune Design is developing are synthetic compounds that are supposed to be 10-100 times more potent than the natural-product derived MPL adjuvant that GlaxoSmithKline currently uses to amp up its human papillomavirus vaccine (Cervarix), Paya says. Immune Design co-founder Steve Reed and his team at Seattle-based Corixa developed the earlier-generation adjuvant, and now have set out at the new company to create adjuvants that improve on the old ones. Namely, the new adjuvant is supposed to be cheaper, more reproducible, and easier to manufacture at commercial scale.\nThe new compound is supposed to specifically stimulate a target known as the TLR4 receptor, which sets off an immune reaction that the company thinks could be useful in different settings for triggering an immune reaction against herpes simplex-2 infections\u2014the cause of genital herpes\u2014and cancer.\n\u201cThis one (GLA) is a synthetic molecule that offers straightforward manufacturing, and stability,\u201d Paya said in his presentation.\nImmune Design has run a variety of early clinical trials that have exposed about 300 patients to the new synthetic adjuvant, Paya said."}

This is the rationale behind the Excellence in Educational Transformation Awards (EETA), which rewards the most transformative and innovative educational programs of educational institutions and their proponents.\nStarted by the Bayan Academy in partnership with REX Bookstore, Knowledge Channel, ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya and the Department of Education (DepEd), EETA recognizes the impact and legacy of institutions and educators that promote learning effectiveness and school efficiency while being true to their vision, mission and values. Celebrating the triumphs of the \u201csmallest\u201d schools that delivered simple yet impactful innovations that uplifted students\u2019 learning and competitiveness, as well as ignited collaborations among stakeholders, four schools and two schools divisions were awarded the highly esteemed accolades in the various categories.\nAlso, for the second consecutive year, the Oscar M. Lopez (OML) Award for Educational Leadership is given to Dr. Maria Cristina Robles, Principal of Navotas National High School. Dr. Robles has been the principal for eight years of the school with a student population of 3,000 yearly. She holds various degrees and has been given a higher position in DepEd but her love for the school and engaging with its stakeholders led her and the school itself to outstanding performance.\nThey were presented in a ceremony held recently at the Dolphy Theater inside the ABS-CBN compound.\nAtty. Dominador Buhain, REX Group of Companies Chairman and current President of the Philippine Book Development Federation, Inc., proudly commended the recipients for their significant contributions in uplifting the quality of teaching and learning in the country.\n\u201cWe all believe in the value of promoting learning effectiveness and efficiency in schools. For us at REX Bookstore, being an educational publisher since the 1950s, we know that our learning solutions are just one part of the equation. Equally important, if not more important are the schools, which are the hub of learning. They are our students\u2019 second home. How these schools adapt to change greatly influence how our learners adapt to the increasing demands of this complex modern world,\u201d he said.\nApart from the smart incorporation of technology, community-based learning was integral to the inspirational success of the EETA winners. By significantly re-designing and implementing new academic programs and inspiring the school community members to work together, the \u201csmallest schools with limited resources\u201d have achieved their ultimate goal, which is to deliver best teaching practices and student learning excellence.\nDr. Ed Morato, President of Bayan Academy, lauded the award recipients for using \u201cweaknesses\u201d such as their smallness and inferior resources as a driving force to customize programs and craft superior strategies that deliver \u201creal\u201d and sustainable beneficial results for students.\n\u201cWe knew then back in 2011 that we wanted to come up with a program that will motivate schools to actually upgrade themselves, uplift themselves and transform themselves not so much in their curriculum and materials but also in their learning methodologies, places and spaces.

The short answer to this question is \u2018maybe.\u2019 Read on for the long answer!\nThere has been a lot of research on vitamin C and colds. A 2005 study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition tracked participants for five years. There were two groups: a low dose and a high dose group. The 144 people low dose group took 50mg of vitamin C daily. In the high dose group, the other 161 took 500mg per day.\nWhen the people in the low and high dose groups got sick, there was no difference in the severity and duration of their colds. What did vary was how often they got sick. People in the high dose group got sick less often than the ones in the control group.\nThe results of the 2005 study seem to suggest that once you\u2019re experiencing cold symptoms, it may be too late for vitamin C to make a difference. The authors noted that their results \u201cshould be interpreted with caution.\u201d The study had some limitations. Participants who saw a difference were taking regular vitamin C supplements, but taking a 500mg supplement may not be a good idea. More on that below.\nA 2013 study took an even larger-scale look at vitamin C\u2019s cold-fighting power. This meta-analysis looked at 70 years of studies: 20 trials involving 11,306 total participants. The researchers concluded that people doing extreme exercise or exposed to extremely cold temperatures for short periods can benefit from taking a vitamin C supplement.\nThe analysis found some evidence that regularly supplementing with vitamin C may reduce the severity of colds, but it wasn\u2019t replicated when people took it therapeutically\u2014after they already had symptoms. However, the researchers also said that there were not very many therapeutic trials to look at, and more research is needed.\nThe conclusion of that study was basically \u201cit can\u2019t hurt.\u201d Vitamin C is inexpensive and it could help. They suggest trying large doses of vitamin C at the onset of a cold to see whether it helps you.\nCan you take too much vitamin C?\nVitamin C is water-soluble, meaning that you can\u2019t overdose on it like you can fat soluble vitamins. Your kidneys filter out excess vitamin C, and it exits your body when you pee. You can\u2019t OD on vitamin C, but mega-dosing for long periods is still not a great idea.\nAccording to the NIH, taking too much vitamin C can cause gastrointestinal symptoms: diarrhea, nausea and stomach cramps. It can also cause your body to store too much iron, which may lead to organ damage.\nDoes vitamin C help with colds?\nSo, does vitamin C really prevent colds, shorten cold duration, or lessen symptoms? It could, especially if you\u2019re marathon training or spending a lot of time out in very cold weather. Otherwise, taking vitamin C regularly and eating more vitamin C-rich foods can\u2019t hurt, as long as you\u2019re not mega-dosing.\nShould You Actually Starve a Fever?\nImage Credits: Vitamin C chart via the NIH; other images via Thinkstock.\nThank you for the Vitamin C info and tips.\nI"}

{"idx": "37871", "prompt": "Continue the following text: William Gay: William Gay is now absolutely and decidedly the old man of the group, as aside from Donald Washington, at 31, he is the only cornerback over the age of 24. But he is also still the best they\u2019ve got, and he\u2019s been pretty good. How much longer can he hold the fort?\nRoss Cockrell: Ross Cockrell came out of close to nowhere last year, signed on the final roster cut day. He was playing within two weeks and ended up starting in the nickel defense. He figures to enter the starting lineup full-time, hopefully improved physically, mentally, and schematically.\nSenquez Golson: Last year\u2019s second-round pick, the goal is for Senquez Golson to be a heavy contributor this year, of course, after missing all of last season. He should be full-go for training camp, and will likely get a lot of work in the slot and outside, and will play where the defense works best, provided he proves to be one of the top three cornerbacks on the roster.\nDoran Grant: Another second-year player, Doran Grant is often forgotten about, but shouldn\u2019t be. He was a fourth-round pick and showed some potential in the preseason, even if his performance was pockmarked by missed tackles and a couple of blown coverages or bites on double moves.\nMontell Garner: A Reserve/Future signing, Montell Garner got some positive press during spring drills, but that\u2019s all that is for now.\nAl-Hajj Shabazz: The same can be said for Al-Hajj Shabazz, who was also signed as a Reserve/Future player. The two may be more realistically competing for a practice squad spot.\nArtie Burns: The Steelers finally used a first-round selection on a cornerback with Artie Burns this past draft. An underclassman and somewhat raw, however, he is far from guaranteed to be an immediate contributor. He is an intriguing prospect, however, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if they work him into the defense to give him some snaps even if he doesn\u2019t immediately earn a role.\nDonald Washington: A college cornerback who later played a few years at safety, Donald Washington was out of the NFL a bit but won a roster spot during tryouts at rookie minicamp. At 29, as mentioned, he is the second-oldest cornerback on the roster by far, yet his NFL experience was at safety.\nTobais Palmer: Another Reserve/Future Player, Tobais Palmer was waived in order to accommodate the signing of Washington, among three other tryout players. He was clearly the low man on the totem pole behind Garner and Shabazz based on that decision.\nNotes and Camp Outlook: Though it has been known for some time, it struck me while writing this article and going down the list of names and writing about each just how little this group has accomplished at the NFL level.\nGay is the only player assured to be in the starting lineup at the moment, so there should be plenty of intrigue during training camp and the preseason as to how the starting lineup gets sorted out, but it will also be compelling to see how the bottom of the roster is shaped. Is Grant safe? Can Washington reclaim a roster spot? Might they keep six this year?"}

They are only getting a chance to avoid deportation for a limited time unless and until Congress passes an immigration law that helps them permanently. Future presidents can take this back, and those who have brought themselves to the attention of the authorities then could be deported.\nThe president\u2019s plan fell short of what some anticipated because he did not extend this temporary reprieve from deportation to parents of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children and were granted similar relief in 2012. Millions more would have benefited had he included these parents, but administration lawyers said that would not be legal.\nTo put this change in perspective, U.S. citizens who are at least 21 can already petition for their undocumented parents to get green cards. The president\u2019s action merely shields some of those parents until their children are old enough to petition for them.\nThe controversial and failed Secure Communities program will finally be replaced with a new Priority Enforcement Program intended to better target convicted criminals and build community trust.\nFor those skeptical of Obama\u2019s action, it is worth noting that it also serves as an enforcement tool by requiring extensive background checks. By bringing individuals out of the shadows, the president is not just doing them and their families a favor, but he is increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of identifying the few who truly might pose a threat to national security.\nObama\u2019s action will not open the floodgates. DACA in 2012 did not result in a measurable increase in illegal border crossings. The recent influx of women and their children fleeing violence in Central America is totally unrelated. As is well documented, migration is driven by economics and unlivable conditions in home countries. Obama\u2019s announcement also included a stern warning that those attempting to enter illegally will be sent back.\nThere is no quick fix to curbing unauthorized migration and addressing the reality of a significant undocumented population. Honestly looking at our current system\u2019s exploitation of unauthorized workers, increasing stability and aiding economic development in immigrants\u2019 home countries would do more than any number of costly fences, walls or detention facilities. Until the debate is shifted to focus on the root causes, no immigration reform measures will cease the flows, which we need and implicitly invite.\nIt is important to remember that leaving one\u2019s home is not something that most people want to do but instead is often a necessity to protect or provide for their families.

Something is physically wrong. Now we have the answer to that problem.\"\nFultz is expected to miss three to six weeks while rehabbing.\nThis marks the latest development in what has been a bizarre beginning to Fultz's career.\nThe 2017 No. 1 overall pick was expected to be the third star alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in Philadelphia. The Sixers traded the No. 3 overall pick in that year's draft and a future conditional pick to the Boston Celtics to move up and select him.\nHowever, Fultz came into training camp last year with a shooting motion that looked dramatically different from his college days. He ultimately missed most of the season with what was said at the time to be a scapular imbalance in his shoulder, and he was a nonfactor in the postseason upon his return.\nIn the offseason, he worked on improving his shooting motion with trainer Drew Hanlen, and it appeared to be trending in the right direction. But his shot regressed during the season, he never quite fit in the starting lineup, and the Sixers eventually moved him back to a reserve role when they traded for Jimmy Butler.\nIt's long been unclear whether Fultz's issues are physical, mental or both. Even if his shooting woes are solely because of TOS, Fultz will still need to retrain his shooting form to resemble the one he showcased at Washington.\nThat version of Fultz was dynamic, able to score at all three levels and dominate games in the pick-and-roll. His blend of size, athleticism and scoring ability made him a near-consensus top prospect heading into the league. If that version of Fultz returns, a core of Embiid, Simmons, Butler and Fultz would be deadly.\nIn the meantime, his future as an NBA player\u2014and in Philadelphia\u2014remains in question."}

It gives arbitrary powers to the minister of police to declare any building or installation a key point that is vital to state security; once this is done, the constitutional rights to freedom of expression and access to information seem no longer to apply. These fundamental rights are granted or taken away at the whim of the minister, or anyone to whom his powers are delegated.\nAlthough its draconian measures have no real place in our constitutional democracy, the Act seems to have found new friends in a new era.\nA month ago the Right2Know Cam\u00adpaign launched a request for information in terms of the Promo\u00adtion of Access to Information Act.\nWe asked the head of the South African Police Service, who is meant to be the guardian of this information, for a list of all the key points. But, although the legal deadline for a response was November 4, the police have failed to provide the information.\nWhy should the public have a list of them? Simply, it's a law that undermines basic rights; at the very least we should know how widely those rights are being undermined.\nOnce a site is declared a national key point, secrecy provisions come into play: there's a jail sentence or R10 000 fine for any person who discloses \"any information\" in \"any manner whatsoever\" about the security measures of a national key point or \"any incident that occurred there\".\nAny site can be named a key point, from our airports and factories to our power stations and presidential residences. This is why, for many years, activists, unionists and community groups have been calling for a public list of the key points, but the list itself is in effect a secret.\nAlthough the Act may be an apartheid dinosaur, it has continued to give private sector and government officials the opportunity to shut the public out. In fact, Nkandla is not a first for presidential residences \u2013 in 2006 the department of public works used the Act to try to hush up the building of an alleged R90-million wall around the official presidential residence in Pretoria.\nBecause public gatherings are also prohibited at key points, the Act has also been invoked to clamp down on lawful protests. In 2003, for example, the police arrested 36 transport workers who were demonstrating outside Cape Town International Airport \u2013 a national key point.\nEven more farcically, women's groups protesting against gender violence in 2008 were stopped from holding a peaceful protest outside the Emperors Palace casino where noted boxer and occasional wife-beater Mike Tyson was being hosted. The stated grounds for refusing their right to gather was that Emperors Palace is next to OR Tambo International Airport, also a national key point.\nThe Act has been used to prevent accountability in the private sector as well, and nowhere in South Africa has this experience been more bitter than for the communities surrounding the petrochemical refineries in the South Durban basin, where a years-long struggle has"}

{"idx": "37900", "prompt": "Continue the following text: This was doubtless an experience shared widely in and beyond Graham\u2019s native South. Graham\u2019s frequently televised \u201ccrusades\u201d (as he called his public evangelistic events until 9/11, when the connotations in the Middle East became newly salient) became a regular part of American life from the 1950s on, presenting an intensely personal but ecumenical version of evangelical Protestant Christianity to a rapidly secularizing world. Suffering from a variety of ailments, Graham had been out of the public eye since his last big preaching event in 2005 (in Flushing Meadows, as it happens). Upon his death today at the age of 99, his legacy as perhaps the first global evangelist, and certainly the first televangelist, is secure. But his relationship with the politically powerful, which in some respects anticipated the Christian right (which Graham himself conspicuously did not join), provides a more complicated picture.\nAs brilliantly explained in Darren Dochuk\u2019s 2012 book, From Bible Belt to Sunbelt (which features a photo of a young, crusading Billy Graham on its cover), Graham led a whole generation of evangelical preachers and institution builders who combined \u201cold-time religion\u201d with modern technologies and organizational techniques, and made common cause with political conservatives on a host of contemporary issues. It was fitting that his national emergence occurred after a 1949 \u201ccrusade\u201d in Southern California (promoted avidly by the Hearst press thanks to his aggressive anti-communism), the great melting pot of political, economic, and cultural trends that largely created modern American conservatism. Graham was also influential in his relatively early repudiation of Jim Crow, which had long created an obstacle to the spread of both Southern-style religion and politics.\nGraham met his first president in 1950, when a friendly congressman took him to see Harry Truman. Graham\u2019s growing celebrity and instinct for the main chance quickly led to his reputation as \u201cPastor to the Presidents,\u201d and he was consulted by Eisenhower and (despite Graham\u2019s initial ambivalence about a Catholic president) Kennedy, before his closest political associate, Richard Nixon, entered the White House.\nGraham clearly gloried in his tight relationship with Nixon, who benefited significantly from his association with the revered evangelist (it certainly fit in nicely with his \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d). And it is reasonably clear that Nixon\u2019s disgrace (and the exposure of his somewhat less than Christian views on many subjects) became a cautionary tale for Graham the rest of his life. Yes, he still \u201cpastored\u201d presidents on demand, but he became wary of partisan politics, avoiding political controversies and associating too closely with politicians. Interestingly, this anti-political evolution by Graham coincided roughly with the birth of the Christian right, when so many of the evangelical leaders he profoundly influenced formed a movement that eventually became a key constituency group of the Republican Party.\nAnother aspect of Graham\u2019s ministry also increasingly separated him from many of his natural allies\u2014 notably those in the Southern Baptist denomination in which he was baptized and ordained.

At his arraignment after the arrest, he appeared wearing a plain orange T-shirt, designer plaid shorts and flip-flops; at his sentencing, he wore a standard-issue orange prison jumpsuit.\nArellano Felix, the youngest of the cartel's seven brothers, pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to running a criminal enterprise and conspiring to launder money. Those crimes carry a mandatory life sentence.\n\"I tell you today, man to man, that even if I had the discretion not to impose a life sentence in this case, that's what I'd find most reasonable,\" U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns said.\nThe judge, who earlier in the day heard a handful of the drug-smuggling cases that routinely clog his courtroom, minced no words in admonishing Arellano Felix for his role in encouraging drug use.\n\"Your family's name will live in infamy,\" Burns said. \"The effect on this country of what you and your family have done is disastrous.\"\nArellano Felix, who has been in custody without bond at a downtown San Diego federal detention facility, is not currently eligible for any kind of parole, Burns said.\nHis lawyer, David Bartick, said after the sentencing that Arellano Felix was prepared to be sent to the so-called Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where America's most violent criminals are held. A final decision on where Arellano Felix will be housed rests with the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nThe Arellano Felix cartel emerged as a drug trafficking powerhouse in the 1980s in Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, though its influence is widely believed to have waned in recent years as its leaders have been killed or captured.\nThe cartel was once led by seven brothers and four sisters, but Francisco Javier's brother Ramon was killed in a shootout with police in 2002. His elder brother Benjamin was jailed in Mexico the same year; federal prosecutors in San Diego are seeking his extradition to face charges in the United States.\nProsecutor Laura Duffy said she does not know when Benjamin Arellano Felix will be extradited, but said she hoped it would be soon.\n\"I thought he'd be here by now,\" she said after the sentencing. She said she was pleased to have extracted a plea from Francisco Javier because it allowed the government to keep its evidence secret ahead of any proceedings against his older brother.\nArellano Felix was captured during a U.S. Coast Guard-led raid off La Paz, Mexico, and towed back to San Diego aboard his 43-foot yacht, the Dock Holiday.

Let\u2019s explore the reasons. Or maybe the reason, singular.\nThey have yet to re-sign running back LeGarrette Blount, who led the league in rushing touchdowns last year and who remains a free agent. Assuming the team wants him back (why wouldn\u2019t it?), it\u2019s safe to assume Blount wants more than the team has offered.\nSo what better way to get Blount to take what\u2019s on the table than to openly flirt with someone else?\nYes, it\u2019s possible the Patriots genuinely are interested in Peterson. If the Patriots were, though, the Patriots would have kept it quiet (and insisted on secrecy from Peterson\u2019s camp) until Tuesday afternoon, when the Monday visit that wasn\u2019t reported in time to make it to the Monday transaction report finally would have come to light. By then, the Patriots would have had a chance to make a decision on whether the Patriots want him without risking that someone else will cough up more money in an effort to get him signed.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Peterson and the Patriots doing a deal in the near future. The Patriots surely won\u2019t pay him what he\u2019s looking for, and Peterson could have an issue with the whole \u201cdo your job\u201d thing, given that doing his job will consist of no longer being the focal point of the offense, like he\u2019s been for the past decade in Minnesota.\nIf Peterson ultimately is going to take less money and accept a reduced role in a diverse offense with an ever-expanding corps of pass catchers, he can wait until he\u2019s absolutely certain that no one else will offer him more cash and a bigger role. For now, it\u2019s likely a get-acquainted session at best, or at worst a shot across Blount\u2019s bow.\nHis agent could have leaked it? Come on now?\nHaving Peterson come to town without anybody finding out would be tougher than winning five super bowl. I\u2019m not seeing the conspiracy here.\nThis is like that time Gary Payton and Karl Malone joined the Shaq/Kobe Lakers to make a \u201csuper team\u201d that everyone expected to win another championship. These things tend not to work out.\nNice subtle 5lombardi trophy comment.\nAct like a 10yr vet that\u2019s done it before.\nFumbles too much for Bill, not going to happen.\nHe is at least 2 steps ahead of the other GMs (on a bad day), he\u2019s 4 steps ahead of us guys in the cheap seats, and he just plays with people like Florio for amusement.\nBoy, you sure can tell Myra Kraft is no longer with us.\nOoooooh, ooooooooooh, I know, cause they are a dirty cheating lying franchise?\nAnd the Pat\u2019s are in your head if you have to try to figure this out. No cheating, just head games. My guess is ends up being Reggie Wayne and doesn\u2019t want to work too hard.\nWhy would they not want Blount back? Maybe his less than stellar performance over the last 2 years (TDs aside). His scoring of TDs is as much or more a function of the offense and situation than of his skill.

Breaking it down further; Ikelegbe said that as recently as 2017, 71 million Nigerians were classified as workers, with 54 million fully employed, 17 million as under-employed and 12 million totally unemployed.\nIkelegbe said unemployment is among Nigeria\u2019s biggest social problems as about half of the 23 million Nigerians within the 15 to 35 years age bracket are under-employed while some 1.8 million Nigerians enter the labour market yearly, with tertiary institution graduates making up 500, 000 of the number.\nAccording to him, the Nigerian universities must recognise the fact that a pool of over five million unemployed graduates had accumulated as far back as 2014 and must have increased tremendously.\nHe asked the students of WDU, Oghara, to recognise the fact that many graduates are unemployed years after graduation because they are simply \u201cunemployable\u201d as the \u201clack job-related skills and perform below expectation\u201d, and universities are \u201cproviding graduates inadequate knowledge or practical skills in courses studied.\nHe said \u201cMany university graduates lack basic writing and communication skills and can barely write memos and briefs, or express themselves proficiently in English Language\u201d.\nThe way out of the quagmire, Ikelegbe said, is that \u201cuniversities must be held responsible for the successes, performance and capacity of otherwise of their graduates. Therefore, they must begin to be concerned about how their graduates fare in the labour market.

I don't think, as management, we convinced the union of the harsh competitive situation. It's a tough contract.\nThe new agreement calls for a 50-cent hourly wage increase in the contract's first year. A cost-of-living adjustment, which may not exceed 35 cents an hour, will take effect in both the second and third years.\nMost damaging to the fast-growing carriers, however, is a significant adjustment in the new-hire wage program implemented in the 1985 agreement.\nUnder that plan, newly hired employees received 70 percent of the standard wage their first year, rising to 80 percent in the second year and 90 percent in the third before reaching the top rate.\nThe new agreement creates an 85 percent, 90 percent, 95 percent scale that is reached in just 18 months instead of three years. As a result, thousands of employees hired over the last three years immediately will receive wage increases of 10 percent to 30 percent.\nThe 50-cents-an-hour increase represents about a 3.5 percent wage hike, but the changes in the new-hire formula actually will hike labor costs 6 percent to 8 percent for many companies.\nThat could force many companies, including some of the nation's biggest carriers, to raise their rates to recoup the higher costs.\nOther provisions in the new pact call for a 20-cents-an-hour hike in health and welfare and pension payments in each of the contract's three years; a freeze in the current $12 an hour pay rate for casual, or part-time, workers; and a profit-sharing option for carriers.\nUnder the profit-sharing plan, a company may ask its employees to sacrifice up to 15 percent of their wages in exchange for a share of future profits. But 75 percent of the company's employees must approve the plan.\nIf a profit-sharing program is accepted, it becomes mandatory for all company employees.\nSources close to the talks say the contract also contains new language that makes its tougher for carriers to use owner-operator truck drivers and railroads to replace line-haul union trucking operations.\nBut one official said the changes are not that much stronger. There were no language changes pertaining to so-called double-breasted operations, where a company operates both union and non-union subsidiaries.\nSome union members complained that carriers with dual operations have been diverting business to the non-union subsidiary and had been seeking more restrictive language to block the practice.\nManagement also had been seeking some work rule changes that would have granted more flexibility in using union employees. But officials said there were no significant changes in the national agreement applying to the use of casuals or road drivers."}

Shares climbed 15 percent to $45.50 after the news broke.\nThe good news for Dendreon (NASDAQ: DNDN) came today when it received clearance from the FDA to start selling sipuleucel-T (Provenge) to men in the U.S. with terminal prostate cancer that has spread, even after prior rounds of standard hormone-deprivation therapy, according to a statement on the FDA website. The agency gave the green light after Dendreon showed in a trial of 512 men that patients lived a median time of 25.8 months if they got Provenge, compared to 21.7 months for those on a placebo. Patients on the drug had minimal side effects of fever and chills that lasted a couple days.\nThe FDA\u2019s decision will have far-reaching impact for years. The drug is the first marketed product for Dendreon, which has piled up a deficit of more than $700 million in its 18-year development quest. The product is forecasted by analysts to exceed $1 billion in U.S. sales after a couple years on the market. Dendreon could morph into the regional anchor Seattle\u2019s biotech community has lacked since Immunex was acquired by Amgen in 2002. For the 27,000 men in the U.S. who die each year from prostate cancer, the drug represents some hope for a longer life, and a higher quality of life alternative to chemotherapy. And for researchers, it offers new possibilities for a mode of treatment beyond surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted biotech pills and antibodies that must be taken chronically.\n[Update with company statement.] Dendreon said the drug will be made available initially at about 50 medical centers in the U.S. The company didn\u2019t say in its statement today how much it will charge for the drug, although it plans to hold a conference call with analysts and investors at 2:30 pm Eastern/11:30 am Pacific.\n\u201cThe approval of Provenge is a significant step towards realizing our mission of transforming the lives of patients with cancer, and it also marks Dendreon\u2019s transformation into a commercial enterprise,\u201d CEO Mitchell Gold said in the statement.\nWhile today\u2019s FDA approval is groundbreaking, it\u2019s worth being precise about what this means, and what it doesn\u2019t. Treatments like Dendreon\u2019s are most accurately referred to as \u201cactive immunotherapies,\u201d although scientists sometimes loosely call them \u201ccancer vaccines\u201d in the media. Just to be clear, Dendreon\u2019s product is a treatment that people get after they\u2019ve already been diagnosed with prostate cancer, so it isn\u2019t a vaccine in the traditional sense that prevents people from getting a disease. Because Dendreon\u2019s treatment \u201cteaches\u201d the immune system to recognize certain cancer cells and fight them on its own, for months or even years, it\u2019s considered an \u201cactive\u201d immunotherapy. That\u2019s also different from what researchers sometimes call \u201cpassive\u201d immunotherapy. It\u2019s fair to consider an intravenous-delivered antibody drug,"}

{"idx": "37941", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The newest book by Francine Jay, a.k.a. Miss Minimalist, doesn't stop at physical belongings.\nTwo years ago, I described Francine Jay's first book, The Joy of Less, as the best book on minimalism I'd ever read. So when I heard she had a new book, I was eager to get my hands on a copy. Lightly: How to Live a Simple, Serene & Stress-free Life just came out this March 2019, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\nLightly takes the philosophy of simple living, which Jay touched on at the end of The Joy of Less, and explores it in greater depth. It is meant to be a minimalist manual, a reference book of sorts that readers can refer to whenever they're in need of guidance or a reset. In Lightly, Jay wants readers to 'minimize' every aspect of their lives \u2013 or, as the title suggests, to 'live lightly'.\n\"It goes beyond decluttering \u2013 far beyond \u2013 to uplift your thoughts, your actions, every moment and aspect of your life. When you declutter and call it a day, it's easy to backslide. But when your entire life is aligned to a guiding principle \u2013 to live lightly \u2013 you'll find a new sense of purpose and fulfillment, and powerful incentive to stay on the path.\"\nThe book starts as you'd expect any decluttering book to start, with a chapter called 'Lighten Your Stuff' that instructs how to pare down kitchen utensils, closets, office supplies, linens, toys, furniture, and more. But then it moves into new territory \u2013 a purposeful lightening of one's load in every aspect of life \u2013 which Jay believes is a natural progression once physical belongings have been reduced.\nA subsequent chapter, 'Lighten Your Step', addresses consumption problems and how we all need to buy less and choose less wasteful items. Jay advises purchasing used, high-quality, ethically-made goods, and opting for borrowed, rented, and shared items whenever possible.\n\"Both the making and discarding of consumer goods takes a toll on our planet; therefore, we want the stuff we buy to last as long as possible. Products used for just a few hours (or minutes!) hardly justify the resources and landfills they require.\"\n'Lighten Your Stress' delves into the importance of minimizing one's schedule and obligations \u2013 a serious problem in a society addicted to being busy all the time. She offers guidance on 'lightly declining' invitations and requests, on unplugging from the digital world, on being satisfied with good results, rather than inachievable perfection, and pursuing one's own version of success.\nThe final chapter, 'Lighten Your Spirit', feels like something you'd read in 'Mindfulness' magazine, but I suppose it's good for all of us to hear the familiar aphorisms repeated: Savor the present. Think before you speak. Let go of your ego. Be kind. Be still.\nBecause the book moves swiftly from cleaning out kitchen cupboards to cultivating a meditation practice, it feels like it spans a very broad range of topics in very little time; but when these are brought together beneath the common thread of living lightly, it all makes more sense.\nJay sets a high bar, one that left me feeling a bit inadequate, but also motivated to do better."}

The IG office released a redacted version of the April 26 report on Monday.\nAmong the information technology inadequacies highlighted: ex-employees were still able to logon to their accounts and unauthorized outsiders successfully acquired user passwords from DHS personnel.\n\"Collectively, the IT control deficiencies limited DHS' ability to ensure that critical financial and operational data were maintained in such a manner to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability,\" the report stated. \"We consider them to collectively represent a material weakness for DHS\" based on accounting industry standards.\nAn auditor impersonating a help-desk employee tricked unwitting DHS staff into providing their system user names and passwords at several agencies, according to the assessment. Recently, hackers used this increasingly popular tactic, known as social engineering, to gain entry into and steal data from federal contractor RSA Security. In that incident, the culprits posed as a recruiting website and sent company employees human resources-related emails containing malicious software that obtained access to the RSA network.\nKPMG analysts used a less sophisticated lure -- a phone call. Masquerading as DHS technical support staff, auditors dialed randomly selected employees at DHS agencies and asked them to provide user passwords to help fix a network issue. At Customs and Border Protection, two of the 16 people who answered the phone divulged their network passwords. At the Transportation Security Administration, the fake technicians snagged three passwords, after an unspecified number of attempts.\nAt the Federal Emergency Management Agency, several personnel shared their user IDs and passwords, the report said. Some staff, however, looked up the imposters' assumed names in an agency directory to check identification, asked for help desk ticket numbers, or reported the attempted breaches to supervisors.\nThe audit did not say how many employees handed over their passwords at each DHS component.\nKPMG analysts also discovered that some agencies neglected to promptly disable the accounts of employees who stopped working for the agency. CBP staff shutdown ex-employee accounts bi-weekly, a violation of agency policy that requires deactivation on the employees' last day. And at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, someone accessed the account of a former employee, even though the agency had installed a feature that disables user accounts after 45 days of inactivity.\nWhile attempting to physically break into systems after hours, investigators found employees left government credit cards, financial system user IDs and passwords, laptops, and server names and network addresses, unguarded in their cubicles or offices.\nAt FEMA, analysts noted seeing large stacks of documents and compiled spreadsheets that contained sensitive, personal information belonging to business partners.

The department confirmed to ZDNet Australia this afternoon that following Ludlam's request, the block on .info sites has been removed.\nAt the time, Ludlam said that it was particularly ironic for Greens MPs, who are opposed to Labor's controversial mandatory internet service provider-level internet filter, to be subject to such a wide-spanning filter themselves.\n\"I spent two years campaigning against an internet filter for the general population, only to discover that now I am one of the only people in the country who is filtered, which is a little bit alarming,\" he said.\nIn a press conference yesterday, Communications Minister Stephen Conroy was asked about the status of the government's plan to introduce legislation to support its mandatory internet filter, which would be based on a blacklist managed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).\nIn his response, Conroy referred to the voluntary Interpol filter implemented by Telstra, Optus and Primus, leading to reports from AAP that Telstra and Optus had implemented the mandatory internet filter.\n\"Well, two companies, in fact three companies, have already introduced it. It may come as a great surprise to you that the internet hasn't slowed down or collapsed,\" Conroy said of the voluntary filter, adding that this showed that filters do not reduce internet speeds for consumers.\n\"They're testing it against the Interpol list, and overwhelmingly Australians have not noticed any difference, any difference whatsoever. We've seen announcements by a whole range of other companies that they're going to introduce it themselves voluntarily. We welcome this; we think this is a fantastic step forward. I've been calling on the sector to stand up and move forward. I think I've only seen now one company that has indicated it may not introduce voluntarily the filter.\"\nThe government has previously indicated that legislation for the mandatory internet filter will be introduced once the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) recommendations on what content should be classed as \"refused classification\" has been considered by the government."}

Only a new generation can bring real change.\nPalestinian suuporters of activist Issa Amro, who was released on bail by a Palestinian court earlier on September 10, 2017 following his prior arrest on September 4, take part in a protest in the West Bank city of Hebron.\nWhen the Trump administration decided to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, a critical juncture in the Palestinian people\u2019s struggle for freedom, the Palestinian Authority leadership failed to respond in any meaningful way. It also failed to prevent the murder of civilians in Gaza and instead continued its punitive policies toward the 2 million besieged Palestinians living in the strip \u2014 including by withholding public servants\u2019 salaries.\nAfter waiting for 22 years since its last meeting, the Palestinian National Council convened recently in Ramallah to choose the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its chairman. The four-day meeting that took place between April 30 and May 3 was a painful reminder of how Palestinian democracy is being undermined by Palestinian leaders.\nThe meeting ended with the announcement of a new Palestinian leadership based on patronage and narrow factional politics. The so-called elections missed the most crucial element in any functioning political system: the people, who were dismissed, marginalized, and silenced in a dreadful illustration of the growing disconnect between the political elites and those they govern. Though this is not a particularly new phenomenon, the level of the leadership\u2019s arrogance was astonishing.\nIn addition to the Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territory, Palestinians suffer from the absence of legitimate leadership and the lack of accountable and inclusive political structures and democratic, effective, and transparent governance. All of this prevents Palestinians from confronting the multiple levels of oppression and repression they face. Reversing this sad state of affairs is an unattainable objective in the existing Palestinian political system. Yet it is a prerequisite if upcoming generations of Palestinians are to have brighter prospects.\nIf they hope to reinvent the current political system, the Palestinian people and a new generation of leaders must expose the current political elites as they continue to divide, disempower, and marginalize the population. This process of reinvention goes beyond the question of dissolving the Palestinian Authority (PA), the Fatah-Hamas binary, and the frameworks dictated by the Oslo Accords 25 years ago. It will require greater political representation, a more inclusive approach to national planning, and the imagination to transcend the antiquated ideas and blinkered worldview that currently dominate the Palestinian leadership\u2019s political thinking.\nThe current Palestinian leadership is neither willing nor interested in the people\u2019s grievances because they threaten PA rule in the West Bank (and Hamas rule in Gaza). The leadership thus continues with its authoritarian ways, seeking to suppress any voices that put its legitimacy at stake or challenge its monopoly on governance.\nOver the last decade, numerous local and international human rights organizations have documented the excessive use of force by the Palestinian security forces to suppress protesters. There have also been politically driven detentions, limits on freedom of speech and political participation and mobilization, as well as surveillance, acts of torture, and grave human rights violations in response to political activism in the streets or on social media.\nThe recent demonstrations at the Gaza border and the clashes in Jerusalem in the summer of 2017 must be understood in this context. Frustration over the status quo and the lack of future prospects and dire living conditions led to the confrontation at"}

It hired Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch last July, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nCarbon Black, formerly known as Bit9, is based in Waltham, Massachusetts, and develops endpoint security software. The startup, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Blackstone, hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan to lead an IPO, Bloomberg reported in June.\nCoupa is a cloud-based software company based in San Mateo, California, that helps companies manage their finances.

Even thought the Nasdaq Composite index is at a record, any turbulence in the market could discourage issuers.\nAt the moment, though, IPO investors are indicated they'll be receptive to new listings, one of the people said, in part because of the scarcity of such deals this year. Mutual funds that invest in IPOs, for example, are looking for opportunities to bolster their returns before the end of the year.\nAnd although there have only been six tech IPOs this year, those that did approach the market performed well.\nNYSE president Tom Farley, right, congratulates Line executives after ringing the opening bell.\nThe cloud-communications company Twilio, for example, priced above range in June and continued to soar for days. The Japanese messaging app Line priced above its range in July, jumped 27% on its first day of trading, and continues to hover.\nStrong tech IPO performance has also piqued the interest of momentum investors, or hedge funds that might be looking to play IPOs as an asset class by betting on the kinds of short-term gains that Twilio and Line posted.\nIn short, bankers are advising companies that are in a position to launch to consider doing so, the person said.\nOther deals that could go in the fall include the enterprise-storage company Nutanix, which has been on file publicly since late 2015, and the application-intelligence software company AppDynamics, which has not yet filed publicly but is a likely contender for the fourth quarter, the people said.\nMost tech IPOs that are likely to go this year - including Apptio, Carbon Black, and Coupa - have revenues under $1 billion, allowing them to file confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act.\nCompanies that file confidentially must make their documents public 15 business days before holding a"}

I toss them in the trash, but what happens if you opt to flush them down a toilet?\nThe researchers tested how 11 types of lenses survive in wastewater treatment facilities, finding that they can fragment into tiny shards, becoming part of the increasing amounts of microplastic pollution in our oceans and other waterways. Alarmingly, the shredded plastic sops up high volumes of other pollutants on its trip to the sea, which are ingested by the marine life as part of a dystopian food chain, eventually making its way into human food.\nPlastic micro-particles now taint everything from German beer to table salt.

Editor Peter Terzian largely succeeds in his goal of bringing music and literature together. What could have been a crop of fanboy/girl exercises is a collection of informed essays that offer personal insight and literary merit.\n\"Heavy Rotation\" features essays on 11 bands, four singers, three soundtracks, a trio of singles and an archival collection. A distinctive feature of this anthology is that the contributors are not primarily known for their music writing. Most are novelists (including Colm Toibin, Joshua Ferris and Kate Christensen), and the journalists are better known for their writing about literature, with the exception of music critic John Jeremiah Sullivan. Sullivan's album of choice is a Revenant Records release of prewar country blues (1897-1939), and he most convincingly portrays the cultural -- rather than personal -- importance of an album.\nPersonal narrative is the prevalent form in the collection, although Terzian has managed to select a wide variety of anecdotes and angles. There is enough stylistic diversity and experimentation to keep things interesting. Many contributors naturally chose to focus on the pivotal moment in their adolescence when a particular album conveyed them across the crucial threshold between child and adult. Through identification with the singer-songwriter, the faults and weaknesses -- the humanity -- of the idol often served as reassurance to the uncertain teen, whether it was Joni Mitchell bringing comfort to Toibin in a small Irish town or Jermaine Jackson as a source of pride for Martha Southgate in an American rust-belt city.\nIn his introduction, Terzian explains how listening to music as a youth made him feel like he \"was learning about . . . the many different ways of living a life.\" As the adult writers reflect on their obsessive teen selves, there is a poignant nostalgia. In his fond remembrance of discovering mod culture through the Who's album \"Quadrophenia,\" critic James Wood wonders if he can still sing the lyric \"thank God I ain't old\" from \"Sea and Sand\" without hypocrisy.\n\"Heavy Rotation\" also shows how an album can sneak up and cause unexpected changes in an identity already established. In a candid and moving contribution, Claire Dederer describes how the demands of her grown-up life made her feel she had become a \"soulless roaster of chickens.\" She felt she \"was missing the essential quality of a listener: a soul.\" Her essay describes how she was dragged to a production of \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" and the \"painted-up, red-mouthed, big-top artifice\" mercifully returned music to her.\nAn unintended pleasure of the collection is that it provides a narrative history of music's technological journey over the last few decades. The writers navigate the transition from vinyl to cassette to compact disc to MP3. The first essay opens with Benjamin Kunkel flipping his tape of the Smiths' 1986 release \"The Queen Is Dead.\" Soon, Kunkel made the move from communal cassette to \"a private indulgence, Walkman listening.\" Other writers describe not being able to understand the lyrics of their special life-changing album until it came"}

Over time, some of these freshwater river fish washed into caves where they continue to live. With perpetual darkness, these cavefish have lost their ability to see along with their skin pigmentation. Oxygen and food are also hard to come by in the caves. In fact, the cave dwelling fish may go for months without eating as they wait for seasonal floods to deliver foods. Dr. Cliff Tabin (Harvard Medical School) recently presented his research on these fish at the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology meeting held at the University of Calgary, Alberta. His research compared surface dwelling and cavefish to identify metabolic differences in the animals that allow cavefish to thrive in their inhospitable environment. Through these studies he discovered remarkable similarities and differences between the cavefish and people with diabetes.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps lower blood sugar after a meal by causing muscle and fat cells to absorb it from the blood. In type 2 diabetes, this insulin-induced glucose disposal is impaired causing blood sugar levels to remain high. Dr. Tabin's research shows that cavefish are also insulin resistant due to a mutation in the receptor that insulin binds to in muscles. Additionally, the livers of these fish store a lot of fat to help cope with times of starvation. Although the cavefish develop fatty liver and insulin resistance like a humans with diabetes, they do not display any pathologies. The researchers hope that by better understanding how these fish cope with sugar and fats, they may discover new ways to treat diabetes."}

Callous-unemotional traits are characterized by a lack of empathy, a disregard for others' feelings and shallow or deficient affect, such as a lack of remorse or guilt. These traits have been linked to deficits in development of the conscience and of empathy.\nThe findings showed that in typically-developing boys, the volume of the anterior insula or gray matter volume -- a brain region implicated in recognising emotions in others and empathy -- is larger in those with higher levels of callous-unemotional traits. The volume explained 19 per cent of the variance in callous-unemotional traits seen only in, but not in girls with the same personality traits.\n\"Our findings demonstrate that callous-unemotional traits are related to differences in brain structure in typically-developing boys without a clinical diagnosis,\" said lead author Nora Maria Raschle from the University of Basel in Switzerland. In the study, using magnetic resonance imaging, the researchers were able to take a closer look at the brain development of typically-developing 189 teenagers to find out whether callous-unemotional traits are linked to differences in brain structure.

Langton, who taught Bagewadi when he was a master\u2019s student, said his enthusiasm for life and for honing his craft is what sets him apart as an artist.\nAlthough \u201cVetted\u201d was released less than a year ago, Bagewadi said he is \u201calready tired of it,\u201d and has been dedicating most of his time to working on a new album, writing new music and collaborating with other artists across the country.\nHe hits the road next week for a month-long tour and has many other performances and festivals lined up in the future \u2014 including his debut performance at Lincoln Center in New York in May.\nBagewadi said he hopes listeners feel a deep sense of empathy listening to the album.

When the ANC permits that, the organisation in itself will be a champion of state capture.\n\"If the ANC sits by and allows the president to run over National Treasury then the ruling party would have sold out SA, not so much the president,\" he said.\nReferring to Gordhan standing in the way of Zuma, Pityana said: \"Pravin Gordhan is not a problem to Zuma because of a shape of his nose. Gordhan is an obstacle to the intentions of the corrupt.\"\nPityana, who is also chairperson of both AngloGold Ashanti and Izingwe Capital, said National Treasury \u201cis the last frontier between [President Jacob] Zuma and unfettered access to the coffers of the state of this country\u201d.\nHe said \u201cZuma and his cronies' attempts to loot the fiscus are frustrated by National Treasury\u201d.\n\u201cWhen Project State Capture is complete our state-owned entities will provide unfettered access to state resources for Zuma and his cronies and family members,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you have no sense of what a nuclear deal will mean for SA, think about this: we'll work for the Russians for the rest of our lives. Our children would be slaves of the Russians,\" he said.\nReferring to heightened speculation that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is making his way to Parliament and may be in line to replace either Gordhan or his deputy, Pityana commented \"my question is why someone like Brian Molefe, who has resigned from Eskom for things he had allegedly done, would agree to guard over the higher fiscus of the country and all the country's SOEs\".\nPityana said a Cabinet lekgotla is currently taking place, but asked whether the real issues will be addressed. \"Such as the hard questions about why the FIC Bill was sent back on the flimsiest of grounds.

God has been calling us on this road for a long time and we need to get on with it.\nThe long-running debate pits reformers, keen to project a more modern and egalitarian image of the church as it struggles with falling congregations in many increasingly secular countries, against a minority of conservatives who see the change as contradicting the Bible.\nLocal media have said Welby is planning to push through the legislation even if it is rejected by the General Synod.\nBut, asked if he could ignore the Synod and impose women bishops on the church anyway, Welby said: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\"What happens if we lose the vote is a matter for the House of Bishops,\" he said, referring to one of three parts of the General Synod. \"I can't dictate it.\"\nThe issue of female clergy has divided Anglicanism globally.\nWomen serve as bishops in the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand but Anglican churches in many developing countries do not even ordain them as priests.\n\"I think we look ridiculous.

And, nothing much happened in Washington. That is, if you don\u2019t count the failure of the Obamacare repeal, the uncertain transgender military ban, North Korea threatening nuclear war (again), the pardoning of Sheriff Joe Arpaio and President Donald Trump whining about the media.\nWithout a doubt, Trump\u2019s attacks on the press are the best political \u201cstrategy\u201d he\u2019s employed since taking office. This isn\u2019t a joke, this isn\u2019t sarcasm. Trump attacks the press because he needs to.

I\u2019d guess Trump was either at on a golf course at Mar-a-Lago, or forgot his Twitter password. The New York Times dedicated an entire article to marking every Trumpian lie since his inauguration. Trump\u2019s PolitiFact scorecard resembles that of Petyr \u201cLittlefinger\u201d Baelish, not of the President of the United States of America.\nSo how does Trump politically survive, given his disregard for the truth? During the campaign, it was to point out (unfairly) the lies of his opponents. \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d have that catchy ring akin to that of a sixth grade bully.

Look at the person sitting in the Oval Office (not including the times he is on a golf course \u2014 playing golf at Mar-a-Lago, at the New Jersey golfing place, at another golfing place or at Camp David).\nThe irony is that the fake media do exaggerate stories, they can be dishonest, and they sometimes don\u2019t report the facts. But the fake media \u2014 Breitbart and the crazy Sandy Hook skeptic \u2014 are generally supportive of Trump. The \u201creal\u201d media \u2014 The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, ABC, Drudge Report (just kidding) \u2014 aren\u2019t intentionally anti-Trump. Rather, they are pro-truth.

The Tories have been arguing teachers should not have to pay either.\nCllr McVey said a levy, if passed on to staff, was likely to be around \u00a31 or \u00a32 a day - much cheaper than the pay and display parking charges in the city centre, which are up to \u00a34.20 an hour in George Street.\n\u201cBusinesses in the city could see it as a charge on a parking space or a way to engage with their workforce to encourage active travel and public transport as a way of getting in.\n\u201cSome companies may not pass it on and just accept it.

Nottingham, the only city in the UK to operate a WPL, used some of its revenue to extend the city\u2019s tramline.\nHe said it was not expected any of the revenue would be needed for the tram extension to Newhaven because that was to be financed from future fares and a contribution from Lothian Buses.\nIt is not clear how soon a levy is likely to be introduced. Even once the Transport Bill is passed at Holyrood, the council will have to draw up a detailed scheme and carry out the consultation. Cllr McVey hopes, if not in force, it could be all be ready to go before the end of the administration\u2019s term of office in 2022."}

I grew up in Birmingham and have always been involved in music, whether it was Violin, Saxophone or singing from an early age I always did lots of it. Then I got a guitar and 6 years later I haven't managed to put it down yet. I remember listening to Oasis when I was about 13 and thinking, maybe I could write songs. I've been massively inspired by the likes of David Bowie, The Arctic Monkeys and John Lennon, if for no reason other than the anthems that they write that bring people together for a moment in time, and I feel that's something that's so important to have in the world, especially given the current climate. If there's anything I believe in, its the emotional value of arts (particularly music in my case) I'm just trying really hard to do everything I can to make music people can relate to, escape to, cry to or dance to, or be inspired by. Just trying to take over the world to be honest.\nThere are a lot of emerging Artists in the UK right now. What sets you apart from the rest? Personally, I feel that the UK especially is crying out for a new wave of music, especially in the lyrical department. I try as hard as I can to write interesting lyrics about things important to people, whether that be me, society as a whole, or a particular group of people. Some of my previously mentioned favourite artists write lyrics that could by read as a poem just as well as they could be sung, and if that's possible, why not try and do it? There is also always a demand for big tunes that bring people together, so that's also high on the agenda.\nWhat\u2019s you back-story? I won''t say too much in this section, but I'll provide a little insight into the inspiration behind the two singles I've released so far. \"Lullabies\" is loosely about the slow realisation that the pinnacle of all you thought life is changes with you, and a particular turn of events transpired to inspire me and my friend to write \"Sirens\" about a drug overdoes. My upcoming third singe \"Jumpers for Goalposts\" is... well you'll have to wait and see.\nWhat are you working on at the moment? My new Single \"Sirens\" is out for distribution now and the release is on the horizon. I'm really happy with the track and I hope people like it as much as me, because it sounds very very large, so hopefully it will make some waves! I will be gigging relentlessly wherever I can, so be sure to expect lots of appearances in London especially. Looking forward, my third single \"Jumpers for Goalposts\" and a potential EP is on the cards, so stay tuned!\nYou're in a Karaoke Bar - What's your go to song? Mardy Bum is always the go to cover, if I'm feeling adventurous, maybe I'll whip out a cheeky Whistle for the Choir.\nWhat was the first gig you went to? It should have been the Arctic Monkeys in 2013, but it was rescheduled and I'm still waiting to see them to this day! In the end, I think it was the Libertines, which was to date the most violent gig I've been to, absolutely incredible though.\nWhich song do you wish you'd written? So many, at the top of the pile would probably have to be Hallelujah just because it's simply the perfect song. Apparently it took 5"}

The ever-scrappy Capt. James T. Kirk. The Shakespeare-quoting Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. Capt. John Archer, the reluctant diplomat. And so on. How are we to take the measure of these captains to figure out who is best?\nWhile Capt. Archer comes last on our list, we want to emphasize he is an extremely able captain that was a true pioneer \u2014 his ship, the Enterprise NX-01, was the first starship capable of exploring distant star systems. That made Archer host to a number of \"first contact\" incidents that would have challenged even the best of us. Memorably, when he encounters the Ferengi for the first time, he immediately senses their selfish nature and plays them off against each other to get his captive ship back in \"Acquisition.\"\nBut Archer still struggles with the responsibilities of being a captain in general. Especially in the early seasons, he doesn't know much about diplomacy or the military; it takes repeated encounters with hostile species such as the Klingons or the Suliban to realize the value of tactics. Archer began to hit his stride in Season 3, but, unfortunately, we didn't get to see much of his evolution because the series was canceled after Season 4.\nBenjamin Sisko started his command at Deep Space Nine under very difficult circumstances. His wife was dead \u2014 it's a long story involving the evil Borg species, but he held Capt. Jean-Luc Picard responsible for it as Picard was temporarily assimilated into the Borg's collective. Sisko was on the verge of resignation. After his crew members began arriving, Sisko quickly discovered that the situation on Bajor, the nearby planet, would be incredibly difficult to resolve because so many factions were trying to gain control of the government.\nThe rebooted Capt. Kirk (played by Chris Pine) starts as a much younger captain than the one portrayed in the TV series. This gives Pine the room to make some juvenile-yet-hilarious mistakes, such as getting in bar fights, or being angry with colleague Spock because the logical Vulcan alien \u2014 a very by-the-books sort of person \u2014 accused Kirk of cheating on a key test when he found a loophole.\nKirk's boisterous mistakes as a neophyte captain made him funny to watch on screen in the first movie (\"Star Trek,\" 2009), but by the second movie (\"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" 2012) his mistakes quickly caught him up to him. Among other errors, he broke the First Directive about contact with alien species early in their development, and put too much trust in the terrorist John Harrison (played by Benedict Cumberbatch).\nFortunately, Kirk matured by the time \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) was released, and he began to show the crafty gifts of his TV namesake. One of the best sequences was near the end of the film, when he rode a motorcycle around an enemy camp to confuse the aliens there and give his captured crew enough time to escape. We're looking forward to seeing how Kirk progresses in the next \"Star Trek\" film, which is greenlit but doesn't yet have a release date or a name.\nIn raw courage, Capt. Janeway may win for her ability to keep the crew focused while her ship was stranded on the far side of"}

K: What does neuropsychological testing involve?\nDEAR DOCTOR K: My husband\u2019s doctor suspects that he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease and wants him to have neuropsychological testing. What will these tests involve?\nDEAR READER: There is no single test that can diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In fact, a doctor cannot make the diagnosis with absolute confidence without studying the brain under the microscope, which is rarely done except in an autopsy.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is diagnosed presumptively by a combination of different types of evidence. The disease typically has a slowly progressive onset. Sudden confusion or speech problems, for example, are not caused by Alzheimer\u2019s.\nIndeed, a very important part of making a presumptive diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s is first ruling out many other causes of thinking problems. Other conditions, such as a brain tumor, can impair a person\u2019s thinking. So can certain medicines.\nATTENTION \u2014 A major reason people fail to remember new information is that they don\u2019t really concentrate on it when the information is first presented to them. There are many tests to assess attention. For example, the doctor might read a sequence of numbers, then ask the person to repeat back as many as he can remember.\nMEMORY \u2014 Memory testing usually requires that a person listen to or look at some information and then answer questions about it. Or the person may be asked to repeat it back immediately, and then again 10 to 30 minutes later. The doctor might also test long-term memory, things that almost everyone knows that happened long ago. For example, your husband might be asked to name his birthplace, or who was the president of the United States during World War II.\nEXECUTIVE FUNCTION \u2014 This is an umbrella term for high-level thinking skills. These include reasoning, problem solving, planning, inhibiting impulses and resisting distraction in order to stay focused on a task. These abilities often become impaired in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nLANGUAGE \u2014 Language functions include being able to express yourself through speaking and writing. They also involve understanding what another person is saying or what you are reading. The doctor may ask the person to name common objects. For example, the doctor may hold up a pencil and ask your husband what it\u2019s called. Problems with naming and word finding can be early symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s. Your husband may be asked to follow instructions or describe a picture in writing.\nSPATIAL ABILITY \u2014 This involves analyzing visual information \u2014 shapes, faces, and routes between locations on a map, for example. Tests may include drawing and copying designs, solving maze puzzles, and putting blocks together to construct a specific pattern.\nNeuropsych testing cannot, alone, definitively diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, the testing results, along with the medical history, brain-imaging studies and other evidence, can give the doctor pretty strong evidence for or against Alzheimer\u2019s. I hope the testing turns out in your husband\u2019s favor.\nDr. Anthony Komaroff is a physician and professor at Harvard Medical School.
