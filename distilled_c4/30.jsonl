{"idx": "30000", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Colin Kaepernick made headlines again last week, after a column in the Miami Herald criticized him for praising the now deceased Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro.\nShortly after, the NFL issued a statement that said players are encouraged, but not required, to stand for the national anthem. This is the same organization that refused to allow the Dallas Cowboys to wear helmet decals in honor of the five Dallas Police officers that were gunned down at a Black Live Matter protest in July.\nKaepernick is a biracial professional football player, who attended the University of Nevada on a full athletic scholarship and currently earns over $15 million a year as the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers.\nAs he took to the field at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Nov. 27, the football star was met with a chorus of boos from a crowd of over 65,000 people. Miami is home to a large community of Cuban exiles and their descendants, many of whom took to streets in celebration of Castro\u2019s death early last week. It is unclear what triggered the negative reaction from the crowd, Kaepernick\u2019s asinine comments to the Miami Herald or his decision to wear a T-shirt featuring a supportive image of Castro earlier this year.\nSpeaking at a press conference shortly after losing to the Dolphins 31-24, Kaepernick was asked to clarify his opinion of Castro. The media, it seems, has taken a keen interest in Kaepernick\u2019s social and geopolitical insights as of late.\n\u201cWhat I said was I agree with the investment in education,\u201d Kaepernick said. \u201cI also agree with the investment in free universal healthcare. \u2026 I would hope that everybody agrees those things are good things.\u201d He went on to suggest that the media had misinterpreted his earlier comments, and that he did not support Castro\u2019s more oppressive policies as Cuba\u2019s long-term dictator.\nAdmittedly, there is some truth in Kaepernick\u2019s remarks. As with most communist regimes in history, Cuba did adopt a socialized health care system during Castro\u2019s 47-year reign. Of course, it also adopted Marxist economic policies, political repression, religious persecution and a flagrant disregard for basic human rights.\nTo be sure, there is excellent health care in Cuba \u2014 just not for the Cuban people. Castro\u2019s communist regime created a three-tiered system: one for tourists, one for government and military officials and one for the general population. Cuba\u2019s top-tier hospitals and clinics are exceptional, but they require payment in advance and are usually only accessible to tourists and party elites.\nIf these facilities are comparable to the U.S., those available to ordinary Cubans are comparable to developing nations. Hospitals and clinics are deteriorating, medications are scarce and conditions are so unsanitary that patients often choose to bring in their own supplies, or just stay at home.\nAs for education, Castro\u2019s investment was motivated entirely by his Marxist-Leninist ideology. In creating a free public education system, he sought to follow in the footsteps of previous communist regimes and create a literate population absolutely loyal to the state. Education became universal, but it was severely censored, pro-communist and deeply intolerant of government criticism.\nDriven from their homes and deprived of basic human rights, hundreds of thousands of Cubans have fled the island since Castro took power in 1959.

Just getting bowl eligible was a victory, so his 7-6 season felt like an epiphany.\nBut perception changes. And what was once a success can become stagnation or a step back when the bar has been elevated.\nWhich brings Dantonio and the Spartans to Saturday\u2019s regular-season finale against Rutgers (4 p.m./Fox).

And most of them, as they have all year, were on offense.\nThe Spartans continued to struggle to put points on the board for the second straight week. They have not scored a touchdown in 131 minutes of football, and their 12 points in the past two losses are the fewest in consecutive games since the 2000 season.\nCo-coordinator Dave Warner\u2019s offense has continued to take steps backward since setting its record-setting 2014 season, in which they finished 13th in the nation in total offense.

It is 20 years since that knee injury.

For the Oct. 15 presentation, the Sony F55 cameras were run in a live configuration. With CA-4000 4K fiber transmission camera adapters attached to the docking interface of the F55s, they were turned into 4K live system cameras. The CA-4000 was connected to the OB truck using a standard SMPTE fiber connection into a BPU-4000 Base Band Processor Unit. The BPU then provided all of the 4K and HD outputs for the event.\nSignals from each camera were recorded to a Sony PWS-4400 server in the OB truck. With PWA-RCT1 Recording Control Software installed, a Windows PC triggered rec/stop/play/file transfer on the PWS- 4400 so that it could be operated as a VTR.

In a survey of thousands of casual, up-scale restaurants from Delaware to Maine, they found just four percent had \"Maine lobster\" on the menu.\nIn a national survey, the collaborative found that nearly 75 percent of restaurants did not specify where the lobster was caught.\n\"We need the consumer to realize that they can get a very good tasting product they're not used to having so they will want that,\" said lobsterman Stephen Train.\nTrain said the Maine lobster industry is fighting the perception that hard-shell lobster, often caught in Canada, ships more easily and contains more meat.\n\"We're finding out now that the new shell can ship if we take good care of it,\" said Train.\nTrain believes the marketing campaign will be a worthwhile investment if it means increasing lobster prices.\nIn recent years, the catch has outweighed demand, and prices for Maine lobster have plummeted.\nThe marketing campaign will be pursuing food bloggers, chefs, and influential people in the industry to generate more interest in Maine lobster.\n\"Our intent is to conquer the Northeast this year, and then head out to the rest of North America and overseas,\" said Jacobson."}

Anyone can play the game with the AI agent, nicknamed AllenAI, by going to Iconary.AllenAI.org.\nBut it\u2019s not just a game.\nIconary is also a platform designed to see how far the institute, known as AI2, can go in its quest to perfect what the game\u2019s inventors call \u201ccommon-sense AI\u201d \u2014 that is, the ability to understand everyday concepts and make abstractions to deal with new situations.\n\u201cWe wanted to study the kinds of games that teach us more about the underlying assumptions and knowledge about how the world works,\u201d said Ali Farhadi, a University of Washington computer scientist who heads up AI2\u2019s Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research team, or PRIOR.\nFarhadi said the structure of the game meshes with how he and his colleagues believe AI will actually be used in the real world, in contrast to the Terminator-tinged dystopia that comes up so often in the debate over the future of AI.\nA key concept for understanding collaboration, and human-style intelligence in general, is a little something called \u201ctheory of mind\u201d \u2014 basically, our ability to put ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and see reality through their eyes.\nTheory of mind is what\u2019s thought to distinguish human cognition from animal cognition, although some scientists say they see signs of the trait in chimpanzees, birds and other creatures. It\u2019s what makes it possible to imagine alternate scenarios and formulate strategies for those scenarios, even if they\u2019ve never been encountered before.\nFarhadi said the theory-of-mind approach is different from the typical machine-learning approach to AI, which involves training the software on myriad real-world examples that have been encountered before. Iconary could provide a way to get at the distinction.\nIconary grew out of the PRIOR team\u2019s search for alternatives to the adversarial games so often used for AI research.\nPictionary checked all the boxes that Farhadi and his fellow researchers wanted to fill, but they had to change the game to have it work on a computer.\nThe PRIOR team created a vocabulary of 1,200 icons, ranging from stick figures and arrows to pictures of fruit and buildings. When AllenAI is doing the drawing, it will formulate a phrase \u2013 for example, \u201cdrinking fruit punch\u201d \u2013 and then select the icons for a mouth, a glass and an orange to represent the phrase.\nIf you\u2019re not able to guess the correct phrase, AllenAI will try again, focusing on the incorrectly guessed words. For example, if you guess \u201cdrinking orange juice,\u201d AllenAI will fill the screen with fruit icons to steer you in the right direction.\n\u201cGrowing up, I played a lot of Pictionary \u2026 I think AllenAI is a better drawer than my family,\u201d AI2 principal software engineer Sam Skjonsberg joked.\nWhen it\u2019s your turn, you can draw rough sketches of your clues and pick out the icons that come closest to your clues from a menu"}

Yet, for the thousands of high school students attending Catalyst Prep SAT and ACT bootcamps, such references to pop culture \u2013 along with a good bit of humor \u2013 are antidotes for the monotony of preparing for standardized tests.\n\u201cMy premise was, \u2018What if Jon Stewart and Conan O\u2019Brien got together and wrote an SAT prep course?\u2019\u201d says Catalyst Prep founder Jared Friedland, who got the ideas while writing for a Hollywood animation studio by day and teaching college prep courses in the evening.\nIn 2005, Friedland began writing his own curriculum. By late the following year he had gotten his act into four California schools, including Westlake High School near Los Angeles, which now uses Catalyst Prep exclusively. \u201cStudents have increased their SAT scores as a direct result of the program,\u201d says the school\u2019s principal, Ron Lipari.\nThis year the Santa Monica, Calif. company will bring its $165 SAT and ACT bootcamps to about 250 schools in a dozen states. Revenue for September \u2013 typically its busiest month \u2013 is projected to be about $1 million, double what it was last year. \u201cOur goal is to reach $10 million in annual revenue by 2014,\u201d says Friedland, who donates 20% of bootcamp sales back to school programs and offers free classes to low-income students. Though these SAT and ACT bootcamps account for 60% of sales, the company also offers private and semi-private instruction, as well as prep classes for high-stakes testing, advanced placement, and private school entrance exams.\nCatalyst Prep now has 27 full-time staffers working on curriculum and business development, as well as about 350 part-time instructors, who \u201cin addition to having academic chops, have to be able to crack people up and command an audience,\u201d says Friedland. To qualify for the job, prospective instructors take the SAT \u2013 and are expected to score at least 2,250 out of 2,400 \u2013 and then audition by teaching something from Catalyst Prep\u2019s curriculum.\nThe goal \u2013 improve students\u2019 standardized test scores \u2013 is no different than traditional prep courses offered by the likes of Kaplan or The Princeton Review. But Catalyst Prep takes a more light-hearted approach, with an emphasis on easing students\u2019 angst. Its bootcamps tend to be bigger than most prep classes, but the company will bring in multiple instructors who play off each other. \u201cIt becomes an audience of students,\u201d says Friedland.\nThe bootcamp guidebook, meanwhile, uses television shows, pop songs and celebrity tweets to help students understand grammar. Jessica Simpson\u2019s hit song \u201cBetween You And I,\u201d for example, should be \u201cBetween you and Me.\u201d And when Paris Hilton says she had no idea she lived in a mansion until \u201cI went to visit a friend and was like \u2018Oh,\u2019\u201d it\u2019s a classic case of faulty comparisons. Turning to math, the book uses Justin Bieber\u2019s head to graph a parabola and Jonah Hill\u2019s weight fluctuations to talk about percentages.\nTo keep the material current, Friedland and his team rewrite the curriculum annually and tweak it by region.

This could give it the ability to attach spy equipment to an opponent\u2019s satellite, push it out of alignment, distort its signals, damage it, destroy it \u2014 or even potentially capture it.\nDestroying a satellite, however, poses immense risks for all space flight activities.

As the Kremlin steps up its efforts to disseminate its narrative to a broader audience while restricting foreign ownership of the country's media outlets, new opposition-minded information platforms have started to appear.\nSputnik is built on the foundation of state news agency RIA Novosti, which was dismantled last December and incorporated into a global outlet called Rossiya Segodnya. Sputnik presented itself as an alternative for disillusioned news consumers in a press release Monday, saying it would cater to those who are \"tired of aggressive propaganda promoting a unipolar world and want a different perspective.\"\nDmitry Kiselyov \u2014 the controversial head of state news agency Rossiya Segodnya known for his anti-Western rants and homophobic diatribes \u2014 did not deny that the launch of Sputnik would help Russia wage the ongoing informational war against the West that has accompanied the conflict in Ukraine.\n\"There are countries that impose their will on both the West and the East,\" Kiselyov said, referring to the U.S. and its Western partners, according to comments carried by RIA Novosti. \"They cause bloodshed, spark civil wars and color revolutions, and even destroy countries like Iraq, Libya, Georgia, Ukraine and Syria wherever they go. \u2026 Russia offers a model of the world that favors humanity. We are in favor of a multifarious, multifaceted world, and we have many allies [who share this objective].\"\nStarting in 2015, Sputnik will broadcast from 130 cities in 34 countries, including from regional offices in Washington, Beijing and Cairo, and will offer content in 30 languages. The multi-million-dollar initiative is meant to bolster the Kremlin's efforts to counter Western media outlets' largely unflattering coverage of Russia.\nOn its first day, the American version of Sputnik published a story suggesting that 2014 was the \"year of secession\" and that Miami could separate from the state of Florida. It also ran articles highlighting Kiev's \"top five mistakes\" in handling the Ukrainian crisis and detailing Oliver Stone's plans for an upcoming film about U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden's escape to Moscow.\nDespite the country's economic woes and plummeting currency, the Russian government announced in September it would dramatically increase funding for state-run media outlets, including Rossiya Segodnya and RT.

Its private train depot welcomed guests non-stop from Chicago, and limousines ushered guests from the rail station, as well as from arriving steamer ships.\nWhen it opened, The Cavalier had 195 guest rooms and the grounds spanned 350 acres, including a golf course on 290 of those acres. Within the guest rooms, bathtubs featured an extra handle that would draw seawater direct from the Atlantic Ocean, and the in-room sinks had ice water spigots that would draw cold water, anytime, from a large wooden ice-filled tub on the hotel roof.\nIn addition to hosting seven U.S. presidents overnight \u2014 Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon \u2014 The Cavalier welcomed the top celebrities of the era, including Frank Sinatra, Muhammad Ali, Elizabeth Taylor, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ella Fitzgerald and many, many more. And, when the oceanfront Cavalier Beach Club opened in 1929, it became a popular entertainment destination; big band leaders Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway, Glenn Miller and Lawrence Welk all performed there.\nAs with many historic hotels, when World War II broke out The Cavalier turned from a luxury hotel into a military facility; the U.S. Navy moved in in October 1942 and used the building for its radar training. The hotel\u2019s history fluctuated for decades after the war, closing in 1973 when its sister hotel, Cavalier Oceanfront, opened, and then reopening again in 1976. Finally, a family feud caused a court-ordered sale of the hotel in 2012, and the winning bid went to The Cavalier Associates, a group that intended to renovate and restore the hotel rather than demolish it.\nFast forward and after three years and nearly $85 million in renovations, led by Gold Key | PHR, The Cavalier reopened this spring, and the results are nothing short of spectacular. The hotel is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is the first in Virginia to be a part of Marriott\u2019s distinguished Autograph Collection.\nGuests who check into The Cavalier will find 85 spacious and elegantly-appointed guest rooms and suites, all of which feature flat-screen TVs, Molton Brown bath toiletries, plush bathrobes and plenty of room to make themselves more than comfortable.

There are many issues in this particular topic that Assyrian historians and writers prefer not to address because certain aspects of this history aroused, and unfortunately continue to arouse, strong emotions. However, these issues must be recorded in order to preserve historical integrity for present and future generations.\nIn order to understand the role of the French in the Assyrian national movement, it is vital to have an understanding of the British-French conflict prior to World War I. For centuries, before the existence of Communism and Capitalism, these two nations had fought each other. The history of Franco-British confrontation reaches back to the 18th century American Revolution and the Napoleonic attempts to rule Europe. These events heralded tenacious and bitter conflicts during the 19th century that resulted in French expansion into Africa and Asia. It was only during the Third Republic (1871 -- 1940), after France had lost its war against Germany (1870), and the latter was united a year later by Otto Von Bismarck, that France came to a certain level of cooperation with the British. But the competition continued.\nDuring World War I France struggled to dominate new territories while fighting Germany and the Ottoman Empire. This new urgent alliance among \"Orthodox\" Russia, \"Anglican\" Britain, and \"Catholic\" France represents strategic considerations as the three realized the alliance was their sole chance to expand their political and economic power throughout the world. WWI, directly triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was fought for three basic reasons: Franco-German animosity since 1870, the need for international markets for Europe's industrial manufacture in Ottoman controlled markets, and Russian need for access through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\nThe term \"British protection of the Assyrians\" was in reality British exploitation. By the early 20th century, British interest in the Assyrians had degenerated into manipulation of Assyrian leadership whose reliance on British promises grew out of external pressures beyond their control. Two critical factors for the over reliance on the British were: 1) abrupt Russian withdrawal from Urmia and its periphery in 1917 which left the Assyrians isolated and vulnerable to Turkish and Kurdish attack, 2) admission of Iraq into the League of Nations in October 193l thus permitting the Iraqi government and certain leaders who opposed Patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun to defy his leadership on the international stage.\nAfter 1932 the relationship between Britain and Iraq altered to that of two sovereign states. Iraqi- British treaties gave the latter oil concessions that allowed disregard of the massacre of the Assyrians in 1933. This occurred two years after Iraq's admission into the League of Nations and a few days following house arrest of the patriarchal family inside the YMCA center in Mosul. They later were exiled in Cyprus. These events occurred with the clear knowledge of the British. They spelled the end of Assyrian revolutionary thought in the Assyrian national movement. Assyrian helplessness in the face of powerful forces resulted in a depression in the national psyche regarding the past and loss of initiative to formulate long tem strategies up to the present.\nWhat facilitated the French intervention in the Assyrian freedom movement was the conversion of some leading"}

Although few have raised significant funds to date, many charities are beginning to see the Internet as their future.\n\"This brings us into contact with a whole new set of shoppers and donors,\" said Christine Nyirjesy Bragale, spokeswoman for Goodwill Industries International.\nEarlier this week, Goodwill Industries announced that it has teamed with GreaterGood.com to create a co-branded Web site. Five percent to 15 percent of the amount consumers spend at the site, named Goodwill.greatergood.com, will go to Goodwill.\nMeanwhile, Charitableway.com, which allows users to donate funds via its Web site, announced this week that it has received $35 million in second round venture funding, led by Technology Crossover Ventures.\nThe online efforts by these charities and Net start-ups come as the pool of Internet users and revenues grows. Forrester Research estimates that consumers spent some $20 billion online last year, and it projects that number will grow to $184 billion by 2004.\nBut it remains to be seen if consumers will donate to charity online, and few numbers have been released from charitable organizations. Goodwill, which launched its online auction site Shopgoodwill.com in August, has raised just $100,000 through the site, a drop in the bucket compared to the organization's $1.5 billion in annual revenue. Prominent charities such as the national office of the United Way do not yet accept donations online and are still exploring options for raising funds online.\nCharities that have raised significant funds via the Internet are still the exception, said Mark Rovner, senior vice president of Craver Mathews Smith, a consulting firm for charities. \"Organizations that are raising more money than they are spending on their Web presence are still a minority.\"\nDespite the slow start, the Internet represents a huge opportunity for charities, Rovner said. Already, the pool of potential online donors is larger, younger and more diverse than charities have traditionally found.\nAccording to a recent study commissioned by Craver, some 16 million online users would be willing to donate money to nonprofits over the Internet. The study also found that the average age of a donor who responded to direct mail solicitations from a charity was 66, while the average age of a potential online donor was 42.\nCharities are still trying to figure out how to tap into that potential and are exploring a number of options for raising funds online. The American Red Cross, for instance, allows consumers to donate directly to the organization through its online site. Meanwhile, third-party sites such as GreaterGood.com are trying to become online shopping malls, promising consumers that each purchase they make will benefit their favorite charity.\nBut with e-commerce and other Net companies spending millions of dollars on online advertising, observers say charities run the risk of getting lost in the shuffle. Some have tried to take advantage of all the dot-com advertising by teaming with well-known players.\nYahoo, for instance, has donated some of its advertising spots to nonprofit organizations. Amazon and other e-commerce sites also have arranged deals with various nonprofits to dedicate a portion of certain sales"}

Experts say that the move could slow the growth of solar installations across the country.\nIn Indiana, a 2017 law that phases out an incentive for rooftop solar is already threatening growth in the local installation industry. The legislation was intended to sunset what some called a subsidy for industry that had outgrown it.\nThe author of the law, Sen. Brandt Hershman, said last month that the legislature would review any impact made by Trump's tariff decision. Hershman has since left the senate, but Sen. Jim Merritt, the law's co-author and the chair of the Senate Utilities Committee, said that he would monitor the situation and propose solutions if any became necessary.\nThe following story was originally published on January 1, 2018.\nWhen Sen. Brandt Hershman, R-Buck Creek, crafted the much-debated legislation that phases out an incentive for rooftop solar, he looked at the plummeting price of solar panels and decided that the incentive was no longer needed.\nNow, that assumption may change.\nPresident Donald Trump will rule by Jan. 26 on a pending tariff case brought by a U.S. manufacturer. Such a tariff would drive up the cost of solar panels imported from abroad.\nDepending on its size, the tariff could have a cooling effect on an industry in Indiana that is already wondering what a future without net metering will mean for business. The Indiana solar market is particularly sensitive to these kind of price changes, due to the low cost of electricity in the state.\nSuniva, an American company that manufactures solar panels, filed the tariff case with the International Trade Commission in May. Their request would have doubled the cost of solar panels imported from overseas, which would have devastated an industry that has been growing rapidly in recent years.\nIn November, the ITC made recommendations much lower than what Suniva had requested. That was a relief to Phil Teague, who owns solar installation companies in Indiana and California. Teague predicts that, if adopted, the ITC's recommended tariffs won't have a devastating effect on his business.\nPresident Trump, however, is not required to adhere to the ITC's recommendations. The administration has not commented publicly on how the president may rule, but details about the case suggest that he may be in favor of tariffs. The bulk of imported solar panels are manufactured in China, a country widely criticized by the Trump administration as having an unfair trade advantage.\n\"We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them,\" Trump said, speaking during an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam in November.\nThe tariff case comes at a time when Indiana\u2019s solar market is still reeling from a new law that phases out an incentive for residential solar installation. Part of the law included a grandfather period that expires at the end of the year, which sent Hoosiers rushing tooverwhelmed solar installers who then had to turn some clients away.\nThe incentive, called net metering, dictates that ratepayers with solar panels should be compensated for the energy they produce at the retail rate rather than the wholesale rate. Net metering is viewed by the solar industry as an important tool that allows homeowners to receive a faster return on what's often a hefty investment. As net metering phases out, solar installers fear that there will be fewer customers who will be willing or able to invest in the"}

LNG-fueled trucks offer 15% higher fuel efficiency compared to traditional diesel-powered engines and have a reach of 1500 kilometers. This represents an immediate cost saving. They also emit 99% less particulate matter and up to 70% less nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions than the levels required by the current Euro VI diesel norms.

Total funding in the 100 person company, which expects to double its staff in the next year, now stands at $63 million.\nAs part of the funding, Opscode is changing its corporate name to mirror its wildly successful product, known as Chef.\n\u201cI think the reason that investors were pretty fired up is, frankly, the financial performance over the past year,\u201d said Crist, the former CEO of Likewise Software.\nThe Chef platform has been gaining steam in recent months as large enterprises \u2014 everyone from Facebook to Nordstrom to Riot Games\u2014 implement it in order to more quickly automate development processes and move business operations into the cloud. To date, more than 500 enterprises are using Chef, with sales expected to grow more than 220 this year. New customer additions are up 350 percent over the previous year.\nIn fact, a large percentage of companies utilizing Amazon Web Services also are turning to Chef as an \u201conramp\u201d to the cloud. Essentially, it allows those organizations to ramp up more quickly with cloud services. \u201cChef is actually extremely simpatico with AWS and the (Microsoft) Azures of the world,\u201d he said.\nCrist said that CIOs are turning to Chef because it offers them the ability to rapidly release updates to Web applications, multiple times per day.\nIn addition to the new financing, Chef today is announcing several executive appointments, including former Microsoft manager Curt Anderson who is joining as CFO; former CA Technologies Vice President Tucker Callaway, who is joining as VP of Enterprise; and Tom Murphy, former VP of Customer Success at Apptio, who is joining as VP of Services.\nRory O\u2019Driscoll, a partner at ScaleVP, is joining the board. \u201cChef\u2019s strong revenue and customer growth, vibrant open source community, and disruptive technology point to strong momentum and a huge opportunity ahead,\u201d said O\u2019Driscoll in a statement.\nSome of the new funds will be used to expand sales and marketing, as well as push deeper into international markets. For now, the company hasn\u2019t secured the Chef.com domain, which is owned by Target, instead going with GetChef.com for its Web presence.\nThe new financing, however, comes at a bittersweet moment in the company\u2019s history since it comes just a few days after former Opscode CEO Mitch Hill passed away after a nine-month battle with cancer.

Many with mental health problems won\u2019t seek therapy due to social stigma issues, Cook said, adding that cost also can be a barrier.\nPlus, those who ultimately do seek treatment, he said, sometimes have trouble getting timely appointments with providers.\nLearn to Live\u2019s business model initially focused on individuals who paid for access to the program.\nAt a retail price of $149, each program includes eight 30-minute online lessons plus homework assignments in between. Users watch online videos, write journal entries and complete exercises that help them identify problems and develop coping strategies.\nBeyond the digital content, Cook said, people can ask questions of a trained psychologist via text, e-mail or phone. Most people complete the program within 10 weeks, Cook said, but it\u2019s self-paced.\nAs more individuals started using the program, Learn to Live started reaching out to organizational partners such as employers, insurers and health care providers.\nAn employer might provide access to the online program as part of an employee wellness program, Cook said, or an insurer might include Learn to Live as a covered benefit. A psychology practice might direct patients to the program as an adjunct to therapy. A college or university can make the program available to students \u2014 Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., for example, gave students a code that gets them free entry to the program.\n\u201cThe number of organizational clients that we have is growing by 50 percent year over year,\u201d Cook said, while acknowledging the track record is short, only in its second year.\nSome anxiety sufferers use social media as their primary communication channel, Cook said, so Learn to Live has developed outreach methods that work in the online world.\nInspirational and informational messages sometimes work in capturing the attention of people seeking help online with mental health issues, he said. But the company has found that sardonic humor often works to engage sufferers."}

The proximity of so many musicians to what was once the biggest concentration of songwriters in the country -- at the Brill Building, on Broadway -- also attracted record companies to the area.\nBut in the last few years the longstanding industry has been altered by powerful forces, like gentrification and the explosive growth of digital technology in the recording business. Whether the changes will help or hurt the premier business of Hell's Kitchen is fiercely argued, but few doubt that major changes are under way in the area.\nConsider the revival of the neighborhood -- from its renaming as Clinton in an effort to soften its tough image, to the redevelopment of Times Square as a whole.\nIn one way, these changes have been a boon to the recording studios.\n''There was a time when no women left here without being accompanied by someone; usually me,'' said Walter Sear, who has had a studio in Hell's Kitchen for 35 years. Lately, Mr. Sear said, he has been able to give up his job as a bodyguard for his clients.\nBut along with cleaner streets and falling crime rates have come rising rents, and some studios have felt the pinch. ''Many low-end studios have moved to Queens, and the midlevel studios are under pressure,'' said Mr. Sear, whose Sear Sound Recording is on West 48th Street.\nIndeed, a number of the neighborhood's best-known studios have gone out of business over the years: A & R, Media Sound, Automated, Sound Ideas, Secret Sound and one of the biggest of all, Record Plant.\nBut even as some studios have closed, others that can afford the higher rents have sprung up.\nSome of the new arrivals are huge. Sony spent millions of dollars renovating the old 20th Century Movietone News building on West 54th Street to set up a national headquarters for its studio operations. The company's diverse clients include Yo-Yo Ma, Julio Iglesias, Tony Bennett, Nirvana and Garth Brooks.\nOther studios have famous names behind them. Sean (Puffy) Combs, the rap artist, has opened a studio called Daddy's House in the old Record Plant building on West 44th Street, and two other companies have reclaimed the studio space built by Record Plant on the top floor.\nAnd there are many other new operations. In the Film Center building on Ninth Avenue, several studios -- including Reel Tyme, Adrian Carr Music and Mirror Image -- have started up in the last few years. And Threshold Music has built two studios in converted rehearsal space in the basement of an apartment building near the Lincoln Tunnel.\nJames Walsh, Threshold's owner, who has just renewed his lease, acknowledged that rents in Hell's Kitchen have gone up a bit but said the neighborhood is worth it. ''It's pretty well located among the various record labels,'' he said.\nFor some, however, the makeover of Hell's Kitchen has raised another"}

Lets quit p*ssy-footing around and call it like it is. The war in Iraq is a grand profiteering scheme gone awry and Americans need to take off their blinders and face the truth.\nAs the cost of the war leaves a deeper black hole of debt for our great-grandchildren, people need to ask themselves whether the hundreds of billions spent thus far have helped anyone other than reconstruction companies and defense contractors. It takes no thought, the answer is no.\nAnd after that, to paraphrase a powerful John Kerry comment from the Viet Nam era, Americans need think about which soldier will be the last to die for this mistake.\nDay in and day out, Bush is on TV saying we will not withdraw from Iraq. How much longer will Americans put up with this bumbling idiot?\nThe rumblings for impeachment are getting louder and for good reason. The British memo released this week on Bush's conversation with Tony Blair in January 2003, not only proves that Bush planned to take the country to war using whatever lies he deemed necessary, it also proves that there was no plan for post-war Iraq.\nBush is throwing good money after bad like a compulsive gambler, as our troops get sucked deeper and deeper into a bloody quagmire. The situation in Iraq has elevated beyond a disaster and all Bush wants to do is sink more tax dollars into the same failed policies that brought us to this point.\nOver the past 6 months, we have heard a lot of accusations about \"revisionist history\" from Bush and his minions in answer to those who dare to question whether there ever was a real threat from Iraq.\nHowever, there is an abundance of evidence that administration officials sought to portray Iraq as a deadly threat to the American people in the run-up to war. But as we now know, there is a great difference between the hand-picked intelligence that was presented to Congress and the American people when compared to what was actually in Iraq.\nAmericans were fed a fairy tale about fighting a war of liberation that would be short, cheap, and bloodless. The Bush administration was like a pied piper as it lead the nation into the Iraq disaster.\nIn hindsight, what is particularly troublesome is how naively the nation followed.\nLooking back, there were countless examples of provocative rhetoric as they lead the country to war in Iraq. In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush coined the phrase \"Axis of Evil,\" while pointing at Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.\nIn October 2002, the White House Press Secretary said regime change in Iraq could be accomplished with \"the cost of one bullet.\"\nOn March 17, in his final speech to the American people before the invasion, Bush took one last opportunity to bolster his case for war. The centerpiece of his argument was the same message he brought to the UN months before, and the same message he hammered home at every opportunity in the intervening months, namely that Saddam had failed to destroy the WMDs and presented an imminent danger to the American people.\n\"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments,\" he said, \"leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.\"\nIn a public address on March 19, 2003, Bush told the world: \"Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly -- yet, our purpose is sure.

But there are still virtualization startups out there, among them Redwood City, Calif.-based MokaFive, which is gunning for a chance to go up against Microsoft, IBM and Citrix with its own desktop-in-the-cloud model, which debuts on Tuesday.\nI chatted with MokaFive founder and CTO John Whaley about what makes MokaFive\u2019s model different from that of its competitors, and how reliable a desktop-in-the-cloud might be.\nGigaOM: How is the MokaFive desktop different and why did you guys go with a cloud computing storage model?\nJohn Whaley: Running a desktop off of a server is expensive and you have to be connected to the server. You can generally fit only a certain number of desktops on a server and the servers processing all the information can run really slow. So we chose a client running on a computer carried via a USB drive.\nAnother benefit to running a desktop off a client is we have this feature that keeps all of the data separate from the OS and the applications. So if you ever mess up the system with malware, viruses, etc., you just shut down and restart with a pristine OS and applications.\nGO: Are customers concerned about reliability of the Amazon infrastructure and the idea of storing their desktop in the cloud rather than on dedicated hardware?\nWhaley: We have over 60 customers and they can host the data themselves or we use Amazon S3 to host only the bits for each user. We don\u2019t store the code with Amazon. If a user isn\u2019t connected to the Internet for some reason the data is stored on the travel drive and syncs back up to the cloud when the user is online again.\nGO: What is your and backer Vinod Khosla\u2019s vision for the future of computing that led to the founding and funding of MokaFive?\nWhaley: Your computer is living in the cloud and you can access it from anywhere \u2014 from a desktop, a laptop or a cell phone. That means your desktop can be maintained by someone else for you. From the IT administrator\u2019s point of view his job is easier and for you it\u2019s like a new machine in the cloud that keeps working and is constantly refreshed without the problems of spyware and virus attacks. I think this will be common in 3-4 years.\nStacey here: For those curious and willing to try the MokaFive concept, the company has a section of its site devoted to publicly shared virtual environments for testing. One that looks particularly interesting is its Fearless Browser download, which allows you to create an anonymous browsing environment on your PC.

Yet as underscored by Netflix\u2019s new four-part documentary series Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, which comes from the same director as Efron\u2019s forthcoming feature, there\u2019s no substitute for the real thing.\nHelmed by Joe Berlinger (Paradise Lost), the streaming service\u2019s latest binge-worthy non-fiction effort\u2014which goes live on January 24\u2014hinges on 100 hours of Bundy interviews conducted by journalist Stephen Michaud in 1980, shortly after Bundy landed on Florida\u2019s death row. Those previously-unheard conversations are the foundation upon which Berlinger builds a stirring recap of the infamous killer\u2019s upbringing, carnage and prosecution, which spanned numerous states, resulted in over 30 official deaths, involved two separate prison breaks, and ended with a trip to the electric chair on January 24, 1989. It\u2019s a look inside the mind of a true sociopath who carried out his slayings with maximum brutality and no remorse. He was, in a sense, the prototypical serial killer, redefining our darkest fears about man\u2019s capacity for cruelty\u2014even if, decades later, we\u2019ve never seen another fiend quite like him.\nThose hoping for seismic bombshells from Michaud\u2019s tapes will, it must be said, come away somewhat disappointed by Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes; Bundy refrained from confessing until three days before his state-sanctioned demise, when he copped to 30 killings\u2014a figure that, many agree, may actually be as high as 100. Nonetheless, there are fascinating insights to be gleaned from the reporter\u2019s conversations with the infamous psychopath (aided by Michaud\u2019s editor, Hugh Aynesworth), whose good looks and middle-class stature (he was an intelligent law student with political aspirations) helped mask the madman lurking within. Bundy remains the reason we have Hannibal Lecter-type fictional bogeymen, since no other serial killer has quite married homicidal rage (born in part from women-related adolescent hang-ups, such as the discovery that he was an illegitimate child) with boy-next-door charm and cunning intellect.\nIn the early going, Bundy and Michaud\u2019s sit-downs focus on the former\u2019s childhood and college years. Always careful to pivot every story to his own advantage, Bundy portrays that era as borderline idyllic, casting himself as an athlete, outdoorsman, and sociable wannabe class president with numerous friends. It\u2019s a telling first sign of his deviousness, given that in newly-recorded chats with people who knew him at the time, Berlinger makes clear that Bundy was anything but an affable average Joe; rather, he was a \u201chave not\u201d who \u201cjust didn\u2019t fit in,\u201d a phony who dispensed \u201c"}

Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who offered some of the language used in the new measure, called pretexters \"modern day pirates\" for whom \"the Internet is their seven seas and consumers' privacy is their booty.\" Rep. Cliff Stearns, a Florida Republican, called them \"cybercreeps.\"\nThose comments were aimed at online brokers engaging in \"pretexting\"--that is, the act of posing as legitimate customers--to obtain phone records and then sell them on the Web for an average of $100. Locatecell.com and Celltolls.com are two of the companies that have been accused of the practice.\nIn an odd twist, the 16-page measure, dated March 3, has not been introduced formally. It was unclear which politicians would be its official sponsors, though it includes input from Democratic and Republican committee leaders. Committee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, indicated he would soon submit the text and register the committee's stance.\nThe action came less than a week after House and Senate committees each endorsed proposals that would throw convicted phone record scammers behind bars. Congress in recent weeks has made no secret of its disgust over the activity.\nBecause the other committees' punishments vary in details, the multiple bills would likely be combined into one package before a floor vote. That's what happened in the case of the Can-Spam legislation, which took aim at senders of junk e-mail, a few years ago.\nA portion of the new bill focuses on the Federal Trade Commission, which has for decades enjoyed the power to stop \"deceptive\" business practices, and already has the authority to target phone pretexting.\nThe bill approved Wednesday would explicitly define a number of fraudulent actions as falling under the FTC's jurisdiction, including obtaining or attempting to obtain records, causing disclosure or attempting to cause disclosure of records, or directly selling or disclosing that data.\nAnother section gives instructions to the Federal Communications Commission, which already has the power to fine telecommunications companies that fail to protect the privacy of personal consumer records--and has exercised it amid the recent pretexting buzz.\nThe FCC would be tasked with devising new security regulations for wireline, wireless and voice over Internet Protocol phone companies. These would include rules such as mandatory encryption or other safeguards for personal data, prompt customer notification of breaches, and logs of requests for customer information. It also calls for tripling the fines the FCC could levy on those companies found to have flouted those new regulations, moving them from $100,000 to $300,000 per offense and imposing a maximum of $3 million for multiple violations.\nLike the bills approved by committees last week, this measure carves out an exemption for law enforcement officials, allowing them access to confidential phone records within the confines of \"applicable laws.\"\nThe committee also approved one amendment to the bill that would bar phone companies from disclosing the wireless phone number of any customer without their express consent. Rep. Joe Pitts, the Pennsylvania Republican who offered the amendment, said the proposal arose from concerns that companies are in the process of compiling a 411-equivalent for"}

Speak into a microphone, and your voice comes out of the robot\u2019s mouth.\nJapan loves robots, a fascination nurtured by decades of manga and anime. And if the Japanese government gets its way, that love could spark a revolution.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe calls robots a \u201cpillar\u201d of his efforts to revive Japan\u2019s stalled economy and deal with the country\u2019s shrinking, aging population. And he\u2019s not just talking about industrial robots like the ones that powered Japan\u2019s rise to auto-manufacturing dominance in the 1980s.\nJapanese researchers have created humanoid robots that can walk and run, and some with faces that mimic emotions with startling accuracy. Abe foresees robots helping out in nursing homes and hotels. Others, humanoid or not, could respond to disasters like the 2011 meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. It is a growth industry, he says, that Japan should lead.\n\u201cThe adoption of robots tailored to the individual needs of each workplace is without a doubt a major trump card that will drive our local economies,\u201d Abe said in September, at the first meeting of a Robot Revolution Realization Council, which he created to boost the industry.\nThe obsession with robots \u2014 particularly humanoid ones \u2014 almost seems quaint.

Here\u2019s a look at 10 things to look out for next year that might tell us something about how that campaign to come (which is really already underway) may shake out.\nThe stock market is up, unemployment is down and economists are giddy about prospects for America\u2019s economy to grow in 2015. But while economic indicators are glowing, how middle class voters benefit amid the recovery will shape the presidential campaign. So far, many have not: the typical American family\u2019s income is 8 percent lower than it was before the recession hit in 2007. That helps, in part, explain President Barack Obama\u2019s stagnant approval ratings, and could be a problem for Hillary Rodham Clinton or any other Democrat expected to defend his, and therefore the party\u2019s management, of the economy.\nHillary Rodham Clinton drew snickers this past summer when, while promoting a book for which she was handsomely paid, she said she and husband Bill Clinton were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House. She continues to give speeches that command fees of $200,000 or more, traveling to them by private jet. The Clintons appearance at the Harkin Steak Fry included a $50,000 tab for a private jet. With an income that places her among the top 1 percent of Americans, and close ties to Wall Street dating to her time as a senator from New York, how Clinton shapes her economic message will be watched by a party with a renewed focus on income inequality and economic anxieties for middle-class families.\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has, for months, told anyone able to ask that she \u201cis not running for president.\u201d That has not stopped hopeful liberals in the Democratic Party from talking up a Warren campaign. Activists have held \u201cRun Warren Run\u201d events in key states, including a Dec. 17 rally in Des Moines. Will it be enough for them if Warren were to declare that she \u201cwill not\u201d run for president?

All of the parents were invited to the school for an introductory presentation on the teachers\u2019 goals for learning in the upcoming year. Everything sounded wonderful. The 25 children in the classroom would be organized into small groups. Creating art would introduce them to science and math concepts. They would be exposed to different cultures by learning songs in different languages. Time would be allotted for daily storytelling followed by discussion. The teachers described an interdisciplinary, imaginative and stimulating year ahead, complete with field trips and physical, active play.\nWhile listening to the teachers\u2019 presentation at my twins\u2019 school, I had a moment of clarity: The kindergarten classroom is the design studio. All of the learning activities that take place inside the kindergarten classroom are freakishly similar to the everyday environment of my design studio in the \u201creal world.\u201d In an architectural design studio, we work as an interdisciplinary global team to solve the complex problems of the built environment in a variety of different cultural contexts. We do this most effectively through storytelling\u2013sharing personal experiences\u2013with the support of digital media and tools. A variety of activities\u2013reflective and collaborative, right-brain and left-brain\u2013happen simultaneously in an open environment. Like the design studio, the kindergarten environment places human interaction above all else.\nEven the kindergarten classroom\u2019s physical environment supports dynamic teaching and learning. It is zoned for multiple activities and agile enough for a variety of learning modes to happen simultaneously\u2013one group of children could be working on an art project while another group is discussing a story in a stepped carpeted area with soft seating. In a kindergarten classroom, while there are walls with white boards or smart boards, the \u201cfront\u201d of the room is indistinguishable. Every available wall and surface is an opportunity to display student work. The design allows students to explore many different ways of learning in the classroom\u2013it\u2019s learner-centered space.\nThe learner-centered paradigm should extend beyond the kindergarten classroom. Unfortunately, most educational institutions follow a model that creates an impersonal environment where adults, teaching, and authority are at the center. The studio-like environment of the kindergarten classroom succumbs to a rigid structure of disconnected subject-based classrooms and curricula. Naturally, the physical environment parallels this transition, moving from an open, multi-zone learning environment to a prototypical, teacher-centric mode of direct instruction. The collaborative student-teacher team and its dynamic atmosphere are replaced with the \u201csage-on-the-stage,\u201d front-teaching wall model.\nTake classrooms from elementary through high school. It\u2019s been near-universal since the 1800s to see self-contained classrooms that require teachers to instruct from front-teaching walls and students to sit in fixed chairs and desks in neat rows. Today\u2019s global demand for creativity and innovation cries out for a new model for the learning environment. Great alternatives to this outdated spatial arrangement are entirely possible.\nFor example, at the Henry Ford Academy: School for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan, self-contained classrooms are replaced with clustered learning spaces. The relationship of the spaces is designed to accommodate multiple modes of teaching and learning\u2014for instance, a pair of classrooms flow out to a shared collaborative environment modeled after the design studio.

A Republican House Majority Leader indicted for money laundering, and a senior Republican thrown in jail for accepting bribes. Washington's biggest lobbyist thrown in jail for trying to buy off lawmakers. This is what the Washington Establishment and the media want America to believe is the worst form of corruption: a few dirty political hacks who had the nerve to violate our supposedly pristine democracy.\nCertainly, these examples are egregious. But the intense focus on them by political leaders and the media to the exclusion of the real corruption destroying our democracy trivializes what corruption really is. That's not by accident -- it is a deliberate tactic of distraction, and shows just how bought off our political system really is.\nToday, the lifeblood of American politics is money. Candidates must raise enormous sums of private cash to run for office -- sums that the wealthy and corporate interests are only too happy to provide in exchange for legislative favors. We are told by politicians that this system is \"the greatest democracy in the world\" when, in fact, it is very clearly the same form of bribery that has marked every corrupt regime looked down on by history books.\nMoney, of course, does not just buy favors -- it makes sure that the concept of corruption is only presented to the public by political leaders as anecdotes about a few bad apples, not a narrative about a broken system. Why? Because an indictment of the pay-to-play system that produced the bad apples could mean structural campaign finance reforms that challenge the power of the Big Money interests that underwrite our politicians. Thus, in the aftermath of recent congressional scandals, all we get is a pathetical discussion about weak lobbying \"reform\" proposals and even weaker sanctions against individual lawmakers.\nSuch narrowing of our political discourse is the most nefarious form of corruption of all. It shows how we now live in a country where the very boundaries of public policy debates are designed to ensure outcomes that never challenge Big Money interests. The truly corrupt interests that own American politics long ago realized that they do not have to pervasively violate our weak anti-corruption laws to get what they want. All they have to do is shower cash on as many lawmakers as possible. These lawmakers, uninterested in biting the hand that feeds them, consequently make sure the overall debate is rigged.\nSo, for instance, as America faces an impending energy crisis, the political debate emanating from Washington has been largely limited to a discussion of which new tax breaks to give to which major oil companies -- all of whom have doled out millions in campaign contributions to politicians.\nAny serious discussion of a windfall profits tax on oil companies has been marginalized, even though polls show the public strongly supports the concept. Proposals to improve anti-trust enforcement as a way of slowing down oil industry consolidation -- that's not even talked about. And any consideration of a tough federal price gouging law has been met with propaganda claiming it is not needed. Just last week, the Federal Trade Commission -- headed by a former ChevronTexaco lawyer -- claimed there is no evidence of oil industry price gouging. This is occurring as Americans are paying more than $3-per-gallon for gas at the very same time ExxonMobil made more money than any corporation in history and gave its outgoing CEO a $400 million retirement bonus.\nThe same is true when it comes to health care. As health insurance premiums skyrocket and more Americans are forced to go with no insurance at all, poll"}

Messitte, who is based in Maryland, ruled last month that one of those lawsuits could go forward.\nIn a sally to prevent the case moving on to legal discovery \u2014 which would potentially unearth financial records such as Trump's income tax returns \u2014 Justice Department lawyers asked Messitte on Friday to put the case on hold while they appeal his decision to a higher court in Richmond, Virginia.\nThe plaintiffs, the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia, have said they plan to move forward quickly with discovery \u2014 for example, seeking information from the hotel, a Trump hotel steakhouse and the General Services Administration as well as the president's financial records.\nIn court documents, the Justice Department objected to any discovery on a sitting president in his official capacity because of separation of powers concerns, in order to avoid a \"constitutional confrontation\" between two branches of government.\nJustice lawyers argued that the \"public interest is decidedly in favor of a stay because any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President's performance of his constitutional duties.\"\nD.C. Attorney General Karl Racine responded: \"After winning two major rulings in this case already, we anticipated President Trump's most recent motion. Nonetheless, our case is still moving forward. We are on track to propose a schedule for discovery by September 14, and we hope to request relevant documents shortly thereafter.\"\nThe emoluments clause has never been fully tested in an American courtroom. Two other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause are also being heard in other federal courts. Neither has reached the discovery stage.\nMessitte's ruling last month that an emolument \"extends to any profit, gain or advantage\" was the first time a federal judge had defined the term's application to the president.\nIt is that definition, and the argument that the plaintiffs have suffered actual harm and have a right to sue, that the Justice Department wants reviewed by a higher court.\nThe plaintiffs have argued that Trump \u2014 who has declined to divest from his assets as president \u2014 is capitalizing on the presidency and causing harm to businesses trying to compete with his Washington hotel, which is just steps from the White House.\nThe Justice Department has said earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, don't qualify as emoluments. Its attorneys have argued that under Maryland and D.C.'s interpretation, no federal official would even be able to own stock from a foreign company that provides profits or collects royalties.\nThe case raises important questions and should provide \"clarity on the boundaries of what a president can do while in office,\" said Ted Boutrous, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP who's been keeping an eye on all the cases, but isn't involved.\n\"The discovery would be interesting too,\" he added with a laugh."}

Because it\u2019s always the union having to call and to say to the Shop Stewart to say to the principal can you have a briefing with the staff, can you call the health team, could we make sure that the suspected children are identified and given the Mantoux test.\n\"When you talk about the tuberculosis (TB) or scabies or any communicable diseases then everyone is not running around trying to figure out what to do. But (we should) have the protocol in place on how it is we will resolve it. Thus far I\u2019ve been in communication with the Shop Stewart and the assistant Shop Stewart at those schools.\"\nMrs Wilson said the teachers have been alerted and are moving forward, chest x-rays will be done.\n\"Based on the results of the X-rays, it will then be 14 days for the clearance as to whether they are positive.

I\u2019ve asked Dr Sands to identify a clinic and a specific time for our teachers to be able to go to get the treatment. And not (throw) them into the general population, so that is something we will discuss.\n\"We have expressed to our teachers to try as best as they can to be safe. Education and health must work along with the union so we can have protocols in place so we can deal with these matters going forth and almost seamlessly.\"\nHer comments came after, Health Minister Dr Duane Sands confirmed on Thursday that of almost 200 people screened for tuberculosis in two government schools, skin tests for 20 of them have come back from the lab positive.\nHowever, he said this is nothing to be alarmed about.\nDr Sands explained the positive skin tests simply mean that these 20 people spread out between Government High School (GHS) and A F Adderley Junior High School have at some point in their lifetime been exposed to tuberculosis.\nAs it stands, there remain two active cases of the highly contagious disease between the two schools.\nIn The Bahamas the rate of tuberculosis was 15 per 100,000 making it a low \u201cincidence\u201d country. While this is considered a low rate it still indicates that tuberculosis has not yet been eliminated in our nation, Dr Sands has said.\nOver the past five years, a total of 139 persons were lab confirmed for TB and 157 persons presented with clinical symptoms. All 296 were treated for tuberculosis.\nOf that number the data revealed that the majority of the patients were living in New Providence while a few were living in Eleuthera, Grand Bahama and Exuma.\nIt's presently in the Education Act ......

I'm still curious how this is going to play out, as a 3rd-party Twitter app would undoubtedly compete with Twitter's official apps on desktop and mobile, as well as unique views of their social network- but hey, both parties seem pretty psyched about it. We'll start with Twitter's, followed by that of Iain. See the official announcements here and here.\nIn early 2008, a London-based programmer named Iain Dodsworth began thinking about how to organize everything happening on Twitter. His answer was TweetDeck, a groundbreaking dashboard for monitoring what people are saying in real-time. Today, we're pleased to announce that the TweetDeck team has joined Twitter.This acquisition is an important step forward for us. TweetDeck provides brands, publishers, marketers and others with a powerful platform to track all the real-time conversations they care about. In order to support this important constituency, we will continue to invest in the TweetDeck that users know and love.TweetDeck is a great example of a third-party developer that designed tools for the incredibly important audience of Twitter power-users and, in turn, created value for the network as a whole. As Iain's journey suggests, there is significant opportunity for developers who deliver insights that foster a more engaged Twitter user base. For TweetDeck's perspective on today's news, check out their blog here.\nI am extremely happy and proud to let you know that TweetDeck has been acquired by Twitter. We completed the deal on Tuesday and are now in the process of \"joining the flock\". The past three years have been an epic journey, with many highs and lows, accompanied by the constant thrill of never really knowing what to expect next. We've grown from one team member and a single user, to a team of fifteen and a user-base of millions. The reason for this growth is simple - our unwavering focus on providing high-quality tools and services for the Twitter-centric power-user. This has always been our core audience - the most active, influential and valuable users of Twitter and social media in general. Quality over quantity. It is precisely for this reason that Twitter has acquired TweetDeck. The mainstream Twitter user-base is well catered for by twitter.com and the official mobile clients. And by becoming part of the official platform, TweetDeck will now fill that role for brands, influencers, the highly active and anyone that just needs \"more power\". Change may well be inevitable, but we remain the same team, staying in London, with the same focus and products, and now with the support and resources to allow us to grow and take on even bigger challenges.\nI'd like to finish with a big thank-you to all our investors for their support and guidance over the past few years, especially Betaworks, TAG, SV Angel and PROfounders. And of course a huge congratulations to the whole TweetDeck team - I'm extremely proud of you and this is a huge win for us all."}

And although our world certainly has been transformed by the Web\u2019s capabilities, its history includes some persistent myths and comically naive predictions.\nWe know who invented the Web and the Internet, and when.\nAsk Google who invented the Web and the Internet, and it will give you an answer. But the concept of \u201cinvention\u201d does not map well to the actual histories of these technologies, which arose from collaborations among large numbers of people and whose development features very few moments that were obvious transformations.\nThe history of the Web has one singular figure, Tim Berners-Lee, who wrote the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to format text-based documents, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send documents across the Internet, and a software program to view or browse pages. But Berners-Lee did not sit down one day and create the Internet. There were many precursors, including ideas and systems sketched by Paul Otlet, Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. And Berners-Lee began to play with hypertext programs in 1980, nearly 10 years before he and Robert Cailliau developed a proposal for an information-management system.\nOther milestones included the posting of the first Web site on Dec. 20, 1990; when Berners-Lee announced the Web project to a public mailing list on Aug. 6, 1991; and the declaration on April 30, 1993, that the Web\u2019s underlying code would be publicly and freely available. Myths about the Internet\u2019s militaristic origins and Al Gore\u2019s role have proved difficult to kill, despite some clear documentation of the facts by networking pioneers including Stephen Lukasik, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.\nThe Web is an American innovation.\nDiscussions about Internet governance often focus on international pressure to diminish U.S. control. The Defense Department spent hundreds of millions of dollars from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s developing the core technologies of the Internet. Through entities such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the Defense Communications Agency, defense investments played major roles in the creation of the digital infrastructure that we use to browse the Web. Congress and the White House \u2014 yes, including congressman and later vice president Al Gore \u2014 passed legislation and set policies to support the development of the commercial Internet and e-commerce. And of course many icons of the Web\u2019s history are American: Yahoo, AOL, Google and others.\nBut the Web\u2019s origins are distinctly European, and even the American contributions were infused with international collaboration. Berners-Lee, an Englishman, created some of the Web\u2019s key technologies while working as a software consultant alongside Cailliau, a Belgian engineer, at a Swiss lab. The American protagonists of Internet development at ARPA, Cerf and Kahn, worked closely with European researchers and built on the concepts of French computer scientist Louis Pouzin. And when Gore promoted the \u201cinformation superhighway,\u201d he did so within the context of an explicitly globalist vision, such as in a famous 1994 speech at the International Telecommunications Union.\nGovernment power is obsolete on the Internet.\nExperience suggests that Barlow\u2019s enthusiasm got the better of him. Over the past three decades, governments at all levels \u2014 local, state, national and international \u2014 have claimed and exercised jurisdiction over behavior"}

It's not an excuse, but I just got a little bit disinterested at the start of the season. I thought I might have to move on. I was not starting and even when I was on the bench, there were a number of times when I didn't get on.\nColchester manager Geraint Williams said it was his side's worst performance since winning promotion last season. 'The effort was there as it always has been but, for the first time, we weren't quite at the races and didn't perform,' he said.\n'We have to learn from it.

But It Won\u2019t Replace Lawyers, Yet.\nImpressive advances in artificial intelligence technology tailored for legal work have led some lawyers to worry that their profession may be Silicon Valley\u2019s next victim.\nBut recent research and even the people working on the software meant to automate legal work say the adoption of A.I. in law firms will be a slow, task-by-task process. In other words, like it or not, a robot is not about to replace your lawyer. At least, not anytime soon.\nAn artificial intelligence technique called natural language processing has proved useful in scanning and predicting what documents will be relevant to a case, for example. Yet other lawyers\u2019 tasks, like advising clients, writing legal briefs, negotiating and appearing in court, seem beyond the reach of computerization, for a while.\nDana Remus, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and Mr. Levy studied the automation threat to the work of lawyers at large law firms. Their paper concluded that putting all new legal technology in place immediately would result in an estimated 13 percent decline in lawyers\u2019 hours.\nA more realistic adoption rate would cut hours worked by lawyers by 2.5 percent annually over five years, the paper said. The research also suggests that basic document review has already been outsourced or automated at large law firms, with only 4 percent of lawyers\u2019 time now spent on that task.\nTheir gradualist conclusion is echoed in broader research on jobs and technology. In January, the McKinsey Global Institute found that while nearly half of all tasks could be automated with current technology, only 5 percent of jobs could be entirely automated. Applying its definition of current technology \u2014 widely available or at least being tested in a lab \u2014 McKinsey estimates that 23 percent of a lawyer\u2019s job can be automated.\nTechnology will unbundle aspects of legal work over the next decade or two rather than the next year or two, legal experts say. Highly paid lawyers will spend their time on work on the upper rungs of the legal task ladder. Other legal services will be performed by nonlawyers \u2014 the legal equivalent of nurse practitioners \u2014 or by technology.\nCorporate clients often are no longer willing to pay high hourly rates to law firms for junior lawyers to do routine work. Those tasks are already being automated and outsourced, both by the firms themselves and by outside suppliers like Axiom, Thomson Reuters, Elevate and the Big Four accounting firms.\nSo the law firm partner of the future will be the leader of a team, \u201cand more than one of the players will be a machine,\u201d said Michael Mills, a lawyer and chief strategy officer of a legal technology start-up called Neota Logic.\nThe pace of technology improvement is notoriously unpredictable. For years, labor economists said routine work like a factory job could be reduced to a set of rules that could be computerized. They assumed that professionals, like lawyers, were safe because their work was wrapped in language.\nBut advances in artificial intelligence overturned that assumption. Technology unlocked the routine task of sifting through documents, looking for relevant passages.\nSo major law firms, sensing the long-term risk, are undertaking initiatives to understand the emerging technology and adapt and exploit it.\nDentons, a global law firm with more than 7,000 lawyers, established an innovation and venture arm, Nextlaw Labs, in 2015.

Jerry Brown and fellow Democrats are championing to contain government worker pensions in California could leave state taxpayers awash in debt to public employees.\nThe governor's plan, announced Tuesday, is unlikely to save cities on the brink of bankruptcy. The relief his proposal would provide to the strained state budget is modest.\nAnalysts who study the issue say far more aggressive action \u2014 including reduction of benefits for hundreds of thousands of current employees left untouched by Brown's proposal \u2014 will be needed to get runaway retirement costs under control.\nTaxpayers still face the prospect of major bailouts to cover retirement promises made to public employees whether lawmakers pass the plan as expected Friday or not.\nPension officials predict that Brown's plan, which has yet to be thoroughly vetted by actuaries, would save state and local governments $40 billion to $60 billion over the next three decades \u2014 much more than the governor projected. But the shortfall faced by the big state pension funds is much larger than that.\nOfficials at California's retirement systems, which are counting on investment returns that many experts say are wildly optimistic, acknowledge that workers have been guaranteed about $164 billion more in retirement payouts than there will be cash available to pay.\nSome of the country's most respected investment gurus, including Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffet and Vanguard founder John Bogle, say the burden on taxpayers will be much larger.\nTheir forecasts would leave Californians saddled with at least a $270-billion gap, and the Wall Street credit rating agency Moody's suggests the gap could be at least $100 billion more than that.\nPut another way, every California household may be on the hook for roughly $23,000 for public retirements over the coming decades. Brown's plan might whittle that tab to $18,000.\n\"It doesn't solve the problem,\" said Joe Nation, a former Democratic assemblyman and professor of the practice of public policy at Stanford University. \"We still have many, many miles to go.\"\nBrown had pushed for more. His initial proposal would have housed a sizable chunk of retirement money for new hires in 401(k)-style funds, shifting considerable financial risk away from taxpayers to employees. He also had taken aim at tens of billions of dollars in lifetime healthcare expenses awarded to hundreds of thousands of state and local government workers.\nBrown's negotiations with lawmakers resulted in a more modest plan focused on raising the public retirement age, limiting the annual sums collected by retirees whose jobs paid them six-figure salaries and tinkering with the formulas on which pensions are based.\nThe leaders' decision not to take any benefits away from workers already on the payroll, however, limited their ability to confront the soaring debt.\n\"You can't address these problems unless you address the existing liability,\" said David Crane, who advised former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on pension issues.\n\"The only way to do that is to go after benefits for existing employees.\"\nAn exhaustive study last year by the Little Hoover Commission, an independent oversight agency that reports to the Legislature, warned that pension debt will continue to overwhelm government budgets if benefits for existing workers are not scaled back.\nMaking changes that affect only new employees, the commission's report said, \"will not deliver savings for a generation, while pension costs are swelling now as baby boomers retire....

{"idx": "30102", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Why won\u2019t my documents rotate properly? This is a common occurrence for frustrated smartphone users. A new technique has been devised to correct a smartphone's orientation to overcome this annoyance.\nThe new technique, from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, tracks the rotation sensor in a smartphone to improve document rotation. This deals with a problem that arises when users take document photographs using smartphones. Here the images become parallel to the documents on a flat surface, sometimes causing problems when they are rotated.\nIf you try to take photographs of something like a poster or a brochure and then view the images, it can sometimes occur that the images documents have the wrong orientation (such as rotating 90 degrees). If you try and compensate by rotating your smartphone 90 degrees in the opposition direction, the document photos can sometimes also rotate at the same time, leading to the image always being the wrong-way-round for the user. It is such orientation errors that the South Korean researchers have been looking into.\nHeading up the research is Professor Uichin Lee, and he has found the key reasons for these orientation errors. The error is due to a common software glitch in screen rotation-tracking algorithms found with most commercial smartphones. The recent research found, for example, landscape document photos have an error rate of 93 percent across common smartphones.\nProfessor Lee explains: \"When taking a photo of a document, your smartphone generally becomes parallel to the flat surface\u2026Your phone fails to track the orientation if you make any rotation changes at that moment.\"\nThis happens due to software engineers designing the rotation tracking software in smartphones with an important assumption: that people will hold their phones vertically either in portrait or landscape orientations.\nThis can be overcome, however, by achieving orientation tracking through the measurement of the gravity direction using an acceleration sensor in the phone (for example, whether gravity falls into the portrait or landscape direction). To test this out, Professor Lee ran some studies. These were based on a technique which will correct a phone's orientation. This is by tracking the rotation sensor in a phone. For this to work it had to overcome a common aspect of photo taking using a smartphone since most people tilt the phone towards themselves (this is called a \"micro-tilt phenomenon\"). So it was important that smartphone software compensated for patterns of gravity distributions across the device.\nBy using new algorithms the researchers managed to accurately track smartphone orientation in document-capturing tasks at over 95 percent accuracy. This proved workable on both Google Android and Apple iPhones. It is hoped the new algorithm becomes commercialized."}

It sounds to me like a recipe for disaster.\nThe pitch, as far as I know, is that people sign up to be paid to push products and services to others, in effect becoming agents for a marketer. Umm, excuse me, but I thought the industry was moving toward more transparency and not less.\nAccording to guidelines established by the Word Of Mouth Marketing Association, agents are supposed to disclose their relationship with the companies whose products they push. Can someone explain that one to me? I understand the importance of disclosure, but doesn't this represent a huge catch-22?\n1) Acme hammers are probably pieces of crap, because Acme has to pay Gus off to get him to believe that they're any good.\n2) With all the other things Acme could do to market its products, it decides to pay people off? Doesn't sound like a company I want to do business with.\nOn the other hand, if Gus chooses not to disclose his relationship with Acme and tells me they're the best hammers in the industry, I might buy an Acme hammer. (Hey, Gus knows his tools.) But I've just entered into a relationship on false pretenses. If one day I find out that Gus was less than honest with me about Acme, I might despise Acme for it. If I swing the hammer and the handle breaks, I'm probably going to go back to Gus and say something along the lines of \"Whadja tell me to buy that hammer for? It was a piece of garbage!\"\nIn either case, buzz marketing gets Acme into a situation where there's a huge potential for brand backlash and for Acme to be blacklisted by people. If agents disclose their relationship, the marketer looks bad. If they don't disclose, it's a major ethical slip and the marketer has the potential to look really bad. So where's the appeal?\nIf, on the other hand, the marketer invests what it might put into a buzz marketing campaign into an online program, where paid employees of the company could monitor and participate in online conversations with potential customers, wouldn't that result in better relationships?\nIf there's something to this buzz marketing concept that I'm missing, I'd love for you to come to the Spin Board and tell us all about it.

However, please be cognizant that powerful special-interest groups are perfectly content with the status quo.

However, on Saturday afternoon (April 19), multiple sources sent MTV News a new song by the Tennessee MC.\nAs predicted by 50 Cent, Buck responded to the Unit's MTV interview in song, but it's not the loaded dis anthem Fif was expecting. Buck's new record is called \"My Interview,\" and he speaks frankly in the song about some of the recent issues.\n\"Damn right I'm sipping syrup, flipping birds to get what I deserve,\" Buck raps in the opening verse. \"And I hear the same things that you heard/ That '50 kicked him out' or 'Buck sniffs coke and he flips out'/ It's too late, the whole world know what I be about/ Sh--, I do make mistakes like any other man/ Sh--, I recoup off an album, quicker than you can ... Am I loyal? Dr. Dre can answer that for ya.\"\nThe second verse \u2014 although Buck doesn't mention 50's or his own name \u2014 could be interpreted as a reference to his and Fif's once-close relationship and its deterioration. Buck makes Biblical references to Cain and Abel in the lyrics.\nOn the chorus, an unknown performer sings, \"It ain't nothing I ain't been through/ Seen the evil sh-- that men do.\"\nBuck comes in, declaring, \"This ain't nothing to me.\"\nThe singer rejoins the chorus, crooning, \"Muthaf---- we ain't been cool.\"\nAs the record closes out, Buck ends with a sermon-like rhyme, admitting, \"I had my hand and nose in the 'D.' \"\nAlthough it is still unclear where the song will officially appear, producer J.A. recently told MTV News that he and Buck are working on a mixtape called Honorable Discharge: Cashville Chronicles that should be out in the coming weeks. Buck also has a DVD called \"A Billion Buck$\" slated for release June 10.\nAlthough he is no longer a member of the group, Buck is still signed to G-Unit Records. According to 50, Buck will also appear on the Unit's Terminate on Sight LP when it is released June 24."}

Now she's warning customers it could take two weeks to find an available truck and driver.\nShipping costs have skyrocketed in the United States in 2018, one of the clearest signs yet of a strong economy that might be starting to overheat. Higher transportation costs are beginning to cause prices of anything that spends time on a truck to rise. Amazon, for example, just implemented a 20 percent hike for its Prime program that delivers goods to customers in two days, and General Mills, the maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker, said prices of some of its cereals and snacks are going up because of an \"unprecedented\" rise in freight costs. Tyson Foods, a large meat seller, and John Deere, a farm and construction equipment, also recently announced they will increase prices, blaming higher shipping costs.\nThe trucking industry shows an extraordinary labor shortage in one corner of the economy can spill out and affect the economy more broadly.\n\"I've never seen it like this, ever,\" said Brenny, who has been in the trucking industry for 30 years. \"It doesn't matter what the load even pays. There are just not drivers.\"\nTrucking executives say their industry is experiencing a perfect storm: The economic upswing is creating heavy demand for trucks, but it's hard to find drivers with unemployment so low. Young Americans are ignoring the job openings because they fear self-driving trucks will soon dominate the industry. Waymo, the driverless car company owned by Alphabet, just launched a self-driving truck pilot program in Atlanta, although trucking industry veterans argue it will be a long time before drivers go away entirely.\nBrenny anticipates she will have to raise pay another 10 percent before the end of the year to ensure that other companies don't steal her drivers.\n\"The drivers deserve the wages. They really do, but the raises are coming so fast that it's hard to handle,\" said Brenny, who is having to adjust contracts for drivers \u2014 and customers \u2014 rapidly.\nThe United States has had a truck driver shortage for years, but experts say it's hitting a crisis level this year. There's even more demand for truckers now as just about every sector of the economy is expanding and online sales continue to soar. On top of that, the federal government imposed a new rule in December that requires drivers to be on the road for no more than 11 hours at a time and track their time by an electronic device so they can't cheat.\n\"It's as bad as it's ever been\" to find drivers, said Bob Costello, chief economist at the American Trucking Associations. \"Companies are doing everything they can to make drivers happy: increasing pay and getting them home more often, but that means they aren't driving as many miles.\"\nAmerica had a shortage of 51,000 truck drivers at the end of last year, Costello found, up from a shortage of 36,000 in 2016.

Red Ants Pants is based out of White Sulphur Springs, Montana where the storefront, distribution center, and international headquarters all reside in an historic saddle shop. Known for their grass roots marketing efforts, including \u2018Tour de Pants,\u2019 the direct sales business model is proving effective.\nTo show support for the hard-working side of Montana and beyond, the Red Ants Pants Foundation was born in 2011.

That same year the Foundation launched its first program \u2013 the Red Ants Pants Music Festival. In 2011 over 6,000 fans came to celebrate rural Montana in a cow pasture. Over the years, attendees have enjoyed headliners including Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Wynonna Judd, and Keb\u2019 Mo.\nThe festival continues its success into its seventh year on July 26-29, 2018 aiming to improve upon the authentic, rich community culture the 16,500 attendees enjoyed during the record-setting 2017 festival.\nCalhoun\u2019s grit has brought her enterprises national recognition over the years \u2013 earlier this spring, the festival received the prestigious 2018 Event of the Year award from the Montana Office of Tourism and Business Development.

The research division worked closely with sexual assault centres in the three provinces to develop the 76-item questionnaire and recruit participants.\nMore than one-third of those who experienced adult sexual assault reported it to the police or had another person do so.\nThe most common reasons for not reporting were shame and embarrassment, fear of the offender and lack of confidence in the justice system.\n\u201cWhile 53 per cent of participants stated that they were not confident in the police, two-thirds stated that they were not confident in the court process and in the criminal justice system in general,\u201d the study says.\nParticipants cited ongoing, long-term effects of being attacked, including depression, difficulties with trust and forming relationships, and anxiety, fear and stress.\n\u201cThe trauma is \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s absolutely unbearable,\u201d one victim told the researchers.\nThe women described a number of means of coping with effects of the trauma, both positive (such as reading, exercising, writing in a journal) and negative (drug and alcohol abuse, self-harm, suicide attempts).\nThe women suggested that survivors of sexual violence become informed about the criminal justice system, and know that help is available for victims and that legal proceedings can take a long time. The best way of sharing this information is through school programs and counsellors, they said.\nThree broad themes emerged on making improvements \u2014 helping survivors feel safe and comfortable, providing them with information on sexual violence and justice procedures, and adjusting the overall system to ensure things like more timely processing of cases and a better balancing of how victim and suspect are treated.\nThe Conservatives have introduced legislation to create a federal bill of rights for victims aimed at providing them with more information and protection as well as greater opportunities to participate in trials and sentencing.\nHowever, some victims rights advocates have said the legislation falls short because it wouldn\u2019t allow people to head to court if they felt their rights were not respected."}

They just cannot seem to catch a break.\nAfter six straight quarters of year-over-year sales declines at its marquee hepatitis C (HCV) treatment business, Gilead stock has been left for dead -- its share price basically flat over the past 12 months despite the rest of the S&P 500 surging ahead 19%. Even a pop at the end of August -- inspired by the company opening its wallet to buy fast-growing cell therapy biotech Kite Pharma -- proved short-lived, and Gilead stock today trades right back where it did before announcing its big acquisition.\nAnd yet, hope springs eternal for investors who believe that Gilead may be that rarest of birds: a bargain in the biotech sector. This morning, StreetInsider.com (requires subscription) reported that biotech specialist Maxim Group is upgrading Gilead stock to buy. Assigning the $74 stock a $94 price target, Maxim argues that in \"buying GILD now you [get] recently acquired KITE for free.\"\nEven with profits declining (Gilead has earned only $8.5 billion so far this year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), Katsenelson estimated that this division alone justified a share price of $100 for Gilead, and \"HIV and other drugs\" were on track to sell enough to add another $45 or $50 in share value.\nHence, at a stock price of $90, Gilead&apos;s HCV business was selling at a discount -- and its HIV business was \"free.\"\nTen months later, Gilead&apos;s stock price had fallen into the $70s. The HIV business was doing even better than expected, prompting Katsenelson to switch lenses and argue that $70 a share was a fair price to pay for Gilead&apos;s \"HIV and other drugs\" -- and it was the HCV business that was on sale.\nCiting $4.50 per share in earnings from the non-HCV side of the business, \"8-10%\" revenue growth ... with very high recurrence of revenue\" and \"substantial operational leverage\" on that revenue, Katsenelson concluded that Gilead&apos;s HIV business was now worth closer to \"$67 to $76\" per share.\nAt a $70-ish stock price, that meant the HIV business was now fairly priced, and the monster cash producer that is HCV treatment had become a BOGO.\nAccording to Katsenelson, regardless of which part of Gilead you buy, you get another part \"free.\" Now comes Maxim Group to add a third option -- buying both parts of the original Gilead Sciences, and getting its new Kite division for free. The argument has merit.\nAfter all, Gilead stock was selling for about $70 up until just a few months ago, when Gilead announced its acquisition of fast-growing Kite Pharmaceuticals at the end of August. That deal immediately added $10 a share to Gilead&apos;s stock price, rocketing the stock up 13% through the first week of September.

Seventy percent of Oklahoma voters supported the ballot initiative\u2013known as the \u201cSave Our State\u201d amendment\u2013last November, not because sharia often comes up in the Oklahoma court system, but as a preemptive measure against a shadowy, frightening future.\nNot long after Election Day, a U.S. District Court judge ordered Oklahoma to refrain from certifying the referendum results. Her reasoning was that the ban was likely to be found unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds because it dealt with only one religion\u2019s legal code. And based on the tenor of this week\u2019s questioning by the Appeals Court, she was probably right.\nAnti-abortion activists have run into similar problems with their efforts to enact a variety of abortion restrictions at the state level. Two weeks ago, a U.S. district court judge issued an injunction against parts of a new Texas law that would require women seeking abortions not only to have sonograms, but to listen to detailed descriptions of their fetuses and hear the heartbeat, if audible, as well. As the state\u2019s appeal now moves to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, opponents of the law feel confident that it will be found to have violated the First Amendment by forcing doctors to engage in government-mandated speech.\nOn their face, these rulings might seem like major defeats for conservatives. All told, five states so far this year have passed laws blocking funding for Planned Parenthood clinics, and nearly two dozen states have introduced or passed laws to ban the use of sharia in court cases. These laws are being knocked down in court almost as quickly as they\u2019re entered into the rule books. (Federal judges have also blocked laws banning funding to Planned Parenthood in Indiana and North Carolina.) Are conservatives engaged in a senseless effort with these legislative initiatives?\nThe beauty of the strategy is that it plays directly into a narrative conservative Christians have been weaving for over a generation. After all, the political reawakening of many Christian fundamentalists took place in the 1970s after a series of court decisions took Bible reading and prayer out of public schools. (They were also eventually\u2013but not immediately\u2013mobilized by the Roe v. Wade case.) For conservative Christians who had withdrawn from public engagement to focus on spiritual concerns, these judicial actions made them realize that whether they were politically involved or not, the government could impact their lives and shape society around them.\nFor the past few decades, then, many conservative Christians have viewed themselves as soldiers in a fight against government representatives who want to impose secular values on them. Remember the Justice Sunday events of a few years ago, when Christian Right organizations railed against \u201cactivist judges\u201d who sanctioned gay marriage? These Christians don\u2019t have to view judges as Satan\u2019s agents to see them as enemies.\nSo, legal roadblocks to measures banning sharia or ending Planned Parenthood fit the narrative: Good Christian folk try to turn their values into law, only to be stymied time and again by secular judges and bureaucrats"}

It already was a long road to last Saturday\u2019s ribbon-cutting, and the path\u2019s future is paved with question marks.\nHow and when will the crucial eastern alignment of the trail, connecting to the Coyote Creek Trail at Kelley Park, be completed? And how will the drama surrounding the railroad trestle over Los Gatos Creek finally end? The 91-year-old wooden structure \u2014 the key piece that prevents Three Creeks from linking up with the Los Gatos Creek Trail \u2014 is still on the state register of historic places. A judge has upheld the city\u2019s right to demolish it, but a permit needed for demolition has expired.\nBut even getting the Three Creeks Trail to this point is an accomplishment worth celebrating. The effort took nearly a decade, funding from several sources and the cooperation of a number of public agencies. And its completion marked an important milestone in San Jose\u2019s quest to create a 100-mile trail network.\nThe Three Creeks Trail \u2014 the name refers to Coyote Creek, Los Gatos creek and the Guadalupe River \u2014 actually had its start in a house on Riverside Drive in Willow Glen. That\u2019s where Taisia and Ross McMahon moved into the neighborhood nine years ago. They had expected to have a trail and open space in the spot behind their house where Union Pacific had ripped up the tracks of an abandoned spur line just a few years earlier. But after she received a letter indicating houses would be built there instead, she was off and running.\nA flurry of phone calls and neighborhood meetings followed, eventually leading to the formation of Save Our Trails, a grassroots nonprofit that advocates for the creation of more trails for pedestrians and cyclists through San Jose\u2019s car-centric neighborhoods. With grants from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority and the County of Santa Clara, San Jose purchased the right-of-way from Union Pacific for $6 million, and construction on the trail began in earnest last year.\nWhen she started this effort, Taisia McMahon said Saturday, she dreamed that she would one day share the trail with her two children. \u201cNine years later, we will walk the western alignment of the Three Creeks Trail together,\u201d said McMahon, who has since passed on leadership of Save Our Trails to current president Bill Rankin.\nThe two-lane paved path includes benches and wayfinding signs at key intersections, as well as markers that provide a nod to the area\u2019s history including the railroads and canneries. An iris garden blooms in an area near Iris Garden Court, a cul-de-sac named for the gardens once planted there by sisters Clare and Ruth Rees in the 1930s. The one major break is at the intersection of Willow Street and Bird Avenue, with the trail\u2019s northern entrance marked by a water tower sculpture emblazoned with the number \u201c3,\u201d one of several appearances the number makes on the path.\nMcMahon called the trail \u201ca hope for the future\u201d but she knows that future will require an even greater effort."}

The Fan's new morning show drew an average share of 3.3 per cent of listeners between ages 25 to 54 in April. That was a sizeable jump from 2.3 per cent in March.\nDean Blundell fared much better in his second month on the air for Toronto sports radio station Sportsnet 590 The Fan, while his chief rival's ratings faded.\nBlundell & Co., which replaced Brady and Walker, with hosts Greg Brady and Andrew Walker, as The Fan's morning show on March 2, drew an average share of 3.3 per cent of listeners between ages 25 to 54 in April. That was a sizeable jump from 2.3 per cent in March.\nAt the same time, TSN Toronto 1050's morning show, Mike Richards in the Morning, slid from an average share of 1.3 in March to 0.7 in April.\nWhile it is only one month, the trend is encouraging for Fan owner Rogers Media, as Blundell's 3.3 April share also stopped a steady morning-ratings slide that started a year earlier with Brady and Walker.\nBumping Brady and Walker to the 1-4 p.m. weekday slot initially created controversy because their ratings were considered stable, while Blundell's mix of vulgar and sometimes misogynistic and homophobic humour in his previous job (on Toronto FM station 102.1 The Edge) kept him in hot water with Canada's broadcast authorities.\nRogers never fully explained the reasons for the switch to Blundell, but the ratings now tell the story. A broadcast-industry source provided radio ratings from Numeris that showed Brady and Walker's decline started in April, 2014, and they were never able to arrest the slide. That April, Brady and Walker had a 4.8 share of adults 25 to 54 in the morning slot; by February, 2015, that share was down to 2.4.\nWhen Blundell's 25-to-54 audience share dipped to 2.3 in his first month, there was much chortling from critics, especially when Richards simultaneously increased his share from 1.1 in February to 1.3 in March.\nBlundell also increased his share of what is considered The Fan's target audience, males ages 18 to 49. In March, Blundell had a 3.5 share with that group and raised it to 4.9 in April. This appears to have been done at the expense of Richards. His share of the men 18 to 49 went from 2.4 in March to 1.1 in April.\nOne explanation for Blundell's improvement is the Toronto Blue Jays. Their season started in early April and The Fan is their long-time radio broadcaster. The theory is that listeners who go to sleep with the Jays' game on their clock radios tend to wake up to the same station's morning show.\nThe Jays games are The Fan's highest-rated broadcasts, although Numeris does not separate them from the station's other evening programs. The Numeris ratings for that slot in April gave the Jays a 4.9 share of adults 25 to 54, higher than for any other show on The Fan.\nRunning second to the Jays games was The Fan's enduring drive-time"}

Formerly complimentary add-ons are still there, but now you have to pay a fee to get them. Then the cycle kicks in: Customers end up squeezed, lawmakers become outraged, new regulations are passed to limit business practices \u2014 and companies start looking for new ways to boost their top line.\nConsider the recent surge in line-item gotchas: printed-check charges, hotel resort fees, and extra costs for transactions made anywhere but a company\u2019s Web site. (For more, see our related story, \u201c29 Fees We Hate.\u201d) The rationale behind them is pretty straightforward \u2014 businesses need to make money, and consumers have no stomach for higher prices. But in signing up for what are advertised as cheap new offerings, unsuspecting shoppers end up paying just as much if not more than they would have before getting those \u201cgreat\u201d deals.\nAmerican Express is one company whose customers will be paying more this fall. \u201cLike all companies large and small, our pricing has to be responsive to the business and economic environment, and as a result we\u2019ve had to make some changes to our product,\u201d says Molly Faust, spokeswoman for American Express, which recently raised rates on some of its credit cards. \u201cBut we have always notified card members,\u201d she adds.\nOf course they have: By federal law, credit card companies must disclose any changes they are making. But customers often ignore those small-print disclosures.\n\u201cSophisticated people can avoid many charges and fees,\u201d says Xavier Gabaix, an associate professor of finance at New York University who co-authored an article on hidden fees that appeared back in the 2006 Quarterly Journal of Economics.\nThat article, written with Harvard economics professor David Laibson, found that businesses bank on a group of less-than-savvy consumers whom Laibson and Gabaix call \u201cmyopes.\u201d These are the people who raid the hotel minibar rather than run down to the deli next door, or habitually pay their credit cards late. Admittedly, some may be happy to pay extra for the minibar convenience \u2014 but for most, it\u2019s an unsophisticated behavior pattern that often leads to financial pain.\nFor Edgar Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general for consumer protection in Massachusetts, the issue boils down to disclosure. If he had his way, Congress would enact a law requiring sellers to disclose the complete price; he cites an Australian measure that requires companies to label items with the full price, including taxes and surcharges.\nThere is a movement afoot to challenge the hidden fee practice. In August, T-Mobile sent a note to its customers saying that it would charge them $1.50 a month if they continued to get paper bills. Customers revolted, and the company decided to roll back the plan. And after a flurry of media attention, a few of the large banks (led by Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase) have announced plans to lower or eliminate their overdraft fees and give customers the chance to opt out of overdraft protection."}

The ones that create, one of my favorite words, a three-letter word: fun. The businesses that create fun.\nWho doesn't want more fun in our lives? Whether you're for-profit or not-for-profit, when are you looking at stock or you're an entrepreneur, I think having more fun, creating fun, putting fun in your product or service, surprising people -- lots of people like pleasant surprises, that equals fun for me. The companies that really are about fun, it's really hard not to win if you do that well over long periods of time.\nTwo quick examples that come to mind, these are completely different businesses, but how could I not lead off with Disney, which I think has a better sense of fun and has created more fun for more people living today than any other company, possibly by far? This is a great example of the businesses that win.\nBut then, a completely different company, much much smaller and really just a restaurant company at heart, Texas Roadhouse, for those who know, a recent pick of mine in the last year in Motley Fool Stock Advisor. This is just a steakhouse for the most part. But two things I want you to know about it. First of all, there will be spontaneous line dancing that occurs when you're there on a given night, led by the servers. For me, that's something you wouldn't expect normally. You could have gone to any steakhouse chain, but that's just kind of happening there.\nThe second thing about Texas Roadhouse, and one of the other reasons I like the stock, harking back to an earlier point made in this podcast, they treat their employees really well. For the most part, there's a strong esprit de corps among the staffs at individual Texas Roadhouse restaurants. So, it's just a steakhouse in one way, but it's actually the fun one. And that's my point.\nSo there we have five traits of the businesses that win."}

{"idx": "30148", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There are few current movie projects that have served a more troubled term in development hell than Relativity Media's planned reboot of The Crow. James O'Barr, the creator of the comic book upon which the 1994 original was based, has said that approximately $20 million has already been spent trying to get the new adaptation off the ground, but despite plans to begin filming this fall The Crow still doesn't have a lead actor attached.\nRelativity has bigger problems right now, however. The company is currently filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to owing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and this week confirmed that 75 people - a fifth of Relativity's total staff - have been laid off. The studio's financial woes have obviously had an impact on its current projects, and the latest reports indicate that The Crow has been hit hard.\nAccording to THR, inside sources are claiming that pre-production on The Crow in the UK has stalled and an entire production team has left the project, along with several department heads. Sources also said that Relativity is currently preparing an official statement on the status of The Crow, though one insider said that Relativity \"continue[s] to be excited\" by the property.\nDirector Corin Hardy (The Hallow) is currently attached to The Crow, which was supposed to begin filming at Pinewood Studios' new site in Cardiff this year. Actors who have been sought or attached to play the lead role include Mark Wahlberg, Bradley Cooper, Tom Hiddleston, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Luke Evans and Jack Huston. Huston dropped out of the project in mid-June, at which point Hardy said, \"We look forward to unveiling our new lead and starting to film over the next several weeks.\"\nJack Huston (The Longest Ride) dropped out of 'The Crow' earlier this summer.\nHuston has since said that a scheduling conflict was the reason behind his decision to drop out of The Crow, but the scheduling conflict likely came into play due to the film's seemingly endless production delays. If The Crow had begun filming this spring, as was planned, then the scheduling clash might have been avoided. Evans, who officially exited The Crow at the start of 2015, explicitly said that he just couldn't keep waiting around for Relativity to get the cameras rolling.\nThe Crow's production delays make more sense in light of Relativity's current financial troubles, which probably aren't going to make it any easier to attract cast and production team members. In theory The Crow is still set to start filming this fall, but don't be surprised if the new year rolls around and Relativity still hasn't nothing to show for it.\nWe'll keep you updated on The Crow as development continues."}

{"idx": "30154", "prompt": "Continue the following text: I\u2019ve written many times about how Americans of all ages have been set up for a fake intergenerational battle over supposedly scarce health care resources. The purpose of this phony competition is to distract us from the fact that the resources wouldn\u2019t be so scarce to begin with if we would only reduce the profits of the insurance and drug industries.\nIt\u2019s an old bait and switch tactic, and the mainstream media have fallen for it hook, line, and sinker. So instead of talking about greedy drug companies that gouge people for drugs they need to survive, or greedy insurance companies that let people die to keep up their share prices, we\u2019re all talking about the greedy old farts on Medicare who don\u2019t want their services cut to pay for younger people\u2019s insurance.\nIts 40 million members are split about evenly between those who have access to Medicare, the federal government\u2019s health program for the elderly, and those who are too young to be eligible for such benefits. The younger members, or those between the ages of 50 and 64, sometimes face terrible choices in the private insurance market, with age and declining health status making premiums high and benefits poor. But members 65 and older get among the most secure medical benefits in the country, and many are in no mood to share.\nSo this is what it\u2019s come to in the American health care system: Sickly 60-year-olds just trying to hold out until they can get their Medicare cards. Cranky old folks hoarding their Medicare benefits against the encroaching middle-aged mob. People eyeing each other suspiciously across the 65-year age divide, fearing and resenting one another.\nDo you think people of different generations look at each other this way in Paris? Or in London, or Dusseldorf, or Adelaide, or Kyoto, or Ottawa? Of course they don\u2019t. That\u2019s because in those countries, everyone has Medicare. In most of them, everyone has Medicare that\u2019s better than our Medicare. They all carry around the same little card in their wallets\u2014the one that shows their membership in their country\u2019s national health service. And you know what they have to do to get that card? They have to be born. That\u2019s it. No age restrictions. No waiting periods. No physicals or tests or worries about pre-existing conditions. And no premiums to pay.\nI am more than sympathetic toward the plight of people in their 50s and early 60s. I know my own body started to give me trouble at about 55, and I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I hadn\u2019t had a job with health insurance. I\u2019ve recently written about how the Baucus plan screws people in that age group by permitting insurance companies to discriminate against them. But the solution to these problems isn\u2019t cutting Medicare benefits for people over 65\u2013it\u2019s giving Medicare benefits to people under 65. If everyone loves Medicare, and everybody\u2019s just waiting and hoping and biding their time until they can sign up, why not let them do it now?\nSome proponents of an incremental approach have actually suggested just this\u2014opening up Medicare to ages 50 through 65, with some financial contribution from enrollees. And many single-payer advocates, myself included, have simply called for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Since single-payer health care systems deliver better care for 20 to 40 percent less money, there would be no need to cut services to any generation.\nSo as a"}

But the lower prices were achieved in part by jettisoning features that are important for many business uses, especially in the case of the 610.\nBoth Centris models are built around versions of Motorola's 68040 microprocessor, which is roughly equivalent to Intel Corp.'s i486 chip used in the newest Windows computers.\nApple has previously offered the 68040 chip only in its Quadra family of Macintoshes, and Quadras are very expensive. With powerful Intel-based PCs widely available for less than $2,500, not many executives have been able to justify spending twice that amount for a Quadra.\n\"All of a sudden there's a way to get into the 68040 without spending $5,000,\" said Bob LeVitus, a writer who conducts seminars for businesses on how to take best advantage of the Macintosh.\n\"With the '040, you get more horsepower and better performance. There has always been a premium on Apple hardware, and thankfully the premium gap has shrunk a lot. It means many people can now afford to have the real thing, Windows being the fake thing.\"\nApple, which has no direct competitors for its Macintosh system, has been generally perceived to be years ahead of its DOS-Windows counterparts in terms of software, but years behind in hardware.\nIt scored a stunning reversal in portable computers with its PowerBook notebook models, now the best-selling portable computers of any type. But Apple still lags on the desktop, where Windows users have hundreds of different choices of i486-based hardware from dozens of companies, all stacked against just a few 68040 models from Apple.\nAnd Apple's advantage in software is in peril because of recent advances in the Microsoft Corp.'s DOS-Windows operating system and the imminent arrival of such impressive Macintosh alternatives as Nextstep for Intel.\n\"Apple has to convince the market that they are in fact competitive with the Windows platform,\" said Marc C. Litvinoff, an analyst with the Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn.\n\"They do compete well on a price perspective, and they have better networking capabilities, but the Windows platform is catching up.\"\nWith the Centrises, Apple is finally offering its equivalent of i486 power at roughly comparable prices. The question now is whether Apple can persuade its loyal customers to embrace the 68040 as quickly as the Intel Corp. was able to win the hearts of business computer buyers with the i486.\nComputer Intelligence, a market research company in La Jolla, Calif., estimates that the i486 went from 2 percent of all business PC purchases in 1991 to 25 percent in 1992 and an estimated 60 percent in 1993. In fact, major PC makers stopped designing computers based on the various 386 chips last year.\nThe entry-level 68040 machine from Apple is the Centris model 610, with a base price of $1,859, 4 megabytes of system memory, an 80-megabyte hard disk drive and 5"}

The other alliance was led by J&K People's Conference leader Sajjad Lone, a Kashmiri leader, who was supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruling in Delhi.\nMr Malik, who was appointed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has come under fire for dissolving the assembly without allowing the three-party alliance - which he apparently dismissed as an \"unholy\" one - to prove its majority in the legislature.\nThe BJP has denied that it was behind dissolution of the assembly to prevent a rival faction from coming to power.\nSenior BJP leader Ram Madhav added to the drama by alluding in a tweet that the NC and PDP took directions from Pakistan to form an alliance. Mr Madhav later retracted the remarks.\nSaid political analyst Happymon Jacob from Jawaharlal Nehru University: \"All these incidents will increase unhappiness Kashmiris traditionally have towards Delhi (federal government) and the BJP in particular. Calling mainstream parties anti-national and pro-Pakistan will not help at a time when terror attacks and infiltration are increasing.\n\"People are generally unhappy with the way the BJP was trying to make inroads into the political scenario in Kashmir and the dissolution will have serious implication,\" he added.\nKashmir has been under governor's or federal rule since the BJP pulled out of a ruling coalition in June that included the PDP headed by its leader Mehbooba Mufti.\nKashmir, which has been at the heart of a conflict between India and Pakistan, has had a troubled history with thousands of people killed by violence fuelled by a separatist insurgency which began in 1989.\nFollowing a period of relative calm, the last few years have seen a deterioration in the law and order situation, particularly after the killing of Burhan Wani, the commander of the Kashmiri militant group Hizbul Mujahideen, by security forces in 2016.\nOn Sunday, AFP reported that eight people were killed in violence, capping off one of the deadliest weeks this year.\nAgainst this backdrop, the turbulence on the political arena has added to the sense of alienation among Kashmiris.\nSaid Dr Noor Ahmad Baba of the Department of Politics and Governance in Central University of Kashmir: \"By and large people don't have high opinion of the democratic process. These political developments only vindicates that opinion.\"\nThere has been a lukewarm response to elections this year.\nIn recent village council polls over 100 seats went uncontested, meaning there was only one candidate willing to take part. Municipal elections held early this year saw only a four per cent voter turnout.\nThe Election Commission has said that fresh polls should be held within six months.\n\"Kashmir needs political stability at a time when it is passing through a critical time.

It\u2019s part of the vicious cycle of poverty\u2014without access to high-quality education, kids born into poverty are likely to remain there for their whole lives, despite the promise of the American Dream. According to the Kids Count Data Center, a project sponsored by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, 39 percent of African American children lived in poverty in 2013, the highest rate of any racial group. And one study found that 42 percent of African Americans born into the lowest-income category remained there as adults.\nPolicymakers have some ideas about what can help ensure that children born into poverty succeed. In one oft-cited study from the 1970s, the Abecederian Project randomly selected certain infants from low-income families to attend full-time, high-quality education from infancy through age 5, while others were put in a control group. The children who participated in the education program had higher cognitive test scores, were more likely to attend a four-year college, and put off having a first child for longer.\nSimilarly, the Perry Project in the 1960s randomly selected African American children born into poverty for high-quality pre-school and followed those students throughout their lives; those who attended pre-school had higher earnings, were more likely to hold a job and had committed fewer crimes than the control group that did not attend pre-school.\nBut high-quality pre-school is expensive, and most parents struggle to afford any daycare, much less a program that meets quality benchmarks.\nDayisja Davis, 19, discovered this when she had a daughter, who she named Maileia, 10 months ago. She was working for Popeye\u2019s and was about to begin attending a medical assistant program. She thought she\u2019d be able to work and go to school if she could find good childcare, so she applied for CAPS, a Georgia childcare subsidy for low-income parents. She was denied because she would have been required to work 25 hours a week, but her fast-food hours were unpredictable and she sometimes didn\u2019t get assigned enough shifts.\nSince she didn\u2019t have anyone to care for Maileia, she quit her job to take care of her daughter. And then she didn\u2019t have enough money to go to school, so she quit school, too.\n\u201cAt first, when I was working, I thought I could do it, but it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d she told me, pushing a baby carriage down a busy street in Mechanicsville as trucks rattled by.\nThat\u2019s why a foundation is sponsoring a new approach to breaking the cycle of poverty just a few blocks from where Davis and I spoke. It tries to give children access to high-quality, early-childhood education while helping parents get better jobs and build stronger families. It\u2019s called the two-generation approach, and has been found to be one of the best bets in helping families escape poverty.\nHow Common Is Child Labor in the U.S.?\n\u201cIt\u2019s really attempting to better integrate the services and tools that parents and children receive at the same time,\u201d said Leah Austin, the deputy director of the Atlanta Civic Site, the complex in Mechanicsville where the Annie E.

That\u2019s been out there for a while, as plenty of us have reported. General Manager Chris Grier wasn\u2019t putting it like that Monday, though, because Monday wasn\u2019t the time. The start of the new year in March typically is.\nWas it \u201cfair and accurate\u201d that reports said Tannehill was finished here after seven years?\nBut \u201caccurate?\u201d Well, Grier surely knows after seven seasons there\u2019s nothing to, \u201cfix\u201d with Tannehill. He is who he is. And, again, this decision has been made, even if it\u2019s not time to pull the trigger. The Dolphins\u2019 fantasy is to work out a trade for Tannehill.\nA more realistic option considering Tannehill\u2019s contract is he\u2019s designated a post-June 1 cut. He\u2019d then cost a more palatable $7.8 million in dead money and there would be an $18.7 million in cap savings. The Dolphins couldn\u2019t spend that money until after June 1, but that\u2019s OK. They won\u2019t be big spenders in free agency and could use it to extend deals with Laremy Tunsil or Xavien Howard, if that\u2019s what they decide.\n2. Grier also said reports that the Dolphins have decided to bypass a QB at the top of the draft and wait until the 2020 draft were inaccurate. Maybe that happens. Maybe the Dolphins don\u2019t have the chips to trade up for Dwyane Haskins or Kyler Murray, if that\u2019s what it takes.\nBut to dismiss the quarterbacks outright doesn\u2019t make sense considering, \u201cwe haven\u2019t even gone through our process of getting to learn the guys yet,\u201d Grier said.\nThe idea of outright bypassing a quarterback in this draft to get their roster in better order would be repeating a dumb Dolphins blunder. That was the idea of Bill Parcells drafting tackle Jake Long over quarterback Matt Ryan in 2008.\nGrier said they did like two quarterbacks in last year\u2019s draft. They were Baker Mayfield and Josh Allen (Grier didn\u2019t name them). But that\u2019s interesting because former coach Adam Gase now inherits Sam Darnold with the New York Jets.\nFacing an offseason of uncertainty, Vegas oddsmakers consider the Miami Dolphins a real long shot to win next year's Super Bowl.\n3. In about 15 hours, Brian Flores went from running the winning defense of a Super Bowl championship to being named coach of what could be the worst roster in football. His job the next few years will be to survive, as I wrote in my column. Let\u2019s hope he really grasps this situation. Let\u2019s hope everyone else does, too.\n4. Maybe the Dolphins have learned something.

Mr Trump\u2019s suggestion that Russia should be readmitted, delivered as he left Washington for Quebec, was deliberately incendiary, a defiant signal that America was willing to part from its allies on key issues.\nSignificantly, Mr Trump also praised the new populist leader of Italy \u2013 the only leader to back the US call for Russia to be readmitted to the group.\nAs he disembarks in Singapore, Donald Trump is likely to have left the acrimony of the past two days behind as he prepares to engage in what he hopes will be the defining foreign policy achievement of his presidency. That the US president is more comfortable meeting the leader of a long term adversary and known dictator than America\u2019s long-term allies says everything about the priorities and instincts of the 45th president of the United States."}
{"idx": "30187", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Poetry reviews: \"The Apple Trees at Olema\" and \"The Best of It\"\nTwo of America's best known poets offer new collections for poetry month.\nWhen major poets release their collections of \u201cnew and selected poems,\u201d fans often ask two questions: Do the compilations provide valuable insights? Are the new poems as good as the old ones? In many cases, the answer to one or both is no, and what should have been a literary milestone feels like repackaging.\nReaders are hoping for two affirmatives from Robert Hass and Kay Ryan this spring. Both writers have served as poet laureate of the United States (a position Ryan still holds), and both have earned their place among the nation\u2019s most esteemed poets. That\u2019s where the similarities end.\nThe Apple Trees at Olema illustrates why Robert Hass\u2019s work has been widely admired. He masterly conveys the beauty and fragility of the physical world and the people who often stumble and struggle as they move through it. His selected poems are earthy yet illuminating, complex yet clear-eyed, and as the work progresses, readers watch Hass experiment with line lengths and form as his subject matter, narratives, or aesthetics demand.\nAs the compilation progresses, Hass\u2019s work becomes looser and more meditative, allowing him to explore the human landscape and his own experience \u2013 which includes growing up with an alcoholic mother, parenting, and marriage. The poems can be challenging, with lines that are languorous and long. Yet what earned accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize, for his first five books, was Hass\u2019s careful craftsmanship and his astute eye.\nThe new poems in \u201cThe Apple Trees at Olema\u201d lack those elements, which make them feel like early drafts rather than finished poems.\nThe notebook musings try to suggest spontaneity, but are too dense at times, too fragmented at others. The poems about Hass\u2019s brother, who followed their mother\u2019s path of self-destruction, sound oddly distant or disconnected. Even the more successful poems, such as some of the summer lyrics, pale in comparison with earlier work. There just isn\u2019t enough of Hass\u2019s discipline and thoughtful focus to satisfy high expectations.\nKay Ryan\u2019s collection, The Best of It, is vastly different in tone, approach, and style. Her work is concise, exquisitely crafted, and explores the landscape of the mind, rather than personal experience. Those qualities set her poetry apart, as does her consistency. Every section lives up to the title.\nThat\u2019s a remarkable feat, especially since Ryan\u2019s writing is so unusual. She uses logic and insight the way most poets use narrative and description. She often begins with an observation that sounds as if it should be an adage, but Ryan doesn\u2019t try to sound wise. Her poems spring from a depth of understanding that piques and holds the reader\u2019s attention.\nEach statement is rich yet easy to understand, and that combination entices readers \u2013 both experienced and novice \u2013 to follow Ryan down a slide that twists and turns in delightful ways. The poems never end where you think they will, yet they feel so right, so fully realized.\nAs readers move into Ryan\u2019s selected poems, they will notice \u2013 and appreciate \u2013 that she handles every topic with grace and confidence, whether she\u2019s writing about giraffes or someone\u2019s bitter regrets. The careful chiseling of language and thought shape each individual poem as well as the arc of the book.\nIn other words, \u201cThe Best of It\u201d lives up to its promise and has the potential to change the way many"}

{"idx": "30190", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There could be an official decision on Deflategate as early as Wednesday.\nAfter the NFL players union took the league to court over the decision to uphold Tom Brady's four-game Deflategate suspension, there will be a settlement conference on Wednesday to try to help the two sides reach a deal.\nAs SI's Peter King says, while a settlement would help put the whole issue to rest, it may not be the best course of action for the NFL.\nWhile a judge can't force either side to come to a settlement, if they do, it would most likely be in the form of a reduced punishment for Brady. That could be a reduced suspension, a lesser fine, or some combination of the two \u2014 but King says Brady seems unwilling to accept any punishment over the scandal, in which the Patriots were found to be using underinflated footballs in this year's AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts.\nIn compromising, however, the NFL would give players a greater incentive to challenge any punishment they get from the league. If the NFL folds and gives Brady a reduced punishment after months of sticking to its guns, it will encourage more players to take their cases to a third-party in hopes of pressuring the league to overturn or lessen their punishment.\nBrady's case falls in more of a gray area than most; there was no definitive proof he did anything wrong, as noted in the NFL's investigation, which concluded it was \"more probable than not\" that Brady was \"generally aware\" of plans to deflate footballs. Other punishments, including those in response to violations of the league's policy against substance abuse, are pretty black-and-white.\nIf the two sides don't reach a settlement, the case will go back to court, where a judge will have to decide whether the NFL's punishment was fair and consistent \u2014 not whether Brady is guilty. In this case, the court will uphold Brady's suspension or negate it.\nAs King notes, the NFL could still protest that ruling and appeal the loss to the US Court of Appeals. Appealing that decision would seemingly be a save-face move to show the NFL believes it was right in its decision to suspend Brady.\nThe longer this goes on, the more dangerous it gets for the NFL. Though players are not eager to hire lawyers and appear in court, any reduction of Brady's punishment is a win for players and reason to believe they can get their way if they appeal their own punishments more often."}

The Bills total yards for the game were 415 to the Dolphins 175, yet inexplicably the Dolphins pulled out a key win. There were good plays from the Dolphins and there were plays where a superior team would punish them for giving them the opportunity. Although the defense was able to get some pressure on Allen, he still was able to make some key throws. However, Xavien Howard\u2019s two key interceptions minimized the damage. Reshad Jones offers high praise for the corner-back, \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best corners in the league. I say that all the time. I think he\u2019s one of the best in the league. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s finished yet.\u201d Some of Allen\u2019s catchable throws were dropped by his receivers. For the Dolphins the offense was efficient; Tannehill, back under center for the second game since his injury, had an above average game. He was 16 of 24 (67%) for 137 passing yards with 3 touch-downs and an interception. While the key touchdown passes were made, the offense as a whole has to get better on 3rd down conversions going 2 for 9 for the game (22%).\nWhat is the mindset going in to next week? \u201cObviously, in order to stay in the hunt, we\u2019ve got to win, and we know that.

Next week is a tough challenge for the Phins with a tough rivalry against the Patriots. Dolphins are 5-1 at home, and this is a home game. The Patriots are also coming off a win defeating the Vikings 24 to 10. The Dolphins can\u2019t afford to make too many costly mistakes against the Pats because they will make you pay for it. However, anything can happen on any given Sunday. Tune in next Sunday to see an intense rivalry game with high stakes. Dolphins must win to keep their playoff hopes alive. Let\u2019s see what adjustments they make heading into next week. To have a chance they have to get pressure on Brady, if he\u2019s able to set and throw he\u2019ll kill them all game long."}

Boise State won the game in overtime in one of the most memorable bowl games ever.\nOn the flip side, there was the Oklahoma-Connecticut game of three years ago \u2014 a mismatch that lived up to expectations with a 48-20 win for the Sooners.\nCould UCF be the next Boise State on the BCS stage? Or will Baylor overpower UCF with the nation\u2019s top offense the way Oklahoma did to Connecticut? The teams have a month to scheme and prepare, but here\u2019s an early glimpse at the matchup.\nScouting report: High-powered offenses have become more and more popular in recent seasons, but Baylor has taken it to another level with its nearly point-per-minute scoring attack that hasn\u2019t slowed a bit since Robert Griffin III took his Heisman Trophy to the NFL two years ago. The Bears lead the nation in scoring and total offense, and topped 70 points in a game four times. The knock on Baylor in recent seasons has been its lack of defense. Not this year. Baylor ranks in the top 20 in scoring defense and total defense, having held all but four opponents under 30 points. Baylor landed five players on the All-Big 12 First Team, including the dangerous offensive trio of quarterback Bryce Petty, running back Lache Seastrunk and receiver Antwan Goodley.\nLast game: The Knights capped a school record eight-game winning streak with a 17-13 win over SMU.\nScouting report: UCF takes heat for playing in the American Athletic Conference, a league many believe should not have an automatic BCS bid, but the Knights handled whatever came their way. After a three-point non-conference loss to South Carolina, UCF rattled off eight straight wins, including one over then-No. 8 Louisville. The Knights don\u2019t dazzle with a high-powered offense or gaudy scoring numbers but have been efficient behind junior quarterback Blake Bortles. UCF won seven of its games by a touchdown or less. That\u2019s a credit to the UCF defense, which ranks 13th nationally in scoring defense and 19th in total defense. UCF\u2019s rushing defense ranks 13th in the nation, and its red zone defense ranks ninth.\n\u2014 Both schools are playing in their first BCS bowl game. That should be a draw for the teams\u2019 fan bases, though many assume UCF will not travel well because of the distance between Florida and Arizona.

Now, however, thanks to a leak posted to Instagram (via UberGizmo), we're getting our first true look at Hydrogen One and what it features. The leak is an official infographic that not only gives us a new view of the phone, but also neatly points out all the hardware details.\nThe Hydrogen One has a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 pixel H4V Leia holographic display. It also packs 128GB of storage, 6GB of RAM, a 4,500mAh battery, aluminum or titanium case, and stereo speakers.

The Serbs and an anti-fascist group will do so on Sunday.\nCroatia's new center-right government, which took office in January, condemned the crimes of the Ustashe government this month, but Kraus said that happened only after Jewish and Serb groups announced the Jasenovac boycott.\n\"Attempts at historical revisionism are visible in the society, even in media, while police, state prosecution and politicians fail to act and stem incidents like those with the Ustashe greeting,\" said Sasa Milosevic from the Serbian National Council, the leading Serb minority group.\n\"We don't feel we have a place in Jasenovac today,\" he said.\nThe Jewish and Serb communities have also voiced concern over changes to the exhibits at the Jasenovac museum which they say fail to adequately reflect the criminal nature of the Ustashe government.

India, the largest democracy, was fast becoming its software centre.\nTheir influence expanded in other areas. After enormous growth over the past 30 years, China is now poised to overtake Japan as the world's second biggest economy; if current trends continue, it will replace the US at number one around 2035. India's GDP is just a third of China's, but its growth rate of more than 6% a year lifted average incomes over $1,000 for the first time.\nFrom oil to water, both became thirstier for resources, raising fears of a conflict with neighbouring countries, including each other. Already nuclear powers, the two nations have extended their military reach with satellite launches and, in China's case, manned space missions.\nSpeedy growth also brought rising social inequality, worsening environmental problems and the potentially unsettling shift of hundreds of millions of people from countryside to city. But, on the surface at least, both governments remained stable. For the first time in more than 40 years, an Indian prime minister served a full term and was re-elected.

City Hill is a small, focused fund making a limited number of investments, chiefly because I\u2019m deeply involved, taking a hands-on, operational, or advisory role with each portfolio company.\nRecall that in baseball, the goal of the \u201csmall ball\u201d offensive strategy is to maximize your team\u2019s on base percentage and advance the runners to score more runs, instead of relying on home runs to win the game.

There are strategic ways to make progress with strategic partners on a non-dilutive basis as well.\nThanks for your comment, Mike. Glad to hear you\u2019re using this approach for Medical Device and Diagnostics.\nbe finished at a later date.\nJonathan, nice story \u2013 and a cool acronym that seems to make it easier for people to pay attention. This is quite a similar approach to what we used in building and selling MaxThera \u2013 to Biota, another Australian company. Antibacterial drug discovery assets were acquired from Genome Therapeutics, with back end payments. We funded research exclusively with grants. When a bit more capital was needed to move the assets further along, we worked in parallel to develop relationships with VCs and Corporations, looking for equity investment, partnerships or M&A. Without spending any investor dollars, we picked up a decent payday, which could be substantial down the road with development and sales milestones. Currently working on a new venture called Frontiera Therapeutics \u2013 different therapeutic area, different stage of development, much higher potential market but still thinking lean, efficient and focused. May turn out to become a lasting R&D and sales entity, but more likely will be acquired by a company that appreciates the addition to their pipeline.\nWith respect to Stewart\u2019s comment, such an approach is indeed a win-win: the seller/investors get a respectable return in a relatively short time frame and the buyer gets a shiny new asset for their portfolio, likely requiring less capital than would have been required to build something similar organically.\nYour approach is very similar to the asset-centric investing approach we have been employing at Index Ventures in Europe for the last six or seven years. The principle is very simple: you dont know whether ANY early stage asset is really going to work, no matter how clever you are. So attrition rates are high. Hence you have to turn the card as cheaply as possible for the economics to work. Simple really.\nBut, even after six or seven years and several successful exits for these asset-centric companies its still to early to claim the approach is validated across a whole portfolio. The signs are good though.\nImportantly, though, these people have to come from a culture of \u201clean and mean\u201d and that typically means not from"}

Mueller may also examine \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\u201d. He is empowered to \u201cprosecute federal cries arising from the investigation of these matters\u201d.\nThis is a very big deal, as you surely know if you have recently glanced in the general direction of any newspaper. Defenders of the rule of law had spent months calling for a special counsel. Finally, they got their wish: an special counsel focused on Trump and Russia. Trump responded by fuming and cowering in the White House.\nMueller\u2019s appointment is a good thing. These extraordinary times call for a special counsel, armed with access to the FBI\u2019s investigatory arsenal. If crimes were committed, they must be punished. And given the extent to which the attorney general and his deputy are tainted by impropriety, only a special counsel could credibly oversee the FBI\u2019s probe.\nThat said, Mueller is no silver bullet. To the contrary, he is limited in ways that will prevent him from answering important questions in an open, timely, and transparent manner. Accordingly, while some have urged that congressional investigations (and calls for impeachment) take a back seat while Mueller works, that is the wrong conclusion. If anything, the appointment of a special counsel confirms the need for a vigorous, bipartisan congressional review of attacks on America\u2019s political order.\nThe first limitation on Mueller\u2019s inquiry is timing: it will take him 12 to 18 months, if not longer, to conduct an exhaustive investigation. Throughout that process, he will keep his timeline secret. It is absurd to expect the public to sit on its hands indefinitely \u2013 possibly through the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 waiting to learn whether the president and his staff will be charged with treason, perjury, espionage, obstruction or other crimes. The nation needs answers, and it needs them sooner than Mueller can deliver.\nThis leads to a second issue: secrecy. If Mueller concludes that nobody should be charged with a crime, departmental custom dictates that he say little more. And if he does bring charges, he might reveal only the information necessary to prosecute those specific cases. In the end, even if he wanted to do so, it would be exceptionally difficult for Mueller to tell the public what he found and how he made his decisions.\nThose decisions, moreover, are of a highly particular character, and that raises a third issue. As Leah Litman emphasizes at the Take Care blog: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the special counsel is seemingly limited to investigations of criminal law, and applications of criminal law to whatever the facts may be.\u201d Thus, Mueller is not empowered to indict conduct \u2013 including evil, abusive, or immoral acts \u2013 unless that conduct is specifically covered by the criminal code.\nThis is not a free pass: there are powerful arguments that Trump has violated federal obstruction of justice laws. But to twist a clich\u00e9, when all you have is a hammer, everything either looks like a nail or falls out of focus. Mueller has been tasked with finding criminal acts. If he instead finds shocking abuses of power that do not amount to crimes, his duty is to keep silent. The public, though, has a right to see the full picture.\nYet another limit on Mueller is that he remains bound by justice department policies. This arguably, though not necessarily, includes internal precedent"}

Please don't make search engine algorithms try to make sense of \"Who is that actor Charlie Sheen dating again? I forget\" It is 2017 and people shouldn't be typing sentences into Google unless they're looking to match song lyrics or root out plagiarism.\nWell, Hope Hicks is Donald Trump's 28-year-old White House Director of Strategic Communications, and as reported by Inquisitr, people Googling information about her seem to regard her as Donald Trump's girlfriend.\nNot everyone, but enough that Google's infamous suggested searches -- the autofill function -- seems eager to suggest it.\nA lot of people don't know much about Hope.\nOur first reaction to Hope Hicks' name was to wonder what it's like to have a name like \"Hope\" and work in an administration that embodies despair.\nBut on second thought, we realized that her name makes sense for the Trump White House, given Trump's base demographics.\nThis is right up there with an NSA whistleblower named \"Reality Winner.\"\nLike, if someone were just sitting down and writing all of this for a TV show, they'd probably need to go back and make the names more realistic.\nBut, though Google Trends says that there wasn't really an uptick in searches for Hope Hicks until a couple of months ago, she's been with the administration since the beginning.\nIn fact, she was at the notably undercrowded inauguration, seen alongside Kellyanne Conway -- both dressed as very different flavors of supervillains.\nIf Kellyanne dressed as a supervillain who sends ransom notes in a jack-in-the-box, Hope dressed as a supervillain who turns her enemies to stone.\nThe thing is that we can't find any real indications that Hope Hicks is anything more than Trump's employee.\nBut we think that one factor in making people suggest this is that her looks are ... above average.\nWell above average -- she was a model for Ralph Lauren.\nShe does do her makeup like she's 40, but that's not at all uncommon for affluent conservative women. Sometimes even when they're still teenagers.\nAnd that's totally her right; she can wear makeup however she likes. But she still looks like somebody's 28-year-old stepmom.\nTrump is notoriously picky, but when viewed alongside racist elf Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon, who looks like every male NPC in The Witcher, it's easy to see how she might look appealing to someone like Trump.\nAdd in the apparent marital tension going on in the Trump family, hundreds of millions of people keeping up with news of the administration, and time ... and you're going to see some people speculate."}

A wealthy investor in hospitals and clinics who became a leading antagonist of healthcare reform over the past two decades, the brash, bald Scott somehow escaped scrutiny of his controversial enterprises while he spent millions advertising himself as more \"conservative\" than Attorney General Bill McCollum.\nJust six days before Rick Scott announced his bid for governor, he was deposed in a case that alleged his health care company, Solantic, broke Florida law by filing false medical licensing information with the state.\nBut what Scott said April 7 might never become public.\nWithin a month, Solantic settled the 2-year-old case and signed a confidentiality agreement with Dr. P. Mark Glencross, who claimed his medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. The state has no current or former investigations into Solantic over the licensing issue.\nAt the same time the case was quietly settled, the Republican front-runner was drawing attention to Solantic on the campaign trail by boasting of his business background and the company's patient-centered, low-cost health care model that provides \"Starbucks-style\" transparent pricing at nearly 30 clinics in the state.\nThe Glencross lawsuit and nine other court actions filed against the company since 2001 in Duval County tell a different story. Taken together, they portray the company, and sometimes Scott by extension, as a ruthless employer that discriminated or cut corners in pursuit of profit.\nThe Herald/Times report is tantalizing, yet far too brief, and is aptly headlined \"Few Details Emerge From Suits ...\" A much fuller account of the troubling history of Scott's health enterprises -- including the fraud-ridden Columbia/HCA, which entered into one of the largest settlement agreements ever won by the Justice Department -- was published last fall by Salon (in cooperation with the Investigative Fund).\nReporter Tristram Korten\u2019s two-part series on Scott, which appeared months before Scott declared his candidacy, explored the same hiring discrimination and wrongful death lawsuits, in much greater detail. With Scott closing in on his party's nomination, and perhaps the statehouse, it is very much worth revisiting.\nFrom 2003 to 2005, five Solantic supervisors, all working in different clinics, have claimed they were explicitly prevented from hiring people they deemed the most qualified because the candidates were either overweight, too old, Hispanic or black. The supervisors all prepared lawsuits with the same lawyer, claiming they were fired or forced to quit \"because they did not want to enforce Solantic's discriminatory practices,\" as their complaints state. Two employees corroborated specific incidents in their own lawsuits against the company.\nScott himself is a fascinating figure because he embodies the social vision of this year's loudest ideologues: a Tea Party nation where unbridled corporate avarice \"solves\" every problem, including medical care for the uninsured. What he thinks they need, as a doctor who sued Scott told Korten, are clinics that can be run like a fast-food restaurant (Scott likes to mention Starbucks, but McDonald's is more like it).\nAmong the results, aside from the emphasis on \"attract"}

However Lightning were a touch fortunate not to have the goal ruled out by referee Chris Wells as the net appeared to be slightly off its moorings before the puck crossed the line.\nWith just over eight minutes to the final buzzer Flyers gave themselves hope of turning the game around when Chase Schaber made it 3-2 at 51mins 49secs.\nThe hosts added a fourth goal on 57mins 4secs after Guillaume Doucet put Mele in the clear to go one on one with Marr.\nIn a last fling of the dice Marr was withdrawn for the extra skater but it backfired when Kearney unselfishly passed to Mele to complete his hat-trick with an empty net goal 16 seconds from the buzzer.\nAt Ice Arena Wales a trio of third period goals put an end to a battling performance from Lightning. Lightning took two coaches of supporters to Ice Arena Wales and they witnessed their heroes fight back from going four goals behind by the 27th minute to trail by just a single goal at the second break.\nIn the end the visitors couldn\u2019t match the strength in depth of the high flying Devils who were celebrating their second league title success in a row.\nIn Russell and Emersic\u2019s last game in charge Lightning went behind to a Paul Crowder goal on 6mins 43secs.

The purpose of these weekly nets is to use their Ham radio equipment, to share emergency information and meet other Ham Radio operators.\nAlthough checking-in each week is the ideal goal; it isn\u2019t necessary to participate every week. The realistic objective is to have Hams, ready to tune into a Simplex frequency during an emergency situation with their radio equipment charged up and operational. Checking-in periodically, at least once a month, would satisfy that goal.

Americans have to cut back. They are out of time and out of money. Ten years closer to retirement than they were in before the tech stock crash, Baby Boomers are not a penny richer. Now, they\u2019re facing a funky economy where housing prices are in decline, jobs are hard to find and lenders are reticent to lend them more money.

The nation\u2019s trade deficit with Japan has shrunk by almost 20 percent, and its deficits with Mexico, Canada and the European Union are down more than 40 percent.\nAmericans were the world\u2019s champion consumers. Just lend them money; they\u2019d spend it. But when they stop spending it brings a hush to the entire planet. The malls go quiet\u2026trucks slow down\u2026ships are idled\u2026and finally factories are shut down. Clerks, drivers, stevedores and assembly line workers all go home. That is what a depression is all about.\nThe feds are trying to get consumers to spend again. They\u2019ve given them tax rebates, incentives, loans, and bribes. They\u2019ve run a federal deficit three times higher than the previous record.

America has great businesses with great brands. As the dollar falls it should be able for them to gain global market share in some sectors. But 70% of the economy is consumer spending. Until that changes, the US economy is hostage to US consumer spending. When consumers stop consuming, the US economy\u2019s wheels stop turning.\nAnd you are right. America has less than 5% of the world\u2019s population. But it consumes more than 20% of the total world\u2019s output \u2013 as measured by GDP.

It is one of four documentaries competing in the Oscar foreign language race.\nThe other straight docs are \u201cUkrainian Sheriffs,\u201d Roman Bondarchuk\u2019s look at two small-town law-enforcement officers in a region changing from Ukrainian to Russian control; and Pietra Brettkelly\u2019s \u201cA Flickering Truth,\u201d which documents the revival of the Afghan film archives.\nLuxembourg\u2019s entry, \u201cVoices From Chernobyl,\u201d is a less straightforward doc; it\u2019s a powerful viewing experience in which actors read eyewitness accounts of the nuclear disaster drawn from Svetlana Alexievich\u2019s nonfiction book, while Pol Crutchen\u2019s camera roams the deserted landscape of Pripyat, and the director also stages sometimes surreal tableau amidst the abandoned cityscapes.\nHere\u2019s where lines are almost erased. In the Oscar documentary race, for instance, Robert Greene\u2019s \u201cKate Plays Christine\u201d is competing for the big prize. The film chronicles indie actress Kate Lyn Sheil\u2019s preparation to play newscaster Christine Chubbuck, who killed herself on camera in 1974 \u2014 except that the film about Chubbuck for which Sheil is preparing doesn\u2019t actually exist (unlike Antonio Campos\u2019 \u201cChristine,\u201d in which Rebecca Hall plays the role).\nSheil is simply \u201cpreparing\u201d for a \u201crole\u201d in a fake movie whose clips are never intended to be anything other than scenes in \u201cKate Plays Christine\u201d; this \u201cdocumentary\u201d is documenting a fiction. But the Oscars say it\u2019s a doc, and so did the Critics\u2019 Choice Documentary Awards and the Cinema Eye Honors.\nThen there\u2019s the brain-teasing \u201cHouston, We Have a Problem,\u201d which is Slovenia\u2019s entry in the Oscar foreign- language race. It\u2019s a documentary about how a faltering NASA bought the entire Yugoslavian space program in the early \u201960s in an effort to jump-start their own program \u2014 except that while it looks and acts like a doc, it actually just uses the nonfiction format to show how easily myths and conspiracies can be created and can spread.\nIf you like this year\u2019s Oscar doc race, we\u2019ve got some good news: Next year\u2019s Emmy race will look very similar.

Dredd, penned by Alex Garland, was set in a violent, dystopian future where police have the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, Judge Dredd is joined by a new recruit as they set out to take down a criminal organisation responsible for the designer drug SLO-MO. Karl Urban has since announced that he would love to don the helmet once again but there has been no more news concerning a sequel.\nAlex Garland, writer of 28 Days Later, The Beach and more recently, Ex Machina, has publicly announced that even though he and Karl Urban would love to do a sequel, the studio behind the film will not finance a sequel, due to the poor box office showing the film did. Urban has come out saying that a sequel would see Dredd go back to his roots, following an origins story based on a story by Judge Dredd creator John Wagner. The story follows Dredd as he goes in search of his father in the mutant-filled badlands outside of Mega City 1. Only time will tell if fans will get what they want and convince the money men that a sequel will be worthwhile.\nNeil Blomkamp\u2019s debut, a sci-fi set in a near-future Johannesburg, South Africa, was a film that sent a strong apartheid/segregation message reminiscent of the real problems South Africa have faced. The film focussed on an alien species, known as \u2018prawns\u2019, who landed on Earth but are kept separate from humans. A sequel could either work as a prequel to how the aliens arrived, and their initial interaction with humans, or perhaps a film set after the original film, exploring the alien\u2019s origins and how a technologically superior race came to Earth to begin with, or even when more of their species arrive to find the conditions they are living in presently.\nEven though Blomkamp has been busy with his latest release; Chappie, also set in Johannesburg, he has still confirmed that he would be very much interested in following up the film that hit cult status swiftly after release, a height that his two follow up films haven\u2019t quite yet reached. District 10 has been in the pipeline since the editing stages of District 9, when Blomkamp then felt a sequel could work, whether or not this happens, is anyone\u2019s guess.\nObviously Kill Bill did have a sequel in Volume 2, but a true sequel is something that Tarantino himself hopes to do one day. Supposedly set ten years after the events of Volume 1, the film could involve Vernita Green\u2019s (Vivica A. Fox) daughter Nikki, who unfortunately witnessed her mother die by the hands of Uma Thurman\u2019s Bride. Going down the vengeance path again, the sequel could be about Nikki wanting to get revenge on the Bride herself, with one other character possibly getting in the way; the Bride\u2019s daughter, B.B. Tarantino has mentioned in the past he hopes to write and film a third in the Kill Bill series but no further news has been mentioned since he confirmed his plans in an Italian interview back in 2009. Tarantino wanted to shoot a follow up in real time, ten years after Volume Two was released, which would make the film already a year overdue."}

{"idx": "30253", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: We all make mistakes. Let's just hope we can learn from them.\nAs someone who writes about finances for a living, I tend to hold myself to a certain standard when it comes to my money-related choices. But truth be told, I've made a number of money mistakes in my day -- like staying away from stocks for years because I was scared of the market, or waiting too long to open a 401(k). But if I had to choose my single biggest money regret of 2016, it would have to be something frustratingly simple: I didn't save enough.\nI started off 2016 with an updated budget that incorporated room for savings. The problem? I ignored that budget for much of the year.\nNot that it's any consolation, but I was in pretty good company in that regard. According to a recent Wells Fargo report, about 60% of Americans don't follow a budget. Still, not following a budget made it harder to track my spending, and as a result, I blew way too much cash on things I didn't need.\nI also failed to account for one-time expenses that popped up at various points throughout the year. For example, I pay $1,200 a year in homeowners' insurance, only instead of setting aside $100 each month to cover it, I forgot about it and almost came up short when that payment was due. Had I been following my budget, I would've remembered that payment and spent less money along the way in preparation.\nBut not following a budget is only one of the things I did wrong in 2016. I also forgot to follow my cardinal rule: Pay yourself first. Ideally, we should all aim to save at least 10% of each paycheck, regardless of how much we earn. Now, my income is variable and can change drastically from one month to the next, yet instead of putting 10% of my earnings into the bank every month, I did so only when it was convenient for me.\nOctober, for example, was a slower month for me, so what I should have done was sit down with my budget, figure out how to account for the drop in income, redistribute my spending allowances, and put 10% of whatever I ended up earning aside for savings. What I actually did was ignore my budget, overspend that month, and save nothing.\nBut that wasn't my only blunder. July was a pretty strong month for me income-wise, but instead of seizing the opportunity to stick extra cash in my savings account, I rewarded myself with purchases that perhaps improved my quality of life on a short-term basis but ultimately made me feel bad about the way I spent my money.\nAll in, I'd say I probably saved $5,000 less than I could have because I disregarded my budget and neglected to pay myself first. And while $5,000 is a large amount of money in its own right, in reality, my mistake cost me much more. See, had I put that cash into relatively conservative investments averaging an annual 4% return, I would have put myself in a position to be $16,000 richer 30 years from now -- and that's without adding a single dime above that initial $5,000 investment.\nFurthermore, had I put that money in stocks -- which have historically delivered an average annual 9% return -- I could've turned it into $66,000 over 30 years without having to do a darn thing other than sit back and watch it compound. So in reality, I didn't"}

And the ramifications of that statistic can be costly and wide-ranging.\nFor example, long waits can lead to high abandon rates.

And that can translate into longer call resolution times because frustrated people often like to vent to contact center agents.

Chhaochharia told ET that that India remains a positive story in the medium term, but concerns underlie for near-term growth prospects as they see growth recovery to be gradual and mild.\nAfter trimming the Nifty target from 9600 to 9200 over the last few months, Chhaochharia reasoned that the action is reflective of earnings cut. He went on to state that since earnings estimates have already been lowered by 7% for FY15, FY16, and FY17, hence it is simply reflected in the Nifty target as well.\nThe growth recovery in the GDP and corporate earnings is expected to come in FY17 than in FY16, he added. According to their estimates, earnings will grow at a rate of 10% in FY16. Also, he said that their focus mainly on CPI and not WPI has also contributed to the lack of adjustment of their Nifty target in line with the corporate earnings, which resulted in the slash down of the target.\nChhaochharia sees more disappointments in terms of earnings growth momentum on the cards going ahead. However, he explained that the Nifty target of 9200 and medium-term positive view on India comes on expectations that both inflation and interest rates will positively surprise the market. Chhaochharia keeps a neutral rating on ICICI bank, which is currently surrounded by NPA concerns. He told ET that the bank is highly corporate-driven, of which, a large part belongs to the international book. Hence there will not be a heavy uptick unless local credit cycle improves.\nMeanwhile, Chhaochharia still likes the telecommunications space as they are overweight on stocks like Bharti and Idea. He said that quarterly numbers do matter, but the bigger picture of these companies is sound and robust in terms of pricing power and structure. He does not feel that the launch of Reliance Jio will make any sharp dent in the companies' profitability or its stock price."}

They want drivers licenses because possessing them makes life easier, both in terms of identification and surviving traffic stops by the local constabulary.\nNow New Mexico has investigated their history of awarding DLs to aliens and \u2014 mirabile dictu! \u2014 the silly policy did not increase the prevalence of insurance. Instead, the purchase of auto insurance decreased. We are so surprised.\nSanta Fe, N.M. \u2013 When New Mexico began issuing driver\u2019s licenses to non-citizens in 2003, then-Governor Bill Richardson had argued the policy would reduce the high number of uninsured drivers in the state.\nNearly a decade later, national statistics indicate the law failed to live up to its expectations.\nNew Mexico continues to rank near the top of the list of states with the most uninsured drivers, consistently registering nearly twice the national average, according to the Insurance Research Council.\nIn 2000, before the law went into effect, 26.3 percent of New Mexico drivers were uninsured. In 2008, a year before Richardson left office, that number had jumped to 29.5 percent, making the state number one in the country for uninsured drivers. By 2009, the last year figures were available, the state dropped to second place with 25.7 percent of its drivers uninsured.\nQuery said he was aware of cases where vans of undocumented Polish immigrants from Chicago were brought to New Mexico to fraudulently obtain a license.\nSchmid said there are periodic fluctuations in the data that has caused the figures to rise and fall more because of the economy rather than immigration status.\nAn estimated 49,000 undocumented immigrants reside in New Mexico, and since the law went into effect some 80,000 licenses have been issued to foreign nationals.\nQuery said it is almost impossible to determine what percentage of drivers are undocumented and that New Mexico\u2019s high uninsured rate may be more directly related to its high level of poverty and unemployment rather the licenseholder\u2019s immigration status.\nAs opposition continues to simmer around the state to repeal the law, little of the debate has anything to do with insured drivers.\nIncumbent Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, says she wants to repeal the law, citing concerns about fraud, human trafficking, organized crime and national security concerns.\nState Rep. James White, also a Republican, supports Martinez and has voted twice to repeal the drivers license law saying it encourages further illegal immigration into the state.\nBut though Martinez has garnered some support to overturn the law, she continues to struggle with the state senate.\nFor State Senator George Munoz, a Democrat, the law is about more than just insuring motorists.\nResigned to the fact there will always be illegal immigration, particularly in his border state, Munoz contends it is better to know who is here rather than force the undocumented deeper underground.\nMunoz supports a Utah-style policy where a drivers permit is given the applicant that is only recognized in that state and cannot be used as a form of identification for air travel alleviating national security concerns.\nState Senator"}

But it\u2019s at the expense of women like Fox, Natalya and Naomi, who\u2019ve been toiling away for years, putting on the best matches they could with the scraps they were, and continue to be, given. And though there have been plenty of NXT graduates besides the Four Horsewomen, WWE largely fixates on Charlotte, Banks, Bayley and Becky Lynch, creating yet another hierarchy within the already fractured women\u2019s wrestling division in WWE.\nThose ideologies are even internalized by women Superstars themselves. Listen to any interview with Sasha Banks and she routinely refers to Total Divas and its cast members with disdain. \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be, so to say, \u2018Divas,\u2019\u201d she told the radio show Busted Open during last year\u2019s WrestleMania 32 festivities. \u201cAnd I\u2019m in a category of \u2018wrestlers.\u2019\u201d Banks\u2019 internalized misogyny carries over to her promos as well, looking down her nose at \u201cchicks with no talent who post on Instagram\u201d and calling Dana Brooke \u201cMiss Piggy.\u201d If one of the most celebrated woman wrestlers in (not just recent) history believes only some women are worthy of respect and career advancement, what hope do fans have at dismantling these toxic ideas?\nBut positioning oneself as \u201cdifferent\u201d from other women, despite also being cissexist, is nonetheless seen as a good thing in WWE.

Before he ate it, he pulled out a tape measure (don't we all?) and realized it was only 11 inches long!! He was ripped off of an entire inch of sandwich!!\nHe posted it on Facebook, and of course, a picture of a sandwich got a zillion \"Likes\" and went viral as they say. Wish my Fan Site could pull THAT off. Maybe I need to post my lunch more often.\nAnyway, people all over the place started measuring THEIR foot long sandwiches and what do you know? They measured 11 or 11.5 inches long.\nAm I a bad American because I am not energized to join a class action suit? Maybe I and millions of others who have been wronged could recover mucho dinero for all those lost inches!! Think about it? A family my size?? 8 people?? That's a LOT of lost inches over the years!\nThe sue happy types probably are already one step ahead of me.\nI have an idea for Subway.\nMaybe they should DOUBLE the price of the first six inches of sandwich and charge THAT for a true foot long!\nIn other words, if a six inch sandwich costs $4.00, shouldn't the foot long cost $8.00??\nYou can get the second half of the sandwich for a fraction of what you paid for the first half.\nWhy? Because it's an incentive to get the customer to move a size up on their order.\nIt's a tactic used all the time.\nEver notice at the movie theaters when the concession vendors say \"A large is twice as big as the medium for twenty five cents more!\"\nMaybe movie theaters should charge you the higher price for all that extra soda!\nYou can buy my pencils for $1 each or a dozen for $8. Why? Because it's great marketing.\nI've never gone into the kitchen of a burger joint or restaurant and made them weigh my uncooked burger to PROVE to me it was really a quarter pounder.\nI think it would bother me more if they were ripping you off based on the cost of an inch or a pound.\nIn other words, if Subway said you had to pay by the INCH and, say, each inch was .50, then it should add up. Six inches would be $3.00 and a foot long would be $6.00. Easy math.\nSame way if you go to the grocery store and you buy a POUND of apples.

In the second case, I am paying for the SANDWICH or BURGER as a meal.\nDo you count how many onion rings or french fries you get EVERY time you order??

{"idx": "30286", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On March 18, 2014, local citizens approved a referendum to dissolve Evanston Township the following month, at which point the City of Evanston assumed all functions previously performed by the Township. GO TO 2040 recommends that metropolitan Chicago pursue coordinated investments and analyze the effects of consolidating local governments. A previous Policy Update explored legislation passed earlier this year by the Illinois General Assembly that empowered a limited number of special districts with the legal means to be dissolved into counties, municipalities, or other special districts. This Policy Update examines recent local government consolidation efforts in Evanston and River Forest Townships, as well as DuPage County.\nIn the past, existing Illinois Township Code mandated that a township government could only be dissolved if all other townships within that county were also eliminated. Evanston Township's dissolution process began in March 2012, when citizens passed a non-binding referendum to gauge public opinion on the issue. This prompted state lawmakers to amend the statute the following year in a manner that allowed only Evanston Township's dissolution through public referendum.\nEvanston Township was unique among townships because all its territory fell within the City of Evanston's incorporated boundaries, and thus the township was not required to maintain any roads in unincorporated areas. The township did perform administrative functions, including local management of Illinois general assistance programs and property taxpayer assistance. Upon the township's dissolution, the City of Evanston's Health Department assumed the former government's general assistance and emergency programs, and the City Administrative Services Department took over assessment and administrative duties. Some cost savings resulted from the elimination of a Township Personnel/Finance Clerk administrative position.\nThe Evanston Township legislation has prompted other communities to explore merging townships with municipalities. For example, River Forest Township is now one of only 19 townships in Illinois that doesn't contain any unincorporated territory, and it has discussed a possible merger of services with the Village of River Forest. This could include sharing services for the River Forest Civic Center Authority and housing several township offices in the Village Hall. Similar to the efforts in Evanston, House Bill 4425 was proposed in the Illinois General Assembly earlier this year to allow for the dissolution of the River Forest Township through referendum. The bill is currently awaiting consideration in the House Rules Committee.\nSeeking to reduce the size, scope, and costs of local governments, DuPage County contracted with a private consulting firm in 2012 to perform an audit of the DuPage County Election Commission as well as the 24 agencies whose boards were appointed by the County Board. These agencies account for $300 million in expenditures and employ 900 people. The audit sought \"to obtain a better understanding of the agencies' functions, fiscal sustainability, transparency, accountability, internal controls, audit, and opportunities to improve efficiency, streamline structure, and reduce costs.\" Based on the report, the DuPage County Board identified several \"paper districts,\" which are local governments that levy taxes but usually function by contracting their services from a separate district.\nThese findings were used as the foundation for DuPage County's Accountability, Consolidation, and Transparency (ACT) Initiative in 2012, which brought various agencies into compliance with DuPage County policies related to ethics, procurement, and personnel. Various personnel reforms and the sharing of services, such as the integration of the DuPage County Election Commission and County IT and administrative services, have resulted in cost savings. The"}

But we ask the question -- is this just a waste of time and money?\nWhen Denver voters go to the polls in 2010, they&apos;ll vote on an initiative that would create an Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission. The panel would promote \"harmonious, peaceful, mutually respectful and beneficial coexistence\" between earthlings and extraterrestrials, in part by developing protocols for \"diplomatic contact.\"\n\"It&apos;s like saying you&apos;re going to have a ballot initiative about the existence of Bigfoot,\" Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine, told the Los Angeles Times.\nThis is the brainchild of a 55-year-old man named Jeff Peckman, who is extremely concerned that if/when aliens touch down in the Mile High City, there is no official set of rules for greeting and living alongside them. Um, just send John Elway out to meet &apos;em.\nSo he went out and collected signatures to get the issue on the ballot. He needed 3,974 voters to sign -- he got 10,274, proving this issue is for real. While Peckman is undoubtedly pleased with himself, some city lawmakers are just plain embarrassed.\n\"If someone was looking to locate a business here, they&apos;d think, &apos;What kind of city is this?&apos; \" Councilman Charlie Brown said.\nBrown joked that if approved, it could result in a costly boondoggle for the city. \"What would a commission demand of us as a city?

He was hoping that when President Obama came into office, he would release information on UFO landings. He has not, so Peckman came up with this scheme to try to set-up an official panel that could look into extraterrestrials.\nFor his part, Peckman claims to have seen a spaceship, but only once. It was on the day Michael Jackson died. Coincidence? Peckman was standing in downtown Denver, chatting on a cell phone, when a green ball of light flashed by.\n\"It didn&apos;t fizzle out like a meteorite.

Mangum has 337 hits and counting in his career. On Friday against Tennessee, he passed former Bulldog second baseman Jeffrey Rea, who had 335 hits from 2004-07.\n\"It's really hard for me to believe,\" Mangum told Steve Robertson of GenesPage.com after the game.\nMangum said he went to Starkville as an eighth grader to attend a baseball camp. Rea was the one front-tossing to him in the batting cage. Mangum switched from the left to the right side of the plate in the middle of the session.\n\"Oh, we got a switch hitter, man!\" Rea said. \"Keep doing that and you could be something special one day!\"\nMangum called Rea an \"icon,\" a guy who represented the maroon and white the way Mangum one day dreamed of doing. Mangum has been living it for the last four years now, and Friday he immortalized himself in Mississippi State lore. He credits Rea for being able to do so.\n\"He's done a lot for me and he doesn't even know it,\" Mangum said. \"That day in eighth grade when I was at the baseball camp, small stuff like that went a long way with me. He was someone I looked up to and wanted to be like some day.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Mangum's record-breaking hit came in a clutch situation. Mississippi State was tied with Tennessee, 2-2 in the top of the 10th inning in Friday's SEC series opener. Mangum slapped the ball into right field from the right side of the plate, a classic opposite-field hit for MSU's new hit king. The hit turned out to be inconsequential, but his next one wasn't.\nMangum added a two-RBI single in the top of the 11th to push his career total to 337 and his season total to 62, which leads the country. The runs he brought home were insurance tallies in an eventual 6-3 Mississippi State victory. Mangum is 15 hits shy of tying LSU legend Eddy Furniss for the all-time lead for hits by a Southeastern Conference player.\nMangum played an average of 65 games in each of his first three seasons. If he plays that many this season, he's currently on pace for roughly 130 hits this season. That would not only shatter the all-time SEC mark, but it would set a personal high for hits in a season. Mangum had 101 last year. The all-time record for hits in a season was set by Adam Frazier in 2013, when he had 107.\nBefore the season started, Mangum spoke at length about wanting to bring a national championship to Starkville. The team came close in his junior season, and the sting of that loss in the College World Series has propelled Mangum to have the type of year he's enjoying now.\nMangum leads the team in batting average at .424 and is doing everything in his power to get the No. 8 Bulldogs back to Omaha. If he keeps going on his current rate and gets some of his teammates to follow suit -- as they already have -- then MSU"}

Since then oil prices have dropped to 13-year lows, and Wheeler today said he will continue to monitor the flow of economic data.\n\"Headline inflation is expected to increase over 2016, but take longer to reach the target range than previously expected,\" Wheeler said in a statement. \"Some further policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range.\"\nThe New Zealand dollar fell to 64.32 US cents from 64.71 cents immediately before the statement was released at 9am.\nLast month, the Reserve Bank forecast annual inflation rising back within the 1-to-3 percent target band in the March quarter of this year, due in part to last year's drop in oil prices washing through the data, and projected CPI would creep up to the 2 percent midpoint by December 2017.\nAt the time, Wheeler said he was done cutting interest rates with the record-low level enough to spur inflation back within the percent target band, while keeping the caveat that he would act if circumstances warranted.\nLast week's CPI figure undershot the bank's forecast, though Wheeler today said annual core inflation, which strips out temporary price movements, was within the target range, and that inflation expectations were stable. He'll get an opportunity to provide further detail about his view on the economy when he delivers his first public speech to the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce next week.\nWheeler said there were still a number of risks threatening the outlook,including the prospects for global growth and China in particular, international financial market conditions, dairy prices, the country's strong net inbound migration, and pressures in the housing market.\nWhile house price inflation was showing signs of abating since the Reserve Bank imposed lending curbs on investor-buyers and the government rolled out plans to tax property more stringently, Wheeler said it was too early to tell whether the rate of increase was moderating.\nWheeler said the recent volatility in financial markets had pushed down the kiwi dollar and market interest rates, but \"a further depreciation in the exchange rate is appropriate given the ongoing weakness in export prices.\"\nPrices for whole milk powder, the country's biggest commodity export, have remained soggy in the GlobalDairyTrade auctions this, spurring processors Fonterra Cooperative Group, Westland Milk Products and Open Country Dairy to cut their forecast payout to farmers for the season.\nThe weakness in dairy prices prompted Fitch Ratings to lower its outlook on New Zealand's sovereign credit rating to stable from positive when affirming the nation's AA rating.\nThe rating agency downgraded its forecast of New Zealand gross domestic product growth due to the downbeat agricultural outlook, putting it at odds with Bank of New Zealand economists who upgraded their forecast on the strength of recent services and manufacturing gauges.\nWheeler today said New Zealand's economy is expected to pick up this year due to persistently strong inbound"}

Here are three more.\nMovement and expression telegraph our feelings and intentions. By being still and unexpressive, you can make it impossible for others to read you, which can make people very uncomfortable if they want to know what you\u2019re going to do, how you\u2019re feeling, or what you\u2019re thinking. In gambling, we call this \u201cpoker face,\u201d making it impossible for opponents to tell if one is bluffing or not.\nAgain, many predators in the wild creep up on their prey, and become very still in the moments before they strike, making it impossible for the victim to anticipate the exact moment of the attack. How can you dodge an attack you don\u2019t see coming? Every living animal or person is a potential threat, and when we can\u2019t read their intentions, it can make us uncomfortable\u2026 unless we are equally or more of a threat to them.\nYour first instinct may be to think that yelling or speaking loudly establishes dominance, and it certainly can, but it all comes back to comfort and discomfort again. Yes, yelling can intimidate people and make them feel threatened, but so can speaking softly in the right circumstances. Loudness is the roar of the lion. Quiet is the deadly silence of the snake or shark.\nSpeaking clearly, with intention, communicates clarity of purpose, whether that purpose is sweet, aggressive, or defensive. People with purpose tend to get things done. Doing things effects change, and change can be uncomfortable for us, especially when the change may not be good for our own comfort or security.\nFew things have the power to make others uncomfortable or insecure than violating the norms, the status quo, the way things are supposed to be, if you can get away with it. Think of how powerful a crying baby is on an airplane, or a billionaire tech CEO who wears a hoodie and jeans instead of a suit in the business world.\nAlmost all of us are wilder animals than society\u2019s norms allow. If we all let our freak flags fly, the economic and lawful structures would collapse. Any opportunities to indulge in our weirdness or sadness or angst have a certain tempting appeal, even if they are damaging to ourselves or others.\nIn your scenes, if your character has status or you want to imbue status into them, look to see what rules or norms they can break and get away with. We see so many characters in TV or film who are doctors, lawyers, businesspeople, all with twisted, dark sides that are seemingly incongruous with the stereotypical qualities of their real-world counterparts. We vicariously live out our freakishness through their stories. Why else are we drawn to them? Power is magnetic.\nExperiment with these five keys to claiming status in your work, and let me know what you think, or if you have any to add, in the comments below or hit me up on social."}

It cites \u201cwidespread depression, addiction\u2026 and alarming rates of suicide\u201d as proof it\u2019s really \u201csad Western culture\u201d that is in dire need of help.\nThe scornful statement, which includes allusions to a \u201csad capitalist existential void,\u201d was printed on the website for the group, called Hizb-ut-Tahrir. It\u2019s a massive organization with branches in 40 countries and a regional chapter in Copenhagen.\nThere is no consensus in Hizb-ut-Tahrir worldwide on support or condemnation of terrorism, as both have taken place. The group is banned in Russia and some of its activities are proscribed in a number of Muslims countries.\nIts statement comes weeks after a Copenhagen municipality decided on a plan to tackle Islamic radicalism at home.\nIt plans to do this over a period of four years, with the help of external experts working under the guidance of Sweden\u2019s top expert on the matter.\nThe Sunday statements, made by group spokesman and Danish convert Junes Kock, see this as nothing but \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cdeception,\u201d as well as an attempt to polarize the Muslim community and pigeonhole it into moderate and extreme categories. Kock believes that a plan of this sort intends to take things that are the staple of Islamic life \u2013 \u201ca beard, prayer, scarf and general compliance with Islamic behavior\u201d \u2013 and label them as radical in an agenda of stigmatization.\nDespite the apparent belief that the West has invented the dangers of Islamism to split Muslims, Hizb ut-Tahrir has shown no willingness to cooperate with the more moderate members of the Muslim faith. On Sunday it rejected any Danish initiative to work together with other Muslims at preventing youths from joining up with terrorist movements.\nAs for the plans, \u201cthey are doomed to fail,\u201d according to the author of the statement.\nThe group is no small adversary: it has been active since 1953 in calls to establish a global Islamic Caliphate, although it claims not to condone violence, the way the Islamic State and other extremist groups do.\nHowever, despite its anti-violent stance, a 2002 controversy over pamphlets containing anti-Semitic messages could take on a new salience, especially now that the issue is back on the table and bigger than it has been in 70 years.\n\u201cThe Jews are a people of slander... a treacherous people... they fabricate lies and twist words from their right context,\u201d the text read. But it also went on to justify suicide bombings in Israel, calling the bombers martyrs and the acts as a \u201clegitimate\u201d response.\nThe group also recently staged a demonstration outside the national mosque in Bangladesh calling for the re-establishment of a unified Muslims Army. Members were seen celebrating the victories of the Islamic State.\nIn contrast, the group has in the past condemned both the September 11 attacks and the July 2005 London bombings on the grounds that the killing of innocents isn\u2019t the way to go about achieving one\u2019s aims."}

It also agreed to reduce royalty rates for more recent DDR2 and DDR3 DRAM to 1.5 percent from 3.5 percent during this period.\nThe U.S.-based standard-setting organization JEDEC developed an industry-wide standard for DRAM. JEDEC-compliant DRAM is used in virtually all PCs. Last year global sales of DRAM totaled $34 billion.\nThe Commission believed Rambus had intentionally concealed that it had patents and patent applications connected to DRAM chips that were relevant to technology used in the JEDEC standard, and that it claimed royalties for those patents when they should have been offered free &#8211; a practice known as patent ambushing.\nAnnouncing the Commission decision, competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said it is vital to stop what she called \"abusive practices in standard setting,\" adding that Rambus' behavior was harmful to innovation and led to higher prices for companies and consumers.\n\"The Commission will vigorously enforce the competition rules in this area, for the benefit of technical progress and European consumers,\" she said.\n\"An effective standard-setting process should take place in a non-discriminatory, open and transparent way to ensure competition on the merits and to allow consumers to benefit from technical development and innovation,\" Kroes added.\nThe Commission is in the process of settling a much bigger antitrust case against Microsoft. A final decision to accept the software giant's settlement offer is expected next Tuesday.\nIn addition to creating a level playing field for competition among Internet browsers, Microsoft is understood to have also made promises not to unfairly withhold information from companies that want to make products compatible with the word processing, spreadsheet and office management tools contained in Microsoft's Office suite of software applications.\nAs part of this probe the Commission was examining whether OOXML is sufficiently interoperable with competitors' products, and in April last year, when OOXML won ISO status, the regulator suspected foul play.\nMicrosoft was suspected of having unfairly influenced the vote by national ISO affiliates in order to secure the ISO label on OOXML.\nIt is unclear how the anticipated settlement announcement of the Microsoft case next week will deal with the questions surrounding OOXML. \"Microsoft's settlement offer in the interoperability case has addressed the main concerns other companies had, but I don't know how this specific issue has been settled,\" said one person familiar with the Commission's thinking who asked not to be named."}

Chris Christie speaks at the Statehouse this afternoon where he proposed suspending an automatic payroll increase of as much as $683 per employee which would be used to fund the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.\nTRENTON -- Looking to blunt a steep business tax increase, Republican Gov. Chris Christie today proposed reducing some unemployment benefits.\nEmployers were set to see an increase in their unemployment tax starting July 1 because the state's unemployment fund ran out of money and has been borrowing from the federal government.\nLast month, Christie said he would let the full tax kick in, but today he said he was looking to lessen the tax burden to businesses by reducing unemployment benefits.\nUnder Christie's proposal, the state would reduce the maximum weekly benefit for newly unemployed residents from $600 to $550. The governor also wants to require a one-week waiting period before benefits can be received and would require employees fired for \"misconduct\" to find other work for a prescribed period before becoming qualified again for unemployment benefits.\nThe governor's proposal needs the approval of the Democratically controlled Legislature, which he didn't have today.\nAssembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said she would support some element of Christie's plan but was concerned about unemployed residents sharing the burden of the state's money problems. Later, she issued a joint statement with Assembly Majority Leader Joe Cryan calling the plan \"ill-advised,\" and \"insensitive and unsound.\"\nSenate President Stephen M. Sweeney went further, calling the proposal a \"total nonstarter.\" He said he would not consider any legislation to decrease benefits to the unemployed.\n\"The dead of winter is no time to leave New Jersey's unemployed out in the cold,\" Sweeney said.\nOn average, employers would have seen an increase of about $400, or more than 50 percent, per employee.\nThe governor's proposed changes would have only given them an increase of about $130 per employee, or a 17 percent hike, this year and would allow companies to prepare for future increases in advance.\nChristie's proposal would enable the state to stop borrowing from the federal government in 2013, two years earlier than planned.\nChristie rigorously defended the plan today, noting that New Jersey currently has the second-highest benefit payouts in the country and that 40 other states also require a one-week waiting period before paying unemployment benefits. His plan would bump New Jersey down to the third most generous payouts.\nDemocrats note that the proposal would benefit employers who laid off workers so that they could avoid paying an increased unemployment tax. Christie said that he was afraid employers would continue to lay people off if he didn't mitigate the tax increase.\nThe business tax increase is triggered by a growing shortfall in the state's Unemployment Insurance Fund. Business taxes are increased by law when the fund's balance dips below a certain level as measured every March. Christie has said the fund will be more than $1 billion in debt by March.\nUnemployment in New Jersey climbed to a 33-year high of 10.1 percent in December \u2014 the first time since October 2006 that the Garden State's jobless rate eclipsed the national average of 10 percent.\nTotal employment in New Jersey fell to just over 3.91 million in December, with losses in both the public and private sectors.\nAccording to the governor's office, more than $4.6 billion was raided from the fund from"}

But coaches have cause for concern if the quarterback is angry. The quarterback needs all his smarts; he cannot afford the functional cortical damage caused by the mid-brain firing off the fear and anger signals. So we are going to offer here a collaborative model for the seminar.\nThe posting below, while longer than most, it offers some excellent advice on how to conduct effective seminars.. It is by Don McCormick of the University of Redlands and Michael Kahn, of the California Institute of Integral Studies. The article originally appeared in EXCHANGE: The Organizational Behavior Teaching Journal. 1987, Volume VII, Number 4. pp. 16-20. (now the Journal of Management Education at: http://jme.sagepub.com/). Reprinted with permission.\nIn the classrooms of higher education, the seminar is a puzzling phenomenon. Most teachers understand what to do with a lecture and, usually, what causes its success or failure. But the seminar is another matter. Most instructors aren't sure what a good one ought to look like, and, even if we did know, how to accomplish that. The problem is both technical and attitudinal. It seems intuitively clear that a seminar ought not to be a question-and-answer session, though often it is. Conversely, the implication is that it should be conversation among the students in which the participation is widespread and the teacher is just another participant, or else in some way a facilitator of the discussion. But what sort of conversation? Experience teaches that when it is not a question-and-answer session, it is either aimless drifting (\"just a bull-session\" in the students words) or an argument.\n\"Well,\" the reader might ask, \"what's wrong with a good argument? It keeps people on their toes, forces them to have prepared and punishes those who haven't thought through their ideas. A boxing match is fast and aggressive or it is dull. Isn't that true of an intellectual conversation, as well?\" This paper will take the position that the boxing match is not the best possible model for a seminar. \"But,\" our reader might reasonably object, \"for two hundred years the European and American tradition of education has been that students must be challenged to sharpen their thinking. They must continually test the validity of their ideas by exposing them in combat. The classroom is a dueling school in which one's most basic weapons are sharpened for the battle of life.\"\n1. The classroom battle is not a good way to teach thinking.\n2. Even if it were, it makes idea-conversation so unpleasant that students do their best to avoid it, in college and afterwards.\n3. It is a significant contribution to the building of a society of contention and enmity.\n4. And, as an alternative, there is another way to talk about ideas which obviates those difficulties.\nThe model we are about to offer is not a boxing match but rather a group of builders constructing a building together or a group of artists fabricating a creation together. Anyone who believes the old aphorism that no work of art was ever made by a committee has never attended a good jam session.\nIt is not hard to imagine why the fight model has clung so in American education.

He became cathedral canon at W\u00fcrzburg in 1629, and at Worms in 1630. In 1635 he was made provost of Kronberg and of St. Burkard at W\u00fcrzburg. On 16 August, 1642, he became Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg ( deacon, 1642; priest, 1645); on 18 November, 1647, he was made Archbishop of Mainz, and in 1663 Bishop of Worms. His foreign policy was mainly directed towards the maintenance of peace, but this policy did not always meet with approval and often failed in its object. On the other hand his administration of all domestic affairs was excellent, and as a ruler he was not below the best of his era. His contemporaries gave him the honourable titles of \"The Wise\", \"The German Solomon \", and \"The Cato of Germany \". He succeeded in repairing the injuries inflicted upon his domains by the Thirty Years' War, settled the disputes as to territory with the neighboring rulers, reorganized the higher civil service, and improved the administration of justice. To compensate for the scarcity of priests and to raise the standard of the secular clergy he called to Mainz and W\u00fcrzburg the Bartholomites, an institute founded by Bartholomew Holzhauser ( Institutum clericorum saecularium in communi viventium ); in 1654 he transferred to them the administration of the ecclesiastical seminary at W\u00fcrzburg, and in 1660 also that of the gymnasium founded by him at Munnerstadt. In 1662 he established a seminary for priests at Mainz. Urged by the Jesuit Spee, he suppressed the trial of witches in his domains, and thus contributed, as far as was in his power, to the abolition of this miserable delusion.

The damage is all done elsewhere.\nTed Cruz is pulling some Matrix-worthy moves, dodging the attacks of his colleagues as he obstinately refuses to allow logic or immediate political realities to dissuade him from his crusade (a word we made up: Cruzsade) against Obamacare. The Republican establishment keeps taking shots, and Cruz keeps dodging them, and brushing them off, and absorbing them with a grinning shrug. The damage is all done elsewhere.\nOpposition from Democrats was always expected, of course, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's evisceration of Cruz's plan on Monday didn't require any critiques from other Democrats. Instead, it relied primarily on comments from other Republicans, who called Cruz's push a variety of disparaging things: a \"box canyon,\" the \"dumbest idea ever,\" a \"suicide note.\" To which Cruz responded with the Senate floor speech equivalent of \"No, you're the dumbest idea ever.\" It was the first \"u mad bro?\" in the history of the upper chamber.\nBut like so many Agent Smiths furiously punching away at a much-faster foe, the Republican establishment keeps missing with its attempts to take Cruz down, making their situation consistently worse. According to The Washington Post, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will oppose Cruz's plan. That plan, in short, involves blocking the House continuing resolution that would fund the government until December except for costs associated with Obamcare. (Cruz wants to stall the measure so that Reid can't remove the Obamacare exception. There doesn't appear to be any next step.) Breitbart.com reports that a source suggests McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas will be trying to persuade their colleagues to join their fight. (In the GQ profile of Cruz we noted on Monday, Cornyn is depicted as being cowed by Cruz's popularity in the state they represent.) More specifically, the anonymous source says that McConnell and Cornyn are trying to get enough votes \"to shut down debate on the House continuing resolution so that Harry Reid can gut it with just 51 votes.\" Breitbart.com has been staunchly supportive of the Cruzsade.\nShot fired by Mitch McConnell. Target hit: Mitch McConnell, just in time for his primary fight.\nThese columns opposed ObamaCare before it was known by that name, and we may have even been the first to call it by that name. We also don't need any lectures about principle from the Heritage Foundation that promoted RomneyCare and the individual mandate that is part of ObamaCare. Or from cable TV pundits who sold Republicans on Mitt Romney despite RomneyCare.\nThese are only the most recent examples, of course. Speaker John Boehner, in allowing the House vote that Cruz and the conservative base demanded, was hoping to vent conservative steam. But that, too, was a misfire, empowering Cruz's fight. The 228 Republicans that voted to approve the Boehner-Cruz plan are just as culpable. The establishment decided to organize the circular firing squad and arm everyone participating, assuring them that it was the best way to muffle Cruz. And here we are.\nPart of the reason that Cruz is still bulletproof is that he still has support from the deeply, vocally conservative base. Just as Obama"}

So while you\u2019re mapping out your plans, consider all that South Korea has to offer \u2014 from all-hours malls packed with clothes and knicknacks to the best BBQ imaginable to skin care you didn\u2019t know you needed (but now can\u2019t live without).\nNestled down a picturesque path, the Sooyeon Sanbang Tea House offers an idyllic afternoon activity and way to familiarize yourself with South Korea\u2019s historic variety of teas and desserts.\nSeoul isn\u2019t necessarily a walking city, so get your steps (and leaps and climbs) in with a little rock climbing at a calm and inviting indoor gym.\nThe landmark Banpo Bridge lights up with a rainbow light and water show at night, which makes it a prime place to picnic come sunset.\nThis charming village is home to ample coffee shops and art stores nestled together alongside traditional South Korean-style homes.\nLocated smack dab in the middle of downtown, Deoksugung is a 16th-century royal palace that still puts on an elaborate Changing of the Guard ceremony several times a day.\nGet to know South Korean history through established and contemporary artists at this impressive museum. Pro tip: Walk the grounds of the back garden to round out a perfect day in Seoul.\nHome to the National Folk Museum of Korea, the grounds of this iconic tourist attraction are always bustling with locals who can often be seen wearing traditional South Korean clothing.\nHongdae is a young, hip neighborhood that stays busy around the clock. Bop around during the day for some serious local shopping, but stay for the bars, clubs, and 24-hour stores at night.\nSeoul is home of the mega mall \u2014 they\u2019re almost always busy, almost always open, and definitely not for the faint of heart (or wallet). Plus, each offers a unique shopping experience ranging from luxury to affordable and everything in between.\nYou may already be familiar with this purveyor of ultra-chic eyewear and sunglasses, but its flagship store is still a must-see in person. Its floors are always filled with out-there art installations, making your shopping experience all the more fun.\nAlready a fashion favorite, beloved shoe brand Reike Nen is known for practical yet forward-thinking silhouettes. In this one-of-a-kind shop, you can order a fresh pair sketched by designers just for you.\nYou can\u2019t leave Seoul without visiting at least one of the Stylenanda shops. The clothes and jewelry are of the moment and come in an array of styles \u2014 from minimalistic to athletic. And best of all, everything\u2019s super affordable. It\u2019s also a great spot to try out some Korean beauty products (we highly recommend the lip tattoo and highlighter).\nLocated in Dongdaemun Square near some of the biggest malls in Seoul (again, malls are a major thing), this retreat of a hotel offers a robust breakfast buffet, a state-of-the-art gym, and a lavish pool \u2014 each worth checking out.\nWelcome to the home (or, uh, mansion) of Korean BBQ done with style.

Brooks car and a Jeep driven by Redlands East Valley High School student Monique Juarez collided on Greenspot Road about a half mile east of Santa Paula Street, according to the filing. The lawsuit states that both Brooks and Juarez were driving responsibly at the time of the crash and alleges the road was not safe.\nAttorney Sarah Serpa of the Santa Ana-based law firm of Callahan & Blaine said the lawsuit names Highland, the county and Caltrans as defendants because the firm has not yet identified which agency or agencies were responsible for the part of the road where the crash happened.\n\u201cWhat we re unclear about is who owns or maintains the road,\u201d Serpa said. She said she doubts all three agencies have a responsibility to keep Greenspot Road safe.\n\u201cThey can show us why they re not responsible,\u201d Serpa said.\nHighland City Manager Sam Racadio said city officials are advised not to comment on pending litigation. San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said he could not comment as county officials have not yet been served with the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit alleges a number of safety problems on Greenspot Road, including that it did not have a safe shoulder, was too narrow and had pavement damage. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of being negligent by not repairing the alleged problems before the crash.\nThe lawsuit was filed by Brooks parents, James and Wendy Brooks of Dana Point, and her sister, Yucaipa resident Sharman Brooks. Through the lawsuit, the family seeks to recover funeral and medical expenses as well as an undetermined amount of damages.\nThe family s funeral and medical expenses would be \u201cnegligible compared to the amount we will be seeking for the loss of (Jennifer Lyne Brook s) care, comfort and society,\u201d Serpa said.\nAlthough Racadio was not at liberty to discuss the case, he said the city is working on a plan to improve safety along the curvy section of Greenspot Road where the crash that killed Brooks occurred. Racadio said the city has secured funding for the work, though the plans have yet to receive environmental approval.\n\u201cThe project would be to straighten that turn out a little more so it s not so severe,\u201d Racadio said.\nThe city is prepared to pay for the effort \u2013 at a cost of about $500,000 \u2013 during the 2006-07 fiscal year, Racadio said. However, endangered species such as the San Bernardino kangaroo rat live in the area, so the project must first be approved by agencies including U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Game. Environmental approval could take a year to 18 months.\nGreenspot Road has also received recent attention because of the traffic death of Ashlee Marron, a 20-year-old Highland resident who died in a Jan. 8 car crash near the intersection of Greenspot Road and Weaver Street.

{"idx": "30335", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It does not seem too difficult for evolutionists to imagine that one species of life gradually adapted and changed into a different species of life. But the truth is, scientists simply cannot produce the evidence necessary to prove their hypothesis.\nThe truth is, everywhere you look, without exception, the universe provides the evidence of a supreme Designer\u2014a Creator. A universe this vast, and at the same time so intricately balanced according to so many complex natural laws, could not happen by accident.\nThis article will demonstrate another outstanding proof for the fact of creation. Scientists have primarily concentrated on the ability of living things to evolve into higher creatures able to survive on Earth. Let\u2019s examine the fact that water, the primary non-living substance on Earth, has been perfectly designed to fit the needs of all living creatures.\nBeing inorganic, water could not have evolved. Yet it has many unique properties or \u201cexceptions\u201d to nature\u2019s rules that are absolutely essential to life on Earth. In addition, as we shall see, water has many characteristics that can reveal the \u201cinvisible things\u201d of God\u2014 even His eternal power\u2014if we are willing to accept such knowledge (Rom. 1:18-22).\nWater, in its solid form\u2014ice\u2014and in its liquid form, covers about 70 percent of Earth\u2019s surface. Oceans and lakes are able to store up the heat of the sun during the summer and slowly release that heat during the winter, helping to moderate the temperatures and climate of the Earth year round.\nThe Bible says that \u201cblood is the life\u201d of man (Deut. 12:23), but did you know that water constitutes about 92 percent of blood? Since most living things consist primarily of water, once the supply of water is removed, death is certain to speedily follow.\nWater is a liquid between 32\u00baF (its freezing point) and 212\u00baF (its boiling point). No other common substance is found in liquid form at such a wide range of ordinary temperatures\u2014temperatures found in most places on Earth. If water behaved like most of its closest relatives, no liquid water would be found on Earth\u2014it would have all changed to steam or water vapor. Think about it: Most other liquid substances are not found naturally. They are man-made substances that must be refined and purified by a designer or manufacturer.\nWhen we understand nature\u2019s \u201cwater cycle\u201d whereby heat and wind cause water to evaporate, rise into the clouds, cool down and then precipitate as rain or snow, we realize that a Designer made a continuous source of fresh \u201cpurified\u201d water.\nPerhaps the most unusual quality of water is what happens when it cools. Most substances contract as they grow colder, but when water reaches 39\u00baF, it begins to expand. By the time the temperature reaches 32\u00ba and forms into ice, it reaches its maximum volume. Because water expands when it freezes, it weighs less than the liquid water around it. That is why ice floats to the top of oceans and lakes. That layer of ice actually insulates the water below from the cold, preventing it from freezing to ever greater depths. Eskimos recognize the insulating qualities of ice and build igloos out of ice to protect themselves from the extreme arctic temperatures. Farmers have learned to use this principle by spraying plants with water just before a cold front hits. The resulting ice insulates the plants at a temperature of 32\u00ba and actually protects the plant from more severe temperature drops.\nIf water contracted when it froze, ice would weigh more than liquid water, and sink."}

{"idx": "30345", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: As any parent can likely attest, having kids and starting a family changes your life on so many levels, and on others, not so much. For Kate Tangney, 34, having two kids meant taking a break from her art to be a stay-at-home mom for roughly 10 years. But for the Braintree resident, the passion to create never waned, so in 2015 she returned to art and started posting her distinct and meticulously crafted acrylic work on her page @katetangneystudio.\nQ. Right off the bat, I noticed that your artwork has a very clear and consistent aesthetic. How did you develop this style of painting?\nA. When I started out, I actually started as a hand letterer, and I started painting just as a way to make backgrounds for my hand lettering. I had seen so many posts online of people that were doing watercolor backgrounds, but I wanted something a little more bold. I started experimenting with acrylics in order to make backgrounds for the lettering, and once I started painting I wanted to get deeper into that. It was kind of like my gateway into doing abstract work. I think a lot of the detail work I do on top of the acrylics comes from that history of doing lettering on top of the acrylic backgrounds.\nQ. What made you want to return to art after so many years?\nA. Creative work has been something I\u2019ve always really been drawn to, and after having kids I started drawing with them. Getting back into creative endeavors with my kids made me realize how much I missed doing my own work. That, and seeing so many other artists on [Instagram] really made me feel like I wanted to be involved in that world again.\nQ. When it comes to your more abstract work, do you plan ahead or do you figure it out in the moment?\nA. I think when I started, I definitely planned out my paintings a lot more, but as I\u2019ve gotten more experienced in making abstract art I\u2019ve been approaching it more intuitively. My recent paintings are much more emotive, and they\u2019re much more in-the-moment when I\u2019m painting them. Each mark draws from the one that I made before, and it\u2019s much more centered on emotion than it is on planning.\nQ. What kinds of emotions do you channel into your work?\nA. Really anything that I\u2019m feeling at the time, and I think that that\u2019s something people really connect with in terms of abstract work in particular. You may not see a representational form, but a lot of times the emotion still comes through. If I\u2019m having a day that\u2019s especially anxious, then I go paint something that\u2019s a little more frenetic. A lot of times, if I\u2019m feeling really content, then I might do something with a softer color palette and that\u2019s really free-flowing. It just really depends on what I\u2019m feeling at the time, but I think that\u2019s the beauty of abstract work: You can take whatever you\u2019re feeling and just throw it at the canvas.\nQ. When do know a painting is done?\nA. That is a really tricky question, as that\u2019s something I still struggle with. As time goes on and as I paint more, I\u2019ve realized that there is usually a point where if you keep going, you\u2019re going to lose a lot of the negative space and the breathing space and you\u2019re just going to overwork it. It\u2019s more of a feeling of looking at the painting and seeing if the marks are coming through, seeing if there is enough negative space, and actually making"}

To strengthen his position, Evers plans to count on the roughly $180 million a year in his first state budget, forcing Republicans to find ways to replace it or cut an equal amount.\nExit polls showed health care was the top issue for voters who elected Evers over Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who long opposed taking the federal money to expand Medicaid. Both Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin made health care and their support for Medicaid expansion central to their winning campaigns.\n\"The politics of this are very bad for anyone who wants to stand in the way right now,\" said Robert Kraig, director of the health care advocacy group Citizen Action of Wisconsin. \"Evers understands the public is with us.\"\nDemocratic state Rep. Jimmy Anderson, who was paralyzed after a car crash that killed his parents and younger brother, said Evers' statewide tour will increase pressure on Republicans.\n\"It's ultimately going to be whether Republicans think it's a priority to provide health care to Wisconsinites or not,\" Anderson said.\nWisconsin is in the minority of states in refusing to take the money. Walker rejected it in 2014 and instead did a partial Medicaid expansion. Thirty-five states have taken the money, and voters in three others approved the expansion in the November election.\nRepublicans show no sign of bending. They have controlled the Wisconsin Legislature the past eight years and will for at least two more.\n\"Not going to happen. No way. Never,\" Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told reporters in October. His spokeswoman said after the election that it was not a priority.\nRepublican lawmakers and Walker have been united against accepting the federal money, which has meant Wisconsin missed out on $1.1 billion since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\nVos has said his concern is that Medicaid doesn't currently all the costs incurred by the medical provider, so putting more people on the program will only increase the private sector cost to subsidize the program.\nRepublicans have also voiced concerns about the federal government not fulfilling its funding promise for Medicaid, leaving states to pick up a larger percentage of the costs.\nThis year the Legislature passed a reinsurance bill , signed by Walker, requiring legislative sign-off before the money can be taken, tying Evers' hands as he prepares to take office in January. That program is designed to lower premium costs for people buying insurance on the private marketplace. It takes effect in 2019.\nThe Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 and signed into law by then-President Barack Obama provided states with federal money to pay for expanding Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 in households with an income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or $16,753 for a single person and $34,638 for a family of four.\nWisconsin did a partial expansion of Medicaid in 2014.

The biggest star connected with the project is producer Charles Dutton of \"Roc\" and Broadway fame, who does not appear on camera.\nBut \"Laurel Avenue,\" which airs at 10 tonight and tomorrow night on cable, is the miniseries that people will be talking about this summer. It presents a slice of African-American family life featuring the most complex and interesting black characters ever seen in prime time. And Dutton & Co. make it look so easy, you have to wonder why it took the TV industry more than 40 years to do it.\nThere's nothing flashy about \"Laurel Avenue.\" Its focus is severalgenerations of a black, working-class family in St. Paul, Minn., the Arnetts. The two-part film takes viewers inside the lives of members of the Arnett family for a weekend -- starting Friday afternoon and ending Monday morning.\nAt the center of the family are Jake and Maggie Arnett (played by Mel Winkler and Mary Alice), a fiftyish couple with a big, spacious house that serves as the emotional center for several generations of Arnetts.\nJake and Maggie share the house with two of their children -- Keith (Scott Lawrence), a high school basketball coach, and Sheila (Malinda Williams), a 16-year-old high school student -- as well as with their cranky old Uncle Otis (Jay Brooks).\nMuch of tonight's story involves two of Maggie's daughters from previous marriage -- Yolanda (Juanita Jennings) and Rolanda (Rhonda Stubbins White).\nYolanda, who has a white husband, is a St. Paul police officer about to be promoted to sergeant. Rolanda is a recovering drug addict whose recovery suddenly isn't going so well after a visit from her physically abusive ex-husband. Her 15-year-old son, Rushan (Vonte Sweet), is slipping into the world of drugs himself as a low-level, street-corner peddler; and she has a sweet, 5-year-old daughter, Shanequa (Ondrea Shalbetter), whose innocence makes the physical abuse and drugs seem all the more awful.\nThere are no easy answers in \"Laurel Avenue.\"\nAs Jake is driving Rolanda to a job interview, for example, he gives her a pep talk about persistance, hanging in there and never giving up. And just when you start believing in the wisdom and the power of Jake's middle-class platitudes intended to inspire Rolanda to get her life back on track, the camera shows her coming apart at the seams emotionally and spiritually.\nThe miniseries is very much about Jake's middle-class values. And although Dutton uses the term working-class to describe the Arnetts, some of them have made it into the middle class.\nCentral to the film's drama is the struggle to move from the working class into a middle class. One of the things that makes \"Laurel Avenue\" so refreshing is that, unlike most of prime-time TV, it refuses to act as if there are no class distinctions or barriers to upward mobility for anyone willing to work. There are plenty, and the miniseries acknowledges them.\n\"Laurel Avenue\" is a rich, complicated and uneven work. One minute, it's at the level of TV soap opera with"}

The agency is so flush with marketing dollars that it also spent $100,000 for a dozen freshly painted murals across the state, most of which have nothing directly to do with health insurance enrollment.\nCovered California\u2019s marketing riches contrast starkly with the advertising budget for the federal health insurance exchange, healthcare.gov. The feds have slashed ad dollars to $10 million, down from $100 million last year.\nThe huge discrepancy reflects conflicting attitudes toward the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, said Gerald Kominski, director at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\nOther healthcare experts say marketing is not the best use of money now that the exchanges are a known commodity, especially in California. They suggest the dollars could be better used for things such as reducing premiums.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of taxpayer money,\u201d said Sally Pipes, the president and CEO of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco, which advocates for free-market policies.\nCalifornia is one of 11 states, plus the District of Columbia, that operate their own health insurance exchanges. The remaining 39 states use the federal healthcare.gov site.\nIn addition to cutting its ad budget, the federal government reduced grants for \u201cnavigators,\u201d individuals and organizations that help people enroll, to $37 million, down from $63 million last year. Covered California will devote $6.5 million to navigators. It\u2019s not a perfect measure, but judging purely by population, these investments in navigators do not seem significantly different.\nAltogether, Covered California plans to spend $111.5 million on marketing in 2017-18, which includes navigators, ads, staff salaries and more.\nCovered California leaders and consumer health advocates say the agency\u2019s sizable marketing budget is necessary because of recent federal moves to undercut the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration shortened the enrollment period to 45 days in most states and stopped paying insurers to provide a subsidy that helps many low-income consumers with their out-of-pocket medical costs.\n\u201cIt sounds like a lot \u2026 but it\u2019s a very legitimate expenditure,\u201d said Betsy Imholz, director of special projects for Consumers Union.\nThe federal government\u2019s $10-million investment in advertising is \u201cridiculously inadequate\u201d by comparison, she said. Covered California will spend that amount on online ads alone.\nThere have been so many policy flip-flops in Washington, and so much misinformation, that some people may be confused about whether the law is even in place anymore, she said.\nTheir confusion is magnified by the fact that consumers nationwide may be served by different Obamacare exchanges with different rules.\nFor instance, Californians who purchase their individual insurance through Covered California or on the open market will have three months, until Jan. 31, 2018, to enroll in plans for next year. People who purchase their plans through healthcare.gov have until Dec. 15.\nEd Haislmaier"}

And the criticism flows both ways.\nU.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has said the office for civil rights in the Education Department, led by Lhamon, was overreaching in its approach to investigating and enforcing civil rights.\nUnder DeVos\u2019 leadership, the Education Department has halted the previous administration\u2019s practice of regularly expanding probes into individual civil rights complaints to look for larger, systemic violations. Early in her tumultuous tenure, DeVos joined Attorney General Jeff Sessions in rescinding Obama-era guidance on the rights of transgender students, and she recently said she plans to re-examine the previous administration\u2019s guidance on sexual assault.\nLhamon is now the chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, an independent agency charged with advising Congress and the president. The commission voted in June to launch a two-year investigation into civil rights practices at several federal agencies under the Trump administration, including the Education Department.\nIn Lhamon\u2019s time at the office for civil rights, the agency took a highly public role and investigated a record number of complaints.\nWhat\u2019s your response to this criticism, and why did you consider this systemic approach important?\nI think the only way to do effective civil rights enforcement, which is OCR\u2019s congressional charge, is to use the expertise of the staff related to civil rights ... as well as the kinds of fact patterns that can come up to evaluate whether civil rights have been violated. The statutory and regulatory charge for the office for civil rights is to act whenever the office has information that civil rights may have been violated. Typically, if the office received a complaint or otherwise opens an investigation into a particular issue, the office is examining whether there was particular animus toward a single student or a lack of information about civil rights law as it applies to a class of students.\nWe saw it over and over again. If one student had not had, for example, a manifestation determination [a required assessment schools do before disciplining a student with disabilities to determine if that student\u2019s misbehavior stems from their disability] ...typically that was because the school didn\u2019t know that it should conduct such an [assessment]. It means that it had not only not done it for that student, but it had [also] not done it for the whole class of students like that student at that school. If you get a correction only for the one student who knew to complain to OCR, you are failing to satisfy Congress\u2019 charge to protect civil rights for all students.\nA conservative critic recently criticized the systemic approach. He pointed out some cases for which you ended up finding that there wasn\u2019t something worth penalizing the school for the individual complaint but you uncovered something in systemic data, like racially disparate rates of suspensions. He argued that maybe that was inappropriate. If the individual complaint is resolved without you taking any action, then why should you take action on broader issues?\nI think that is an astounding criticism in its historicity and its failure to understand the reason for having federal civil rights enforcement.\nIt is a good thing every time the office can identify lack of violation of civil rights, and that is worth celebrating. It is also the case that the office employs close to 600 staff who have singular expertise with respect to civil rights and who follow the updates in the law, changes in statute, changes in court interpretations, and the wide variety of fact patterns that can take place for students in school.

The program includes: 1) approximately 1,555m of drilling in four drill holes to test new, high-value targets in the Buena Vista-Meagher Corridor and the Virgin deposit footwall; and 2) commencing work on an initial resource estimate in accordance with NI 43-101 for the Virgin deposit (refer to Lewis plan map at https://goldstandardv.com/lp/lewis-mar21-2019-drillmaps/).\nThe Lewis Project was acquired by Gold Standard as part of its purchase of Battle Mountain Gold (see June 14, 2017 news release). The large (5,340 acre) mineral property has several known mineralized zones and potential for new gold and silver discoveries, while sharing a common boundary with Newmont Mining Corporation's Phoenix open pit mine, one of the most prolific gold-copper-silver producers on the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend. The Phoenix Mine is likely to be included in the newly formed Barrick-Newmont Nevada Joint Venture.\nJonathan Awde, CEO and Director of Gold Standard commented: \"In our view, Lewis has strategic value to the neighboring Phoenix Mine by contributing additional gold resources, and based upon permitted pit boundaries provides Phoenix the room it needs to increase its pit size and access more of its own ore. Our aim in this program is to enhance this strategic value.\"\nTwo drill holes will target favorable Antler Sequence host rocks along the north-northwest striking Buena Vista-Meagher corridor, a strong gravity gradient coming out of Newmont's Phoenix open pit mine. This is a new target not previously tested by other operators.\nTwo holes will test for eastern, shallow oxide extensions to the Virgin deposit approximately 700m north of the Phoenix open pit mine. The holes are designed to test Antler Sequence host rocks where northwest-striking faults intersect the Virgin fault corridor, immediately north of historic intercepts of 24m of 1.20 g Au/t in drill hole MAD-45 and 44.2m of 0.88 g Au/t and 17.3 g Ag/t in drill hole MAD-74*.\nAn initial NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate will be completed for the Virgin deposit. The Virgin gold-silver deposit consists of higher-grade, gold-silver bearing structures surrounded by disseminated mineralization within a zone measuring approximately 600m long, 120m wide and 180m deep. The Virgin fault is a control for mineralization within the Phoenix mine and both structural control and mineralization continue northward along it onto Gold Standard's project. Drilling by a previous operator within the Virgin deposit (Madison Minerals 2002 - 2008) generated the following results including: 21m of 7.93 g Au/t and 64.3 g Ag"}

{"idx": "30360", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: With her sensitive, astute compositions about interior revelations, Mary Oliver made herself one of the most beloved poets of her generation.\nWith her consistent, shimmering reverence for flora and fauna, Oliver made herself one of the most beloved poets of her generation. She worked in the Romantic tradition of Wordsworth or Keats, but she also infused a distinctly American loneliness into her words\u2014the solitary reflections of Thoreau gazing over a lake, or of Whitman peering from the Brooklyn Ferry at the shuffling tides below his feet. Hers were not poems about isolation, though, but about pushing beyond your own sense of emotional quarantine, even when you feel fear. Everywhere you look, in Oliver\u2019s verse, you find threads of connectivity. In \u201cThe Fish,\u201d in which she reflects on eating the first fish she ever caught, perhaps when she was a child growing up in Maple Heights, Ohio, she writes, \u201cI am the fish, the fish / glitters in me; we are / risen, tangled together, certain to fall / back to the sea.\u201d The affinity she felt for the animal kingdom was something more than a banal idea of \u201coneness\u201d; it was about the mutual acknowledgement of pain. Whatever the fish felt at his moment of death, Oliver assumed, she, too, would feel. And together they would both become part of the infinite churn.\nOliver rarely discussed it, but she escaped a dark childhood. She told Maria Shriver, who interviewed her for a special poetry issue of Oprah magazine, in 2011, that she was sexually abused as a child. \u201cI was very little,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I had recurring nightmares; there\u2019s damage.\u201d We are just now starting to have broader cultural conversations about women\u2019s trauma, about how so many women move through the world with heavy burdens. But for more than five decades Oliver gave voice to the process of confronting one\u2019s dark places, of peering underneath toadstools and into stagnant ponds. And, when she looked there, she found forgiveness. She found grace. She found that she was allowed to love the world. When she writes, in her poem \u201cWhen Death Comes,\u201d \u201cI want to say all my life / I was a bride married to amazement,\u201d she tells us that wonder has to be earned. Marriages are hard work; they take nurturing and constant vigilance. By comparing herself to a bride, she yoked herself to being amazed; she gave herself the lifelong assignment, however difficult, of looking up.\nWhen Oliver died, the first thing that I felt, after sadness, was a kind of roiling anger at her critics, who dogged her throughout her lifetime. To her credit, Oliver did not seem much to mind. She rarely gave interviews, and they were invariably gracious and urbane and free of bitterness. As one of her former students wrote on Twitter, \u201cshe didn\u2019t even like the phone or attention.\u201d But the critics were there, calling her poetry simplistic, her verse plain. In the Times, in 2011, David Orr wrote, of her work, \u201cone can only say that no animals appear to have been harmed in the making of it\u201d; he added, referring to Oprah\u2019s poetry issue, which prominently featured Oliver, if poetry \u201cworked as self-help, you\u2019d see more poets driving BMWs.\u201d Despite her numerous accolades\u2014the National Book Award, in 1992; the Pulitzer, in 1984\u2014the Times did not publish"}

Current vaccination rates in the U.S. hover around 91%.\nA 1998 study claimed to show a link between autism and vaccines, but the study has long been discredited. Two decades of research have shown vaccines do not cause autism or other side effects in healthy children.\nThe percentage of Americans who believe vaccines are unsafe does appear to be falling, however. A 2011 poll showed that 18% of Americans believe that vaccines can cause autism.\nDirector of political research at Pew Research Center Carroll Doherty said that many of the misconceptions about the safety of vaccines appear to come from ignorance of the science behind inoculations, particularly among those who aren\u2019t aware of the recent outbreak.\n\u201cPeople who haven\u2019t been following this debate, they are very high in either saying they\u2019re not safe, or they don\u2019t know,\u201d Doherty said."}

How do you think someone could be as successful as him without being as smart as him? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\nDo what you are passionate about. Without passion, your work is not your love and you can never be your best or be better than others who are running with their passion.\nDo something that you are inherently good or talented at. We all have our relative talents but spending your life doing something that is inherently more difficult puts you at a disadvantage to other more talented people.\nDo something that creates value and can be sold into a market present or future. Creating a widget that nobody but you wants may be self satisfying, but it certainly is not going to make you your fortune nor lead you to personal or professional success.\nNotice that money is not an ingredient in any of these factors nor is intelligence. Admittedly, higher intelligence makes some fields (maybe rockets for example) easier to learn, but by and large these ingredients are never a major factor in success. If you combine these three elements into your pursuits in life, you will be very successful and the money will come on its own. Money is a reflection of the true value that you are creating.\nHow does this relate to Elon Musk? When he came to me in 2001, he knew nothing of rockets or space exploration but he was deeply passionate about them. In fact, he was so passionate about the need to \u2018make humanity a multi-planetary species\u2019 that he was willing to spend a very large portion of his fortune on it. But because he was intelligent, he knew that he needed rockets to launch probes into space. To prolong his money supply, he needed to buy the cheapest rockets available. Hence his interest in Russian launch vehicles. Once he understood the space market a bit better, he saw that there was also an enormous opportunity to disrupt the launch vehicle market. He was thus led to the conclusion that his time and money might be better spent \u2018solving the launch problem\u2019 as he put it back then, than \u2018throwing away my fortune in some Russian warehouse\u2019.\nSpaceX was born after Elon spent some time with John Garvey (a co-founder of my new company Vector) who was building amateur liquid launch vehicles in his garage at the time. While this seemed like an insane endeavor and John\u2019s neighbors worried about him, Elon saw the brilliance in it and decided that John\u2019s small rockets were an existence proof of something much bigger. Elon knew that if a small band of Space Cowboys like John could build a 30 foot tall liquid rocket with left over beer money and regular machine tools, great things were possible with big money, a great team and lots of hard work. This is where SpaceX was born.\nSpaceX was not an obvious success in the early days. Clearly Elon and the team he recruited were passionate about building a low cost launcher. Clearly we were good at it. And clearly there was a market. However, most of the world was betting against Elon from the outside. This skepticism was born of a bit of conceit on the part of the big aerospace concerns who thought that \u2018nobody can do better than us and especially not a band of Space Cowboys like SpaceX\u2019. There were also questions of Elon\u2019s motivations and basic honesty brought up by the skeptics. Others in the industry confided in me at the time that they thought Elon was fundamentally dishonest and making promises that he couldn't keep.\nI left SpaceX"}
{"idx": "30369", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: PRINCETON, NJ -- One in four Americans now say they are supporters of the Tea Party. This is down from 2010, but support has been fairly stable since late 2011. The percentage of Americans classifying themselves as Tea Party opponents is slightly higher now than it was in 2010. The lower support for the Tea Party reflects the group's more limited impact in primary election contests this midterm election year, compared with its major role in 2010.\nThe latest update is from Gallup's Sept. 4-7 Governance survey. The Tea Party came into national prominence in 2010, when its supporters were widely credited with helping elect candidates they supported to Congress. Support among Americans was 30% or higher in a number of polls in 2010 and the first part of 2011, but began to drop later that year. It reached a low of 21% in two late 2011 surveys, followed by a slight recovery in 2012. After declining slightly in three surveys in 2013 and early 2014, support then edged up to 24% in surveys conducted in May and September of this year. Thirty-one percent of Americans now classify themselves as Tea Party opponents -- by one percentage point, the highest opposition level Gallup has measured -- leaving about 44% of Americans who are neither supporters nor opponents, or who do not answer the question.\nTea Party opponents feel more strongly about their position than do supporters. More than half say they are \"strong opponents,\" while less than half of supporters say they are \"strong supporters.\" This pattern has been evident to one degree or the other since 2011.\nThe Tea Party movement's major influence has been within the Republican Party, particularly in terms of Republican primaries. Eight in 10 Tea Party supporters in the September survey are Republicans or lean toward the Republican Party, with the rest divided between independents and Democrats.\nGallup has asked about Tea Party support in five surveys conducted over the past year, consisting of more than 6,000 interviews, with 18% of adults in that large sample saying they are Tea Party Republicans, 25% who are Republicans who do not support the Tea Party, and 58% who are not Republicans.\nOverall, 77% of Tea Party Republicans are conservative, including 28% who say they are very conservative. That presents a sharp contrast with the 52% of non-Tea Party Republicans who are conservative, including only 10% who classify themselves as very conservative.\nDemographically, 31% of Tea Party Republicans are men aged 50 and older, compared with 21% of other Republicans. Tea Party Republicans are also more likely to be married. There are only minor differences between the two groups of Republicans in terms of region and education. Republicans overall are much more likely than other Americans to be non-Hispanic whites, as are Tea Party Republicans, 86% of whom are white.\nTea Party support is down from where it was at the time of the last midterm elections in 2010, although it has remained relatively stable over the last year or two -- while opposition is up from 2010. These trends may help explain the diminished impact of the Tea Party in 2014 Republican primary elections this year, and could mean the Tea Party will have less of an impact in the forthcoming November general elections.\nMost Tea Party supporters are Republicans, and within the Republican Party"}

He found out his credit score wasn\u2019t high enough for the funding he needed to purchase the property from the Albany County Land Bank.\nSmith is one of many people who look to purchase property from the land bank, which has taken over control of hundreds of blighted properties, but later find they lack the finances or the resources to make them an eligible applicant.\nMany of the properties the land bank has acquired are in the most economically distressed neighborhoods, like Arbor Hill, West Hill and the South End in Albany. Those areas coincide with the discriminatory practices of the 1930s New Deal era of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which \"redlined\" areas that the American government deemed unsafe for investment \u2014 which were typically racially diverse, urban neighborhoods.\nRecognizing the redlining that has contributed to the blight, coupled with the hurdles many people still face when buying a home, the land bank\u2019s Equitable Ownership Pilot Program was born. It seeks to connect low- to moderate-income families with training and mentorship to help them navigate the home buying and renovation process from start to finish, encouraging home ownership in neighborhoods that are primarily rentals.\nThe program aims to pair applicants with a mentor and resources to guide them through purchasing and rehabilitating a home in economically distressed neighborhoods.\nRequirements: Be a first-time home buyer whose household income is equal to, or at 50 percent to 70 percent of the area median income for Albany County. Applicants must live in or be willing to relocate to the program areas where homes are available through the program. Home ownership training courses also will be required.\nProgram benefits: 15 percent discount off list price, or seller's concession of equal value, reduced closing costs and connection to resources and specialists for guidance on purchase and rehabilitation of the property.\nExperts say these past practices have been key factors in continued racial segregation, intergenerational poverty and the wealth gap between whites and other racial groups.\nZaranko hopes the pilot program will help address the home ownership gap by pairing applicants with mentors and resources that will guide them through the purchase and rehabilitation of a home, while also requiring education courses on home ownership.\nEducation is key to increasing home ownership in the most economically distressed communities, which often have mostly people of color living there.\nThere\u2019s the down payment, closing costs, lawyer fees and possibly costs for rehabilitating the property as well as planning for emergency costs, like a broken furnace or leaky roof.\nBefore the land bank\u2019s pilot program, there was the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development with the Albany Housing Authority. The program helps families who rent save up money to use as a down payment for a home or to use for other goals. It also requires individuals to take finance and other classes.\nYet, of the 4,500 people eligible for this path to home ownership, or some other independence goal, only 221 are part of the program and only 19 of 2,500 are taking advantage of the ability to use their Section 8 voucher to make mortgage payments, Longo said.\n"}

Perhaps good journalists, intuitive and ambitious journalists, might figure out how to survive this Darwinian state of media evolution on their own. Others may need the help of early risk-takers and success stories before being able to individually adapt to the socialization of content.\nMy contemplative discussion with Walt explored the missteps of publishers and content producers and the corresponding opportunity for savvy individuals with relevant perspective combined with online social prowess. The persistent reverberation of those ideas in my head in the weeks to follow the exchange led me to explore the impact of the Statusphere on the authority of the blogosphere, as measured today. And it serves as my outline today.\nWhether it\u2019s newspapers, television shows, or online mediums and networks, the shift is in consumption behavior, quality, relevance, and personality, not the production or distribution of content per se.\nSo what of those brilliantly articulate, passionate, and scintillating writers whom we identify, admire and connect with in each article they share?\nIt\u2019s not unlike the renaissance currently underway in the music industry. Artists are discovering that they have a Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channel to reach fans and cultivate relationships. Those in touch with technology and the cultures of online societies can bypass traditional music production and distribution altogether.\nI guess I\u2019m saying that at a time when traditional routes to journalism careers are being questioned, exceptional journalists can create their own destiny. Their future is in their notepads (or laptops), ready to escape from paper to online and the real world.\nThe connection with readers, once established, multiplied, and fed, is seductive and unquenchable.\nPersonality, motivation, determination, and the ability to embrace risk and venture into unchartered and unpredictable territory is the only way to champion change and influence the direction of professional adventures.\nBelieve it or not, in the overall theatrical production playing out as the world watches media Darwinism unfold, in the end it really doesn\u2019t matter whether or not newspapers survive. We are witnessing and building the future of media production and associated connections right here, right now.\nAdvertising in newspapers as well as print and broadcast media in general is spiraling irrecoverably without any hope of salvation. Subscriptions are evaporating and quickly eroding the supporting infrastructure for printing and delivering paper publications.\nThe Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer have shuttered their print businesses and they\u2019re not alone. These industry staples are merely the first to topple, triggering a domino effect that will resonate and replicate worldwide. Newspapers are swinging the axe and cutting staffs as though they were invading hordes while many are also reducing their publishing frequency. The rich and influential 200 year-old history that defines the legacy of independent media empires is now writing its next chapter for the history books. The still-powerful empires of print media will become a footnote in the future of all published media as the much younger, 15 year-old online medium competes for limited advertising revenue.\nAccording to Paper Cuts, a Web site tracking the newspaper industry, more than 120 newspapers in the U.S. have closed since January 2008 and at least 21,000 jobs at 67 newspapers have vanished. I\u2019m sure that the number is much more dramatic now.\nTo get a real time glimpse into the bloodshed, The MediaisDying on Twitter also maintains a running public account of all media properties as they announce layoffs, closures, and firings"}

The Internet isn't sure that reconstructing the raid through tweets was the best idea. However you remember that day, here are some things to keep in mind.\nAl-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden speaks to a selected group of reporters in the mountains of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan in 1998. It has been five years since he was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.\nIn May 2011, Osama bin Laden was killed by a team of Navy SEALs in Abbotabad, Pakistan. To mark five years since the death of the man whose terrorist network carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, the CIA posted a series of tweets re-creating the raid.\n\"[Trapani] noted that the CIA has done postings to mark other historical events, including the Glomar operation, Argo, U-2 shootdown, and the evacuation of Saigon.\"\n\"Of course there is relief that an evil mastermind cannot commit acts of terror in the future. But is it ever a good idea \u2014 from a spiritual or philosophical standpoint \u2014 to celebrate with beer and good cheer over the death of anyone, even a widely acknowledged monster?\"\nHe noted that a popular status on Facebook that day was a quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"I've never wished a man dead, but I have read some obituaries with great pleasure.\"\nThe raid, approved by U.S. officials on April 29, began in the early morning of May 2 in Pakistan (still the afternoon of May 1 on the U.S. East Coast). President Obama addressed the nation to announce the al-Qaida leader's death about 10 hours after the helicopters left Afghanistan bound for Pakistan.\n\"A government official told reporters that the body of Osama Bin Laden was buried at sea from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson, an aircraft carrier, in the north Arabian Sea. The official said the body was washed in accordance to Islamic practices and a religious verse was read and translated into Arabic. The body was placed on a flat board and tipped.\"\nJournalist Peter Bergen outlined the search for bin Laden in his 2012 book, Manhunt. On Fresh Air, Bergen told Dave Davies that the U.S. used classic forms of human intelligence to zero in on bin Laden's location, tracking a Kuwaiti courier and watching the compound's clotheslines to figure out who was living there. The Senate Intelligence Committee has challenged the CIA's claim that enhanced interrogation techniques helped locate bin Laden, as The Two-Way has reported.\nAnother fascinating aspect to all of this is the story of bin Laden himself and of the organization he built, al-Qaida. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly wrote a profile of how bin Laden went from \"the pampered son of a Saudi millionaire to the world's most-wanted terrorist.\" Daniel Benjamin, then the State Department's point man on terrorism issues, told Mary Louise that bin Laden's success lay in casting his agenda as religious rather than political, and combining that with the fundraising skills to finance his goals.\n\"So he really reshaped the struggle. He's managed to create both an authentic cause, an authentic ideology, and to find the means to carry it out,\" Benjamin said. \"And I fear that the path that he hewed, he cut,"}

The heirs property was purchased from the Matthew and Teena Jones Family LLC.\n\"No one is in the shoes we are walking in, and we want to see justice. ... No one should be treated like we have been treated,\" said Thelma Byas, 69, who has lived at 125 William Hilton Parkway her whole life.\nAccording to meeting minutes from Town Council's May 18, 2010, meeting, Ferguson made the motion for council to execute a contract to purchase the land from the LLC for $4 million -- or more than $690,000 per acre -- using proceeds from a 2010 land-acquisition bond sale. The motion passed unanimously.\nFerguson said if he had known these families would be evicted, he never would have voted for the purchase.\nTown staff members told him those on the land \"were all in agreement to sell the property. I found out later on that was not the case,\" he said.\nFerguson said during council's April 5 meeting it was a \"sad state of affairs in 2011 if we don't like black people, we buy them out and kick them off\" their land.\nThe LLC secured a loan against proceeds from the sale to help pay to relocate those on the property who can't afford the move otherwise, including non-heirs. But some on the property said they are skeptical of receiving money from the LLC and wanted money from the town to help move.\nA judge already has signed off on settlements for four people living on one parcel -- three received $9,000 to $12,000 to vacate, remove mobile homes and relinquish any interest in the land. A fourth owning an unoccupied mobile home on the property could not be reached by a court-appointed receiver, according to records. Some have already moved, Brown said.\nSettlements are still being worked out for those living on the other parcel, Brown said. They have until July 6 to leave.\n\"Our position is, all settlements need to be fair and come out of the proceeds of the sale. We were approached by the family and the majority of the heirs were seeking a sale. We did not go to them, they came to us,\" said town manager Steve Riley. \"And the sale was made based on the assurances that there was a relocation plan in place by the LLC.\"\nBrown, who was voted president of the LLC, said the LLC approached the town, and \"this has nothing to do with race.\" He said the town bought the land at more than market value.

Managing anger in this way is one of the 'life skills' that Seldon hopes to inculcate in his pupils as part of what he calls 'trying to educate the whole child'.\nI have to say that if I were a parent shelling out \u00a324,000 a year to send my child to Wellington, I would not have been impressed. The lesson seemed more suited to a group of unruly teenagers at a young offenders' institute than GCSE students at one of Britain's top independent schools. For instance, Morris had two actresses stage an argument in which one of them lost her temper after being called a 'silly cow'. The idea, apparently, was to illustrate how the use of certain phrases can trigger 'negative emotion'. He then asked members of the audience if they could guess what the phrase was in this instance. A teacher from Marlborough raised his hand. Was it 'silly cow'? Right first time!\nWas this really an example of the sort of lesson that some of the best brains in contemporary education think ought to be taught in Britain's schools? The other co-director of the Well-being Institute is Felicia Huppert, the current Cambridge Professor of Psychology, and one of the most prominent advocates of this new approach is Richard Layard, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the LSE. (He is the author of Happiness: Lessons From a New Science.) Both of these luminaries were present at Seldon's one-day conference and, given their involvement, I was expecting the 40-minute 'Happiness Class' to have a little more depth. Morris's lesson on anger-management didn't amount to much more than telling children to take a deep breath and count to ten the next time they felt angry.\nIn fairness to Morris, his lessons are probably a lot more lively when"}

They asked for input and ideas regarding the game well in advance so that when they are together with the GMs, the focus can be on good productive discussions and suggestions on strengthening the game.\nWhen you gather this collection of experienced, passionate and intelligent people to discuss, debate, analyze and make recommendations on how the game can be improved and enhanced, the beneficiary becomes the game of hockey.\nPaul Kelly, executive director of the NHL Players' Association, also made a presentation on behalf of the players with respect to various opinions they have on issues surrounding the game.\nSo, what are the topics being discussed?\nFighting is a 'hot-button' issue with many layers and nuances to it.\nThe black-and-white argument is: does it or doesn't it belong? The reality is considerably more complicated and finding a simple answer is extremely difficult.\nHow does a fight begin? Is it the result of the constant friction of a competitive battle or is it as a response to a player being hit? Does it occur as a result of the game tactic of \"trying to change momentum?\" How can players be better protected from serious injury as a result of fighting?\nIn a similar vein, the players are concerned about the place of \"head shots\" in the game. Seems odd that a debate can rage on about fighting and its place in hockey at the same time there is a concern with head shots.\nAgain, the consideration of factors is complex in regard to head shots. Do you hit a player who is unsuspecting? Is it the player who's unsuspecting -- or unaware in some instances -- who is responsible? Or does the responsibility remain with the player who is delivering the hit to stop short of delivering such a blow? What are the penalties to be levied against a player in a sport where the action is fast and the intensity high?\nThese are just a couple of the topics being discussed here, but fans can be reassured that everybody involved in the discussions surrounding the NHL, specifically, and the effects for hockey, in general, have the best interests at hand and will deliberate appropriately.\nRemember this is the same collection of people who during the lockout made the recommendations that have lead to many of the enhancements -- including the shootout and the elimination of the red line for passing -- found in the game today.\nThose are enhancements that have led to the excitement of hockey being played at the highest level with superbly skilled players.\nThe GMs will meet this challenge as well -- and hockey will benefit once again."}

The research has been led by William Ripple, of the Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University.\nIn the paper, the scientists have looked at population data relating to 74 different herbivores. The qualifier was that each animal needed to weigh over 100 kilos to be included in the study. This embraced a range of animals from reindeer to elephants.\nThe reason for the alarming predictive declines are multi-faceted and include habitat loss, hunting for meat or body parts, and competition for food and resources with livestock. At biggest risk is the rhinoceros. Given that a rhinoceros horn is worth more than gold, diamonds or cocaine on illegal markets, rhinos could be extinct, the researchers warn, in the wild within 20 years in Africa. It was through hunting that Africa's western black rhinoceros was declared extinct in 2011.\nThe impact is not just with herbivores for there is also a knock on effect with carnivores: a dwindling food source. In other words, as herbivore numbers fall so, ultimately, with carnivores for there will be fewer animals for the predators to feed upon. This is is likely to impact lions, leopards, and hyena the most.\nHerbivores also perform other functions where, if their numbers fall, ecological issues could arise. For example, elephants help to clear forest by trampling down vegetation. Other herbivores help with seed dispersal.\nAs a remedy, the authors call for a coordinated research effort focusing on threatened species in developing countries. Otherwise, the future looks bleak. Talking with BBC Science, Professor Ripple warns: \"The process of declining animals is causing an empty landscape in the forest, savannah, grasslands and desert.\""}

Sometimes, she got so excited about a lesson it made her breathless.\nOn Monday before class, Madame Couture stopped by the foreign languages department at Major Williams Hall.

What between Google and my eleven year old daughter, I can find anything. In the mornings when I leave home, there is Little Miss, index finger outstretched, showing me just where I parked the car last night and that I have forgotten my work book. And Google, the patron saint of writers, is always there to remind me of the names I had forgotten. Now all I have to do is get my brain hot-wired into a wireless network and I can meet the world head on.\nHowever, we\u2019re not quite there yet, so we (you and me) we have to retain as much cerebral function as we can. And it turns out that it is not all that difficult.\nWe have known for some time that if you don\u2019t use your muscles, they waste away. By not using your hands for physical work, the skin on your hands gets thin. However, we also know that if you use your muscles again, the muscle tissue builds up and becomes strong once more. If you use your hands again, the skin builds up and becomes thicker. The message is simply that all is not lost! Recovery is possible.\nHowever, we were always told that the one organ of the body that could not reverse the wasting process was the Central Nervous System. Once it started to fail, that was it. Dementia was just around the corner. Do not pass go, do not collect 200!\nHowever, that view has recently been challenged and the results are comforting, to say the least. Experiments have been carried out that showed that by inducing stress in an animal resulted in chemicals being released. This on its own was nothing new, but what was new was the fact that some of these chemicals produced a difference in the brain\u2019s anatomy! The idea that the brain could not change was incorrect! It could be \u2018short-circuited\u2019 resulting in a new wiring pathways.\nWhat was even more exciting was that if the animal was restored to its own \u2018safe\u2019 and non-threatening environment, then the brain reverted to its pre-stressed anatomy! It was possible to \u2018re-wire\u2019 the brain.\nIn turn this has led to much research into the effects of stress and its reversal, and then on to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (if I have remembered to spell it correctly)! And if it were possible for its reversal too!\nReturning to the research, we have shown that stress can physically damage nerve cells used in storing memory. We have also found that mindless watching of the goggle-box also produces a decline in brain function. In fact the numbers are more worrying than that. It has now been found that people with no stimulating leisure activities, and who are couch potatoes instead, are nearly four times more likely to develop dementia compared to those people who have leisure stimuli and do not waste hours in front of the TV.\nTaking that a step further, and turning the scientific data around to be useful, it has been found that in being the converse to the couch potato, intellectually stimulating leisure activities had a \u2018protective\u2019 effect for the brain and its capabilities. What is more, they have also found that if you are doing a job you enjoy, then this was again protective, but a dull job with no stimulus or challenge was another way to head downhill.\nThis does not mean that we all have to take up chess tomorrow, because in place of intellectually stimulating hobbies, it has been found that physical exercise itself stops memory loss and stimulates growth of nerve cells.\nSo"}

In it, the QDMA has compiled facts and figures from all the whitetail states and provinces across North America. It should be noted that gathering and compiling all this data takes considerable time, much of which is spent waiting on the states. As a result, the most recent numbers available are from the 2016 season.\nWe\u2019ll start with the number of antlered bucks harvested, as that\u2019s where most of the interest and effort from hunters is directed. Not surprisingly, Maine tops the list of New England states with 16,711, followed by Vermont\u2019s 9,995 and Massachusetts\u2019 7,043. You would expect Vermont, and New Hampshire to be close behind as they have a good deal of undeveloped land. The Bay State is a bit of a surprise, as is Connecticut\u2019s 6,092 bucks, just edged out by New Hampshire\u2019s 6,629. By comparison, Maryland hunters killed 30,326 bucks and New Yorkers killed 107,006. Yikes!\nIt\u2019s not really fair to compare the states head-to-head by absolute numbers because they are so different in size. Bucks killed per square mile is a more accurate index to the quality of deer hunting. Maine comes in dead last in that category for New England at 0.5. Next worse are New Hampshire at 0.7, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts tied at 0.9. First place in New England goes to Connecticut at 1.3. Tops in the Northeast was Pennsylvania at 3.3. For a broader perspective, Michigan was tops in the nation at 3.5 bucks killed per square mile; that\u2019s three more bucks killed per square mile than Maine. Some parts of Maine only have three live deer per square mile.\nSome might also argue that it\u2019s not fair to compare northern states like Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont to Maryland and Pennsylvania, or Virginia\u2019s 89,675 buck harvest. Let\u2019s look at a state with similar climate and habitat, like Minnesota, where hunters killed 100,921 bucks. That\u2019s not a typo. Granted, it\u2019s a bigger state, but it still averaged 1.3 bucks per square mile. However, a good bit of that harvest likely came on the strength of southern Minnesota.\nSo let\u2019s look at North Dakota with a similar, perhaps more severe climate than Maine, and poorer deer habitat. Hunters killed 22,660 bucks, but at a rate of only 0.3 per square mile. South Dakota was the only other whitetail state in the nation with a lower rate than Maine.\nAnother index to the quality not only of deer hunting but of the overall deer herd and deer management program is age distribution in the buck harvest. It reflects age distribution in the overall herd, with more even distribution being the preferred goal of both managers and hunters. One of the best measures for this is the percentage of yearling bucks in the harvest, higher numbers obviously being a bad thing. New England numbers are pretty similar, with Vermont gaining a noticeable advantage at 34 percent and Maine in the middle range at "}

It will go live with 650 branches in addition to 3,250 access points co-located at post offices and around 11,000 postmen both in rural and urban area will provide doorstep banking services. It has permission to link around 17 crore postal savings bank accounts. The government plans to link all the 1.55 lakh post office branches with IPPB services by the end of this year. Earlier this year, IPPB had launched its pilot operations in Raipur and Ranchi.\nWhile the government was earlier planning to launch IPPB at a grand function in Delhi\u2019s Talkatora stadium on August 21, it was later rescheduled in the wake of the seven-day national mourning to pay homage to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\nWhat is a payments bank?\nA payments bank is like any other bank, but operating on a smaller scale without involving any credit risk. In simple words, it can carry out most banking operations but can\u2019t advance loans or issue credit cards. It can accept demand deposits (up to Rs 1 lakh) and offer remittance services, mobile payments/transfers/purchases and other banking services like ATM/debit cards, net banking and third-party fund transfers.\nThe objectives of setting up of payments banks is to increase financial inclusion by providing small savings accounts and payments/remittance services to migrant labourers, low-income households, small businesses and other unorganised sector entities.\nDoorstep banking service is one of the most distinct features of IPPB, making it very accessible. With an aim to ease access and encourage adoption of new-age banking and payment instruments, IPPB will utilise the services of postmen to offer doorstep banking in rural areas.

{"idx": "30414", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Trump administration wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons by 2020 after which it would get sanctions relief. Pyongyang insists on a phased and synchronized approach with incentives and concessions along the way. On paper, these are not entirely incompatible approaches.\nIn reality, however, nuclear weapons occupy too important a place in North Korea\u2019s national security \u2013 as deterrent against attack, as bargaining chip, as shortcut to achieving strategic balance on the Korean peninsula \u2013 to be given up easily. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign policy establishment is skeptical of any process that rewards North Korea for actions short of complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization (CVID).\nThe most likely post-Singapore scenario, then, is a protracted set of negotiations over the very terms of negotiations. The first (unsuccessful) step in this process took place in early July with Pompeo\u2019s visit to Pyongyang. If both sides can agree on terms, however, some hesitant moves toward denuclearization can follow.\nMeanwhile, as Washington and Pyongyang negotiate their differences, the two Koreas can use this extended pause in hostilities to restart the slow-motion reunification of the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun years. That means a resumption of direct links (hotline between capitals, direct marine radio communication), joint economic projects (tourism, Kaesong Industrial Zone), infrastructure coordination (inter-Korean rail), NGO initiatives (reforestation), and cultural exchanges.\nThe two sides are potentially going further. On the table are such proposals as pulling back long-range artillery pieces from the DMZ and establishing a Pyongyang bureau for the South Korean news agency Yonhap.\nInter-Korean reconciliation depends at least in part on an ongoing d\u00e9tente between Washington and Pyongyang. That d\u00e9tente in turn requires at least the promise of denuclearization. As long as the United States and North Korea keep talking, the two Koreas can get on with the business of creating a more durable peace on the ground.\nNuclear disarmament is an important goal. But denuclearization was not one of the demands the United States made of China during the d\u00e9tente of the 1970s. D\u00e9tente, however, ensured that China, once embedded in the international system and the global economy, would be considerably less likely to use nuclear weapons.\nUltimately, that should be the U.S. goal with North Korea as well. CVID may well be a chimera. But Washington and Seoul can engage Pyongyang in ways that make it less likely to use any of its weapons.\nA month after the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, euphoric U.S. claims that \u201cthere is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea\u201d are running into North Korean intransigence. The sparse Singapore Communique was a shaky foundation upon which to build a comprehensive agreement to compel Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear, missile, and BCW programs.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s post-summit mission to Pyongyang was to put meat on the bare bones summit agreement. His trip was a critical test of how much the two leaders had actually agreed to. Pompeo needed North Korea to affirm\u2014publicly and unambiguously\u2014that it would abandon its WMD arsenals in an expeditious manner. Such a declaration would combat mounting skepticism, which had been fueled by evidence that the regime was expanding its nuclear and missile programs.\nP"}

Solar energy, despite its limited usefulness, has been subsidized with hundreds of millions of dollars of federal grants and loans, including some to companies in India. Similarly, reports CNSNews.com, the administration has handed out $112 million over the past two years to protect the Sage Grouse, yet the bird itself exists in such numbers that the Department of the Interior has refused to list it as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\nThe money is being disbursed through five different federal programs in the form of \u201csubsidies to farmers \u2026 to cover a portion \u2014 up to 75 percent, in some cases \u2014 of the cost of implementing certain conservation practices, technologies and techniques,\u201d according to the news service.\nOne can hardly disagree with these organizations that cooperation is preferable to coercion and that the restrictions triggered by an endangered species listing are so severe that it would be better to do what it takes to keep the Sage Grouse off the list than to risk Washington\u2019s wrath later on. Still, those farmers and ranchers accepting subsidies to protect their own property are, in the process, violating others\u2019 property rights since the subsidies first have to be taken from others via taxation. Thus, the very existence of the unconstitutional Endangered Species Act virtually guarantees that the government will infringe upon someone\u2019s right to dispose of his own property as he sees fit, whether to prevent a species from making the list or to protect it once is has been listed.\nWhy the push, then, to get the Sage Grouse listed and, in the meantime, to spend millions of taxpayer dollars in hopes of preventing that? In 2007, the Interior Department, then under President George W. Bush, refused to list the Sage Grouse, a decision that was overturned by a federal court in Idaho, whereupon a gaggle of environmental groups petitioned the department to list the bird. The Obama Interior Department then ruled as described in the above-quoted press release, steering \u201ca middle course between conservationists who wanted ironclad protections for the ground-hugging bird and industry interests and landowners who sought the ability to locate mines, wells, windmills, and power lines in areas where the grouse roam,\u201d in the words of the New York Times.\nIt also provided the Obama administration with an excuse to shower taxpayer dollars on western states, many of which are heavily Republican, under the guise of protecting farmers\u2019 and ranchers\u2019 property \u2014 a move undoubtedly calculated to boost Obama\u2019s chances of reelection next year.\nAt a time when the government is $14.6 trillion in debt and everyone in Washington claims to be looking for ways to save money, spending $112 million to protect a quite populous species and to shore up political interests will only give taxpayers one more reason to grouse about those birds in the capital."}

Peaking at $2.2 billion and a 21 percent market share in 2010, 3D revenue in the U.S. has been on a downward trend \u2014 accounting for just $1.3 billion and 12 percent of box office revenue last year.\nOn top of that, IMAX announced last year that it would be largely moving away from 3D technology, saying that its audience showed a clear preference for standard IMAX screenings. In the case of some films like \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d IMAX eliminated 3D screenings altogether.\nSo in the face of all this, how is 3D moviegoing still an $8 billion per year business? One reason is that while many Hollywood wide releases today only add 3D nominally or convert the format into 3D in postproduction, there are still a few releases each year that actively incorporate and promote 3D to the point that audiences respond.\nUniversal\u2019s two \u201cJurassic World\u201d movies are a prime example. RealD, which now sits as the top 3D distributor with IMAX exit, reported in 2015 that the first \u201cJurassic World\u2019 saw nearly half of its North American audience see the film in 3D. Last month, that film\u2019s sequel, \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d was released, with RealD reporting that approximately 50 percent of the film\u2019s $1 billion-plus global gross has come from 3D screens.\nAnother movie that got a boost from 3D was Marvel\u2019s \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d a film with psychedelic, mind-bending imagery that created a buzz among audiences to pay the extra bucks to watch it with glasses on, resulting in 46 percent of its $85 million domestic opening coming from 3D sales.\nIn 2017, global 3D sales hit $8 billion for the third year in a row, with overseas markets contributing 83 percent of that total. That\u2019s more than double the $2.8 billion that came from outside North America in 2010.\n3D might not be the industry-changing boom it may have seemed to be at the start of the decade and may be seen as a fading fad in America, but with global grosses for the format continuing to hover around 20 percent of total box office gross, it\u2019s clear that the glasses won\u2019t be going away anytime soon.\nRealD has renewed its partnership with Cinemark through 2021, and AMC will also allow subscribers to its new ticket subscription program to see films in 3D without paying an extra charge.\nBut Dergarabedian said that unless the movies themselves provide the draw, 3D will likely rely more and more on overseas interest."}

The church is believed to have religious and historical significance since the days of Indian Catholic Missionary Joseph Vaz before the establishment of Wilpattu as a National Park in 1938.\nAccording to an announcement by the Roman Catholic Church, Joseph Vaz who came to Sri Lanka in 1687 had visited Pallekandal and put up a little chapel.

If Portland voters reject fluoridated water, it will follow in the path of many cities before it. Forty-four cities around the world - largely in the United States, Australia and Canada - have passed anti-fluoridation policies this year, according to the Fluoride Action Network.\nThe fluoride battle has a lengthy history. One article, published in 1985, described the fluoridation fight as \"America's Longest War.\"\n\"A few things remain constant in America - death, taxes, baseball and, since the 1950s, widespread, often successful efforts by a passionate minority to keep fluoride out of drinking water,\" Donald R. McNeil wrote in Wilson Quarterly.\nMcNeil has written one of the more complete histories of the fluoridation wars that I was able to find. It starts on Jan. 26, 1945 when the city of Grand Rapids, Mich. became the first city to fluoridate its water supply. It was meant to be a public health experiment, to test whether fluoridation could protect against tooth decay, especially among younger children.\nIt would take decades to have any results and, therefore, \"the pioneers of fluoridation were generally a cautious lot,\" McNeil writes, noting that they thought \"that communities should at first fluoridate only on a test-batch basis.\"\nPublic health officials in nearby Wisconsin had other ideas; they began clamoring for statewide fluoridation as soon as possible. They began spreading the pro-fluoridation gospel\u2013and that's when the anti-fluoride advocates showed up. Their ranks were diverse including, in one fight over fluoridating Seattle's water in 1951, \"Christian Scientists, a few dentists, health food operators and fervent anti-Communists.\" They won the Seattle vote, 84,000 to 44,000.\nThe medical establishment near universally supports fluoridation. The American Dental Association has endorsed the practice since 1950. The Surgeon General Regina Benjamin supports fluoridation and the Centers for Disease Control, which has described wide-spread water fluoridation as one of the 10 most important public health accomplishments of the 20th century.\nFluoridation opponents, meanwhile, have cited research finding that high levels of fluoride - about 4 milligrams per liter - can cause harmful health effects. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency have recommended, since 2011, that cities maintain 0.7 milligrams per litter of fluoride in the water supply.\nIn Portland alone, this is now the fifth time the city has voted on the water fluoridation issue, according to the Oregonian newspaper. The last vote, Brad Schmidt reports, was in 1978, when voters overturned the city council's decision to fluoridate the water.\nExcept, what we know about the fluoride wars suggests that the fight might actually be waning.

The moorings, for instance, carry the weight of an Orange County grand jury investigation, which found the city was mismanaging the mooring process.\n\"It's a very, very complicated situation,\" said Councilman Mike Henn. \"What we have in Newport Bay has just sort of evolved over time.\"\nOne of the findings of the grand jury was that the city hadn't assessed the moorings' \"fair market value\" since the mid-1990s.\nBecause the annual mooring fees are low \u2014 $20 per linear foot (of a boat), compared to more than $500 per foot at a private marina \u2014 boaters covet one of the public cans.\nThey've been willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to a current mooring holder, under the table, to have a permit transferred into their name.\nBy hiking the fees and setting them to about 15% of the harbor's average private marina rent, city officials hope to break the cycle.\n\"The city gets nothing from that check that's written, and that mooring is a public asset,\" Henn said. \"The point is, a user of the harbor that's using a public asset should pay an appropriate value.\"\nMembers of the Mooring Assn. contend that the city doesn't extract enough from those whose docks sometimes extend over city-owned tidelands.\nThey say the City Council wants to get the most vocal group out of the way first, and would rather avoid the more politically sensitive discussion concerning commercial marinas or bayfront home docks.\n\"What they're doing now is they are splitting the herd,\" said Sites, who believes commercial and residential dock owners \"may have some undue influence.\"\nHenn said the city isn't going to play favorites, and that \"nobody is exempt.\"\nThe Newport Harbor Yacht Club and the Balboa Yacht Club hold some of the city moorings, and Henn said the city planned to examine if their arrangement was in the public's best interest.

But he never thought he`d make a career of the confection. Today, as owner of the Baskin-Robbins franchise at 2506 N. Lincoln Ave., he has his hands in every aspect of the business (including the ice cream cartons, as a dipper). Single and 25 years old, Westcott commutes to the store from his home in Park Forest, where he grew up. He enjoys taking friends out for ice cream and recently took catering classes to expand his skill at fashioning some of the North Side`s most sumptuous ice cream creations. What`s a treat for him? A movie or a Black Hawks hockey game. Chicago writer Sherri Gilman-Tompkins got the scoop from Westcott on a job that really heats up in summer.\nMy very first job was as a scooper at a Baskin-Robbins store in Park Forest. I was 14 years old. While working there all through high school, I began to take on more responsibility and became assistant manager. The store I worked in was the busiest store in Park Forest. We waited on hundreds and hundreds of customers every day.\nWhen I started, the single dip was 24 cents and double scoops were 49 cents. Today the single dip is 56 cents.\nBefore I bought my franchise, I worked another job for two years, and I didn`t like it, so I came back to Baskin-Robbins to see if I could manage a store. I bought it when I was 19 years old. I`m the youngest person to buy a Baskin-Robbins franchise.\nOne of the reasons being a scooper is so much fun is that most of your coworkers are young. You do get a lot of older customers, though. You have to be a people person to be a scooper. On a nice day 700 people come in for cones. Sometimes people have to wait up to 15 minutes on line, but they don`t mind waiting if their scoopers are friendly.\nBeing a scooper is one of the few jobs a 14-year-old can get, and that`s why I became one. Many franchise owners buy their businesses as an investment. I`m a working owner. I work behind the counter, scooping and making fountain creations 40 hours of my 65-hour work week. There`s a lot more to this job than meets the eye.\nThe freezer holds 240 tubs of ice cream. Each tub is three gallons. We only order once a week, so it`s important to know what your customers like. Sometimes it`s hard to judge. All of a sudden a flavor can become really hot for no reason. We know we`ll always be scooping a lot of vanilla, so I never run out of that. Recently chocolate almond, which has been a regular flavor for 15 years, was selling out faster than we could scoop it!\nFlavors cater to people. The brighter a flavor is, the more kids want it. They like orange sherbet and pink bubblegum. People 65 and older like traditional flavors such as burgundy cherry and butter pecan. Pralines and cream is the No. 1 flavor across the United States. Basically it`s a woman`s flavor. Women eat 75 percent of it.\nYou also learn about your neighborhood. We`re close to DePaul University"}

Instead, this person was pointing to a far deeper matter: the 35-year-old\u2019s faith. Kushner, the increasingly influential son-in-law of President-Elect Donald Trump, is an observant Orthodox Jew. He grew up attending a Jewish day school in northern New Jersey. His wife, Ivanka, converted before the two were married by a rabbi. They send their young children to a Jewish school in Manhattan. Both observe the Sabbath each week.\nDuring his first fortnight as president-elect, Trump appears to be assembling not so much a team of rivals as one of adversaries. Entreaties to the conservative Establishment (such as the appointment of Reince Priebus as chief of staff) appear undercut by gestures to his alt-right base (like the selection of Stephen Bannon as his top strategist). Trump\u2019s attempt to woo the avuncular and cool-headed Mitt Romney as his secretary of state appears compromised by his appointment of the more bellicose Mike Flynn as national security adviser.\nIn some ways, the split among members of the Jewish community is merely a microcosm of larger ones enveloping the Republican Party and the American electorate itself.

{"idx": "30453", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Forget all that stuff about \"jury nullification\" and racial divisions as the reason O.J. Simpson was acquitted last fall of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman.\n*Los Angeles police conducted a warrantless search of Simpson's house; then bungled the collection of evidence, at best contaminating it, and at worst, planting some of it; then tried to cover it up with perjury in court.\n*Some of the most crucial evidence was found during the warrantless search by a racist cop who bragged about planting evidence and harassing black men who were with white women.\n*The county coroner, who was not even called to the crime scene for 10 hours, then botched the autopsy and destroyed crucial evidence that could have helped determine when the crime occurred.\n*The prosecution lost the jury in its over-technical explanation of DNA evidence.\nWhen the time came, the jury found it could not believe the LAPD nor its evidence. Asked to find Simpson guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" they refused.\nRobert Shapiro's \"The Search for Justice: A Defense Attorney's Brief on the O.J. Simpson Case\" and Alan Dershowitz's \"Reasonable Doubts\" are as different as their authors. Shapiro tells a personal story: how he got involved in the case, his reactions to events as they unfolded, and the high price he and his family have paid for the unwanted fame and loss of privacy the case brought with it.\nDershowitz, the controversial Harvard professor and appellate lawyer, is intent on showing what the case has to teach about the American justice system, the role of defense lawyers, and the widespread problem of police perjury.\nShapiro was the \"quarterback\" of the defense \"Dream Team\"; he brought F. Lee Bailey, Johnnie Cochran, and the rest on board. Keeping harmony among such a crew of large egos was not easy: The trial destroyed Shapiro's friendship with Bailey (whom he accuses of leaking confidential information to the New York press). And Shapiro says that while he has great respect for Cochran, he won't work with him again.\nSimpson protested his innocence from Day 1, Shapiro says, and behaved like an innocent man throughout. He reveals that it was Simpson's adult son who stopped him from committing suicide after the infamous Bronco chase.\nGiving the impression that he believes his client innocent, Shapiro says that he finds it hard to believe a man in Simpson's impaired physical condition could perform the acts Simpson was accused of. In the famous courtroom incident of the gloves that did not fit, the defense knew that they would not; they fit Shapiro snugly, and his hands are far smaller than Simpson's.\nShapiro does not denigrate the LAPD as a whole and is often sympathetic toward the prosecutors, especially Chris Darden, as people. He faults Cochran for flirting with lead prosecutor Marcia Clark in front of the jury and for constantly baiting Darden.\nDershowitz is far harsher on Clark and the police. He points to her castigation of the defense lawyers, which brought frequent rebukes from Judge Lance Ito. He has no patience with her putting Mark Fuhrman on the stand when she must have known he was lying about his racist behavior. And Dershowitz makes a solid case that the problem of police lying on the witness stand is far more serious"}

She has stood in the way of the progressive movement, and she has consistently put her own political interests ahead of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said.\nCanova decided to run against Wasserman Shultz because her stance on issues like Wall Street reform, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and big corporations did not align with the progressive beliefs of some party members.\nShe also supported the anti-net-neutrality bill SOPA and voted to remove part of the Dodd-Frank law that stopped big banks from using deposits for speculative financial derivatives.\nWasserman Schultz denies the accusations of bias toward Clinton, saying she would not be DNC chair if she wanted to favor a candidate.\nPerhaps the biggest suggestion of bias lies in the charges that the DNC purposely limited Democratic debates and held them on weekends and nights with low audience ratings, such as the weekend before Christmas and at the same time as an NFL football game.\nSome feel this was an effort to limit the time voters would be exposed to both Sanders and O\u2019Malley\u2019s strengths, and Clinton\u2019s shortcomings.\nClinton\u2019s campaign had lobbied against an earlier proposal for eight debates.\nThe Democratic candidates had six debates, with only four held before the first of the caucuses in Iowa. The Republicans will have 12, and will have had seven before Iowa.\nIn 2008, there were 26 Democratic debates.\nUnofficial debates have been banned by the DNC, with Wasserman Schultz threatening to ban any candidate that took part in an unsanctioned debate from the remaining debates.\nThis week, MSNBC and the Manchester Union Leader paper in New Hampshire organized an unscheduled debate for February 4.\nSanders and Clinton made statements that they would participate with the blessing of the DNC.\nWasserman Schultz released a statement Tuesday: \u201cOur next DNC-sanctioned debate featuring our major candidates will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hosted by PBS on February 11th, with another already scheduled for March 9th with Univision and the Washington Post. We have no plans to sanction any further debates before the upcoming First in the Nation caucuses and primary, but will reconvene with our campaigns after those two contests to review our schedule.\"\nOther accusations against the DNC chair include the controversial cutting off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to voter data following a data breach, due to an external firewall issue.\nBoth Sanders and his supporters blamed Wasserman Schultz for blocking them and making a statement without warning the campaign.\nOther party members have spoken out against the debate schedules.\nDNC finance chair Henry Munoz III reportedly helped organize a fundraiser for Clinton, in violation of rules that state all DNC members must be impartial.

{"idx": "30460", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Con artists are greedy hucksters who sell us dreams that never come true. But Americans have a soft spot for them. Witness the current success of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle,\u201d films that celebrate (sort of) the art of the grift. Somehow, living through two bubbles in which plenty of investors and homeowners were suckered by sugarplum visions hasn\u2019t dampened our appetite for watching spectacles like Christian Bale duping almost everyone he encounters, including F.B.I. agents, and Leonardo DiCaprio hypnotizing a mark into buying worthless stock.\nIt has ever been thus. The phrase \u201cconfidence man\u201d was popularized in an 1849 New York Herald article detailing the arrest of William Thompson, a man of \u201cgenteel appearance\u201d who for months had been approaching strangers on the street and somehow persuading them to trust him with their watches until the next day. (Needless to say, they never got the watches back.) Almost immediately, a play titled \u201cThe Confidence Man\u201d d\u00e9buted; Thompson was soon bragging that he was \u201ca great man in the eyes of the world.\u201d In the decades that followed, the con artist became a classic American antihero. The curious thing, as the University of Pennsylvania historian Walter McDougall writes, is that, \u201cfar from despising flimflam artists as parasites or worse, American popular culture habitually celebrates rascals as comedic figures.\u201d Think of the movies of W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers; think of \u201cThe Sting\u201d and \u201cDirty Rotten Scoundrels.\u201d Even bleaker depictions, like David Mamet\u2019s, get us to admire the dexterity with which con artists persuade people to part with their money.\nIt seems that con artists, for all their vices, represent many of the virtues that Americans aspire to. Con artists are independent and typically self-made. They don\u2019t have to kowtow to a boss\u2014no small thing in a country in which people have always longed to strike out on their own. They succeed or fail based on their wits. They exemplify, in short, the complicated nature of American capitalism, which, as McDougall argues, has depended on people being hustlers in both the positive and the negative sense. The American economy wasn\u2019t built just on good ideas and hard work. It was also built on hope and hype.\nIn the nineteenth century especially, the line between crook and businessman was fuzzy. Take the building of the American railroads, which both spurred industrialization and laid the foundation for a truly national economy. When the Central Pacific Railroad (the western spur of the transcontinental railroad) was built, the four men who started it, including Leland Stanford, set up an outside construction company in which they were the sole shareholders, and used that company to milk the Central Pacific for tens of millions of dollars in excess construction costs. The building of the Union Pacific Railroad led to the same kind of self-dealing and pocket-lining and reckless overbuilding, while railroad financiers like Jay Gould made enormous sums via stock schemes and dubious takeovers. The result was one of the biggest cons the country has ever seen, with huge losses for investors and huge fortunes for the moguls. Still, we ended up with a national transportation system.\nIn the twentieth century, the relationship between commerce and con artistry became subtler.

Italy\u2019s public debt, which amounts to more than 130% of its GDP, is the Commission\u2019s \u201ckey concern\u201d.\n\u201cI believe we will find a compromise [with the Commission], without sacrificing the citizens who are rightly waiting for our promises to be kept,\u201d added Di Maio referring to the two contested policies of universal income and the overhaul of the current pension system that will allow some workers to retire earlier.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if this procedure really starts, now we are discussing,\u201d he concluded.\nHowever, the opening of such a procedure is edging ever closer.\nEU governments\u2019 representatives in the Economic and Financial Committee, an advisory group of the EU Council, met in Brussels on Thursday (29 November). They agreed with the Commission that Italy\u2019s budget does not comply with the debt-to-GDP criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact.\nThe Committee considered an \u201caggravating factor\u201d the fact that the Italian government has submitted a revised plan confirming the same previous budget targets.\nAn Italian diplomatic source pointed out that the opinion of the Committee does not prejudge any decision by the EU ministers to open a procedure.\nThe document also said that further elements may emerge from the ongoing dialogue between the Commission and the Italian government, keeping the door open for a compromise, which is so far unlikely.\nIn an interview published on the Italian daily La Stampa on Wednesday (28 November), the Commission\u2019s Vice President Dombrovskis said that \u201ca substantial correction\u201d to the budget is required from Rome and that a reduction by 0.2% of GDP wouldn\u2019t be enough.\nDi Maio said that he took Commissioner\u2019s word as an encouragement, adding that he can understand the European institutions are disoriented by a method which goes against the trend of the past.\n\u201cThis is a method that we want to apply to reduce debt since the method of past governments increased public debt,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Di Maio, an expansive political economy is now needed in order to reduce the debt and get the country back on track.\nIn the morning Di Maio also met Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen.\nHe discussed with Vestager the steel plant lLVA taken over by Indian multinational ArcelorMittal, and about the restructure of the Italian flag carrier Alitalia, which recently received a bid for some units by Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) rail group.\nA spokesperson told EURACTIV that Thyssen met Di Maio in the context of preparations for next week\u2019s Employment and Social Policy (EPSCO) Council, adding that the Commissioner welcomed Italy\u2019s support of the pending social files, including the European Labour Authority"}

Through the transaction, Qualcomm Incorporated will become a minority WiTricity shareholder.\nThis acquisition will streamline technology development that enables automakers to deliver an EV charging experience that is seamless and efficient. By simply parking over wireless charging ground pads located at home, in garages, and public parking spots, EV drivers will be able to recharge hands-free, without the need for any bulky cables, virtually eliminating the need to ever plug in. Additionally, electrified autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets will require wireless charging since there will be no human drivers present to plug in.\nQualcomm Incorporated and WiTricity have been working collaboratively with global standards organizations, which currently leverage reference designs from each company. This acquisition will simplify ratification of the standard and help ensure interoperability across automakers. EV drivers will be able to use any standards-compatible pad to charge their vehicles.\nWith all major car manufacturers and climate-focused nations like China racing to phase out internal combustion vehicles, the global electric vehicle market is at a tipping point. It is estimated that more than 120 million EVs will be on the road by 2030 with over $50 billion being invested in charging infrastructure. By 2040, 200 million EVs will be on the road in China alone; and globally, 559 million -- or a third of all cars. All of these could be charged simply and wirelessly with WiTricity\u2019s unique technology.\nThe acquisition follows other significant recent milestones for WiTricity. The company has signed several new licensing deals including Mahle in Germany and Anjie Wireless in China. Earlier this year, Honda and WiTricity demonstrated their wireless vehicle-to-grid charging model at CES in Las Vegas, leveraging WiTricity\u2019s DRIVE 11 wireless charging system. 2018 also saw the introduction of the world\u2019s first vehicle that is factory equipped with wireless charging, the BMW 530e iPerformance sedan.\nWiTricity develops solutions to enable wireless power transfer over distance using its patented magnetic resonance technology.

Over a dozen species are native to North America. Maples are related to several other types of trees, although their taxonomy is difficult to decipher due to disagreements on classifications.\nLike so many other plants and animals, the taxonomy of the maple family is somewhat muddled and debated between experts. Some consider the family Aceraceae to be a family on its own, while others, including the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, consider the maples to be part of the family Sapindaceae, or soapberries. When Aceraceae is on its own, Acer and the monotypic Dipteronia are the only two genera; when grouped with the soapberries, plants such as hopseed bush (Dodonaea), buckeyes (Aesculus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus) and balloon vine (Cardiospermum), among several others, are also included.\nMaple trees, in general, have opposite, palmately lobed simple leaves and produce winged samaras. While this is the standard, some maples have pinnately lobed compound leaves. Most maples are favored for their bright fall foliage, ranging in hues from deep yellow to bright red. The trees vary greatly in height and shape; some are tall shade trees reaching well over 40 feet, while others may only reach 4 feet tall. The shape of the crown may be round or oval or anything in between; some of the shorter ones have a mounded habit.\nWith more than 1,000 cultivars, the Japanese maple (Acer palmatum cvs.), which grows in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 5 through 8, dominates the nursery industry as the small ornamental tree of choice, particularly when it comes to ornamental maples. These trees are often favored for their bright colors, small size and interesting foliage. Other non-native maples include Amur maple (Acer ginnala), which grows in USDA zones 3 through 6; and paperbark maple (Acer griseum), which grows in USDA zones 4 through 8.\nSeveral maples are native to North American forests and work well in decorated landscapes. Some are understory trees; others make magnificent shade trees. Bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), which grows in USDA zones 5 through 8, is native to the Northwest. Vine maple (Acer circinatum), which grows in USDA zones 6 through 9, also is native to the Northwest. A commonly encountered shade tree, the red maple (Acer rubrum) is native to eastern North America and grows in USDA zones 3 through 9.\nKelly, Jasey. \"Trees That Are in the Maple Tree Family.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/trees-maple-tree-family-70214.html.

Today, he is fighting off a chicken snake while talking in an Australian accent. If you need a little laughter in your life this afternoon, check out the video on his page, and take a few moments to read how he became an Internet phenomenon.\n\"Southern Momma at the Ball Field\" ... \"Southern Momma Gettin\u2019 \u2018em Babies to Bed\" ... \"Southern Momma Gets Her Tax Return.\"\nThese are just a few of the videos that have catapulted Darren Knight, 30, to international internet fame as everyone\u2019s favorite \"Southern Momma.\" (Watch the video at the end of this story.).\nHe\u2019s the guy with long hair pulled into a top-knot, sunglasses propped onto his forehead and that unmistakable southern accent.\nKnight, whose videos spoof southern moms in various settings, including the flea market, JC Penney and in the car with her misbehaving kids, has become somewhat of an overnight celebrity. His videos, which are hilarious, have been viewed by millions around the world \u2013 and he had no idea what he was doing while filming the first one.\nBut it\u2019s all a product of his simple, Deep South upbringing.\nDarren Knight was always the class clown.\nBorn and raised in Southside, Alabama, Knight grew up in a very close-knit family with two sisters, his grandmother and several cousins, all of whom he saw on a regular basis.\nAs a child, Knight was frequently labeled the class clown , funniest and most talkative \u2013 an antidote to his reputation for getting bad grades.\nKnight eventually graduated high school, then went straight into the workplace, where he served tables at Applebee\u2019s and then started selling cars.\nSince he had few responsibilities, Knight was \u201cgoing out and living it up,\u201d spending his paychecks on bills and going out on the town.\nAnd that\u2019s precisely how he got his start in the world of stand-up comedy.\nDarren Knight enjoys filming in his car the most.\nKnight had absolutely no experience performing comedy, but he decided to give it a shot.\nThe reason behind Knight\u2019s punishment was simple. Money was tight, and his cousin\u2019s father didn\u2019t have health insurance. His grandma was looking at the boys playing though the window, and she saw Knight shove his cousin off his bike.\nKnight\u2019s comic delivery of the incident was impeccable, and he was a natural at turning every-day experiences into hilarity.\nOne day, a friend of his showed him a Facebook video of a guy mocking a soccer mom.\nAbout a year ago, Knight shared his first video, \u201cSouthern Momma Picking the Kids up from School,\u201d on Facebook. The response blew his mind.\n\u201cIt skyrocketed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt started getting shared, the views went up.

According to Chiarelli, he has begun riding a stationary bike, often the first step in recovery from PCS, and has elevated his heart rate to the range of 110-120 beats per minute.\nChiarelli said the plan is for Savard to try to sustain that light level of exercise for \u201ceight or nine\u2019\u2019 days, while consulting along the way with the club\u2019s medical staff. Provided he is able to tolerate the light workouts, he\u2019ll try something a little more taxing, right around the time the Bruins return from their European swing a week from Monday.\nAccording to Chiarelli, Savard looked and acted more like his old self earlier this week when he joined the club for its two-day Vermont getaway. The trip, billed as a team-bonding retreat, had the 33-year-old Savard navigating one of three suspended \u201chigh wires\u2019\u2019 that players had to cross on foot while teammates below added their support (and, no doubt, a steady stream of verbal, though good-natured, cheap shots).\nSavard planned all along not to be on the trip to Northern Ireland, and initially the front office said he might come next week to Prague, where the Bruins will open the season with back-to-back games next weekend against Phoenix. Given that he is riding the bike in Boston and experiencing a little traction on the PCS front, said Chiarelli, it\u2019s more likely that he will remain in the Hub and try to build on that bit of momentum.\nSavard suffered a Grade 2 concussion in March, returned to the lineup two months later to face Philadelphia in the playoffs, and made no public mention of PCS upon leaving for the summer. After beginning to skate again over the summer, he said he shut down his workouts abruptly when he experienced PCS symptoms. He has not skated in weeks and though neither Savard nor the club have offered a possible return date, it likely could be December or later before he is able to play again."}

That's not meant to be an indictment on LaVar as a parent, as I truly can't judge him effectively in that arena. I don't have enough facts - because LaVar is constantly the only one talking.\nAt 19 years old and poised to start a hopefully successful career in the NBA, Lonzo is still under the thumb of his helicopter father - literally sitting in his shadow. If that were a young actress or musician, closing in on their 20th birthday as their mother or father toted them around like a pageant kid, the entertainment media would talk about nothing else.\nAs a normal, non-celebrity human in the world, I can tell you that my independence upon heading off to college was a monumental opportunity for growth. I learned so much about myself in that time when I was given the opportunity to make decisions about the kind of person I wanted to be and the future I wanted to have. Hell yeah, I still needed my mother. I still need her on a daily basis now, and I've been out of college for six years. But had she been there, at my side for every class I decided to take or every interview I went on, I would've been worse off for it.\nThat's not to say that Lonzo's life is anything like mine. It's just that moving on without a parent acting as your mouthpiece is a universal process that we all have to experience in order to become productive adults. The jokes Lonzo is making here aren't meant to be funny in a laugh-out-loud way, they are meant to be funny in a dark, \"if you don't laugh you'll cry\" way. The stuff he's saying isn't hyperbole. It would be legitimately humorous if he were taking real situations and exaggerating them to fit an overblown media narrative, but that's not the case. LaVar really did tell 95% of the teams in the NBA not to even bother drafting his son.\nSo yeah, I can laugh at the commercial because it's well executed and it gives Lonzo at least some avenue through which to acknowledge the insanity of his reality. Still, I can't help but notice that while we're all laughing, Lonzo doesn't actually appear to be that amused."}

Carlyle did not dispute the fairness of the suspension.\n\"A little bit surprised with the number of games, but I don't think from anybody's standpoint that there's much of a defense,\" Carlyle said after the team's practice at the Centennial Sportsplex. \"He committed the act. If that's the price that that action warrants, then the League obviously felt that way and we have to live with their decision.\"\nWithout specifically naming it, Carlyle referenced the eight-game suspension that Chris Pronger, playing for the Ducks at the time, received in March 2008 for a similar offense against Vancouver's Ryan Kesler in saying that he generally agreed with the philosophy of the ruling.\n\"I think there's probably a bit of a precedent set with people who have committed that act,\" Carlyle said obliquely. \"This being playoffs, there's this mindset that playoffs, well, playoff games are worth two or three regular-season games.\n\"There's some credibility to that because people are fighting for their lives. It's a tough situation and it puts the League in a tough situation and we'll move forward.\"\nCarlyle said his options for replacing Ryan, who scored 34 goals and 71 points during the regular season and had a pair of goals in Anaheim's 5-3 victory in Game 2, on the Ducks' top line include moving up Brad Winchester or Matt Beleskey. Both have played in that spot during the regular season. Winchester had 1 goal in 19 games during the regular season and Beleskey had 3 goals in 35 games \u2013 a substantial drop-off.\nAs for who will take Ryan's spot in the lineup, one possibility is Jarkko Ruutu, who played in Game 1 but was a healthy scratch on Friday.

{"idx": "30506", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Forget Apple Pay. A Michigan startup says what you really need is a Buetooth-enabled supercard.\nOn Tuesday, Stratos introduced such a device, which it bills as the industry's first payment card that consolidates an unlimited amount of cards into one. The Stratos Bluetooth Connected Card, which the company has worked on for three years, is roughly the same size and weight of a standard credit card, but it's electronic and can be accepted anywhere.\nThiago Olson, the CEO and cofounder of Stratos, compares the concept to the iPod, which consolidated a user's CD collection into one device. In the future, he says, you'll also be able to add a new card to Stratos without having a plastic card handy. That means that if you're on vacation and lose your American Express, the company won't have to FedEx one to you in Maui.\nWhile that feature isn't yet available, when the card launches in April, you'll be able to load all your credit cards onto Stratos. You can also add some identification cards as well. If all goes well, you'll be able to travel as Olson does \u2014 with his phone, a driver's license and a Stratos card.\nThe price for such convenience is $99 or $145 for one- or two years, respectively. If you order, Stratos sends you a personalized card, a reader that attaches to your phone so you can add your credit card info (the technology supports iOS and Android) and a six-month warranty in case the waterproof card gets damaged or destroyed.\nThe device offers some perks in addition to convenience. If it's separated from your phone for a specified length of time, it goes into lock-down mode, so if you lose a card it's useless to the finder. It can also send you real-time notifications via your phone (example: \"There's a Starbucks nearby\") based on your location.\nIf the idea sounds familiar, that's because Coin, another startup, floated a similar concept in 2013. Despite promising a summer 2014 release, though, Coin pushed that back and promised to launch the product this spring. A rep for Coin declined comment on the timing of the relaunch.\nCoin attempted to crowdfund its product. Stratos has received a little over $7 million in funding. While Coin made headlines, Olson and his team were quietly working out the kinks on the product, which contained a lot of complexities, Olson says, including the wafer-thin form factor and all the back-end coding.\nAssuming Stratos works as advertised, the question is whether Apple Pay and the looming introduction of the Apple Watch will jump start mobile payments. One criticism of such mobile payment schemes is that it's not all that hard to reach into your wallet and use your credit card. The same critique could be lobbed at Stratos, since it's not very difficult to pick out your one card among many in your wallet. The persistence of alternate card designs (my wallet, for instance, includes an RFID smart card for the PATH trains) also means you won't be able to ditch your wallet for Stratos just yet. Still, for early adopters and seekers of simplicity, Stratos may be worth the cash."}

French President Franois Hollande recently stated that \"A monetary zone must have an exchange rate policy. If not, it will be subjected to an exchange rate that does not reflect the real state of the economy,\" according to a new WisdomTree research note.\nStill, the European Central Bank did not cut interest or unveil new monetary easing measures at the conclusion of its policy meeting last week.

As DXJ offers investor a hedge on the falling yen, HEDJ is \"designed to have higher returns than an equivalent non-currency hedged investment when the value of the U.S. dollar is increasing relative to the value of the euro, and lower returns when the U.S. dollar declines against the euro,\" according to WisdomTree.\nAnd like DXJ, investors have a tendency to focus on the hedged currency aspect with HEDJ. Obviously, that is a primary advantage of HEDJ, but the ETF sports another feature similar to that of DXJ. That being a screen for companies that derive the bulk of their revenue from the region tracked by the ETF. Arguably, another reason why DXJ and HEDJ have performed well this year has been their exposure to exporters that are not highly dependent on the fragile Japanese and Eurozone domestic economies.\nAs for HEDJ as a currency war play, take the example of LVMH Moet Hennessy, the ETF&apos;s eleventh-largest holding.

Prosecutors said they used their restaurant in Corona, called Cucino a Modo Mio, and a produce import company as a front for the scheme. The counts included plans to distribute some 50 kilos of cocaine discovered in shipments of yucca in 2014.\nWhen authorities searched the restaurant in 2015, they found a cache of firearms, brass knuckles, more than $100,000 in cash and a ledger detailing drug deals.\nEleonora Gigliotti pleaded guilty to lesser charges.\nGregorio Gigliotti denied any mob ties on Tuesday, and jurors never heard about any mafia links during the trial.\nBut prosecutors previously said in a memo that the Gigliotti family had \"close business ties\" to the infamous Calabria-based crime organization the 'Ndrangheta.

And the closer 2020 gets, the more information about the consoles leaks onto the Internet. The latest comes way of an anonymous poster on Pastebin, who claims to be a European developer working on an unannounced PS5 launch title, and who, apparently, is privy to a ton of inside information about Sony's next console, including its launch line-up and the release date of Horizon Zero Dawn 2. Of course, the source and claims seem dubious, but that's the rumor mill.\nThat said, according to the leaker, the PlayStation 5 is allegedly launching in 2020, and will be $100 more than the PS4 at launch. That's right; the PS5 may be $500, which is $100 more than the PS4's launch price-point of $400. Given that Sony had so much success with the PS4, it seems wild to think it will come in at a $100 more with the PS5, but given the current price of the PS4 Pro, it's possible.\nThe leak claims that despite asking for $500, the PS5 will sell at a $100 loss in the beginning. As for the system itself, the leaker says it will be backward compatible, offer a new premium version of PlayStation Plus (which has been echoed in other leaks), pack a 2TB built-in hard drive, support 8K upscaling, and be compatible with a newly upgraded PlayStation VR headset. And of course, there's also a new controller, the DualShock 5, which will have a built-in camera.\nNow, it's important to remember this is all unofficial information. In fact, not only is it unofficial, but there's a very solid chance it's incorrect or fake. So, take all of this with a huge grain of salt. If the PlayStation 5 actually is going to release in 2020, then we should hear about it within the next 12 months.

Nidal Hasan's court-martial, last-minute issues were addressed at a morning hearing. It's unclear if the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, will allow him to make that statement to potential jurors.\nHasan, an American-born Muslim, must wear a uniform during his murder trial. Military defendants usually wear a dress uniform during a court-martial. However, both sides and the judge have agreed that Hasan can wear a camouflage uniform worn by troops in combat because it better meets his health-related needs as a paraplegic.\nHasan was paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the rampage.\nHasan, 42, faces execution or life without parole if convicted in the rampage that killed 13 and wounded nearly three dozen on the Texas Army post.\nPotential jurors, who must be of Hasan's rank or higher, have already filled out a questionnaire prepared by prosecutors and the defense. The first pool of 20 potential jurors -- three majors, five lieutenant colonels and 12 colonels -- were to be brought in Tuesday afternoon from Army posts nationwide.\nHasan, who is serving as his own attorney but can get help from his former defense attorneys, will have a jury consultant on hand. Jury selection is expected to last at least a month, and once testimony starts in August, that could take another two months.\nGroups of 20 will be brought in each week until 13 jurors are chosen for Hasan's trial.

The story of Game of Thrones started in 1996 when author George R.R. Martin published his book titled A Game Of Thrones, which stands as his first entry in his A Song of Ice and Fire series. His series of novels is what HBO decided to adapt into Game of Thrones which came on the air in 2011.\nThe show has been running for seven seasons, but Game of Thrones very quickly became one of HBO's most popular TV shows. The series has a truly ensemble cast including actors like Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, and Lena Headey. All of these characters survived the end of season 7, but it is up in the air whether they will survive the eighth and final season. Thankfully, spoilers for the upcoming season haven't leaked yet, which is because HBO is taking special precautions to ensure that doesn't happen.\nAccording to EW, HBO is using new high-tech instruments to make sure drones cannot fly over filming locations called a \"Drone Killer\". Previously, Game of Thrones has had leaks due to flying drones and even actual photographers. As explained by actress Sophie Turner at New York Comic Con, \"If a drone flies above sets, there's a thing that can kill the drones, which is really cool. It creates a field around it and the drones just drop. It's very X-Men.\" While this new development will no doubt help contain spoilers on the highly anticipated season, the show has still had trouble in the past keeping elements of the plot a secret.\nLast August, hackers stole 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO which contained Game of Thrones scripts as well as the cast's personal information. The leak was a big blow to HBO as people were less inclined to tune in if the episodes had been spoiled. The filmmakers behind the newest season seem to not be playing games when it comes to season 8. In addition to this, the Game of Thrones scripts now supposedly vanish after the scenes have been filmed. It was also rumored that the show would film multiple endings, but those rumors have since been debunked by the cast.\nEven though Game of Thrones is still quite a ways away, the eighth season is looking to be the biggest one yet (despite being the shortest in number of episodes). After all, this season will feature the biggest battle in Game of Thrones history. The series will also have to effectively tie up each of the characters storylines and finally reveal who will sit atop the Iron Throne. Regardless of what HBO has in store for fans, they are doing everything they can to ensure that this season doesn't get spoiled early."}

Robert Sanders of the United States Geological Survey has stated there is no concern about a resulting tsunami from the early morning quake. According to KOIN, the National Weather Channel also decided not to issue a tsunami warning. No injuries from the earthquake or later aftershocks have been reported at this time. There have also been no reports of property damage.\nThe Pacific Northwest is especially vulnerable to earthquakes and resulting tsunamis, which have the potential to cause catastrophic damage. A fault line known as Cascadia Subduction Zone lies about 70 miles off the coast of the region, putting the entire area at risk.\nAs the Express explains, the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d has been experiencing a lot of activity recently. The Ring of Fire refers to a region that runs down the west coast of the United States and Canada, around the east coast of Asia, down to New Zealand, and stretching across to the tip of South America which marks an extremely potent fault line. Ninety percent of the world\u2019s earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire. In the last few days, more than 60 tremors have been reported along the fault lines.\nSome people are concerned that this is a sign of a catastrophic earthquake that seismologists believe the Ring of Fire is capable of releasing. In the past, the region has been responsible for some disastrous earthquakes. The strongest was an 8.2 on the Richter scale, which occurred in the Pacific Ocean close to Fiji and Tonga.\nFor some time now, experts have voiced concerns over the potential for a large scale earthquake in California. Seismologists have long theorized that the state would be the target of the Ring of Fire\u2019s most violent earthquake. Thomas Jordan of the Southern California Earthquake Center warns that any time there is seismic activity, the threat of a large quake goes up."}

On an 11th occasion, he downloaded the call.\nBeeman worked closely with the now-defunct \u201cspecial handling\u201d unit that managed informants in the Orange County jail. A four-year investigation by the Public Defender\u2019s Office found that prosecutors and deputies in the special unit were misusing jail informants to gain confessions and then convictions.\nUsing informants is a standard practice of law enforcement. But it is a civil rights violation to use informants on inmates who have attorneys and have been formally charged.\nProsecutors and deputies had developed a group of jailhouse informants who were strategically placed to obtain incriminating statements from targeted inmates. Defense attorneys alleged the practice had been going on for decades and began to unravel in 2014.\nAppellate justices said the \u201csnitch scandal\u201d indicated systemic problems in the the District Attorney\u2019s Office and Sheriff\u2019s Department. The problems prompted a Superior Court judge to remove the district attorney from the prosecution of mass killer Scott Dekraai, who shot and killed people in 2011 in Seal Beach. The judge also barred Dekraai from getting the death penalty, instead sentencing him to multiple terms of life in prison.\nOn the heels of that controversy comes the revelation that the sheriff\u2019s telephone contractor, Global Tel Link Corp., inadvertently recorded 1,079 calls from jail inmates to their attorneys. GTL attributed the problem to a software upgrade in January 2015. Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said she didn\u2019t learn of the breach until mid-June. The District Attorney\u2019s Office said it didn\u2019t learn of it until last week.\nRecords show that 58 phone conversations were accessed 87 times, mostly by sheriff\u2019s personnel. Beeman was among the most prolific in accessing the calls. Another former special handling deputy, Jacob Bieker, listened to one call, according to the documents.\nOne deputy, Eric Giummo, played one call and then downloaded 32 recordings. All the calls were to the same phone number.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department and the deputies declined a request for comment.\nThe Public Defender\u2019s Office is so concerned about the breach that it obtained a court order Monday from Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett banning all law enforcement, prosecutors and county officials from listening to or reviewing the recordings.\nPrickett also appointed a special master to take charge of the recorded conversations. As part of his order, any digital copies must be deleted or destroyed and hard copies must be turned over to the special master, who will be named later this week.\nProsecutors have identified 10 defendants whose conversations were breached and are in the process of notifying their attorneys, Deputy District Attorney John Maxfield said.\nMeanwhile, the Sheriff\u2019s Department provided the public defender with a list of"}

Picard wants UBS to pay a total of $2 billion, including damages, fees and any funds the company might have withdrawn from Madoff's firm before it collapsed.\nAs we allege in the complaint, Madoff's scheme could not have been accomplished unless UBS had agreed not only to look the other way, but also to pretend that they were truly ensuring the existence of assets and trades when in fact they were not and never did.\nSpecifically, the suit says UBS \"actively assisted\" Madoff by serving as the sponsor, custodian and administrator of the so-called feeder funds that pumped money into the scheme. That lent an \"aura of legitimacy\" to Madoff and allowed him to run the operation with no checks and balances, according to the complaint.\nThe 'fees' they received in their various roles were nothing more than 'fees' for looking the other way, and lending their prestigious name to legitimize and attract money.\nAs part of the suit against UBS, Picard is even going after the widow of deceased hedge fund manager Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet, who committed suicide after Madoff's scam came to light.\nDe la Villehuchet was co-founder of a firm, called Access International, that raised money for Madoff from European investors. After his death, his wife became the sole executor of his estate. Access International \"perpetuated the fraud by opening the door to substantial investments from Europe,\" the suit states.\nThe investment funds that funneled money to Madoff on behalf of their clients withdrew nearly $800 million from the firm in the three months before the scheme unraveled, and a total of $1.1 billion over six years. Picard wants that money back. Under the law, he had to file suit by next month in order to recover those funds.\nWhile Madoff's ruse was intricate, his crime was straightforward. Which is why UBS could find itself in trouble if Picard can show that the company did, in fact, carry on doing business with Madoff despite suspecting fraud. In a court of law, however, proving that someone was aware of fraud is usually no easy feat.\nInvestors in a fund that steered money to Madoff were recently awarded $12.7 million. That sum is a good indication that UBS will never come close to having to fork over $2 billion -- investor attorney always \"go long\" in such cases. But the company could well end up on the hook for a sizable settlement."}

(PVGSA), said solar panel floats are made of high-density polyethylene that withstands temperatures of up to 100 degrees Celsius and does not release organic solvents at room temperature.\nAbout 480 gigawatts of solar panels have been installed in over 200 countries around the world, and no toxic-related incidents have been reported, Kuo said.\nChen Kun-hung (\u9673\u5764\u5b8f), a Taiwan Photovoltaic Industry Association official, said Taiwan is the second largest producer of solar cells in the world, and exports to markets such as Europe, Japan, the United States, and China.\nThese Taiwanese businesses have also set up production facilities in Germany, the U.S., and Japan, and their production processes and products meet the high environmental safety standards of those markets, Chen said.\nSpeaking of environmental concerns when using cleaning agents, Kuo said cleaning agents do not have to be used as the angles at which solar panels are set enables rain to wash away dust and bird feces.\nOnly a high-pressure water spray is needed to clean the panels when it has not rained for a long period of time.\nAt the same time, many solar panel installations co-exist with agricultural and fishery farming spaces, and cleaning agents are therefore not used, Kuo said."}

The video went viral thrusting the hospital into the national spotlight.\nThe practice of patient dumping is a national problem that\u2019s hardly new.\nWhen the term was first coined in the late 1800s, it involved private hospitals sending poor patients to public hospitals, but it\u2019s come to mean any hospital that releases someone, usually a homeless and/or mentally ill person, to the streets rather than sending them to a shelter or appropriate services.\nThe New York Times first began writing about patient dumping in the 1870s when private hospitals were sending patients who couldn\u2019t afford their services to Bellevue Hospital, the city\u2019s public hospital, according to a 2011 report in the American Journal of Public Health.\nThe University of Maryland Medical Center\u2019s top executive apologized to a patient who was discharged and found on the street wearing only a thin hospital gown and socks outside its midtown facility, calling it an isolated incident.\nTraditionally, poor patients in the United States were largely treated by public or charitable hospitals. Private hospitals were under no obligation to admit patients and could refuse service to anyone.\nThat changed in 1986 when Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, which was signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law prohibited emergency rooms from denying hospital services to anyone even if they can\u2019t pay and also from transferring or discharging patients without first stabilizing them.\nThe Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, also requires that hospitals have a discharge plan. But discharge policies can differ widely by hospital.\nThe issue drew widespread national attention about a decade ago when the city of Los Angeles began a crackdown on patient dumping after several incidents there, particularly along Skid Row, where many of the city\u2019s homeless people live. The city has imposed millions of dollars in fines on hospitals for the practice.\nIn one particularly egregious incident, a paraplegic man was found crawling around Skid Row in 2007. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, which was accused of taking him there without a wheelchair, paid $1 million to settle that case.\nGood Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles had to pay $450,000 to settle allegations that it dumped a homeless patient on the street in 2014 after he was treated for a foot injury.\nThe Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas has been accused of shipping hundreds of patients out of Nevada, many of them to California, by bus, according to a 2014 report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on patient dumping. Multiple lawsuits alleged the hospital dropped patients off at the bus station with a prepaid ticket and a few days food and medicine.\nIn May 2017, two Howard University police officers and their supervisor were fired after being recorded dumping a patient from a wheelchair outside the university\u2019s hospital in Washington, according to reports in The Washington Post.

As an independent-minded Democrat, I will work with all parties regardless of their political affiliation. My work in co-authoring hate crime legislation, which passed unanimously in the House and Senate of Illinois and was signed into law, proves that I reach across the aisle to work with everyone to find bipartisan solutions.\nAs a lawyer, a co-author of legislation, a founder of a nonprofit organization, and a state-certified police instructor, I have been working on improving our county for years. Becoming a county board member allows me to broaden the work that I do to serve the people in the best way possible.\nQ. Describe two ways you would contribute to the board.\nDuPage County Board is involved in ordinances, regulations and contracts. As a lawyer, I am able to assist with analyzing ordinances and contracts to ensure efficiency and compliance. Out of all the candidates running for DuPage County Board in District 5, I am the only candidate that is an attorney.\nThe experience I have gained from co-authoring legislation in Illinois allows me to bring a unique skill set for the legislative agenda for the DuPage County Board. The legislative agenda is a platform to bring about policy changes for the board and the constituents of District 5.\nQ. Is there a specific service or amenity that is lacking in the county? If so, how do you propose to provide and fund it?\nWhile I was speaking with constituents in District 5, there were many that expressed concerns that there were not enough services for children and adults with special needs.\nI would like to help with this issue by tapping into nonprofits and other resources that we already have to provide more services without raising costs. As a nonprofit founder, I am able to connect with other nonprofits that may be able to assist with this issue at the county level.\nQ. With DuPage County's budget being squeezed by state funding cuts and other factors, what initiatives would you support to increase revenue and/or save money?\nI would look for ways to streamline county services and functions without sacrificing quality. We should investigate ways to cut costs wherever possible and make sure each and every tax dollar is being spent as efficiently as possible.\nUltimately, to increase revenue in DuPage County, we should avoid raising taxes, and instead look to expand our tax base through economic development. I would be a strong advocate for bringing new development projects to the county.\nQ. The county has been focused on consolidation of services and government agencies. How effective has that effort been and how could it be improved?\nI support the consolidation portion of the new ACT Initiative. The sharing of the Juvenile Detention facility with Kane County's facilities was impressive. It not only saved costs for DuPage County, but it also allowed us to build better relations with another county. Another good example of effective consolidation is the merger of the election commission with the county clerk's office. This cooperation and sharing of responsibilities makes us stronger.\nQ. What is the single most important issue facing your district and how should the county address it?\nProperty taxes are the most important issue facing my district and are causing many people to think about not only leaving DuPage County, but Illinois as well. As a lawyer who has been fighting to save families from losing their homes to foreclosure, I have seen too many of my own clients continue to struggle with their property tax payments, even after having a loan modification reduce their mortgage payments.\nAlthough only a small fraction of property taxes"}

Gouri received several of Israel's highest accolades for his work as a writer and poet, including the Bialik Prize and the Israel Prize.\nGouri was a prominent figure among Israel's founding generation, and his work is inextricably linked with much of the State of Israel's national ethos.

His parents, Gila and Yisrael Gurfinkel, arrived to Israel on a ship from Odessa in 1919. He grew up in a non-religious, socialist Zionist home. His father was a labor leader and politician who served as member of the Knesset for Mapai from its beginning in 1949 until his death in 1965.\nGouri went to the Kadoorie Agricultural High School; after graduating in 1941, he was one of the first to enlist in the Palmach, the elite pre-state strike force of the Haganah. He picked up the nickname \u201cJouri\u201d in the Palmach. Later, as a platoon commander in the 1st Battalion, he participated in a large number of underground military operations against the British. These included bringing ashore illegal Jewish immigrants from the ship \u201cHannah Szenes,\u201d the 1946 attack on the Stella Maris radar station in Haifa, and the same year, an operation called Night of the Bridges, in which the Palmach tried to blow up all the railway bridges connecting Palestine to its neighboring countries.\nAt the same time, he called himself the \u201ccourt poet\u201d and wrote a number of well-known poems, many of which were later turned into popular songs.\nHe remained in Europe and the newly founded Israel Defense Forces sent him to Czechoslovakia, where he was a commander in the first paratroopers course for the IDF, which trained Jewish soldiers who served as paratroopers in the Allied armies during World War II, along with refugees from Hungary. \u201cTo take a Holocaust refugee and turn him into a paratrooper is a great thing.

If you believe the forecasters, quite good. And a top-notch front four goes a long way, history says.\nThe Mets have $31.6 million invested in the quartet this year, a very reasonable price tag, especially with more than half of it ($17 million) going to deGrom. Looking at FanGraphs data, each pitcher\u2019s 2019 projections are forecast by a few various analytics prognosticators, all whom use some variation of player performance history (with recent years weighed more heavily), ballpark conditions, opposing lineups (the Mets play the bulk of their games against N.L. East clubs) and age curving. We\u2019ll go with the projections offered up by THE BAT, the analytical tool founded by Baseball Prospectus alum Derek Carty, though the numbers from other prognosticators are similar.\nStarting with deGrom, the numbers say he will regress as he turns 31 this year, but only to the point of going from superhuman to mere superstar. Projected for the Mets ace: 210 innings, 0.99 WHIP, 2.57 ERA and 269 strikeouts, or more than 11 Ks per nine innings. For Syndergaard, who will make $6 million in his age 27 season, he projects to 176 innings, 1.15 WHIP, a 3.27 ERA and better than a strikeout per inning. The ERA is a bit worse that than last year but still far better than the 2018 N.L. average of 4.02.\nZack Wheeler\u2019s breakthrough after the All-Star break last season doesn\u2019t figure to let up much in 2019, say the projections. Making the same $6 million as Syndergaard as he gets set to turn 29 in June, Wheeler figures to toss 171 innings (just under his 182 last season, for some reason) while pitching to a 1.2 WHIP, 8.8 strikeouts per nine innings, and 3.56 ERA that\u2019s half a run better than league average. For Matz, 27, who has been struggling on and off to stay healthy and find consistency since his impressive big league debut four years ago, the projected numbers have him at 162 innings with a 4.04 ERA and 1.29 WHIP while averaging just under a strikeout per inning, all very much around league average. The only lefty in the group, he\u2019ll make a relatively modest $2.6 million this year.\nProjections before the season are based on very solid data and sound reasoning, but they\u2019re still just that \u2013 projections. You can\u2019t take them to the bank. But if they are reasonably accurate, that\u2019s good news for the Mets\u2019 playoff chances.

But it's not going to go away. European leaders need to grasp the opportunity they have at the moment while markets are calm. With another reasonably sized bailout they can snuff out the problem in Portugal; instead, they're wishfully hoping it goes away on its own.\nThe ECB's Carlos Costa, who also heads the Bank of Portugal, today said it's \"not desirable\" to revisit the topic of Portugal's financing gap and that a second rescue is \"undesirable\".\nIt's a familiar story. For every sovereign default, there has been a government that has played wait-and-see, that has said \"Maybe the economy will pick up and bond yields will come down on their own.\" It never happens. If you don't \"desire\" to deal with it sooner, you always pay more later.\nThere is no sense in breaking down the Portuguese debt/revenue/repayment situation.

{"idx": "30558", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Deep recession in the US and Europe has gotten retailers asking some really pertinent questions, such as: \"Do I need to just sit in a shopping centre or on a high street and hope that customers come to me? Or can I go to the customers myself?\"\nThey may have hit on something, because shoppers increasingly expect retailers to be where they are and not the other way around.\nOf course, good conventional retail space, which includes well-located shopping centres, CBDs and suburban strips, will always be in demand. But these options are no longer enough for growth-oriented retailers.\nSmall and large retailers alike are increasingly marketing themselves and selling in unconventional locations, such as hospitals, museums, sports arenas, university campuses and office buildings.\nIn Britain for example, the news, books and stationery chain, WH Smith, is selling edited assortments of its customary inventory out of about 80 hospitals, an extension of its existing store portfolio in high streets, shopping centres, railway stations and airports.\nNow it has opened a unit in a Liverpool office block as well and according to media reports the retailer thinks it can open about 80 stores in office buildings, each occupying roughly 100 square metres.\nWH Smith?s gambit should not be lost on Australian retailers, given that the latter exist in a market where shopping centres are almost fully occupied and upward pressure on rents is as certain as death and taxes.\nA non-conventional location can provide a captive audience and potentially higher profitability than a store in a traditional retail node with a lot of competition, provided that the retailer edits its selection carefully for the specific target customer.\nGaining exposure to a new market need not involve any real estate risk at all. One way retailers can do this is by using temporary pop-up shops.\nPop-up shops (occasionally referred to also as \"guerilla stores\") are temporary shops set up either in an unusual location or in a more traditional retail space that is vacant. The purpose of the shop can sometimes just be to hype up the brand by selling a limited edition item.\nFor example, Nike once opened a store in New York?s SoHo district for four days to sell 250 pairs of limited edition shoes.\nGucci also recently opened a pop-up store in Manhattan to sell limited edition footwear. The store was to remain open for two weeks or until the shoes were sold, whichever came sooner. After that the show was to move on to Miami, London and Tokyo.\nMore often, the purpose of the store is to give a retailer some advance marketing and product testing in places where it doesn?t yet have a store.\nBefore opening a permanent shop in New York for example, Japanese fast fashion retailer Uniqlo drove two shipping containers around the city, popping up temporary stores right and left and then closing them just as quickly.\nPop-up stores often appear in non-traditional locations, like a Nike store that showed up on the campus of Hongik University in Seoul.\nDon?t think for a moment though that pop-ups are the exclusive province of the global superbrand. Recently, the rise in vacancy at US and European shopping centres has created a wealth of temporary store opportunities for retailers with no past, no particular reputation and in some case no future either.\nLandlords are glad to have them even if they are only paying for the lights to stay on while they scour the marketplace for a permanent tenant. Of course, if the pop-up concept works well, it could turn in to a longer-term opportunity.\nSome pop-ups are much less conventional."}

As a major public research university and a leading voice in the national conversation about issues vital to higher education, UB is an appropriate setting for such a discussion, Tripathi said.\nA member of the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), UB was praised this year as a national model for higher education reform by the New America Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, public policy institute.\nThe New America Foundation report highlighted UB as one of six \u201cnext generation\u201d universities nationwide, citing the university\u2019s innovative approaches to controlling costs and expanding student access while improving the quality of education. UB was noted, in particular, for working with Gov. Andrew M.

Neeta continues to use her powers for good, working as the Membership Director of SoundExchange, a nonprofit agency based in Washington, D.C. and authorized by the U.S. Copyright Office to collect royalties from digital broadcasters and pay them directly to performing artists. Founded in 2000 and initially part of the Recording Industry Association of America, SoundExchange made its first payments in 2001 and, after a slow beginning, has begun to double its annual collections. Recently, SoundExchange had come under fire for not doing enough to find those musicians, and see to it they get what they derserve. Those detractors couldn\u2019t be more wrong, as the Bakersfield Californian\u2019s Robert Price found out. Sound Exchange continues to find artists and their families, and for those that can\u2019t be found, their royalties reside in a general fund, to support their fellow deserving artists. In Price\u2019s December column, he detailed just how difficult it can be for Sound Exchange to find these artists, and how rewarding it can be when they do.\nIn a recent blogs, SoundExchange was taken to task for not doing enough to get royalties for artists like, T. Bone Burnett, Ton-Loc, Flock of Seagulls. As Neeta explained to me in a phone conversation last week, \u201cThat at the time of their release, any unclaimed funds would go towards SoundExchange\u2019s operating costs, thereby lowering the administrative fee charged. This would, then, in turn result in a larger payment being made to the featured artists and sound recording copyright owners who are paid by SoundExchange. There have been some artists who, upon hearing this explanation, chose not to claim their funds and opted instead to have their payments in essence redistributed among other featured artist and sound recording copyright owner payees in this manner.\u201d A noble way of giving back in the music world if ever there was one.\nLast December, Price wrote: \u201cBefore 1995, U.S. recording artists weren\u2019t entitled to airplay royalties of any sort. The Digital Performance in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 changed that \u2014 at least for Internet and satellite radio.\nThe nonprofit organization SoundExchange, authorized by the U.S. Copyright Office to collect and distribute royaltiesassociated with those specific media, started with a royalty pool of $5.2 million. About 90 percent of that money has been distributed to thousands of artists worldwide. Of the 9,000 performers identified as eligible in September, the group has located about 2,000.

Pour in wine and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned bits on bottom of pan. Let mixture simmer until thickened and reduced by about a third (about 5 minutes). Pour over lamb.\nIn a bowl, toss together scallions, spicy greens, and herbs. Sprinkle lamb with half the herb mixture and set remaining half aside for serving. Cover pan with two layers of foil (or heavy-duty foil) and bake until meat is falling off the bones, 3 to 3 1/2 hours total, turning shanks every hour so they cook evenly. If the bottom of the pan starts to dry out before lamb is done, add a few tablespoons of the stock or water to moisten it.\nWhen shanks are tender, transfer to a heated serving platter and cover with foil to keep warm. If you like, at this point you can tear the meat off the bones; or, serve the shanks bone-in.\nOn top of the stove, heat roasting pan over medium-low heat.

We might say they should have known better, except that in so many instances they manifestly did know the risks \u2014 and brushed them aside.\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard a very different origin story: A series of unfortunate mistakes and misjudgments let a species imported from another part of the world get loose into ours, etc. Like the starlings, perhaps, or buckthorn.\nTo be sure, \u201cOverrun\u201d is no mere history project. It\u2019s also an up-to-date threat assessment and a deft explanatory treatment of control techniques; the need for cooperative management policies (and their obstacles); and such scientific advances as carp-tracking through eDNA, which allows scientists to monitor the invasives\u2019 spread by sampling, say, their excreta.\nThe more familiar territory for general readers may be the recent detections, confirmed or disputed, of bighead, silver and black carp in new and treasured places of the Great Lakes basin; this gets up-to-date treatment in \u201cOverrun,\u201d informed by travel and firsthand observation.\nBigheads strike a prehistoric pose, as though forgotten by evolution. Large, wide-set eyes sit low on bulbous heads, their mouths hanging in a perpetual frown. In rare cases, bigheads reach 140 pounds and 7 feet in length, though 40 pounds and a length of 28 inches is standard \u2014 still big by American freshwater \ufb01sh standards. Silver carp also sport frowning mouths and scaly heads, heads that are, comparatively speaking, less bulging than the aptly-named bighead. They shade from silver and caramel-colored to olive green and can grow to 100 pounds, though 30 pounds is routine\u2026.\nThere is a fourth member of the Asian carp family \u2014 the black carp. They are equal to grass, silver and bighead carp in their voracious eating habits, though they eat snails and mollusks, including numerous end"}
{"idx": "30583", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Wireless networks are fast, easy, and full of security holes. Follow our ten tips to keep your LAN safe.\nBusinesses and home users are quickly adopting wireless networking\u0097and for good reason. It's cheap, convenient, easy to set up, and provides great mobility. In fact, more than one third of PC Magazine readers have already installed wireless networks in their homes. The freedom from tangled cables is intoxicating but comes with a price. A wireless network can broadcast far outside your building. With a powerful antenna and some widely available hacking software, anyone sitting near your installation\u0097or even driving by\u0097can passively (without alerting the target) scan all the data flowing in your network.\nWe pointed out a year ago in \"Wireless LANs at Risk\" (April 9, 2002) that most wireless setups have no security measures in place. By all accounts, little has changed. But this doesn't have to be the case. Here are ten security techniques you can implement right now.\n1. Control your broadcast area. Many wireless APs (access points) let you adjust the signal strength; some even let you adjust signal direction. Begin by placing your APs as far away from exterior walls and windows as possible, then play around with signal strength so you can just barely get connections near exterior walls. This isn't enough, though. Sensitive snooping equipment can pick up wireless signals from an AP at distances of several hundred feet or more. So even with optimal AP placement, the signal may leak. Keep reading.\n2. Lock each AP. A lot of people don't bother changing the defaults on their APs, and maintaining the default administrator password (like admin for Linksys products) makes your system a good target. Use a strong password to protect each AP. For tips on creating substantial passwords, go to www.pcmag.com/passwords and click on Password Dos and Don'ts.\n3. Ban rogue access points. If an AP is connected to your home or office network, make sure you or the network administrator put it there. Bob in Accounting isn't likely to secure his rogue AP before he connects it. Free software like NetStumbler (www.netstumbler.com) lets you sweep for unauthorized APs.\n4. Use 128-bit WEP. Passively cracking the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) security protocol is merely a nuisance to a skilled hacker using Linux freeware like AirSnort (http://airsnort.shmoo.com). Still, the protocol does at least add a layer of difficulty.\n5. Use SSIDS wisely. Change the default Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) for your APs, and don't use anything obvious like your address or company name. For corporate setups, buy APs that let you disable broadcast SSID. Intruders can use programs such as Kismet (www.kismetwireless.net) to sniff out SSIDs anyway (by observing 802.11x management frames when users associate with APs), but again, every bit of inconvenience helps.\n6. Limit access rights. Chances are, not everyone in your building needs a wireless card. Once you determine who should take to the airwaves, set your APs to allow access by wireless cards with authorized MAC addresses only. Enterprising individuals can spoof MAC addresses, however, which brings us to the next tip.\n7. Limit the number of user addresses. If you don't have too many users, consider limiting the maximum number of DHCP addresses the network can assign,"}

Shovels hit the ground in May of last year, but only about $56 million in funding has been secured.\nThree levels of government have committed $35 million \u2014 $15 million each from the federal and provincial governments, and $5 million from the City of Winnipeg.

These reforms have been aimed at achieving a transition from a state-dominated economy, where all the key sector of the economy are dominated by government parastatals to transit into a market-driven economy that opens all sector of economy to private sector competition.\n\u201cNow, in the course of these reforms, many government agencies and companies have been privatised in the last ten years or have been opened up for competition. The purpose of the reform is to ensure that where government has constituted a clog in the wheel of progress, particularly in key sectors, we opened them up to ensure increased private sector investments.\n\u201cIn the course of these reforms, it has become very clear that unless we undertake serious policy legal framework to ensure competition in the economy, what will happen is that the previous monopoly exercised by government companies or parastatals in the key sectors of the economy will simply be repeated by private sector monopoly as people who buy these companies may block further development of the sector unless you have in place a legal framework that regulates competition in the economy,\u201d Maku added.\nWhile noting that the Nigerian economy at present has no specific agency that deals with the issues of abuse of trade practices, anti-trust and monopolies, the minister stressed that such agency must be in place in every open economy if competition was to thrive towards developing the economy.\nAccording to the minister, \u201cWherever you do not have legal framework to regulate the economy, to prevent anti-trust, to prevent abuse of trade practices, what happens is that one or two companies could quickly take over and monopolise sectors of the economy and prevent other people from coming in."}

{"idx": "30615", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: \u201dRemember, remember the fifth of November\u201d. And not because of gunpowder, treason and plot. But because an explosive Leica Akademie workshop took place, which was attended by winners of a Pocket-lint competition for the chance to get their hands on the latest Leica SL full-frame mirrorless camera under expert instruction.\nThe workshop, led by Leica Akademie tutor, Robin Sinha, was based around photographing the Regent Street Motor Show in London. The show, which has been running for 120 years, sees the capital's iconic street shut to traffic, to make room for traffic of a whole other kind: vintage cars aplenty are on display, as are their owners, adorned with attire of the era.\nIt's the perfect place to go shooting street photography, without feeling too exposed yourself. So many eye-catching subjects make it easier to sleuth around and find those perfect decisive moments.\nWith Leica SL in hand, complete with 24-90mm f/2.8-4 lens to be able to zoom in on the action as needed, our four attendee photographers - Nick Board, Peter Ramsay, Siraj Yusuf, and Nicholas Redhead - went exploring solo for a couple of hours in the brisk cold to see just what they could achieve with the camera.\nFirst, a little foresight about what the Leica SL is all about. As a brand new Leica system, revealed in 2015, the SL was the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to market, showing the German company's progressive view towards new technologies.\nAmong those is the EyeRes viewfinder, a 4.4-million dot electronic viewfinder that is higher-resolution than anything else you'll find on the market today. It's about as close to a traditional optical viewfinder as you can get, plus it brings the benefit of various electronic overlays and details during shooting - if you want them.\nShooting in among a sea of spectators on Regent Street posed a challenge, but also as an opportunity. The various bodies became useful for framing, say for obscuring part of the frame to highlight the intended subject, and with eyes pressed to finders the world feels shut away, out of sight.\nNot that it's all about the viewfinder. The SL's autofocus system can be commanded by simply pressing a finger on the camera's rear touchscreen, or by using the rear toggle control to manually position it. Pair that with an autofocus system with 529 spot positions and the world, as they say, is your oyster.\nAnd make no bones about it: the SL is super-quick to snap subjects into focus, whether in single autofocus for still subjects, or continuous autofocus for moving ones - which is handy when people are so prone to moving or suddenly spotting that they're being photographed.\nBurst shooting became another useful tool. The SL is capable of shooting at up to 11 frames per second - yep, eleven - at its full 24-megapixel resolution, which is on par with the pro cameras that you'll see used at the Olympics. Snapping a subject on repeat in this way will glean those in-between moments and give more options to source the one that's the pick of the bunch. It'll make a bit more noise whilst doing so, too, but as cameras go the SL's shutter is subdued in the best possible way.\nAnd when let loose, the most interesting thing to come from the workshop was the way the four different photographers saw their surroundings"}

They also evaluated the 25 firearm state laws implemented in 2009 and examined state-specific characteristics that may factor into firearm mortality such as unemployment rate.\nOut of the 29 state laws analyzed, 24 are applied in Massachusetts.\nUniversal background checks would potentially reduce firearm death rates by 57 percent, Bindu Kalesan, a co-author of the study, wrote in an email. Combined with background checks on ammunitions, the rate would drop by 83 percent, she wrote.\nSome firearm control laws are not as effective because laws vary by states, creating certain issues when people bring guns across state lines, Kalesan wrote.\nGun control is a complex and multifaceted issue, argued Sandro Galea, another one of the study\u2019s co-authors. Though gun control laws are associated with unwanted consequences, Galea added that they do not cause harm.\nSeveral BU students said universal gun control is necessary to ensure the safety of gun owners and innocent people. Leo Huang, a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, said though people should be able to own guns, a proper education on usage is crucial before anyone can purchase a gun.\nGurvir Dhaliwal, a senior in the Questrom School of Business, said the best method to control guns is to reduce the supply and demand of the firearm market.\nClaire Sheehan, a freshman in the College of General Studies, said she is in favor of more background checks, as guns have become easier to purchase compared to products that have been deemed less dangerous.\nThe problem is, a number of well-respected gun mortality researchers not connected to the effort just aren\u2019t buying it.\n\u201cBriefly, this is not a credible study and no cause and effect inferences should be made from it,\u201d Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Center for Gun Policy & Research, told the Washington Post.\nDavid Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, explained the laws cited by Kalesan\u2019s group aren\u2019t that strong and the predicted impact of dropping gun deaths by 90 percent is wildly optimistic.\n\u201cI would just be flabbergasted; I\u2019d bet the house if you did [implement] these laws, if you had these three laws and enforced them really well and reduced gun deaths by 10 percent, you\u2019d be ecstatic,\u201d said Hemenway.\nA third researcher, James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, argued that in other countries that have adopted harsh gun control schemes, which included massive buybacks and destruction of privately owned firearms, such dramatic declines in firearms deaths were not observed."}

But the days of motorists calling to report potholes may someday be a thing of the past.\nInstead, networks of self-powered wireless sensors would be laid under the road surface, providing regular updates on road conditions to transportation planners, drivers with connected cars and other parties.\nThat\u2019s the promise of ePave, a joint project involving UB computer scientists and researchers from China\u2019s Chang\u2019an University.\n\u201cWe want to detect road faults before they happen, and ultimately help motorists avoid traffic accidents due to damaged roads,\u201d says Wenyao Xu, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UB, and one of the project\u2019s co-leaders.\nThe idea of embedding sensors in pavement is not new. An example of this are the buried sensors at intersections that prompt traffic lights to change if another vehicle is crossing the road. These systems are powered by wires that connect to traffic lights.\nMany researchers are trying to create more intelligent systems using wireless technology. This could allow entire roads to be monitored, including traffic and sub-surface conditions, such as pressure and moisture levels, that can be a sign that potholes or other road faults are developing.\nMany proposed wireless systems focus on batteries. The trouble with that idea, Xu says, is that transportation planners would need to tear up the road to replace the batteries. Other alternative power sources include solar, mechanical and thermal energy, or harvesting ambient radio signals. Yet each faces limitations with cost, installation, maintenance and other issues.\nePave attempts to work around these issues by harnessing piezoelectricity \u2014 the same type of electric charge used by electric cigarette lighters and acoustic guitar pickups \u2014 from the mechanical stress that vehicles put on roads.\nEach sensor is about the size of a key fob. Tests with a prototype suggest they can be placed as much as 500 feet apart. At two to three centimeters below the road, they can harvest and store enough energy to regularly detect moisture, pressure and other helpful information. It can then send this data every 10 minutes to relay stations as far as 1,000 feet away.\nThese relay stations could be built into street lights or similar structures, and the data could then be transmitted to a network via underground cables. In turn, that information could then be shared with transportation planners, connected cars and others.\nWhile promising, ePave is not yet ready for the roads. Researchers plan to continue studying the system, including the life of the piezoelectric module, which they hope will last at least five years and possibly as long as 20 years. They\u2019re also examining how to best embed the sensors, ways to reduce costs and other matters.\nMore information on the system can be found in a study in the journal Sensors."}

The group's Twitter profile earlier today said 8,600 unique Tumblr users were affected.\nTumblr didn't explain what happened but said in a blog post that no accounts were compromised, and users didn't need to take any further action.\n\"Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience,\" the company said. \"As always, we are going to great lengths to make sure this type of abuse does not happen again.\"\nWhen the viral post first started circulating, Tumblr advised users to immediately log out of all browsers that might have been using Tumblr. It also said its engineers were working to resolve the issue as swiftly as possible.\nA spokeswoman later updated CNET at about 10:30 a.m. PT, saying Tumblr engineers \"resolved the issue of the viral post attack that affected a few thousand Tumblr blogs earlier today.\"\nWhen visiting an infected Tumblr site, users would see an expletive-laden post urging them to commit suicide. The spam also said deleting the post would delete the user's Tumblr account. Visitors also saw a pop-up asking them to confirm they wanted to leave the page.\nSophos, a provider of security software and hardware, including antivirus products, thinks it has figured out how the worm spread so quickly on Tumblr. The firm noted in a blog post that the worm appeared to take advantage of Tumblr's reblogging feature, meaning that anyone who was logged into Tumblr would automatically reblog the infectious post if they visited one of the offending pages.\nSophos noted that each affected post had malicious code embedded inside, and it spread sort of like a Web virus. Chester Wisniewski, a Sophos senior security adviser, said someone found a way to bypass Tumblr's filters by possibly hijacking a legitimate message from Tumblr about site maintenance.\nHe added that such an attack could have been prevented, and that the situation has happened to many other social media sites. Programmers build Web pages that can't be hacked, but there are also tens of thousands of ways to inject code on a page, he said. Sometimes it's difficult for newer companies to identify and plug all of those holes.\n\"It was preventable, but this type of thing happens to most social media sites at some point in their youth,\" Wisniewski told CNET. \"Hopefully, Tumblr will learn and lock its site down tighter, and we don't [sic] see it happen again.\"\nCybersecurity has increasingly been a concern for social media, blogs, and other online outlets.

One year after, these areas have yet to recover from the devastation. The survivors continue to mourn for the dead and the missing. The footprints of Yolanda in flattened dwellings, destroyed public infrastructures and a blighted environment have remained visible to this day to haunt the nation.\nCan we avoid or reduce the deadly consequences of a disaster like Yolanda?\nTyphoons are a regularly occurring phenomenon in our country. Our current communication and information facilities can already divine days ahead the occurrence of a typhoon, its direction, its strength and speed, the volume of rain it brings, and the moment of landfall. Moreover, there are areas in the country that are known as typhoon paths, precisely because typhoons visit or pass these places almost predictably. These typhoon paths, notably in southern Luzon and eastern Visayas, have not changed much through the years despite the recent aberration of Typhoon Sendong (2011) in northeastern Mindanao and Typhoon Pablo (2012) in Davao Oriental.\nIf typhoons in this country are annual happenings, the number of which at times exceeds the letters in the alphabet, and if they are almost 100 percent that predictable in occurrence in certain places, there is no reason why we cannot avoid or reduce their catastrophic consequences. Indeed, while the present level of human knowledge and technology is still far from adequate to stop, divert or slow down raging typhoons, their devastating impacts can certainly be minimized through thorough planning and preparations.\nDespite the long string of disasters that this country has experienced through the years, it is only very recent that the national government has confronted the concern squarely with the passage of Republic Act 10121, otherwise known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.\nNeedless to say, the major responsibility for any disaster lies in the local government units (LGUs) \u2013 at the barangay, municipal/city and provincial government units where the event is expected to happen. The preparation starts with coming up with a disaster risk and management plan, the details of which may include among others the identification of disaster risk areas (risk mapping); coming up with disaster response strategies; public education; formation of warm bodies of responders; identification or establishments of secured evacuation centers; transports and rescue facilities; preparation of emergency food, water, clothing and medical supplies; and providing security and order in evacuation centers and of communities left behind.\nIn the advent of Yolanda, that is 3 years after the passage of RA 10121, it was evident that both the national and the local governments were ill-prepared for the calamity. The preparation and the overall capacity to respond was no match to the ferocity of the impending disaster.\nWhile the Super Typhoon had been announced several days earlier to be violently strong with the great possibility of an accompanying storm surge, the planners at all levels failed to develop a big"}

A Z Backscatter Van is a mobile threat detection system that uses X-Rays to quickly scan through vehicles and buildings for hidden explosives and contraband.\nAnother contract calls for Rapiscan Systems to develop a walk-through x-ray screening system that could be deployed at entrances to special events or other points of interest. The contract calls for a scanning system that could be installed in corridors and likely scan people walking through it without them knowing it, McCall said.\nAmong the tools mentioned in the DHS documents is an X-Ray Backscatter system that could detect concealed metallic and high-density plastic objects on people from up to 10 meters away.\nThe language used in many of the documents suggests that the DHS plans to use the scanners mostly in a covert fashion, McCall said. \"The DHS believes it has very wide authority to implement its national security goals,\" she added.\nIt's unclear whether the projects have been completed, she said.\nMcCall contended that the use of such technologies to scan individuals without notice would be an invasion of privacy and a violation of Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable search.\nIn addition, the use of such technologies also raises several questions about the potential radiation risks that people could be exposed to, she said.\n\"In fact, the radiation risk is discussed several times in these documents,\" she said.\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJaikumar Vijayan covers data security and privacy issues, financial services security and e-voting for Computerworld.

And while Kani was not necessarily a well-known figure outside of his own country, his death may have international significance: he was the chairman of Iran\u2019s Assembly of Experts, the body that will choose the next Supreme Leader of Iran.

It is unfair to the person against whom an allegation is made and to the institution as a whole to constantly have wild and unsubstantiated allegations in the press and social media against judges who cannot defend themselves.\n\u201cMany of these allegations which are given widest publicity have the effect of seriously damaging the judiciary and eroding public confidence.\nJustice Kekere-Ekun also reminded senior members of the Nigerian Bar that it was their duty to preserve the ethics and dignity of the legal profession by setting good example.\nHe urged them not to allow the days of the likes of late Rotimi Williams, GOK Ajayi, Kehinde Sofola and others, when young lawyers usually comported themselves at the sight of senior lawyers, to become extinct.\nSpeaking on the topic, \u201cDangers of a compromised and incompetent judiciary,\u201d Oditah listed lack of institutional capacity, lack of jurisdictional clarity between the federal and the state high courts, lack of procedural fairness in court processes, lack of a reliable and effective appeal system with a strong filter system, lack of a robust regime of award of costs in litigation and lack of an effective judgment enforcement regime as some of the challenges that the Nigerian judiciary had to surmount."}

There\u2019s another side howling over the governor\u2019s proposed 30-cent increase in the state cigarette tax.\n\u201cThe governor is missing a great opportunity to dramatically improve the health of Virginians children and save taxpayers money,\u201d said Keenan Caldwell, director of government relations for the American Cancer Society and one of the co-chairs of Virginians for a Healthy Future, which is advocating a 90-cent-per-pack increase on the state cigarette tax, which currently sits at 30 cents a pack.\n\u201cA 30-cent increase will generate some revenue for the state, but it will not have a substantial impact on health,\u201d Caldwell said.\nKaine in his budget message to members of the Virginia General Assembly two weeks ago cited the costs borne by state taxpayers to provide Medicaid to Virginians for smoking-related illnesses as being an estimated $400 million a year. The 30-cent-a-pack levy raises an estimated $167 million a year for the state coffers, meaning \u201cVirginians have to pay another $233 million a year in taxes just to support Medicaid costs related to smoking. I believe that the taxes on smoking should pay for the budget costs incurred because of smoking,\u201d said Kaine, who estimates that the proposed 30-cents-a-pack increase will generate an additional $148 million annually for the Health Care Fund that supports Medicaid.\n\u201cThis still will not fully cover smoking\u2019s costs, but the taxpayer subsidy will be significantly reduced,\u201d said Kaine, noting that the tax even with the sharp increase would still leave the Virginia cigarette tax at about half the national average.\nThe 90-cent increase being pushed by Virginians for a Healthy Future would bring us up to that average, and would also more than cover the costs that state taxpayers incur to provide Medicaid coverage for smoking-related illnesses, which are projected to be on the upswing as the baby boomers age into retirement.\nAnother benefit would be to reduce smoking particularly among children. Virginians for a Healthy Future points to studies indicating that for every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes ther is a corresponding drop in youth smoking by about 7 percent and overall cigarette consumption by about 4 percent. And extrapolating from data from a study conducted by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, a 90-cent increase in Virginia could prevent 83,400 Virginia kids from becoming smokers, prompt 44,100 adult smokers to quit, and prevent 38,200 adults and kids from premature, smoking-caused deaths."}

The first was in Florida in 2016 and the second was in California in March.\nIn both cases, vehicle logs revealed that the drivers in both cases did not respond to vehicle warnings to retake control before the accidents.\nAfter the Florida crash, I urged anyone driving a Tesla to never take his or hands off the wheel, for any reason. Since then, I've had the chance to sample Autopilot in several new Teslas, including the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, and my view hasn't changed. There's no way Autopilot can drive a car by itself.\nLet me stress: This is my opinion, based on my personal experience with Autopilot in a Model S, a Model X, and the Model 3. In the interest of journalism, I've periodically taken my hands off the wheel and monitored the Tesla systems, responding to warnings to better understand the system.\nBut Business Insider hasn't conducted a scientific analysis of Autopilot's capabilities, and when we've compared the system with other semi-self-driving setups, we've tried to be clear that we haven't spent months reviewing the technology.\nTesla more or less agrees with me and now tells owners that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving, hands-free technology, and that when it's operating, drivers should be prepared to take control of their vehicles when prompted. The system will deactivate if they ignore these warnings.\nGet those hands back on the wheel!\nBut the Autosteer aspect of Autopilot continues to tempt drivers to go hands-free. Tesla argues that Autopilot makes driving safer and reduces the likelihood of a fatality, and I'm OK with giving the company the benefit of the statistics. The suite of features offered by Autopilot may very well assist a human driver in avoiding a tragic mishap.\nThe problem is that Tesla can't force drivers to conduct themselves properly with Autosteer, and obviously some drivers are ignoring my advice.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board investigated the Florida crash and found that Autopilot contributed to the accident. \"The Tesla driver's pattern of use of the Autopilot system indicated an over-reliance on the automation and a lack of understanding of the system limitations,\" the NTSB investigators concluded.\nThey added: \"If automated vehicle control systems do not automatically restrict their own operation to conditions for which they were designed and are appropriate, the risk of driver misuse remains\" and the \"way in which the Tesla 'Autopilot' system monitored and responded to the driver's interaction with the steering wheel was not an effective method of ensuring driver engagement.\"\nThe NTSB may draw different conclusions from the California accident, which is being investigated.

The Courant's faction, covering about 60 reporters, editors and photographers, would become a unit under the union's local chapter, The Providence Newspaper Guild.\nKathleen McWilliams, a reporter for the Courant, said she has witnessed the newsroom \"decimated and demoralized by buyouts and layoffs\" during her three years at the 254-year-old paper. Job cuts at the publication have gone on much longer than that.\n\"I've watched our workloads increase without commensurate compensation and I've grown deeply concerned as my colleagues and I struggle to maintain the quality of our publication while corporate managers take home $5 million bonuses,\" McWilliams said Monday.\nMcWilliams said organizers informed local management about their united efforts to unionize on Monday morning. Ideally, the group hopes corporate officials at Tribune will quickly recognize their proposed guild so labor negotiations can begin, she said.\nIn a statement Monday evening, Andrew Julien, the Courant's publisher and editor-in-chief, said he has received the staff's letter asking to recognize the guild and is looking into the request.\nIn November, McWilliams said 12 veteran Courant newsroom staffers took a voluntary buyout offered to Tribune employees as the media company worked to save on overhead costs.\nShe said the newsroom began plotting a path toward unionization in October and formed a committee to outline their next course of action. Many workers, McWilliams said, started to realize the urgency of the movement amid November's buyout period, when a few members of the committee actually accepted buyout offers from Chicago based-Tribune.\nTribune, which owns the Courant and eight other newspapers, is still searching for a buyer after it was nearly acquired by McClatchy in December.\nMeantime, average print circulation at the Hartford paper has dropped 32 percent over the last three years to 60,265 in the third quarter of 2018, according to Alliance for Audited Media figures.\nIn 2014, Hartford Business Journal reported the Courant's newsroom workforce peaked in 1994 at 400 employees and fell to 135 employees in 2009.\nMcWilliams said the newsroom currently has 62 employees who are not in management posts.

The letter, provided to reporters Friday, asked Matson to tell the state when the pipeline was repaired.\nVic Angoco, Matson\u2019s senior vice president for Pacific operations, said the company responded by inspecting the pipeline twice\u2014at high and low tide\u2014but didn\u2019t see any molasses leaking. The company also didn\u2019t see any molasses in the water, he said.\nMore than 26,000 fish and other marine species in Honolulu Harbor suffocated and died as the molasses spread and sank to the ocean floor about 5 miles west of Waikiki\u2019s hotels and beaches. The spill happened in an industrial area of Honolulu Harbor west of downtown, where Matson loads molasses and other goods for shipping.\nGrune said the inspector saw the leak while looking for storm water discharge. Harbor tenants are responsible for inspecting their own pipelines, not the Transportation Department, Grune said.\nA separate state crew in the harbor noticed molasses dripping in May, but Grune said the department didn\u2019t tell Matson.\nGrune blamed the department\u2019s failure to notify Matson of the second instance on a \u201cbreakdown in our procedures and practices.\u201d The department needs to improve on this, he said.\nAngoco said the company didn\u2019t have a plan to respond to a molasses spill\u2014despite being notified of the dripping pipe last year\u2014because molasses is an unregulated product.\n\u201cThat being said, in hindsight, now we need to look at what happened, how it happened, move forward and you can bet we\u2019re going to develop a response plan for molasses should we continue to move molasses in the future,\u201d Angoco said.\nGrune said the department will require harbor tenants to inspect their pipelines and have a spill response plan for all products.\nIt will also ask tenants to let the department know the date of their most recent inspections, the inspection findings and the status of any fixes that need to be made, he said.\n\u201cAlthough Matson has taken responsibility for the spill, DOT is looking for ways to tighten up the checks and balances in the system that can help prevent another incident of this type,\u201d Grune said.\nGary Gill, state Department of Health deputy director, said he recently heard about similar spills in other states, like when large numbers of fish died after a highway tanker discharged corn syrup into a river.\nGill said he expects a national review of such \u201cfood handling infrastructure\u201d to be conducted to determine whether any new state or federal regulations might be needed.\nFederal and state officials have largely relied on natural water currents and weather to dilute and flush the molasses out of the harbor and a nearby lagoon.

Just like in 1922\u2019s Nanook Of The North, Bell tackles a vanishing way of life \u2013 an ancient people in a harsh, unforgiving climate \u2013 and one might be forgiven for thinking it celebrates a wilful anachronism as it slides over history\u2019s horizon. But you\u2019d be wrong: there is enough of the new and the now to make this enthralling viewing.\nBut here modernity creeps in: we glimpse a motorbike, a solar panel, transistor radios, and Aisholpan herself, who wants to be the first female eagle-hunter ever. Much to the consternation of the conservative old men who govern the sport (as it is now): too weak, too young, too inept, they say, she should be cooking and cleaning.\nTell that to Aisholpan!

Groat, 50, who was arrested on Thursday, is the third in four years involving major espionage at the C.I.A. Mr. Groat, a $70,000-a-year technician who had worked undercover abroad for most of his 16 years at the agency before he was dismissed in October 1996, faces the death penalty if convicted of spying.\nThe Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, called the case ''extremely serious'' but said he did not yet know how deep the damage ran.\nThe C.I.A. is still recovering from the treason of one turncoat, Aldrich H. Ames, who caused the deaths of a dozen foreign agents, and another, Harold J. Nicholson, who gave Russia the names of three years' worth of graduates from the agency's school for spies.\n''During Groat's employment with the C.I.A.,'' said Wilma A. Lewis, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, ''he participated in classified covert operations aimed at the penetration of cryptographic systems of foreign governments.'' In other words, Mr. Groat's job was to be a thief, stealing and cracking secret codes.\nMr. Groat, an Army officer, a police officer, a county sheriff's process server, a prison guard and a United States marshal in the eight years before he joined the C.I.A. in 1980, stands accused of extraordinary crimes of espionage.\nCode-stealing and code-breaking are among the most secret operations of United States intelligence. They allow the United States to read the mail and eavesdrop on the conversations of foreign governments. Disclosing the ways in which United States intelligence does this work could shut down operations aimed at the governments under surveillance. The statutes forbidding those disclosures allow the death penalty for doing so.\nShortly after noon today, in a Federal courtroom shielded by thick, bulletproof glass, Mr. Groat, wearing blue prison garb, a short beard and a dark mien, entered a plea of not guilty through a public defender.\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose agents arrested Mr. Groat, were unusually secretive about the case. They said that to disclose which nations were tipped off by Mr. Groat, or where he had served overseas, would gravely endanger American national security.\nMs. Lewis called the case ''an extremely sensitive matter.'' Mr. Dubelier said the Government would invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act, which is designed to shield Government secrets from disclosure at a public trial.\nThe Government unsealed an indictment today containing a few bare facts. Only four pages long, it said that in March and April 1997, Mr. Groat had told two foreign governments about how the United States went about ''the targeting and compromise of the cryptographic systems'' those nations used.

Now, you\u2019ll never hear this being discussed anywhere. You\u2019ll never see CNN do a panel discussion for four hours on how Limbaugh accurately predicted an assault on the profit sector in health care. Well, where\u2019s Obama? Yeah, the woman on the ABC primetime special who asked if her \u2014 that still gives me the creeps, that ABC primetime special back in 2009 where an American citizen, a woman, stood up and asked the president of the United States \u2014 this is before we even had Obamacare \u2014 if her 100-year-old mother would be given a pacemaker. I tell you what\u2019s creepy about it is what have we become? A citizen has to go on a network TV show and hopefully get the chance to ask the president whether or not he will approve her mom getting a pacemaker.\nWhat business is it of his? But there she was asking the question. Her real point was (paraphrasing exchange), \u201cLook, my mom is a hundred years old, and she really likes to live. She got a great spirit, a great will to live. Will you factor that in when making these kinds of decisions?\u201d And Obama said, \u201cNo. That\u2019s too nebulous. The will to live? How do you assess that? No, probably the compassionate thing to do is just give them a pill.\n\u201cZone \u2019em out for their remaining, short moments on the planet and give them all love you can and then wave good-bye at the last moment. That\u2019s it.\u201d And all because they don\u2019t have the money. The government\u2019s gonna run it and they don\u2019t have the money. So, anyway, \u201cA shareholder might even applaud the creativity with which profit-seeking institutions go about seeking profit. But the consequences of this pursuit might not be so great for other stakeholders in the system \u2014 patients, for instance.\n\u201cOne study found that patients\u2019 mortality rates spiked,\u201d that means they went up for those of you in Rio Linda, \u201cwhen nonprofit hospitals switched to become profit-making, and their staff levels declined.\u201d So get this: Profit-making leads to more death. Hospitals seeking profit equals a higher mortality rate. It\u2019s right here in the New York Times. \u201cThese profit-maximizing tactics,\u201d so now seeking profit is a tactic, \u201cpoint to a troubling conflict of interest that goes beyond the private delivery of health care.\n\u201cThey raise a broader, more important question: How much should we rely on the private sector to satisfy broad social needs?\u201d Folks, this is just the first four paragraphs of this New York Times story, and it\u2019s all here. Everything that our future holds is right here in these four photographs. Profit in the health care system, bad. Nonprofits, good. Private sector"}

Thanks to the work of plant breeders, we now have varieties that thrive in bright sunlight where we can see the brilliantly colored foliage to its best advantage. Sun-loving varieties are thirstier than their shade garden relatives, and they need a rich, organic soil that manages moisture well. You can also grow them in outdoor containers or as houseplants. Coleus is hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zone 10, and can be grown as an annual in cooler zones.\nPinch back the tips of the stems monthly, beginning when the young plants are 5 inches tall. Grasp the top 1/2 inch of the stem between your thumbnail and finger and squeeze. Pinching off the growth tips stimulates the plant to form foliage and lateral branches that make it look full and bushy. When the plant forms side branches, pinch them as well.\nSpread a 2-inch layer of mulch around the plants when they are about 6 inches tall. Mulch keeps the soil evenly moist by slowing evaporation.\nWater newly planted coleus often enough to keep the surface of the soil moist for the first month or until the plants are established and growing. Water slowly and deeply when the soil is dry to a depth of 2 inches thereafter.\nFertilize monthly with 1 tablespoon of high-nitrogen fertilizer for each square foot of bed. Scratch the fertilizer into the surface of the soil with a cultivating tool, but take care not to injure the roots.\nPinch off the flower spikes as they appear, if desired. Most types of coleus produce flowers that detract from the appearance of the plant, but a few of the newer sun coleus varieties have long, graceful spikes that appear in a cluster on top of the plant. If you pinch them off you'll have larger foliage, but many people think these spikes of tiny flowers are worth keeping.\nMixing several varieties of sun coleus leaf colors and patterns makes the garden look chaotic. Choose only one type for each section of the garden.\nColeus cuttings root in less than a month in a glass of water. Use cuttings to make new bedding plants or root them at the end of the season to use as winter houseplants.\nCarroll, Jackie. \"How to Care for Sun Coleus.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/care-sun-coleus-69149.html.

Also hurt were Turkey's sense of security, its peace, and its tourism industry.\nIn the first hours of the attack, who had carried out the attack was unclear, as the usual suspects included not just the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL), but also Kurdish militants affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). I pointed to ISIL as the likely culprit, as this was an attack that hit Western tourists, which would not be strategically helpful to the PKK, but would be desirable by ISIL.\nIn a couple of hours, the Turkish government announced that the suicide bomber was an ISIL militant: a Saudi-born Syrian citizen. Nabil Fadli, 27, had entered Turkey from Syria very recently. The press also found a photo of him, taken last week when he was in an official office in Istanbul for some paperwork.\nThe question, then, is that if it was ISIL, why did they hit Turkey right in the heart of Istanbul? ISIL militants had carried out two other deadly suicide attacks inside Turkey in the past six months - one in Suruc on July 20 and another in Ankara on October 10, killing a total number of 135 people.\nBoth of those bloody attacks, however, were directed at a specific ideological target: the secular, left-wing, pro-Kurdish political line in Turkey.\nIn that sense, both of those attacks could be seen as the encroachment of the ISIL-Kurdish war into Turkish territory, or, as I argued then, the spilling of the Syrian civil war into Turkey.\nThe target was not the secular, left-wing, pro-Kurdish line; it was random tourists, an iconic Istanbul site, and ultimately Turkey itself.\nYet, the latest on Sultanahmet Square was of a different kind. The target was not the secular, left-wing, pro-Kurdish line; it was random tourists, an iconic Istanbul site, and ultimately Turkey itself.\nOn New Year's Eve, Turkish policemen had arrested two would-be suicide bombers who were planning another deadly attack in Kizilay, the very heart of Ankara, during the midnight celebrations.\nBoth that unsuccessful plot in Ankara and the sadly successful in one Istanbul show that ISIL is now targeting Turkey directly, with a focus on soft targets.\nThis should come as no surprise, since the conflict between Turkey and ISIL has been deepening since last July, after the first major suicide attack in Suruc and following a United States-Turkey deal allowing US warplanes to use the Incirlik airbase in southern Turkey against ISIL.\n\"Oh, Istanbul, you have allowed disbelief in your avenues.

Its first-quarter e-commerce sales grew 63%, followed by 60% year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Gross merchandise volume is growing even faster as Wal-Mart brings in more third-party merchants to its online marketplace.\nBut Amazon continues to dominate online commerce. A new report from eMarketer indicates Amazon could take 43.5% of the U.S. e-commerce market this year, up from 38.1% last year, as reported by Recode. Meanwhile, eMarketer expects Wal-Mart's market share to grow from 2.8% to 3.6%.\nDespite Wal-Mart's efforts and expectations for continued rapid growth in e-commerce sales, the gap between it and Amazon will likely continue to expand for the foreseeable future.\nWal-Mart doesn't give out exact figures for its e-commerce sales, but eMarketer estimates the company's online gross merchandise volume in the U.S. totaled around $11 billion last year and will grow to a bit over $16 billion this year. By comparison, it expects Amazon's sales to reach nearly $200 billion this year.\nSo, if Amazon grows sales volume a measly 8% next year, it's basically adding Wal-Mart's entire online operation. Of course, Amazon is growing much faster than 8%. Analysts expect the company's overall revenue to grow about 28% next year. That number isn't a perfect comparison, as it includes Amazon's cloud computing sales, but only includes fees charged to third-party sellers instead of gross merchandise volume. Comparatively, Wal-Mart recently forecast 40% growth in online sales for next year.\nEven if Wal-Mart's growth outpaces Amazon's next year 40% to 28%, Amazon will continue to widen the market share gap between itself and Wal-Mart (and everyone else, for that matter). It will take a long time for Wal-Mart's faster growth rate to overcome Amazon's commanding size, and it's not clear Wal-Mart can keep up its torrid pace.\nWhat's driving Wal-Mart's online sales growth?\nManagement is keen to note the majority of Wal-Mart's online sales growth comes from Walmart.com, not its string of e-commerce acquisitions following its Jet.com purchase last year.\nThere have been two big drivers for the growth of Wal-Mart's online sales.\nThe expansion of online grocery ordering and in-store pickup is the first major growth driver. Online grocery ordering is available at 900 Walmart locations as of the end of the second quarter, and management expects to add another 1,000 next year.\nBy 2019, however, more than half of Walmart store locations will support online grocery ordering and pickup. As such, the growth from the new service should slow down.\nAt the same time, Amazon could ramp up its own online grocery ordering operations following the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.

It lacks ambience. It`s depressing and stark. Even the performers have griped that the space is so big they didn`t know how to time their jokes.\nYet, through it all, the 4,319-seat Arie Crown, at McCormick Place, has endured as a major, if little-loved, landmark on Chicago`s entertainment landscape, the largest of the city`s theaters.\nBut those days appear to be numbered.\nOn Thursday, officials detailed plans to subdivide and transform the theater into a much smaller conference center as part of a $75 million renovation of the East Building in the McCormick Place complex.\nUnder the plans, the main floor will be retained as the 2,000- to 2,200-seat conference center, while two new levels will be constructed in the space now occupied in part by the balcony.\nOne level will be a cluster of new meeting rooms, while, on the level above, there will be a ballroom and a ''white-tablecloth restaurant'' where diners will be able to look out over the lake.\nThe result will be a major change to a theater where millions of Chicagoans, suburbanites and out-of-towners have attended Broadway musicals, concerts and a wide array of other events.\nPeter Pan has swung from its rafters. High school students have graduated on its stage. It has been the site of religious revivals and muscleman competitions. Twice a year, fresh-faced bar-exam survivors have gone there to be sworn in as lawyers.\nAnd, each Christmas season, it has been the site of the annual lavish production of the Nutcracker Ballet.\nThe earliest that work on down-sizing the theater will begin is 1997, but already the Nutcracker is preparing for a move.\nThe ballet, sponsored by the Chicago Tribune Charities Fund, has been a fixture on Chicago`s entertainment calendar since 1965.\nA spokesman for the ballet`s sponsor said it had been promised the theater would be available through 1996 but that a downsizing of the theater would force the ballet to find another venue.\nIn fact, new scenery ordered for this year`s series of performances has been constructed in such a way that it will be easy to move to another theater, the spokesman said.\nJames Reilly, chief executive of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, told members of an authority board committee Thursday that the original plan had been to start the work to downsize the Arie Crown in January 1994.\nHowever, Reilly said many trade show promoters wanted to continue using the theater until the McCormick Place expansion, on the other side of Lake Shore Drive, is completed in 1996.\nThe East Building rehabilitation plans, which also include a large skylight and air shaft in the middle of the building and a new entrance for the Arie Crown on the south side of the structure, are expected to be presented to the full authority board on Sept. 27.\nThe Arie Crown Theater is named for a Lithuanian immigrant who was 15 years old when he arrived in Chicago by way of St. Louis in 1875.\nArie Crown opened a store on Ashland Avenue near Milwaukee Avenue, where"}

People were like: \"No. What are you talking about?

He could move within space and time in ways that no other superhero can do. It's not just a matter of power. He would change even what the notion of mass is, and lift things much more easily. It is a crazy place to be in the Quantum Realm.\nLet\u2019s go back to basics. What exactly is quantum physics?\nQuantum physics is usually thought of as the physics of the universe at the microscopic level. This is kind of a misunderstanding. Quantum physics seems to be the foundation of all of physics, almost like a theory of knowledge \u2014 a way for us, as humanity, [to ask] questions that go beyond what we were able to ask before. Removing that filter allows us to see reality at its true form, and makes for some very weird things that end up happening, like particles being in two places at the same time [and] quantum entanglement, which is the ability of these particles to communicate with each other, somehow, over vast distances. When you study quantum physics, you try to understand how particles, but also larger objects in this world, behave when you have the ability to view them from many different points of view.\nAre there aspects of the Quantum Realm in the \u201cAnt-Man\u201d movies that are actually rooted in real-life quantum physics?\nWhen I was brought in for the first movie to discuss some aspects of quantum physics that might be relevant to the plot, one of the things that really resonated with the writers and Paul [Rudd] was this idea that, as you go deeper and deeper into the Quantum Realm, the things that we take for granted \u2014 the idea that there are laws of physics, that there is a dimension of time and we're moving through it in one direction \u2014 all of these things potentially dissolve.

If I remember correctly the new planetarium was installed and opened about this time.\n\u201cAlso, I remember well, in early 60s, the building and opening of the Red Duster and White Ensign pubs, both Newcastle houses.\nPlease get in touch with your memories; they can be of anything at all.\nYou can write to me, email me on peter.french@jpimedia.co.uk or phone me on 0191 501 7476."}

This is also one of the bad things about movies.\nTake gun violence, for example. Everybody loves a good gunfight. Without them, you couldn't make a good western. The \"shoot 'em up\" is actually a genre unto itself. Our good guys must be good with a gun, and they need only the thinnest of legal sanction or moral motivation to get us to accept images of them killing lots of people for our entertainment while still feeling good about ourselves. But in real life, we all agree gun violence is horrible. At the movies, we get to have our cake and eat it, too.\nGangster movies are another example. They take the conventional heroic structure, but plug in a bad guy instead of a good guy. We get that we're not supposed to really be rooting for this guy doing all this horrible stuff, but he's got the most close-ups, and that gangster really loved his mama, so we kind of root for him anyway. And if that objectively evil guy with the most close-ups is Tom Cruise, you bet we're going to root for him.\nIn American Made, Cruise plays Barry Seal. When we first meet him, it's 1978, and he's an airline pilot for TWA with a sideline smuggling Cuban cigars into the United States in his carry-on. Always with a good eye for talent, the CIA, in the person of Monty \"Schafer\" (Domhnall Gleeson), recruits him to start flying covert spying missions in Central America. He quits TWA to start working for himself as an Independent Aviation Consultant (IAC) for the CIA. Pretty soon, he's graduated from the Toronto-Baton Rouge milk run to dodging Sandinista ack-ack in Nicaragua. Then, budding businessman Pablo Escobar (Mauicio Mej\u00eda) discerns that a man with Seal's aviation talents who enjoys the protection of the United States government would probably be good at smuggling cocaine, too. From 1977 to 1985, Seal was living the freelancer's dream: a top-notch reputation that enabled him to command top dollar ($2,000 a kilo) from multiple clients with deep pockets.\nBut complications cropped up, as they always do. In Seal's case, it was getting in the middle of a raid by Colombian paramilitaries and tossed in jail. \"Schafer\" springs him, but he must move his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) and two kids from Baton Rouge to Mena, Arkansas, just before the DEA executes a search warrant on his house. Fortunately, his buddies in the CIA set him up good, and in no time flat, he's back in business and rolling in the dough.\nAmerican Made is directed by Doug Liman, who got his start in the indie '90s with Swingers, a Hollywood hangout movie that launched the careers of Vince Vaughn and Iron Man director Jon Favreau, and Go, a Tarantino-flavored minor classic.

{"idx": "30708", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The Bureau of State Audits investigates the financial stewardship and effectiveness of state government agencies. That includes financial accounting, such as an annual financial examination required under the state Budget Act. Other reviews, such as the federally-mandated Single Audit, evaluate state entities' administration of federal grants, both through traditional accountancy and by appraising how well the state is meeting the goals of federally subsidized programs. Finally, performance audits examine whether state agencies and programs are accomplishing what they were created to do, whether they are obeying the law, and whether state resources are being used properly.\nSometimes performance audits are broad in scope, as in the questioning of California\u2019s High Speed Rail program. Sometimes, they\u2019re very specific, as in a critique on the Department of Corrections\u2019 $600,000 delay in reassigning an \u201cincompetent\u201d psychiatrist.\nThe current Bureau of State Audits has been in place since 1993, but its roots reach back to 1955. In that year, state lawmakers established the Office of the Auditor General, with authority to conduct independent financial audits at the state and local level. The auditor general was recommended by a joint legislative committee and confirmed for an indefinite term by the state Assembly and Senate.\nIn 1969, legislators informally agreed to broaden the scope of the auditor's investigative power, authorizing manage\u00adment and performance investigations. A 1972 law formalized that policy, assigning the auditor general to examine and report annually upon the financial statements prepared by the state government's executive branch and to perform any other related assignments, including performance audits, requested by the legislature.\nThe agency, most of whose investigators had degrees in accounting or business administra\u00adtion, drew praise for fair and painstaking work. Its audits \u2013 exposing government waste, track\u00ading expenditures and evaluating the performance of executives \u2013 were credited with saving taxpayers $6 for every $1 spent on audits.\nBut in November 1990, former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum proposed and California voters passed Proposition 140, which limited legislative terms and imposed a 38% cut in the Legislature's budget. In response, legislators made deep cuts in their office and committee staffs and eliminated funding for their independent advisers, including the auditor general.\nStarting in July 1991, when the cuts took effect, the Office of the Auditor General survived by selling its services to other government agencies that were required by the federal Single Audit Act and state law to be audited. Without such audits, these agencies would have lost $16 billion in federal grants annually.\nIn 1992, the Legislature placed Proposition 159 on the ballot, asking voters to establish the auditor general as a state constitutional office and to exempt it from the legislative spending limitations.\nIn a May 2011 interview, former Acting Auditor General Kurt Sjoberg recalled that he and his staff worked hard to get Proposition 159 passed. He remembered holding a backyard barbecue at his home to raise campaign funds, and he traveled throughout the state in his motor home, appealing to newspaper editorial boards to support the measure.\nBut Schabarum opposed Proposition 159, arguing that lawmakers should find funding for the watchdog agency by firing political appointees and cutting their own perquisites. The measure was defeated on November 3, 1992.\nOn November 4, the Office of the Auditor General closed"}

As new pipeline capacity comes on-line in the Permian this year and in 2020+, the logical question is whether the bottleneck will simply move ~500 miles east to the Texas Gulf Coast. Today, we compare Permian pipeline takeaway capacity with Texas Gulf Coast export projects to determine if crude exports will be constrained over the next few years.\nPipelines to the rescue to alleviate Permian crude constraints.\nAt the risk of stating the obvious to most readers, the Permian is a big deal and has garnered international attention for its robust production growth. Its January 2019 crude output of 3.8 million barrels per day (MMBpd) was an increase of almost 1 MMBpd (+35%) from the same month in 2018. To further frame the Permian's importance, only two OPEC members produced more oil than the Permian in January 2019, Saudi Arabia at 10.2 MMBpd and Iraq at 4.7 MMBpd.\nThe steep growth in Permian production quickly overwhelmed pipeline takeaway capacity last year, causing widened discounts in regional oil prices and making the basin the poster child for what happens when supply overwhelms pipeline capacity (read more). The good news for Permian producers is that crude differentials have improved with added pipeline capacity and in anticipation of more capacity coming on-line. In fact, Midland crude traded at a $0.60 per barrel premium to WTI Cushing as of February 15. One recent development was Plains All American's (PAA) expanded Sunrise Pipeline being placed in service ahead of schedule in November. This month, Enterprise Products Partners' (EPD) Seminole NGL pipeline conversion to crude service will begin limited service. Additionally, in the second half of this year, EPIC will finish its temporary conversion of a portion of its NGL pipeline to crude service, and PAA will place the first leg of its Cactus II pipeline in service.\nOver 3 MMBpd of Permian crude pipeline capacity is expected through 2022.\nWhile Permian producers may be celebrating improved crude differentials, the big story from a midstream perspective is the deluge of crude pipelines being built over the next few years. In total, we estimate 3.4 MMBpd in takeaway capacity being constructed through 2022, based on projects that have reached final investment decision (FID)1. We excluded the Permian Gulf Coast (PGC) pipeline, since it has not reached FID, but would note that management teams involved with PGC have signaled interest in potentially combining with the Wink to Webster pipeline.\nHow does pipeline capacity align with production growth? The EIA forecasts Permian production of 4.8 MMBpd by the end of 2020 \u00ad- implying 1 MMBpd of growth from January 2019 - compared to 2."}

{"idx": "30717", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: WHILE the release of American hostage Edward Tracy on Sunday brought relief to Americans, the kidnapping and subsequent release of a French health worker in Beirut emphasized the changing nature of the hostage crisis.The freeing of Edward Tracy comes shortly after the release of British television journalist John McCarthy on Thursday. Experts point to a number of trends that have fundamentally changed the nature of Lebanese hostage-taking, and could help lead to at least a partial solution of the problem. These include: * Desire of the hostage-takers' two main patrons, Iran and Syria, for better relations with the West. * Syria's increasing control over Lebanon, where the hostages are held. * Declining Western public interest in the hostage situation, which ironically may make hostages less valuable to their captors. \"Hostages are only valuable when you can get people to negotiate over them, and since the Persian Gulf war the hostage issue in Lebanon has really been pushed to the back burner,\" says Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation. The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad group freed John McCarthy after five years of captivity, saying it wanted him to act as its special envoy to the United Nations. Edward Tracy, who came to Beirut at the start of the civil war and stayed despite the dangers, was captured on Oct. 21, 1986. His captors, who call themselves the Revolutionary Justice Organization, accused him of being a spy. If nothing else, the glimmers of hope for the hostages reflect the completely changed nature of United States influence in the region.\nUS gained strength Having kicked Iraq out of Kuwait and come within inches of organizing a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace conference, the US seems a far more powerful force in Middle East politics than it did only a year ago. At least Syria's Hafez al-Assad seems to think so, as demonstrated by his having joined in the anti-Iraq coalition, and given a crucial \"yes\" to peace conference attendance. Assad may now see the holding of hostages in a Lebanon he increasingly controls as an embarrassing blotch on his new statesmanlike image. Iran likewise seems to be tiring of the hostage situation, perhaps due to a desire for Western financial and technical aid for its economy. Though Iran claims not to have dictatorial powers over Hizbullah, the umbrella organization of Shiite groups which hold the hostages, it does say it is able to influence them. The chief spiritual leader of Hizbullah said in a Washington Post interview last week that even the most hard-line Iranian leaders want to see an end to the hostage crisis. \"The hostage issue no longer has any great impact on events,\" said Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah.\nDepreciating asset Having been held for years - in the case of Terry Anderson, over six years - the hostages may now be seen as a depreciating asset by their captors, according to terrorism expert Robert Kupperman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. After all, there have been so many hostages in the last 12 years, so many yellow ribbons, so many photos of gaunt, hollow-eyed prisoners. What was once profoundly shocking has become much less so.

My name is Dana, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-and-answer session at the end of this conference. Copies of the slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the company's website at investor.associatedbank.com. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nAs outlined on slide two, during the course of the discussion today, management may make statements that constitute projections, expectations, beliefs or similar forward-looking statements. Associated's actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated or projected in any such forward-looking statements. Additional detailed information concerning the important factors that could cause Associated's actual results to differ materially from the information discussed today is readily available on the SEC website in the Risk Factors section of Associated's most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent SEC filings. These factors are incorporated herein by reference.\nFor a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures mentioned in this conference call, please refer to the slide presentation and to Page 10 of the press release financial tables.\nFollowing today's presentation, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Philip Flynn, President and CEO, for opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nThanks, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today, as usual, are Chris Niles our CFO; and John Hankerd, our Chief Credit Officer.\nTurning to slide three, we had earnings of $0.49 a share, excluding acquisition-related costs. This quarter was marked by deposit inflows, decreasing expenses and strong credit results. Average deposits were up about $1 billion from the second quarter, reflecting our typical seasonal pattern of inflows and some CD funding initiatives we undertook during the third quarter. We continue to grow our non-interest-bearing deposits, while further reducing our network funds.\nWe wound down Bank Mutual operations during the quarter and expect our run rate expenses to trend lower in the fourth quarter. We don't expect any further significant acquisition-related costs. We continue to benefit from the benign credit environment with non-accrual loans continuing to decrease, allowing for a net reserve release during the quarter. We've taken several actions to optimize our capital, including repurchasing approximately 4 million shares of stock during the third quarter and repurchasing an additional 2 million shares through an accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.4%.\nLoan details for the third quarter are shown on slide four, I'll highlight some trends we saw in each of our three primary asset classes. Growth in the commercial and business lending segment was up 3% versus last quarter with particularly good results in our power & utilities and oil & gas segments. Average balances increased in all of our specialty lines of business and in our general commercial portfolio. And our C&I pipeline remains solid.\nOur commercial real estate balances were down as both the commercial real estate investor and construction segments declined during the quarter, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Our residential mortgage portfolio was up slightly in the third quarter. Growth in this portfolio has been"}

Users of the drugs have been found to have lower risks of everything from depression to Parkinson&apos;s disease, and fatal prostate cancer.\nThe catch, though, is that none of those studies proves the cholesterol medications are the reason. They were so-called observational studies, in which researchers compared statin users with non-users, through sources like medical records.\nThose studies can&apos;t prove cause-and-effect because people on statins may simply be healthier than non-users, or have better access to preventive healthcare, for instance.\nWhat&apos;s different about the current study is that it&apos;s based on a clinical trial, said Dr. Sascha Dublin, a researcher at Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle, who was not involved in the new work.\nNovack&apos;s team used data from a trial in which people were randomly assigned to take Crestor or a placebo, to see whether the statin cut the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with normal levels of bad\" LDL cholesterol.\nThat allowed the researchers to analyze factors that might affect pneumonia risk: The statin and placebo groups were similar as far as age, weight and smoking habits, for example.\nI think it&apos;s an important paper,\" Dublin told Reuters Health. \u0093It&apos;s among the strongest evidence we have that there really may be something there.\"\nPast observational studies had come to conflicting findings. In her own medical-records study, Dublin found no evidence that statins themselves seemed to ward off pneumonia.\nI haven&apos;t been impressed by the evidence so far,\" she said.\nIf statins can curb the risk of pneumonia, any benefit may be modest, according to Novack&apos;s team.\nOf 8,900 Crestor users followed for up to five years, 1.1 percent developed pneumonia. That compared with 1.35 percent of placebo users.\nWhen Novack&apos;s team weighed other factors, statin use was linked to a 17-percent lower risk of developing pneumonia. And that isn&apos;t huge,\" Dublin said.\nStill, she noted, if that relative risk reduction could be translated to groups of people with fairly high"}

He gave countless interviews to all the US major TV Channels, confirming that Saddam Hussein possessed chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons. Today everyone knows that was a lie.\nBut in 2002, just before Iraq was invaded, he said that \u201cIn terms of the chemical and biological weapons, Iraq has those now. How many? How could they deliver them? I mean, these are the big questions,\u201d proclaimed Albright nine years ago, helping to get closer a devastating assault on Iraq.\nAlbright talked up the scientist Danilenko's nuclear credentials on CNN, outlining what exactly was explained to the Iranians.\n\u201cHe showed them how to build a thin hemispherical shell with holes in it and where the detonation happens and you simultaneously set off explosive pellets in a series of holes in that aluminum shell and those explosive pellets ignite the high explosives underneath and in a very spherical way it compresses the core and then you get a nuclear explosion,\u201d David Albright claimed.\nExcept that, although Vyacheslav Danilenko is a scientist, he is not a nuclear specialist.\nIn Ukraine, Vladimir Padaklo who is a former co-worker of Danilenko, gave his comments to RT.\n\u201cDanilenko did work in a federal nuclear facility, but not every person who does is a nuclear specialist.

Intertrust is best known as an early developer of digital rights management technologies \u2014 software that is used to prevent unauthorized access to music, movies, apps and other forms of electronic content.\n\u201cNo other entity uses Intertrust technologies so extensively at so many levels of its enterprise,\u201d the company said in its complaint.\nSteve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment, citing the company\u2019s policy of not commenting on pending litigation.\nApple and other big technology companies with deep pockets are often targets for patent lawsuits (and sometimes initiators of them). A particular irritant to these tech companies is a class of plaintiffs pejoratively called \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d which dedicate most of their energies to suing rather than making products.\nBut Intertrust does not quite fit that profile. The company has been around since the early 1990s, went public in the late 1990s and was taken private in 2003 through a deal that resulted in Sony and Philips owning the vast majority of the company. The company has teams of programmers that work on security software and services, according to Talal Shamoon, chief executive of Intertrust.\nLitigation is also rare for Intertrust, which previously has sued only one other company, Microsoft, for patent infringement, according to Mr. Shamoon. That lawsuit resulted in a $440 million settlement from Microsoft in 2004. Intertrust has reached patent licensing agreements with Adobe, HTC, Samsung and others.\nMr. Shamoon said he had sought to negotiate similar licensing deals with Apple for years but the conversations never went anywhere. \u201cYou have a culture over there where they see the courtroom as an extension of the conference room,\u201d he said.\nMr. Shamoon said that Sony and Philips had not directed Intertrust to go after Apple in court to further their own strategic objectives. \u201cThis is not some proxy war between big companies,\u201d he said."}

Unfortunately, no clear effective treatments are available and much work is being done as a consequence to find this medical holy grail.\nWe know that when we age, a part of the brain that is crucial to memory called the hippocampus can decline abnormally fast and this in turn can lead to symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If this decline can be slowed or counteracted then the consequences would be profound.\nThis research has found that the drug Riluzole \u2014 already used in treating the neurological condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \u2014 appears to reverse some of the key genetic changes associated with brain cell damage typically found in early Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThis has significant potential, but the caveat here is in the word potential. The first clinical trial is now underway in America and it will be some years before this appears as a potential treatment \u2014 and that is only if repeated trials continue to show the efficacy of this drug in large numbers of patients.

That not only improves crop yields, but it cuts costs and helps with water quality, Van Wagner said.\nOne of the ways farmers can see some of the latest technology in action is through the Center for Excellence program. About 10 or so years ago, Van Wagner said, a group of farmers saw a need for on-farm demonstrations to help them see how different products affect yield and assess whether these techniques would work on their own farms.\nOne of the hosts of a Center for Excellence plot is Tim Stutzman, who with his father farms 6,300 acres of corn, beans and wheat near Morenci, Mich. Prior to getting involved with that program, he worked with Monsanto on something similar, so he\u2019s had about 15 or 16 years to be one of the first people locally to see what\u2018s new for farmers.\nAnother Center for Excellence host is Bakerlads Farm. Blaine Baker and his brother Kim farm 1,500 acres near Clayton, Mich., raising corn, soybeans, alfalfa and milk cows.\n\u201cPrices (for commodities) were up last year, so we thought it\u2019d be a good time to get some new technology,\u201d Blaine Baker said.\nOne of the devices he uses is a GPS-based automatic shutoff system that turns the planter on and off depending on where the field has already been planted. Avoiding double-planting saves on seed costs, which is important at the best of times and especially critical given the way the price of corn seed has shot up.\n\u201cIt\u2018s gone from $100 a bag to $300 a bag in three years,\u201d Baker said. Plus, by making sure there aren\u2019t too many plants in one place, yield is improved.\nThe Bakers also use an automatic clutch system that uses grid sampling to improve fertilizer application. The field is sampled in 2.5-acre grids, the soil is tested in each grid, and the \u201cprescription\u201d for fertilizer is input into a computer. The rate of application varies according to what\u2019s needed in each location.\nThe technology is also available to allow farmers to apply variable-rate seed in the same way, Baker said.\nThe Bakers haven\u2019t adopted that yet, although Blaine Baker said he thinks they will. By determining where the soil is best, a farmer can plant more seeds in good soil and fewer in poorer soil, helps yield in both types of soil.\nWhile it\u2019s obvious that good soil should get more seed, it may sound surprising that planting fewer seeds in poorer soil actually produces more plants. The reason that can be true, Baker said, is that the farmer"}

Here are 15 more cars that we would love to see hit American roads once again.\nFor nearly two decades, the Acura Integra proved to be one of the most popular small luxury cars sold in the US. Produced in sedan and hatchback form, the Integra proved to be fun, peppy, reliable, and luxurious without making a huge dent in your wallet.\nThe final version of the Integra (sold in the US as the RSX) was discontinued in 2006. Since then, it has been replaced by the compact ILX sedan. While not a poor vehicle, the ILX has not resonated with buyers in the same way its predecessors have. Perhaps it's time for Acura to return to its roots and bring back the Integra hatchback.\nUntil it was discontinued in 2011, the Ford Ranger was one of the best selling small pickups in the US.\nFord still make compact trucks in other parts of the world that carry the Ranger name. With the return of General Motors' impressive Colorado and Canyon small pickups, it's time for Ford to re-introduce American consumers to the Ranger.\nWith the exception of a few bright spots, the 1980s were a performance wasteland. One of those bright spots is the 1987 Buick Grand National Experimental. Known to most people simply as the GNX, the 276 horsepower Buick was the ultimate '80s muscle car. The performance is impressive by today's standards: 0-60 mph happens in 4.5 seconds. It is rumored that GM underreported the actual power of the GNX's motor to protect the Corvette's street cred.\nWhat better way to complete Buick's recent renaissance than an-all new GNX. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing this Cadillac ATS-V decked out in black paint and Buick badges. The mean-looking Caddy even has the GNX's trademark turbocharged V6 engine. In this case, it's a 455 horsepower, 3.6-liter, twin-turbocharged unit.\nFord's languishing Lincoln luxury brand has been on the comeback trail lately.

Residents of the community, built to house workers during the oil shale boom of the late 1970s and early '80s, have been among those pushing for greater setbacks between such facilities and homes, schools and other buildings.\nVoters across Colorado are posed with a question on the Tuesday, Nov. 6, mail ballot that would reshape the oil and gas industry throughout the state. The initiative, Proposition 112, seeks to push the minimum setback requirements for new oil and gas developments to at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings and other vulnerable areas.\nThe current setback rules, established by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in 2013, set a 500-foot statewide setback from residences, as well as a 1,000-foot setback from high-occupancy buildings such as schools, nursing homes and hospitals.\nProposition 112 has received widespread criticism and support, with opponents, including the industry lobby, calling it a \u201cban on oil and gas in Colorado.\u201d Community groups and environmental activists have voiced their support for an initiative they say gives greater weight to public health and safety and reins in what they say is an uncontrolled industry.\nEarlier this year, advocates for the proposed setback change acquired an estimated 123,000 signatures, well more than the 98,492 required to put the question on the ballot, as environmental advocacy organizations across the state see it as a necessary step to address health and safety concerns felt by residents across the state.\nProp. 112 was debated at an oil and gas ballot forum in the western Garfield County gas patch community of Rifle on Thursday, Oct. 4. There, Heidi Henkel, with Colorado Rising, a grassroots organization dedicated to protecting communities from the hazards of oil and gas development and which is campaigning for the initiative, said there were different reasons for the 2,500-foot setback.\nEven some supporters of stricter setbacks have said that distance may be a bit too aggressive, suggesting that something closer to 1,500 feet would have been easier to swallow for voters who may be on the fence when it comes time to cast ballots.\nBut, Henkel said a deadly home explosion in the Front Range community of Firestone in April,2017 that was caused by gas leaking from an uncapped abandoned gas line from a nearby well, and some 15 similar incidents since, show the dangers of conducting such activities so close to homes and schools.\nOn the other side, opponents of the proposition see it as \u201ca measure so extreme it disrupts the state\u2019s regulatory balance and increases setbacks to five times the distance currently required,\u201d according to Protect Colorado, a group fighting the initiative.\nRepublican state Rep. Bob Rankin, from Carbondale, up for reelection for the Colorado House District 57 seat, believes oil and gas regulations do not need to include greater setbacks.\n\u201cThe 2,500-foot setback would devastate the oil and gas industry,\u201d Rankin said at an Independent Voters forum in Glenwood Springs last month. \u201cI represent 15,000 oil wells, three big coal mines \u2014 it\u2019s the heart of the economy I represent.\n\u201cI think this is an attempt to put oil and gas out of business,\u201d Rankin added.\nHis Democratic opponent, Colin Wilhelm, disagreed.

Her company claimed it discovered a new way of conducting blood testing that would allow them to perform dozens of tests with just a few droplets of blood.\nThe strange timbre of Holmes&apos;s voice was revealed after Stanford professor Dr. Phyllis Gardner told ABC Radio\u2019s podcast \u201cThe Dropout\u201d that she recalled Holmes\u2019 voice being higher when they first met.\n\u201cWhen she came to me she didn\u2019t have a low voice,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWhen I next saw her again was at the Harvard Medical School board meeting where she was being introduced. She says with this low voice and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019 It was quite off.\"\nArriola also noticed Holmes\u2019 wardrobe had changed from \u201cfrumpy Christmas sweaters\u201d to all black. She believed Holmes changed her attire to mirror Steve Jobs who wore black turtlenecks. However, Holmes told Glamour in 2015 that she has worn black turtlenecks since she was young.\n\"My mom had me in black turtlenecks when I was, like, eight,\" she said. \"I probably have 150 of these. [It&apos;s] my uniform. It makes it easy, because every day you put on the same thing and don&apos;t have to think about it\u2014one less thing in your life. All my focus is on the work. I take it so seriously; I&apos;m sure that translates into how I dress.\"\nThe demise of Theranos began following a Wall Street Journal investigation that discovered the company\u2019s break-through technology was a sham, and it had been using average equipment for the vast majority of its blood tests. The FBI, Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission began to investigate Theranos following the report. Theranos shut its doors in September 2018 and Holmes was eventually charged with \u201c11 criminal felony counts, including wire fraud and conspiracy,\u201d Vanity Fair reported."}

How can we connect better?\n\u201cThe balance between being approachable and nagging is hard to get right. Sometimes, the more a child is asked, the less they\u2019ll say. Ask how they\u2019re doing rather than what they\u2019re doing. How is school, your friendships \u2013 who did you play with, did you have fun? This shows genuine interest in what they have to say.\n\u201cAs parents, we must realise it can\u2019t be all on our terms \u2013 we have to be interested in what interests our children. A small child might have an interest in sharks or dinosaurs. They can go on a bit about it and, in life\u2019s busyness, a parent can shut them down \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ve heard enough about sharks for the moment, I\u2019m busy making lunch\u2019. Putting the spadework into listening to them on the facts and figures about 15 different dinosaurs will pay off when you want a conversation where you have an agenda important to you.\nMy toddler\u2019s prone to major meltdowns. What can I do when he has a temper tantrum? And what if it happens in public?\n\u201cTantrums \u2013 emotional deregulation \u2013 are an unavoidable feature of childhood. Your child hasn\u2019t yet developed capacity to manage emotion. Help them manage it: create a language to help them express their feelings because where words fail, behaviour takes over. Providing children with emotional language enables them to better negotiate their wants/needs than children without those words.\n\u201cRead to children at bedtime \u2013 loads of stories with emotion in them. Give your child a lexicon of emotion \u2013 how does the character feel: angry, sad, hurt? Children can feel under pressure when asked how they feel \u2013 it\u2019s easier to talk about how someone else might feel.\n\u201cSanctions for tantrums are important. Don\u2019t allow tantrums to achieve their goal. Public tantrums are likely to do so with greater accuracy \u2013 if you\u2019re in the middle of Aldi and your child wants those chocolate buttons, you\u2019re more likely to give in. Yet, children won\u2019t learn to regulate emotion if dis-regulation is rewarded. Your child may learn more from a trip to the park, abandoned due to a tantrum, than they\u2019ll gain by staying in the park.\n\u201cParents need to realise a child\u2019s behaviour doesn\u2019t always reflect on them. When a tantrum happens in public, we feel scrutinised, judged \u2013 we\u2019re not doing it right, we\u2019re overly permissive or overly strict, someone else could do it better.\nMy child has been on his screen all day, he\u2019s obsessed with Fortnite, I want him to get some fresh air. What\u2019s the best approach?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take a hard line. When you consider the billions spent on keeping your child on-screen \u2013 with psychologists paid to figure out how to do it \u2013 you have to resist quite strongly, or your child will be addicted.

The targets distribution of Floyd (19.6 percent) and Brown (6.5 percent) proves it. Even with that being said, there is no way I'm giving up hope on Brown's fantasy season. Maybe as an unabashed John Brown supporter I'm making excuses here, but I'll state my case anyways and you can feel free to adjust for my optimism.\nRight after the game, Arians came out and said Brown wasn't going at full speed, and was still reeling with a hamstring injury. Brown was a game time decision headed into the game. Unlike Week 8, Brown played a healthy amount of snaps (59), but still put up a zero for fantasy. It made sense for the Cardinals to deploy Brown against the Seahawks, as defenses must roll coverage to respect Brown's ability to take the top off. It's why Larry Fitzgerald was able to rack up so many yards underneath. Brown was never a part of the game plan, as his three targets game without true design, Jaron Brown took over Floyd's targets when the latter left with a hamstring injury. It's hard to believe that John Brown was so uninvolved for any other reason than he was never intended to be. The Cardinals, Arians and Brown do not care about your fantasy team, nor should they. They want to win the game, and playing Brown regardless of his health status, helped them accomplish that on Sunday night.\nWith all that being said, feel free to leave John Brown on your bench until he has a big week there. Brown broke out prior to that Cleveland game, both in the stat sheet and how opposing teams played him. I refuse to believe that all the positivity building up to that moment evaporated in three weeks while Brown dealt with a hamstring injury. Even if he does come back to full strength, this is a three wide receiver offense. Michael Floyd is an exceptionally talented player, and looks better now than he did at any point last year.\nSeeing a massive 31.1 percent share of the team's targets, Kamar Aiken stepped right into the No. 1 receiver role. You can see he doesn't have quite the skills or juice to fill that spot to its full potential with Flacco, and he had his share of gaffes. Yet, if he gets those targets, he'll be an interesting volume play in fantasy down the stretch. You have to feel safe with his floor after this game.\nChris Givens seeing the second mast targets was an expected move. He and Flacco didn't hook up on a deep ball, but he did sneak in for a red zone score. Givens will be a great punt play in DFS, and an upside flex in seasonal leagues in the march to the playoffs.\nSammy Watkins certainly got the better of Darrelle Revis in coverage at times, but misplayed the ball in the air on more than one occasion. He's still far from a finished product at receiver, although he carries tremendous potential. Watkins is about the only option you want to consider among the pass catchers with the volume being so low. It was inspiring to see LeSean McCoy with five receptions, as his passing game work was a concern coming into the season.\nThere"}

But, of course, teamwork is typically restricted to companies where everyone is working under the same roof. While distributed teams have become commonplace in tech startups, taking that to the next level by linking up disparate groups of people all working on the same problem (but not in the same company) has been all but impossible. However, in theory, you could use a blockchain to do such a thing, where the work generated was constantly accounted for on-chain.\nThat\u2019s in theory. In practice, there\u2019s now a startup that claims to have come up with this model. And it\u2019s raised funding.\nCovee, a startup out of Berlin, has raised a modest \u20ac1.35 million in a round led by LocalGlobe in London, with Atlantic Labs in Berlin and a selection of angels. Prior to this, the company was bootstrapped by CEO Dr. Marcel Dietsch, who left his job at a London-based hedge fund, and his long-time friend, Dr. Raphael Schoettler, COO, who had previously worked for Deutsche Bank. They are joined by Dr. Jochen Krause, CTO, an early blockchain investor and bitcoin miner, and former quant developer and data scientist, respectively, at Scalable Capital and Valora.\nWhat sort of things could this platform be used for? Well, it could be used to bring together people to use machine learning algorithms to improve cancer diagnosis through tumor detection, or perhaps develop a crypto trading algorithm.\nThere are obvious benefits to the work of scientists. They could work more flexibly, access a more diverse range of projects, choose their teammates and have their work reviewed by peers.\nThe platform also means you could be rewarded fairly for your contribution.\nThe upside for corporates is that they can use distributed workers where there is no middleman platform to pay and no management consultancy fees, and access a talent pool (data engineers, statisticians, domain experts), which is difficult to bring inside the firm.\nNow, there are indeed others doing this, including Aragon (decentralized governance for everything), Colony (teamwork for everything) and Upwork (freelance jobs platform for individuals). All are different and have their limitations, of course.\nCovee plans to make money by having users pay a transaction fee for using the network infrastructure. They plan to turn this into a fully open-source decentralized network, with this transaction fee attached.

Toward the later years of the collection, Goebbels is starting to show anti-Semitic tendencies, Mr Panagopulos said. He added that the auction house has only translated about 10 percent of the papers and has had a tough time with Goebbels' handwriting.\nThe sale sparked concerns by a leader of a Holocaust survivors group who criticized the auction house's sale last year of the journals written by Nazi death camp doctor Josef Mengele.\n\"Alexander Auction House is making a business out of selling Nazi artifacts and memorabilia,\" said Menachem Rosensaft, vice president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants. \"They clearly have the legal right to profit here from such materials. I leave it to others to determine the morality of it all.\"\nRosensaft said such materials belong in an archive for historians to study. He expressed concerns that at an auction of the materials could wind up in the wrong hands and be used as a shrine to the Nazi leader.\nThe collection, which spans the period from Goebbels' childhood to shortly before he joined the Nazi party in 1924, is expected to sell for more than $200,000, Mr Panagopulos said. It includes more than 100 letters written between Goebbels and Anka Stalherm, the first great love of his life, and show his desire to control others, he said. Letters from other girlfriends include a pair of sisters he seduced at the same time.\nGoebbels and his wife killed their six children with cyanide before killing themselves the day after Hitler's suicide.\nMr Panagopulos said the sale is on behalf of a Swiss company and would not benefit any relatives of Goebbels, but he said his auction house does not identify consignors. He said the company received the materials from a man who obtained them from an earlier owner who won the rights to the writings in a 1950s court case with Goebbels' sister.\nThe auction house last year said it sold the journals written by Mengele, drawing criticism from Rosensaft who said the business was profiting off the sale of materials by one of the worst mass murderers in history. Alexander officials said the Jewish buyer wanted to remain anonymous and is building a collection for a museum."}

It would have been more than this man could take to see another legendary band fall from grace within a week.\nHowever, enter Now What? the latest opus of the Purple ones. It is there best in decades and they are not afraid to show it. Producer Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper) gave them a great sound with this project.\nAt the start of the band\u2019s Phoenix appearance, there was a classically-tinged introduction worthy of Rock Royalty. Then, the band swirled nonstop through some golden oldies that would have surprised some. First off, a blazing \u201cHighway Star\u201d complete with Ian Gillan in shades.\nThey then segued into \u201cInto the Fire\u201d and \u201cHard Lovin\u2019 Man.\u201d At this point, I feel that Ian has silenced the punters who doubt him.

It\u2019s also done just about everything poorly, but, hey, you do a TV show for 28 seasons. A big, high-concept season finale about all Springfield\u2019s canines taking over the town? Why not? I mean, the show\u2019s gone to space, it\u2019s built a monorail, spent most of an episode as a hot pepper-induced hallucination, turned Homer into a singing star, pro baseball mascot, sideshow freak, pro boxer, art world phenom, and several dozen other splashy, episode-driving occupations. And while the most memorable Simpsons episodes traditionally incorporate some more subtle character beats into the shenanigans, shenanigans for their own sake are memorable, too\u2014as long as they\u2019re funny enough to justify the detour into wackiness.\nIn \u201cDogtown,\u201d Homer swerves into poor ol\u2019 Gil rather than hitting Santa\u2019s Little Helper (they\u2019re both eating out of the same alley garbage cans), and only wins the ensuing civil lawsuit because his slick lawyer plays on the jury\u2019s affection for dogs. Gil\u2019s weaselly lawyer (the weaselly lawyer) does his case no favors by citing all the adorable things dogs do as proof that dogs are worth less than people, thus inadvertently establishing a legal precedent that dogs are worth more than people. Quimby, seeing votes in the town\u2019s newest hair-trigger whim, enacts some \u201cuntested, hastily passed, pandering laws\u201d that make Springfield into a dog paradise, ignoring the pleading wisdom of Michael York\u2019s veterinarian Dr. Budgie that those dogs are gonna turn on people once they discover that humans are no longer in charge. They do, chaos ensues, Marge tells off Milhouse\u2019s pipsqueak chihuahua that\u2019s leading the pack (all the dogs immediately show Marge their bellies, which, cute), and that\u2019s that.\nAs far as bare bones go, why not? Again, silly and high-concept can work if the jokes are good enough, especially if an episode manages to ground the silliness in some sort of character work. Failing that, a bold stab at self-reflexive meta-comedy can also power things along. But here, the jokes aren\u2019t good enough to sustain the premise, the character elements are perfunctory and sparse, and, as has been the case for a few years in a row now, the season finale has seemed less like an attempt to go out with a bang, and more like an afterthought.\nFor one thing, while Santa\u2019s Little Helper is the impetus behind the White God-esque dog-pocalypse, the Simpsons\u2019 trusty greyhound barely figures in the plot at all. When the town\u2019s dogs go wild, he runs off, but essentially disappears until the crisis has passed (with Marge punting little Taquito the chihuahua over the horizon, a jarringly cruel thing coming from her). Santa\u2019s Little Helper has flirted with going feral and fearsome before, and there, it was his relationship with Bart that saved the day in the nick of time. Here, Bart worries about his pal\u2019s loyalty, but then the dog just splits, and their bond is irrelevant. The same goes for ol\u2019 Gil, although his extraneousness is played with as just another joke about how extraneous Gil is. There\u2019s a certain element of"}

{"idx": "30792", "prompt": "Continue the following text: According to reports, President-elect Donald Trump has tapped recently retired Marine General James Mattis to be his secretary of defense.\nThe Mattis pick has been circulating as a rumor for weeks, and most of the commentary have focused on two aspects: 1) Mattis' penchant for offering highly quotable, pithy, but slightly impolitic observations, and 2) to be confirmed, he would need Congress to pass a law lifting the restriction on recently retired general officers serving in this post.\nThe first aspect likely attracted Trump to Mattis. In their plainspoken defiance of political correctness, the two are birds of a feather.\nThe second clearly did not repel Trump from Mattis, and rightly so. Mattis is a very strong pick for Secretary of Defense and I believe a good case can be made to get Congress to lift the restriction.\nThere is little doubt that a Congress willing to confirm Mattis would be willing to pass the additional law required. As Robert Chesney, a professor of law at the University of Texas at Austin, explains, it is not quite as straightforward as renaming a post office. But lets not pretend it is a high legislative hurdle. Once a candidate has been cleared by the relevant oversight committee, most confirmations, even for very senior positions, are passed under unanimous consent procedures that fly through very quickly. Of course, a senator who wants to block a confirmation can put a hold on it or filibuster it. That sometimes happens, especially for controversial nominees, but if it does not, then a simple majority of the Senate can confirm an appointment. That same threshold is needed to pass the law that removes the legal restriction barring Mattis. While it is an extra step, it is likely not any more difficult than the confirmation process itself. In other words, if Mattis has confirmation troubles, they will occur at confirmation, regardless of the waiver issue. If he doesn't have confirmation troubles, the waiver is manageable.\nAlso, it has been done before. In fact, within a few short years of passing the law forbidding uniformed military from serving as secretary of defense, Congress voted to lift it to allow General George Marshall to take the post. To be sure, in passing that law, Congress explicitly argued that it viewed this as a one-time exception that should not set a precedent; it wanted Marshall to be the first and last such exception. He was, for 65 years. Congress cannot legally bind future Congress in this way \u2014 this was a \"sense of Congress\" declaration anyway \u2014 but even morally, 65 years is long enough to view a second exception as exceptional.\nThe secretary of defense and the president (commander-in-chief) collectively embody the National Command Authority and, as such, collectively represent the civilian in \"civilian control.\" They must actually be civilians to embody civilian control.\nIf they have prior military experience, they must nevertheless operate as civilians while being the National Command Authority. This is why President George Washington refused to wear a uniform or command troops in battle while president (commander-in-chief), even though his former experience as wartime commander arguably made him the most qualified battlefield commander in the republic. Ditto for President Dwight Eisenhower.\nThe secretary of defense is the person in government who embodies civilian control 24-7; he or she has no other duty, unlike the president or the Congress, the two civilian institutions named in the Constitution, and so on a day-to-day basis he or she IS the face of civilian control closest to the troops.

Each player has individualised dribble and shot styles and there's a whole bag of new dunk animations. The graphics aren't that much better than 2K12 but at least this year there's less repetition in player movements and it really keeps the game dynamic.\nThe dribble gameplay's been changed up this time around.

{"idx": "30796", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The move follows a story by ProPublica and The New York Times detailing how insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers have made it easier to get opioid painkillers than less risky alternatives.\nA U.S. senator whose state has been devastated by the opioid epidemic sent letters Tuesday asking two major health insurance companies to remove barriers to non-opioid pain treatments.\nThe letters from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., follow a story by ProPublica and The New York Times, which detailed how insurers have restricted access to pain medications that carry a lower risk of addiction or dependence, even as they provided comparatively easy access to cheaper, generic opioid medications.\n\u201cThe practices detailed in the article are the exact opposite of what we need and will only serve to worsen the opioid epidemic, putting more people at risk of opioid addiction and overdose death,\u201d Manchin wrote in letters to David S. Wichmann, chief executive of UnitedHealth Group, and Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem Inc.\nDrug companies and doctors have been accused of fueling the opioid crisis, but some question whether insurers have played a role, too.\nUnitedHealth was cited in the story because it stopped covering Butrans, a painkilling skin patch that contains buprenorphine, an opioid that has a lower risk of abuse and dependence than generic, long-acting opioids. As a result, a patient said she turned to long-acting morphine to control her pain, went to the emergency room because she could not control her pain, and now visits her doctor more often than before.\nAnthem denied a request for Lyrica, a non-opioid, brand-name drug, for a patient who had been using it successfully to treat the pain associated with interstitial cystitis, a chronic bladder condition. She cannot afford the roughly $520 monthly retail price of Lyrica, she said, so she takes generic gabapentin, a related, cheaper drug. She said it does not manage the pain as well as Lyrica.\nUnitedHealth and Anthem defended their decisions and said they take the opioid crisis seriously. Both companies said they have been able to successfully decrease the number of opioid prescriptions taken by members.\nAnthem said a West Virginia affiliate, Unicare Health Plan of West Virginia, is expanding a program to offer substance use treatments as part of primary care, removing the stigma that may be attached to it. The insurer also said it covers non-opioid pain relief drugs \u201caccording to best clinical practice guidelines and scientific evidence,\u201d noting that some carry retail prices of $350 to $1,500 per prescription.\nUnitedHealth has not yet responded to a request for comment.\nUntil recently, the role of insurers in fanning \u2014 or at least failing to stop \u2014 the opioid crisis has not received as much attention as that of other players, including pharmaceutical companies, doctors and drug distributors.\nA day after the ProPublica/New York Times story was published, attorneys general for 37 states sent a letter to the health insurance industry\u2019s main trade group, urging its members to reconsider coverage policies that may be fueling the opioid crisis.\nThey want insurers to re-examine coverage policies that, as ProPublica and The New York Times reported Sunday, may be driving patients toward addictive painkillers.\nInsurers say they have been addressing the issue on many fronts, including monitoring patients\u2019 opioid prescriptions, as well as doctors\u2019 prescribing"}

The average teenage boy is consuming two cans of soda pop a day. The industry spends over $500 million each year promoting the sale of these worthless products. The U.S. government's dietary guidelines for Americans have urged people to consume less sweetened beverages. But the government doesn't do anything.\"\nSo Jacobson has filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, requesting that warning labels be put on soft drinks with more than 13 grams of refined sugar for each 12 ounces.\nAlthough the calorie count is already on the can, Jacobson says much more needs to be done to warn consumers.\n\"Obviously, that hasn't had much of an effect,\" he says of the calorie information on labels. \"And we should be doing more. Nobody's talking about a ban on soda pop. But just put a little health information on there, a little reminder. We're suggesting a range of reminders, some would say it contributes to obesity and tooth decay; others would say consider switching to diet soda, water or skim milk. Obesity is an epidemic. One-third of youths already are overweight or obese. Are we just going to sit around and do nothing? Or should we do something - a modest, sensible step of putting a health message on cans and bottles?\"\nIn 2004, the average American consumed 37 gallons - or 59,000 calories - of carbonated beverages.\nSoft drinks can lead to obesity, diabetes, tooth decay and osteoporosis (bones don't develop as well because soft drinks are in lieu of calcium-rich milk).\nSix of the seven most popular soft drinks have caffeine, which is mildly addictive.\nThe health impact of soft drinks is sufficiently detrimental for the FDA to require warning labels on the products.\n\"To ask the FDA for warning labels on soft drinks, or any food products that contain caloric sweeteners, patronizes consumers and lacks common sense. Where should such a food hit list stop? Even skim milk and thousands of other food products could potentially fit into a CSPI labeling scheme because of the sugars contained in these products.\"\n\"That's the industry,\" Jacobson says. \"I don't know where it stops, but it starts with them.

At 2:16 p.m. the market yawned, took a look at the statement, and then, after a couple of nervous minutes, continued up on its merry way. Is the stock market just plain stupid? Doesn\u2019t it know when it has been smacked on the head with a two-by-four?\nIn my turret at the hedge fund where I work, we call this kind of blissful reaction to a dreaded hammering the \u201cBig Bad Event\u201d phenomenon. That\u2019s when a scary event, like an impending Fed meeting, looms so large that nobody does anything for weeks until we know the results. The irony here, of course, is that even if the event goes badly, people buy anyway! They are just happy that the event is at last out of the way so they can put their new money back to work. Recognizing when you are in the throes of one of these BBEs can make you a fortune, so let\u2019s look more closely at why the stock market always seems to do the most moronic thing in the wake of obviously terrible news.\nFirst, let\u2019s stipulate some obvious facts, just so you know I haven\u2019t lost my mind. When interest rates go higher, the economy cools because people borrow less money to buy and build things. So far, so good. When the economy slows down, companies that rely on the economic cycle for increased business don\u2019t get that business, and their earnings fall short of well-crafted Street expectations. Normally, those shortfalls cause stocks to go down. So how can stocks rally on news that rates just went up?\nAh, now you are talking about two different things: the broad economy that the Federal Reserve worries about, and the amazing games that fund managers have to play to stay alive in a world where, if your performance falls behind benchmarks like the Dow and the S&P, you lose your bonus \u2013 and if you fall behind your peers, another fund manager takes your place next quarter.\nOn days when the Federal Reserve meets to discuss interest rates, as it did last week, you get to watch as the cool precision instrumentation of Greenspan & Co. crashes into the irrational frets of fund managers afraid of missing the next big move. During the weeks leading up to these deliberations, the fund managers have sat on their hands while millions of your dollars have come in over the transom \u2013 money that you expected to be invested in stocks. These managers watch the cash build up but are afraid to put it to work until they know the results of the Big Bad Event. But then, once the event occurs, they have no excuses. The money goes to work no matter what. Got it?\nFed meetings have come to define the quintessential Big Bad Event. They are widely telegraphed and hyped. Managers freeze like deer in Greenspan\u2019s headlights, paralyzed by their own prudence. But once the event is over, they become financial bulimics, unable to keep the cash down, belching it out at every stock that gets too close. Some buy Pfizer and Pepsi, betting that the economy will now slow. Others buy Cat and Deere, betting that this is the last rate hike and the economy will soon reignite. Still others, the majority these days, buy tech, like Intel and Sun Micro, betting that rates don\u2019t matter to these high-growth companies anyway.\nWhat else drives managers to think that bad news creates an opportunity"}

How did you know, in writing, which connections you wanted to include, and which (if any) you would ultimately decide to exclude?\n\u201cSpider Season\u201d began when I noticed, one Fall day, just how many spiders were living on my front porch, because I refused to sweep them away, despite my longstanding arachnophobia. Spiders, as I say in the essay, comprise my one true phobia, yet you\u2019d never guess it to see me near a spider now. How had this happened? Had I actually matured out of my fear? Not exactly: I\u2019d instead developed a deep, if admittedly silly superstition surrounding them. My second awareness: This superstition had cropped up when I became a parent\u2014which also coincided with my settling into the first real home in my life. I\u2019d moved around almost constantly growing up, and \u201chome\u201d had always been a tricky, mysterious subject for me. Yet now I had one\u2014and it was often crawling with spiders.\nI started reading about spiders, and the more I learned and remembered about them, the more moved I was by their architectural prowess, their relentless and complex home-building. And that led me to consider my own relationship with the family home, with the psychological resonances of architecture. Though I wasn\u2019t sure where I was headed, I wanted to write the essay as a patterning of ideas, memories, and emotions about spiders, using the simple structure of eight sections to both connote my subject and give me the freedom to wander within it.\nIt\u2019s very true that\u2014at the risk of confusing creatures and metaphors\u2014this was magpie sort of writing: I kept noticing shiny things off in the distance and bringing them back to the nest. I filled the essay with all the spidery associations that occurred to me\u2014whether pulled from mythologies, religions, the natural world, or aesthetics.

I jettisoned almost immediately, for example, the time a spider dropped into my eyelashes while I was watching a movie at a theater: While an icky, startling, and somewhat comical experience (at least, I\u2019m imagining, from the other movie-goers\u2019 perspectives), it didn\u2019t touch on much else.\nThis measure no doubt explains why family became a central subject in the piece.

{"idx": "30801", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Next week brings the highly anticipated FDA decision on the approval of Dendreon's (DNDN) prostate cancer vaccine Provenge (sipuleucel-T).\nThe Cancer Vaccine Stigma: The cancer vaccine field suffered so many failures that investors would run for the hills at its mere mention, forcing the remaining biotechs in the space to collectively re-brand themselves as \"specific active immunotherapy\" companies. The late-stage trial graveyard includes Antigenics, BioVest, CancerVax, Cell Genesys, Favrille, Genitope, Progenics, Therion... and Dendreon itself (see next bullet).\nThe Pivotal Trials: Dendreon's first two Phase III Provenge trials missed their primary endpoint of time to progression but showed a survival benefit in post-hoc analyses. The company filed for approval anyway, arguing that survival was the most important measure, and an FDA advisory committee agreed. But the agency rejected the drug (see next bullet) until a third Phase III trial designed to show survival turned out positive two years later.\nThe Conspiracy Theory: Some Dendreon fans have argued that politics and conflicts of interest at the FDA blocked Provenge's approval the first time around. And the SEC is currently investigating an alleged short-selling scandal that caused Dendreon's stock to tank 65 percent in 75 seconds just before the release of the final Phase III data.\nThe Credibility Issue: Dendreon execs have raised some eyebrows by selling off chunks of stock, once right before the first FDA rejection and again last year.\nThe Commercial Questions: The champagne corks had barely popped on the successful Phase III trial when analysts started raising questions about the magnitude of benefit, the challenges of manufacturing a personalized vaccine, and potential pricing/reimbursement issues.\nWith all that drama, it's easy to lose focus of one of the most important parts of Dendreon's story: Provenge has the potential to be the first therapeutic cancer vaccine ever approved by the FDA. The concept of using a vaccine to stimulate the body's immune system to fight cancer has been a Holy Grail of oncology research for decades. Provenge is by no means a cure -- but it extends survival a few months, and since vaccines don't have the nasty side effects of typical cancer drugs, they are likely to be combined with other life-extending drugs. Combine enough of them, and maybe we can finally turn cancer into a chronic disease.\nSoap Opera photo by Flickr user Mike Licht, NotionsCapital.com, CC."}

Remember that global newspaper sales were \u2013 on the most authoritative survey \u2013 up in 2012, not down. And that decline in poor, despised mainland Europe was often far slower than in English-speaking parts. The curse of the internet isn't as strong if the net itself is weaker. But Germany adds extra force by producing great papers in Frankfurt, Munich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Hamburg (among other spots) that carry regional and national clout. It's a chance of geography as well as an opportunity. Tabloids, such as Bild, don't have a local identity, but if you want quality reportage, you also get the best, most insightful news about the city and region you live in.\nCompare and contrast Britain, where the power of the nationals has blown most regional dailies away or stunted their growth over decades; or the US, where local dailies, chained together by debt and squeezed margins, have hacked away at any decent combination of national and regional coverage. So why does Germany prosper? Perhaps, in part, because it hasn't made the mistakes that proliferate elsewhere."}

The two Cleganes, although similarly fierce warriors, are diametrically opposed and have made it abundantly clear that they would kill each other given the chance.\nLet's dig into what exactly makes Cleganbowl such a juicy fight.\nYou know how Sandor has a pretty nasty scar on his face and scalp and he's afraid of fire? Well, that's because of his brother Gregor.\nWhen Sandor was young, he found a toy that his brother wasn't using and decided to play with it. In what can only be described as a morbid overreaction, Gregor silently grabbed his younger brother and shoved his face into a burning brazier.\nSince their childhoods, the two brothers have never had a good relationship. This comes up in the first season of Game of Thrones when Gregor loses in a joust and his brother steps in to stop him from killing his opponent, Ser Loras Tyrell. The two parry swords for a moment before King Robert Baratheon calls on them to stop, when Sandor immediately kneels and Gregor's sword comes within inches of delivering a fatal blow.\nIt was years before they saw each other again in Season 7, and although the Mountain is now basically a monstrous zombie, the Hound doesn't hold back from reminding him who will end his life \u2014 the biggest sign that Cleganebowl will go down in Season 8.\nTime and time again, Gregor has shown just how relentlessly sadistic he is, stopping at almost nothing to terrorize, torture, and kill people.\nHe's done some truly heinous things, having possibly killed his own sister and father, numerous servants at Clegane Keep, which was before he was knighted at Tywin Lannister's request. During Robert's Rebellion against the Targaryens, Gregor committed more horrible acts, killing the two children of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell, and then raped Elia before murdering her \u2014 an act he boasted about when he dueled her brother Oberyn Martell.\nIn the middle seasons of Game of Thrones after the Lannisters take control of King's Landing, Gregor pillages the Riverlands ferociously, striking fear into people everywhere stemming from his vicious acts of torture and terror, seen by Arya Stark at Harrenhal.\nSandor, seeing all the horrible things one can commit as a knight, decides that he will not take a knighthood, not wanting to be associated with his brother.\nSandor has clearly harbored an intense hatred for his horrible brother since a young age, so the two coming to blows doesn't seem like a stretch at all.\nAside from the fact that there's all this history and the Clegane brothers truly hate each other, there are numerous clues that these two will clash.\nAlthough one of them is called the Hound, both come from house Clegane, whose banner dep"}

Then she ran into a brick wall.\nThe wall, a United States law to restrain nuclear proliferation, kept Ms. Bhutto from her main goal: resolving a dispute with Washington over delivery of 28 F-16 jet fighters paid for by Pakistan six years ago. Despite sympathy from President Clinton, both the law and the planes -- now parked in the Arizona desert -- appear likely to stay put.\n''President Clinton must realize that there could be a high global price to pay for not upholding the only effective piece of nuclear nonproliferation law on the books,'' warns Sen. Larry Pressler (R) of South Dakota, author of the law.\nThe 1985 Pressler amendment bars US aid and arms sales to Pakistan unless the US president can determine that Pakistan does not posses nuclear weapons. In 1990, after President Bush said he could not make such a determination, the US cut its annual $564 million aid package to Pakistan.\nInvocation of the Pressler amendment also interrupted the sale of $1.4 billion in military goods to Pakistan, including the 28 F-16 jets, which the US cannot deliver under the terms of the amendment. After paying $800 million toward the total sale, Pakistan wants its planes or its money back.\nSupporters of the Pressler amendment say it may have deterred other nations from acquiring nuclear weapons, and making an exception for Pakistan would send the wrong message to states like North Korea and Iran that also harbor nuclear ambitions. It would also compromise the US at a major conference next week in New York, where the future of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will be decided.\nClinton administration officials have been trying to modify the Pressler amendment for more than a year, arguing that it is now proving counterproductive.\nFor Pakistanis, the Pressler amendment has been freighted with symbolic significance. The South Asian nation was once seen by Washington as one of its most important allies against communism: It was the back door through which US aid and arms flowed to anti-Soviet freedom fighters in Afghanistan.\nSince the war in Afghanistan, Pakistanis say, the US has left its old ally to cope with the war's legacy, which includes bands of unemployed armed militants, at least two of whom were responsible for an attack last month in Karachi that left two American diplomats dead.\nIn this context, the Pressler amendment has spurred rather than retarded nuclear research, Pakistanis say.\n''When the amendment was invoked, Pakistan's conventional capabilities were degraded, therefore making the nuclear option more attractive to the [Pakistani] public,'' says Pakistan's ambassador in Washington, Maleeha Lodhi.\nClinton has tried to circumvent the amendment without actually repealing it: either through a one-time exemption or by selling planes to a third party and turning over the profits to Pakistan. But like the desert-bound F-16s, neither option is likely to fly, in part because of opposition in Congress. Pakistan says it will not relinquish its option to build nuclear weapons until its regional rival, India, does the same."}

In the middle stands Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York. He is a man who is used to people asking to have their picture taken with him, and he seems very glad to oblige. Time and again, he asks his longtime companion, Diana Taylor, who\u2019s wearing a khaki dress and a sweater tied smartly around her shoulders, to use each person\u2019s camera so he or she might carry home a digitized piece of him.\nFor some time now, observers have questioned whether Bloomberg\u2013who brought unexpected innovation first to the world of financial information and then to the New York City mayor\u2019s office\u2013has another new beginning left in him. By Forbes\u2019s account, he is the 30th richest person in the world, a politician whose ambitions for public office, by his own admission, have reached their end. Close advisers pressed him to run for president in the 2008 election, but as political analyst Larry Sabato recently pointed out, the idea of a Bloomberg 2012 bid, even as an independent, is \u201ca complete nonstarter.\u201d It is also clear that Bloomberg will never return to the day-to-day machinations of the financial services and media company he built, Bloomberg LP. He\u2019s already been there, done that, and moved on.\nSo what comes next? For a man who made his fortune through the fluid dispersal of information, Bloomberg has always been reluctant to talk about himself. That fundamental contradiction is evident in his unwillingness to discuss his own future, publicly or privately. More than a dozen interviews with Bloomberg confidants, colleagues, and advisers\u2013as well as a disarmingly intimate one with Bloomberg himself\u2013reveal no professed master plan. Yet between the lines (and in the details of what he says he won\u2019t do), a vision of the Bloomberg of tomorrow can be glimpsed. The possibilities are vast when you\u2019re a self-made billionaire and world-renowned public figure. But true opportunities for impact and relevance are, it turns out, more limited.\nIn Bloomberg\u2019s view, a better global future is a matter of urban innovation. In many respects, his belief rests on simple logic: When virtually all demographic projections for the coming decades assure us that the vast majority of humanity will soon reside in cities, it makes sense to conclude that our problems and solutions will reside there too.

{"idx": "30818", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A new concept for information storage and retrieval is proposed that links chunks of information within and among documents based on semantic relationships and uses those connections to efficiently retrieve all the information that closely matches the user's request. The storage method is semantic hypertext, in which conventional hypertext links are enriched with semantic information that includes the strength and type of the relationship between the chunks of information being linked. A retrieval method was devised in which a set of cooperating software agents, called scouts, traverse the connections simultaneously searching for requested information. By communicating with each other and a central controller to coordinate the search, the scouts are able to achieve high recall and high precision and perform extremely efficiently.;An attempt to develop a document base connected by semantic hypertext is described. Because of the difficulties encountered in the attempt, it was concluded that there is no satisfactory method for automatic generation of semantic hypertext from real documents. The collection of semantically linked documents used in this research was generated synthetically.;A Java-based agent framework used to develop three types of software scouts. In the simplest implementation, Scoutmaster, the paths of the scouts through the document base were specified by a central controller. The only task of each scout was to follow the links specified by the central controller. In the next level of autonomy, Broadcaster, the controller was used strictly as a conduit for scouts to exchange messages. The controller received information from the scouts and broadcast it to all of the other scouts to use in determining their actions. In the final implementation, Melee, the central controller was used only to inaugurate the scout searches. After initialization, the scouts broadcast their messages to all the other scouts.;Experiments were performed to test the ability of the scouts to find information in two synthetically created document sets. All scout types were able to find all of specified information, i.e. high recall, while searching few documents that did not contain the information, i.e. high precision. Using groups of scouts, the best time to search document sets with up to 3000 documents and 2.5 million links was about thirty seconds.\nRehder, John J., \"Semantic software scouts for information retrieval\" (2000).

Though I write about advertising, I\u2019m a journalist first, and I really don\u2019t like the increasing blurring of the lines between the editorial and sales sides of publishing. So, to me, the idea of a single advertiser (Target, a discount chain, yet!) marrying itself to a highbrow magazine like The New Yorker appeared to be a cheesy marketing gimmick wrapped in a demographic accident. It seemed especially unfortunate for such a storied magazine to go along with this\u2014like the Visigoths invading Rome or Howie Mandel filling in for Regis Philbin.\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought until I saw Target\u2019s solo sponsorship of last week\u2019s issue.\nSo I warn you: there is excessive gushing ahead, but every word is heartfelt.\nYet, much to my surprise, the Aug. 22 issue of The New Yorker is the smartest and most exciting example of branded entertainment I\u2019ve ever seen.\nFor starters, how many contemporary American brands have a logo and a visual identity that is so strong and distinct that it can sustain 21 pages in a single issue\u2014without a single product mention or word of text, mind you\u2014and have it all remain immediately recognizable?\nBrands like Gap or Apple come to mind, but neither could have executed it better.\nThe concept is genius: give a dizzying array of contemporary illustrators\u2014Milton Glaser, Gary Baseman, Katherine Streeter, Ruben Toledo, to name a few\u2014the simple assignment of creating a drawing with a New York theme, using black, white and red, and including Target\u2019s trademark Bullseye.\nAndr\u00e9 Dubois\u2019 drawing appeals to dreamers and fashionistas alike: a highly stylized, giant red shoe covered in target polka dots acts as a bridge to the city. The shoe, which reminds me of an Andy Warhol drawing, is magical. It suggests a new kind of fairy tale. As opposed to the \u201cOld Woman in the Shoe,\u201d this woman has so many opportunities she doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nSpeaking of myths and stylized women, one of my absolute favorite drawings is by Streeter and appears to use photo collage. It shows a mermaid sporting fashionably shaped eyebrows, a happening red bob and red lipstick, cooling her tail on the banks of the East River. She\u2019s got a few targets dotting her scales, which mimic the chain-link fence behind her. This sort of fence usually symbolizes an up-from-the-rubble urban nightmare, but here it seems quite benign. It\u2019s certainly not keeping her from flapping up to shore.\nYuko Shimizu\u2019s riotous drawing could be the opening page of a graphic novel: The perspective is from the ground up as we watch a leather-clad female biker ride over the Brooklyn Bridge. The enormous red Target behind her dominates the sky, like a giant Japanese rising sun.\nThe iconography of the city is captured cleverly without a clich\u00e9 in site. Ironically, in the illustrations, the bull\u2019s-eyes completely infiltrate the city, while in reality, Target has yet to open a store in Manhattan.\nWhich brings us to the seeming demographic mismatch.\nAs New Yorker publisher David Carey will happily tell you (I only wanted a quick interview and he ended up selling me three pages in November), there are more New Yorker subscribers living in the state of California than New York itself.

However, almost two thirds of millennials instead prefer the stability of corporate jobs according to a recent Deloitte survey. Can a corporate job lead to a dream career? What are the benefits of choosing a corporate job instead of freelancing? Is it selling out? Or a career strategy?\nLarger companies often have a greater level of financial stability which allows them to provide more formal programs that benefit employees. These companies have a large enough number of employees to justify robust internal development programs. If you want to be an executive, you usually have access to a mentor and a manager that can show you what that path looks like. Corporations can give you a clear structure and a ladder to move you forward. Since workflow happens on larger timelines and your career has a structure of expected progression in the corporate space, you can also plan your life a little bit better rather than trying to schedule your life around work. When you are part of a team, it is easier to take vacations and manage personal time. These are things that we sometimes take for granted, but a lack of steady income and roadmap can significantly impact the lives of freelancers and solopreneurs.\nBeing a part of a company also lets you shape your career and mentor others. If you manage your career correctly, you can have a positive impact on your team\u2019s careers in addition to your own. Part of your job is who manages you. A much more significant and fulfilling part of your job is whom you manage.\nIn the right company, you can also find and contribute to a sense of community. \"As a millennial who works with and trains other millennials in Fortune 100 companies, I see a clear reason why people in my generation would choose to work for a large business - they want to be part of something greater than themselves,\" said Shawn Rhodes, a Marine Corps veteran who shares what he learned on the battlefield in a TEDx talk and through keynote speeches.

And hope this guy\u2019s talk of \u201chospitalizing a brick\u201d is all bluster. After all, you have no choice.\nThis is the situation we find ourselves in with climate change. We have a nasty battle in front of us, and we have no choice but to fight it. The only question is what attitude we take into the ring.\nBy now most Americans know that climate change is what\u2019s for dinner for the foreseeable future. They also know what will be on the plate \u2014 a heaping serving of doom and gloom. NASA\u2019s James Hansen, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, has said that if we don\u2019t take radical action to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions in the next decade, our children will be living on a planet unrecognizable to us.\nAs Hansen, Kolbert, and many other leading thinkers are striving to make clear, climate change seems to be the most pressing issue ever to face humanity. But the problem is that humans, and Americans in particular, can\u2019t be galvanized into action by \u201cthe sky is falling\u201d scenarios, even if they\u2019re true. We tend not to believe them, partly because we have such a history of overcoming predictions of doom with technology or luck (population, Y2K, and ozone-layer destruction, for example), and partly because we can\u2019t imagine the scope of a challenge like this. The Black Death killed off a third of Europe, but that was in 1348; we don\u2019t have the experience, or social memory, of real catastrophe.\nTo solve this problem, we need to entirely reengineer our energy infrastructure \u2014 which is to say our societies \u2014 in order to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 90 percent by century\u2019s end. It will be the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. But there\u2019s another way to look at climate change. It is an opportunity on the scale of the Enlightenment or the Renaissance, a rare chance to radically change the face of society forever. Such wholesale societal change is within our ability: we have done it before.\nWhen Europe emerged from the Dark Ages, it moved from a period of irrational superstition \u2014 when mythology, not reason, ruled people\u2019s lives, and fear, not optimism, was the operating principle of the day \u2014 into an age of reason and rationality. The movement was traumatic, but ultimately it improved every aspect of people\u2019s lives, from medicine to law, science to government.\nLike the Enlightenment, tackling climate change will require a century-long revolutionary mobilization of society\u2019s intellect, finances, mores, vision, government, and technology. And the payoff, the promise of overcoming this challenge, is not just a safe, stable, and livable world. It is a planet from which the barriers to utopia are substantially removed.\nIn a highly efficient planet running on clean energy (which is a world that has solved the climate problem), most existing pollution will be gone, and many of the obstacles to solving other problems \u2014 poverty, starvation, access to clean or any water, disease \u2014 will be significantly reduced.

The inequality campaign will intensify later in the year with a push in the Senate to raise the federal minimum wage that will be synced with President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech, which is expected to dig heavily into the issue of economic disparity.\nThe focus on income inequality builds on the economic themes Obama successfully harnessed to beat Mitt Romney in 2012. Democrats believe they can win again by spotlighting the growing divides between the rich and poor and daring Republicans to oppose legislation aimed at benefiting low-income Americans.\nFor their part, congressional Republicans sound open to an extension of unemployment benefits, but only if the $6.5 billion cost of a three-month extension is paid for \u2014 a nuanced argument that Democrats hope won\u2019t sound convincing at a time when the number of long-term unemployed is on the uptick. And no matter what Democrats argue, Republicans will seek to keep voters\u2019 focus on Obamacare.\nFor now, reviving emergency unemployment insurance may have more legislative legs than a federal minimum wage increase, given that the three-month extension has the support of Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), a key development for a bill that will need the support of four more Republicans to break a filibuster.\nDemocrats argue that seizing on the minimum wage is also key to appearing serious about improving peoples\u2019 lives \u2014 and even if legislation fails on the Senate floor, as is currently expected, the party believes the high-profile vote will augment vulnerable incumbents\u2019 campaigns as Democrats work to defend their five-seat Senate majority.\nThe Capitol Hill push follows a wave of national polls that show Americans increasingly favor raising the minimum wage, a rate that has stayed put at $7.25 per hour since 2009 for most workers. Few, if any, Republicans are likely to support Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s (D) bill to raise the rate to $10.10 an hour, though his legislation could be filled with incentives for small businesses, and the wage could be whittled to a more palatable number to entice moderates in both parties.\nDemocrats see special appeal in spotlighting a rate hike when the road to retaining the Senate runs through red states with Democratic incumbents such as Alaska\u2019s Mark Begich, Arkansas\u2019s Mark Pryor, Louisiana\u2019s Mary Landrieu and North Carolina\u2019s Kay Hagan. Minimum wage issues are particularly poignant in Southern states like North Carolina, Louisiana and Arkansas, all of which have above-average numbers of employees paid at or below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe congressional spotlight will give the nation\u2019s lowest-paid workers the most attention nationally since Congress last approved a rate hike in 2007 under President George W. Bush, part of massive legislation that included tax cuts. But the minimum wage is also the centerpiece of a larger shift for Senate Democrats away from approving presidential nominees and social legislation and toward fiscal policy.\n\u201cThe thing that is going to help us keep the Senate is focusing on the economy,\u201d said a Democratic leadership aide.\n"}

In the new black-and-white photo, Justin was holding his baby girl and looking down at her with a huge smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t win #cyyoungaward, but I can\u2019t be too upset when I have this little girl waiting for her daddy off camera!\u201d he wrote. So cute! While he may not have been selected as the best MLB pitcher, he still knew that he was going home a winner no matter what. That\u2019s the spirit!\nKate clearly loved the pic of her husband and daughter too because the model reposted it to her account. But as much as we love this father/daughter shot, we can\u2019t wait until the new mom shares a selfie with her baby girl \u2014 especially if she shows her sweet little face! We still don\u2019t know whether Genevieve looks more like Kate or Justin, but let\u2019s be honest, she can\u2019t go wrong either way. The little one has a fab pair of parents who have so much love for each other. On their anniversary, Kate penned the sweetest message to her hubby alongside a picture from their wedding.\nAw! We\u2019re so happy to see these two so happy. Here\u2019s to hoping they share baby pics a little more often than they did baby bump pics. Kate only showed off her perfect pregnancy body on social media a couple of times, but we can\u2019t get enough of Genevieve. The more precious photos, the merrier!"}

Inside, she\u2019s interviewed in the piece \u201cJessica Lange Can Finally Relax\u201d (a perfect headline), where she discusses her fascinating career, her most legendary romances, and what she calls the \u201cpervasive\u201d problem of ageism in Hollywood.\nGetting cast in the Fay Wray role was such a fluke. I was just back from Paris, and all skin and bones with a white Afro, and they took one look at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019s not right.\u201d But then they flew me out to MGM to put me on camera \u2014 what did they have to lose? And by the time I left, I had the part. I had no idea how big the movie was, or that coming out of it I wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I went back to taking acting classes for a few years. When you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t see the connections, how one thing leads to the other.\nI knew when I did [the character of] Frances that it was something extraordinary. I love those kinds of parts, with huge emotional swings. But Tootsie turned out to be the best film I ever made. And to win my first Oscar for it was thrilling, not terrifying, the way it might be today. The awards were more casual then. You did your own hair; you did your own makeup. It wasn\u2019t the fashion event of the season.\nAfter revisiting the \u201980s and \u201990s\u2014during which she had two great loves: Mikhail Baryshnikov and the late Sam Shepard\u2014Lange talks about her unexpected transition into not just television, but television horror. She says she never intended to do more than one season of American Horror Story, but that Ryan Murphy, \u201ca great seducer,\u201d convinced her to stay on for four years.\nTelevision, Lange later explains, is one of the many places older women in Hollywood turn when the \u201cimportant\u201d film roles stop coming in.\nAgeism is pervasive in this industry. It\u2019s not a level playing field. You don\u2019t often see women in their 60s playing romantic leads, yet you will see men in their 60s playing romantic leads with costars who are decades younger. I think about how few wonderful actresses of my generation are still doing viable, important film work. You go to television. You go to the stage. You do whatever you can because you want to keep working.\nAnd Lange isn\u2019t just still working, she\u2019s still winning. She received an Emmy for 2014's American Horror Story: Coven, and a Tony for her performance in 2016's A Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night.

She's Australia's queen of romance and she lives right here in Canberra. Valerie Parv is seen as a romance expert, and with Valentine's Day on Sunday, what better time for a conversation? Despite her busy schedule, Valerie Parv is also a volunteer guide at the National Zoo and Aquarium, from where she draws inspiration. Stateline met her there.\nVALERIE PARV, ROMANCE WRITER: Well like all writers, wherever you are is a source of inspiration. The National Zoo and Aquarium has to be probably one of the best in the world because you've got people from all over the world come here and as a volunteer guide I get to interact with them and hear their stories and their travels and their experiences and I get to interact with the animals, which is different every single time I see them. And I guess all of that is good fodder for a story. I have written the zoo into some short stories for magazines, not yet into a full length novel, but little bits of it creep in every now and again.\nI'd always loved reading romance, so I decided I would write - or try to write a romance novel, little knowing what I was getting into.\nWhat nobody had told me was that at the time they were receiving something like 4,000 books in a year and they were accepting about 10, otherwise possibly I might have given it up as being impossible odds because I'm not much of a gambler. But as it turned out, I thought, \"No, I'll study the books. I'll find out how they're put together.\" I enjoy reading them, so I'll write a book that I'd like to read. And so I submitted it, and about three months later they accepted the book with some editorial changes. All up, I think the process took about a year.\nI wish there was a formula, or somebody would at least share it with me so my life would be a lot easier. No, it's basically a man and a woman get together, they fall in love, there is some obstacle to them getting together and the rest is up to the author. There's no formula other than those conventions. And other than that you can write whatever book you like. You really need to believe in romance. You need to see it around you, you need to be interested in how people meet. It's often one of the first questions I asked a couple: is how did you get together, how did you meet? Because that kind of thing fascinates me. And if you have that kind of interest there's always another story waiting around the corner.\nTo me, it's the characters. It's not about the basic convention of boy meets girl. It's about who they are as people, what their problems are, what their history is. I had an editor who said once that a lot of the characters sound like they're born on page one, and I agree with that. You've gotta know these people. But to me, not in the sense of the hair colour, their eye colour, how tall they are. To me that's just minor detail. The most important things are who they are, how they came to be the way they are.

When Cub Cadet added this multifunctionality to its trimmers, it began locating the start cord between the drive shaft and the engine flywheel. When you have to replace the cord, you need to remove the drive shaft, which isn't a difficult task. Earlier 4-cycle Cub Cadet models feature a starter assembly that is attached to the side of the engine housing opposite the muffler.\nDisable the trimmer by pulling off the spark plug wire. Set it down on a level surface. If it's a split boom trimmer, disengage the lower part of the drive shaft by loosening the fastening nut and pulling it off. This makes the rest of the procedure easier.\nUnscrew the four screws holding the drive shaft to the engine with a screwdriver and pull the drive shaft away. Turn the drive shaft around to access the starter mechanism -- it is just inside the drive shaft. If you have an older 4-cycle model, unscrew the starter assembly from the side of the engine. You don't need to remove the drive shaft.\nPull out the old cord, using needle-nose pliers, if necessary, to unhook the knot from inside the pulley. Clean out the inside of the starter assembly with a rag.\nPrepare a new length of starter cord with the same diameter as the old one by melting the end with a lighter and rolling the tip in your fingers while it's still warm. This makes it easier to thread through the holes on the starter assembly.\nWind the starter pulley two full revolutions clockwise, and line up the holes on the housing cover and the pulley hub. Feed the cord through both holes and tie a knot in the end. Slide the starter grip onto the other end of the rope and tie a knot in that end to hold it.\nHold the rope vertically against the pulley, and use the rope to wind the pulley through five or six more clockwise revolutions. Keeping tension on the rope, allow the pulley to slowly unwind, wrapping the rope around itself, until the starter grip is held against the starter housing by the tension in the spring.\nReplace the starter back onto the trimmer and reassemble the drive shaft, if you took it apart. Reconnect the spark plug wire before you use the trimmer.\nIf the grip doesn't come all the way back to the starter housing cover, the rope is too long. Slide the grip along the rope to reduce its length, make a new knot, then wind the rope on the pulley again.\nDeziel, Chris. \"How to Replace a Pull Start Cord on a Cub Cadet Grass Trimmer.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/replace-pull-start-cord-cub-cadet-grass-trimmer-102010.html.

Greipel, a loyal servant to Lotto-Soudal since 2012, had been abruptly dumped over the summer as they opted for a newer, shinier sprinter in Ewan. Afterwards, he made tactful noises about his happy history with the Belgians, but he must have been laughing inwardly.\nThomas had led the field out of the start among the sand dunes and pines of the Pembrey Country Park on the coast south of Carmarthen \u2013 and around part of a new custom built racing circuit for future Thomaslets \u2013 en route for 108 miles that turned into a second triumphant homecoming after his official return to Cardiff following his Tour de France win in July.\nTiny villages such as Kidwelly and sedate market towns such as Llandovery were a sea of Welsh dragon flags and it was all of three miles into the race before the first fan in full Welsh national dress, stovepipe hat and all, could be spotted on the roadside.

It was her now-famous large-scale painting from her M.F.A. thesis show at Parsons titled Class of 2007, which depicted her fellow classmates, who were all white, as black inmates, while Nina, the only black student in her class, painted herself as a gun-toting white prison guard with flowing blonde locks.\nWehby was right. Within days, every piece sold. Class of 2007 was purchased by the famed art collectors Don and Mera Rubell based on a photograph of the piece, an amazing feat in and of itself, especially in pre-Instagram days. That work, and several others, found its way into 2008\u2019s inaugural exhibition of \u201c30 Americans,\u201d a group show that the Rubell\u2019s Web site claims focuses on \u201cthe most important African American artists of the last three decades.\u201d The exhibition took place in the Rubell\u2019s 45,000-square-foot gallery in Miami, formerly a D.E.A. confiscated-goods facility, a building that once contained millions of dollars\u2019 worth of an entirely different luxury commodity that caters to a similarly bourgeois clientele.\nAbney\u2019s mother soon married a man who had a daughter around the same age as Nina. The genial stepsisters spent much of their young lives bouncing around from one Montessori school to the next, often as the only black students in their class. On one surreal afternoon, while driving home from school just across the border in Indiana, Abney\u2019s mother was pulled over by a local police officer. As the uniformed man\u2019s face entered the frame of the driver\u2019s-side window, Nina instantly recognized it, or more accurately, recognized her own face in his. The cop was her biological father, a man she had never met until that moment. The \u201cLynchian\u201d encounter was fleeting, but it had a lasting effect on the artist (she wouldn\u2019t reconnect with the man until earlier this year. Abney claims they are currently attempting to build a relationship from the ground up).\nAfter a fire damaged her mother\u2019s home, they moved in with her aunt in Matteson, Illinois, and attended Rich South Campus High School. \u201cWe were always the only black girls, so high school was the opposite,\u201d remembers Abney. \u201cI was excited, but also a little nervous. Though we were very much \u2018in-tune\u2019 we would still get teased with that whole \u2018talk white\u2019 thing.\u201d Nina navigated this by taking requests for portraits of famous black figures in pop culture as a sort of friendly icebreaker and also, as a means to maintain a classically trained eye. \u201cPeople asked me to do portraits of, like, Tupac or something,\u201d recalls Nina with a dismissive laugh.\nThough Abney had won some awards for her work in middle school, high school was where she began to take things a bit more seriously.

However, new research suggests that within European organizations, one worry tops the rest: the possibility of insider threats.\nResearch conducted by enterprise data security firm Vormetric in conjunction with industry analyst firm Ovum \u2014 surveying over 500 IT decision makers in mid-range and large businesses across the UK, France, and Germany \u2014 discovered that only nine percent of businesses feel safe from insider threats.\nNearly half of UK-based businesses said that \"privileged users,\" such as system and data administrators, as well as network specialists, pose the biggest risk to system protection against cyberattacks.\nInsider threats are no longer classified simply as disgruntled employees who use privileged access to abuse their positions and steal data for personal use. Instead, those who maintain systems are an additional concern, since their roles generally require access to root systems in order to protect them. If a cybercriminal manages to compromise one of these accounts, then they are given widespread access in to corporate networks and are able to wreak havoc.\nTop management and executives are considered the top risk, with 29 percent of respondents saying accounts belonging to the CEO or CFO are most at risk.\n62 percent of respondents believe that there is a general lack of transparency concerning cloud and the technology's security measures.\nThe report states that organizations are beginning to realize that encryption plays a part in not only protecting corporate and customer data, but preventing insider threats. In total, 38 percent of respondents said that encryption is the most important security measure that blocks insider threats. In direct response to this threat, 66 percent said they planned to increase future IT security budgets.\n\"Despite the growing frequency of insider threat related incidents in the news, the report shows that organisations are still at the early stages of managing this data loss vector.\nTo practically defend themselves, organisations must take a data centric approach, implementing encryption and access controls to limit exposure, and monitoring data access to identify inappropriate user activity using a platform approach that scales with growing data security mandates and requirements without diverting an inordinate amount of IT resources.\""}

I can understand that is awkward to check the immigration status of folks in need of medical care-particularly urgent medical care. However, when it comes to medical billing, there is a whole different story. About 50% of all medical care in the US is already government funded. The elderly and the poor in the US receive substantial subsidization of medical care\u2014and virtually every major proposal for universal medical care in the US would increase the subsidization of those groups.\nRather than take the side of an unpopular position on the medical care issue and oppose universal medical care, I would suggest that immigration restrictionists specifically oppose the subsidization of medical care for non-citizens on the part of citizens. There is no reason why the employers of illegal aliens(or investors in those employers) cannot be held 100% accountable for the cost of medical care of non-citizens. If need be, we can specifically increase the minimum wage of non-citizens to pay these extra fees. Now, many employers of illegal aliens don't properly file taxes-but when they are discovered, property of the employers of illegal aliens could be seized-as could the property of the landlords that rent to illegal aliens and those that invest in businesses that employ illegal aliens. After all, those that get caught need to pay for health care expenses of those that aren't caught-so I'd expect these fines would have to be pretty high for the system to be self-supporting.\nNow, it would be rather difficult for businesses hiring folks at $5.50 per hour to pay for $1500/month in medical and dental benefits for a family of 5.

Construction is scheduled to begin this summer.\n\"We want to move forward in July,\" said Mickey Garcia of Suffolk-based Garcia Development LLC.\nGarcia had requested a rezoning and amendment of the zoning district from residential with medium density to residential apartments - a small step for council, but a necessary move for the developer to go ahead with the planning and eventually construction, because the former zoning did not permit multifamily dwellings.\nThe city transferred the property over to Garcia for just $1. \"Our benefit is the redevelopment itself,\" said City Manager Ed Daley yesterday. \"The whole building will be restored and brought back into economic livelihood.

The development will bring life to a building that has been sitting dormant for almost 20 years,\" concludes the analysis.\nThe 1927 Mallonee School, which once served as the city's high school, was declared \"no longer necessary for education purposes\" by the School Board in 1988 and has been vacant for 19 years. In 2001, the city obtained the structure from the School Board with the purpose to redevelop it. There were numerous plans to convert the building into office spaces for various city departments, but none if these plans were economically feasible.\nTwo years ago, the city received three unsolicited proposals for redevelopment of the school. Last July, the city reached an agreement with Garcia to acquire and develop the property with 32 market-rate residential units and a day care center.\nBut based on recommendations by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, the number of units was increased to 50, to ensure historical architectural elements of the building would be maintained. The project does not include HUD Section 8 rentals.

He even let S.N.L. and his old colleague Tina Fey publicly mock him for it last October.\nBut Fallon\u2019s fun-loving, late-night party vibe continues to lag in the overall ratings behind Stephen Colbert who, following S.N.L.\u2019s example, has struck ratings gold by throwing Trump firmly under the bus. And while Fallon\u2014perhaps feeling the pressure of these falling ratings\u2014has recently started to get a little meaner about Trump, he still remains a relative pussycat.\nSo it should come as no surprise that even though Fallon participated in the episode\u2019s political cold open as presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner opposite Baldwin\u2019s Trump, he somehow managed not to say a word against the president. . .literally.\nIn the sketch itself, Trump makes reference to the fact that unlike other White House advisers jockeying for power, Kushner has not been eager to be seen in the media spotlight. Trump lovingly calls him \u201ca little Jewish Amelie,\u201d a reference to the French film moppet\u2019s silent ways.\nFallon managed to get through the pointedly anti-Trump sketch without saying a word, until he joined Baldwin in a boisterous \u201clive from New York, it\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d Whether that silence was the S.N.L. writers lampshading Fallon\u2019s political neutrality or not, it was a clever way for the host to participate without verbally committing himself to any edgy humor.\nNext to the political cold open, the best chance for S.N.L. hosts to make a pointed political statement comes in the episode\u2019s monologue. Though it\u2019s usually written by the staff, the monologue provides any given host the opportunity to put a very personal spin on the episode. Recent hosts like Aziz Ansari and Kristen Stewart have taken full advantage of the platform to use their personal experiences to make a commentary on Trump\u2019s America. Certainly not all hosts go political in their monologues\u2014but Fallon went one step further by once again avoiding speaking as much as possible. Instead, he sang a tribute to David Bowie, and, leaning into his life\u2019s-a-party persona, he led the cast and musical guest Harry Styles in a dance party.\nWhile recent hosts like Louis C.K., Scarlett Johansson, and others have used the show\u2019s pre-recorded digital shorts to make some of their most searing political statements, Fallon\u2019s pair of digital shorts both explored The Tonight Show host\u2019s awkward and clumsy white guy schtick. Then Fallon understandably sat out the most confrontationally political sketch of the night: Melissa McCarthy\u2019"}

And companies can\u2019t, they can\u2019t even start up, they can\u2019t expand, they\u2019re choking.\nReports suggest Apple has at least a passing interest in exploring a manufacturing facility in the United States, apparently going as far as to open a feasibility study about producing the iPhone at a US plant. Foxconn chairman Terry Gou pointed out the obvious: increased costs in production lead to higher costs for consumers.\nWould anyone buy a $1,500-plus iPhone?\nThe total cost of the build, according to data from IHS Markit, adds up to $219.80. Once you factor in labor costs, estimated at $5 per phone, the total build runs $224.80 for the base model, 32GB iPhone 7. The company claims that this is an increase of $36.89 per unit, as opposed to the $187.91 iPhone 6s base model from last year.\nGood luck getting labor down to $5 a unit in the US.\nChina put an enormous focus on manufacturing.

Gordon said 5.6 per cent of them were subsequently referred for confirmatory transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies.\nShe said the majority of the men who presented for screening were over the age of 50 years, which speaks to multiple barriers to prostate cancer screening given that screening should begin at age 40.\n\u201cWe have had meetings with the Ministry [of Health]. Together we have identified the gaps where cancer care [is concerned] and also the prevention strategy at the national level. Among the areas identified is, one: the national cancer registry, where we can get a better handle on the distribution determinants of cancer in the Jamaican population.\n\u201cTwo: the fact that we really need to establish the national cancer screening programme which would serve to cover at least 80 per cent of the population in order to have that impact because if we are saying that early detection is key to having a favourable outcome; the Cancer Society is about prevention and screening as a tool for that. It goes without saying, so I guess we have to just be more aggressive advocates,\u201d Gordon said at yesterday's Jamaica Observer Press Club.\nProstate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in the world and affects 72.7 per 100,000 Jamaican men.\nIt is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the country and the island has one of the highest prostate cancer mortality rates in the Caribbean.\nFor Dr Belinda Morrison, tackling prostate cancer must start at the policy level.\n\u201c...You don't have screening at a tertiary facility. It has to be at primary health care. These are clinics, doctors' office, health centres. So if you have that policy whereby doctors in primary care are advised that once they see patients at a particular age they should institute screening and recommend annual visits, or like in the UK (United Kingdom) where a mail is sent out to someone. So you have the date of birth of everybody in your population, so once you know a man reaches age 40 he's going to get a letter to say you need to come in for screening. We must have something like that.\n\u201cIt doesn't require much in terms of infrastructure. It's just a physician who can perform the physical exam and blood test which is already available in our public health care system,\u201d the urologist said.\nProstate cancer develops when abnormal cells begin to grow in the prostate, a walnut-sized gland in the male reproductive system located just below the bladder.\nRisk factors for prostate cancer include race, as Afro-Caribbean men are at a higher risk of developing the illness, family history, high/fat red meat diet, obesity and smoking.\nProstate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Jamaica for the past 15 years."}

The deep downturn left relatively few places untouched. Among the 100 largest metro areas, poverty rates rose in 79, and median household incomes declined in 82, between 2007 and 2010.\nNearly all large metro areas ended the decade with lower median incomes than in 2000. From 2000 to 2010, incomes declined in 91 of the 100 largest metro areas, and poverty rose in 88. In many, the recession merely exacerbated a negative pre-existing trend. In the first seven years of the decade, median household income fell in 70 metro areas, and poverty rates rose in 48. Census 2000 captured U.S. households at a high-water mark economically, a far different situation than they faced in 2010, or even before the Great Recession began.\nLarge poverty increases brought on by the Great Recession began in housing-bust and manufacturing-oriented metro areas, but subsequently spread to other places in the South and West. Over the first two years of the downturn, Sun Belt metro areas on the front lines of the housing market collapse\u2014in Florida, the Intermountain West, and inland California\u2014registered the largest increases in poverty rates. They were joined by a handful of metro areas in the nation\u2019s manufacturing belt like Indianapolis and Cleveland. Several of these places continued to experience rising poverty from 2009 to 2010, but the most affected places included a broader set of metro areas in the Southeast like Columbia, Birmingham, and Nashville; in other parts of the West like Salt Lake City and Colorado Springs; and in previously better-off regions like Austin and Omaha.\nThe recession increased overall poverty rates in cities and suburbs by similar degrees. From 2007 to 2010, the poverty rate in major-metro cities rose 2.9 percentage points, compared to 2.3 percentage points in suburbs. Older Northern regions like Akron, Baltimore, New Haven, and Rochester tended to experience much larger increases in city than suburban poverty, while some Southern and Western regions like Oklahoma City, Orlando, and Seattle saw poverty rates rise more in suburbs than cities. Overall, the poverty rate in cities (20.9 percent) remained far higher than that in suburbs (11.4 percent) in 2010.\nPoor populations continued their decade-long shift toward suburban areas. A combination of factors including overall population growth, job decentralization, aging of housing, immigration, region-wide economic decline, and policies to promote mobility of low-income households led increasing shares of the poor to inhabit suburbs over the decade. From 2000 to 2010, the number of poor individuals in major-metro suburbs grew 53 percent, compared to 23 percent in cities. In 16 metro areas, including Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee, the suburban poor population more than doubled during that time. The recession merely served to accelerate the trend, as suburbs added 3.4 million poor from 2007 to 2010\u20141.4 million more poor individuals than cities.\nMeager job growth and unemployment rate declines over the past year seem sure to extend many of the worrisome trends portrayed in the new data.

In a Google blog post, Fadell said that, with Google's support, \"Nest will be even better placed to build simple, thoughtful devices that make life easier at home, and that have a positive impact on the world.\"\nThe announcement sparked much discussion across the web, as many joked about Google+ integration with Nest's products and Google Ads showing up when you turn off your smoke alarm. But according to a statement Fadell delivered to TechCrunch, Nest will only use customer information for \"providing and improving Nest\u2019s products and services,\" indicating it will not be used for Google's larger advertising schemes.\nThat said, Google could certainly use Nest data to hone its online ads and other web services, changing its behavior according to when you're at home and even where you happen to be in your home. The company's Google Now service is already privy to such information.\nEarlier this month, Nest raised more than $150 million in funding after being valued at $2 billion. The startup made a name for itself with the Nest thermostat, which you can control over the net. The device learns from your behavioral patterns, adjusting itself in an effort to keep you comfortable and save money on your utility bills. Then, in October, Nest introduced a smoke detector that uses verbal and light cues to tell you when it's low on batteries or when carbon monoxide levels are dangerously high.\nThe acquisition is yet another way Google is moving into the hardware game. In mid-2012, it acquired Motorola Mobility, through which it sells smartphones and other devices. It offers the Chromebook Pixel, a machine that run its own Chrome OS operating systems. And it sells the much-praised (and super cheap) Chromecast dongle for new-age TV viewing.\nThe company isn't always successful with its hardware ambitions \u2013 witness the Nexus Q \u2013 but it will keep moving forward.

You don't know how much in revenues anything will produce.\nThe Legislative Analyst's Office, the non-partisan body, took a hard look at Gov. Jerry Brown's initiative to raise, temporarily, sales taxes and income taxes on those who make $250,000 or more.\nBut the LAO's estimate of how much this tax increase would produce in taxes is, at $4.8 billion, more than $2 billion less than Gov. Brown's estimate of $6.9 billion.\nThis discrepancy isn't a product of any wishful thinking on the governor's part. It's the nature of the volatile budget and tax system.\nThe volatility described above makes it difficult to forecast this measure\u2019s state revenue gains from high-income taxpayers. As a result, the estimates from our two offices of this measure\u2019s annual revenue increases vary. Between 2013\u201114 and 2015\u201116 (the three years in which both the PIT and SUT increases would be in effect for the entire fiscal year), the LAO currently forecasts an average annual increase in state revenues of $5.5 billion, and [Governor Brown's Department of Finance] DOF currently forecasts an average annual increase in state revenues of $6.9 billion. For the 2012\u201113 budget, the LAO forecasts this measure would generate $4.8 billion of additional revenues, and DOF forecasts $6.9 billion of additional revenues.\nThose are big differences.

{"idx": "30887", "prompt": "Continue the following text: This column was written by Henry Aaron.\nBehind closed doors all over Washington, serious people are working hard to design a major overhaul of the U.S. health care system. We should wish them well, but their chances of success are slim. Since yet another complete failure would be catastrophic, some attention should be given now to policies that are politically palatable, and would begin the evolution to a new and better health system.\nThree measures will start this process. Two--improved health information technology, and investment in research that would study the comparative effectiveness of various forms of health care--have already been put in motion. The third--a national health insurance exchange--has a bipartisan heritage and can appeal to both liberals and conservatives.\nThe reasons why systemic reform of the U.S. health care system is needed are widely recognized. Rising health care spending threatens private and public budgets alike. Avoidable medical error kills or injures hundreds of thousands annually. The number of uninsured continues to grow.\nAs clear as the need for reform are the reasons why wholesale change is unlikely. Covering the uninsured will cost money now, even if other reforms promise savings later. Taxes for some will go up. Since changing the way hospitals and doctors deliver health care means changing the way millions of people do their jobs, incomes of some providers will go down. And as health care is a $2.5 trillion behemoth, those who oppose change will be well funded and fight hard.\nAny doubts on this point should have been extinguished by the reception accorded President Obama's budget proposal to fund half of his $634 billion health reform reserve fund with increased taxes on high-bracket filers. Those whose taxes are now reduced by 33 cents or 35 cents for each dollar of itemized deductions would be limited to tax savings of only 28 cents. Not a bad idea, one might think--tax upper income households who have prospered mightily for two decades to pay for a reform that will benefit all. Think again! The Democratic chairs of the House and Senate tax writing committees ultimately condemned the proposal. Bad for charities, they declared. Other members of Congress from both parties agreed.\nSo, why do I believe that health IT, comparative effectiveness studies, and insurance exchanges will get larger-scale health reform underway?\nLet's start with the $19 billion included in the economic recovery bill to help physicians and hospitals introduce health information technology. If well-designed, health information technology can improve care coordination, reduce administrative spending, and, perhaps most importantly, generate information that will tell researchers, inexpensively, which treatments work, which don't, and at what cost. The economic recovery bill also includes $1.1 billion to pay for such research. Though initial savings will be modest, both are essential to any rational program of pruning waste and inefficiency, and will likely become only more essential over time.\nStill to be enacted is the seemingly drab, but strategically important, proposal to create a national health insurance exchange (or several regional ones). In the late 1980s, Alain Enthoven pointed out that no mortal human being can rationally choose among the myriad available health insurance plans. For markets to work, the number and diversity of plan features must be limited, and since insurers use a bewildering range of plan gimmicks to attract low-risk patients, the sale of insurance has to be tightly regulated. The Clinton administration was persuaded by the argument and proposed a variant of this idea in its proposal.\nBarack Obama included a similar call for a health insurance exchange"}

He died in Cuba on Christmas Eve 1899 while considering real estate there after the Spanish-American War.\nLand for Gilbert Park was donated to the city in 1922 by his son, Earl Gilbert, who was born in 1871 and died in 1938.\nByron and Caroline Bruce moved along with the Rossiters to Mount Dora November 1882 from Ohio. He purchased land on Lake Dora for the Bruce House May 13, 1884 and built the small hotel, which later became part of the Grandview Hotel. Caroline ran the hotel while her husband was involved in citrus.\nWhen Mrs. Bruce could no longer run the Bruce House she sold it and it passed through several hands until my father, Charles Edgerton, bought it in 1934.

Although the central government has launched a slew of hopeful-sounding initiatives\u2014the 11th 5-Year Plan says China will increase energy efficiency by 20 percent by 2010\u2014Beijing has not always put its money where its mouth is. China\u2019s chief environmental agency, SEPA, had only 300 full-time staff in 2004, compared with 6,000 in the U.S. EPA.\nThere\u2019s also little history of organized nongovernmental activism; it wasn\u2019t until 1998 that Chinese NGOs were even allowed to register with the government (and thus operate legally). By 2002, there were still only 50 registered environmental NGOs in China. But over the last five years, the number has skyrocketed to nearly 3,000 in 2007. Many of these groups operate on a shoestring; there is no government funding and China does not have a tradition of charitable giving nor the tax breaks that accompany it.\nOften the solution to such a problem is to simply pair up with a U.S. NGO or do foreign fundraising. Pat K.P. Yang, founder of the grassroots Zigen Fund, says her nonprofit has both U.S. and Chinese branches: All the fundraising is done by the U.S. branch, and the Chinese branch does the actual work of educating migrant workers on how to recycle trash, among other programs. The U.S.-based National Resources Defense Council follows a similar model, using the United States as a fundraising base but using those funds to compile environmental information for SEPA or to bring Chinese activists to the United States for training.\nInstead, many NGO leaders say educating the public is the best way to go. Television is an important medium because it is cheap entertainment and widely available. There is a growing interest in the public\u2019s right to know about pollution. And though the Chinese government may not support NGO actions, the Chinese people are much more concerned with global warming and environmental damage than Americans. Seventy percent cited pollution and environmental problems as the \u201ctop global threat\u201d in 2007, compared to just more than one-third of Americans.\nThis Beijing-based organization founded in 1998 offers free legal advice for citizens and runs an environmental hotline. It has assisted class-action pollution suits in nearly every province in China, nearly a third of them health related. The center\u2019s clients won in only 12 of the 35 health-related cases, but that\u2019s considered an achievement given that citizens are uninformed of their rights, local and judicial officials frequently have investments in polluting companies, and experts are either afraid to testify or exorbitantly expensive. Sometimes, the fees to file a lawsuit can double without notice, and unlike in the United States, defendants are not obliged to pay plaintiffs\u2019 legal fees if they lose. In 2005, the center worked on the largest environmental case in China to date: More than 1,700 residents sued a wealthy industrialist over forest die-offs, cancer, and other effects of intense air pollution.

By the end of the night, 95 protesters had been arrested, and no one was injured.\nThe confrontation at the bank came just a few hours after Lee met with a handful of Occupy S.F. protesters in an attempt to resolve the health and safety concerns at the growing encampment at Justin Herman Plaza, which faces The Embarcadero across the street from the Ferry Building, a popular tourist destination.\nLee demanded the demonstrators ban alcohol and drugs, increase the space between tents and clean portable toilets more often, among other reforms. But after a divided general assembly of the protesters Wednesday night, it remained unclear whether the campers would actually enact any of the changes before a city inspection set for early Thursday evening.\nLike mayors across the country, Lee has been walking a fine line between tolerance and enforcement. Lee leads a city steeped in a tradition of peaceful protest, and many of the supervisors support the Occupy S.F. movement. Some supervisors even stayed many hours at the encampment when it was rumored the police were going to raid the camp three weeks ago. While Oakland has shut its camp down and Berkeley is attempting to do so, San Francisco still is working with protesters to allow a camp to remain \u2014 begging the question of whether San Francisco will become the de facto epicenter of the Bay Area Occupy movement.\nAfter Lee\u2019s meeting with protesters, the mayor told reporters that the city had been patient in working with the demonstrators to improve health and safety conditions at the camp. Lee said he expected to see \u201cimmediate compliance\u201d with guidelines distributed by the city, which previously included restricting the encampment to 100 tents \u2014 half the number now in the plaza.\nLee would not say whether the number of tents in the camp needed to be winnowed down, or what would happen if the number was not reduced.\n\u201cI have expressed very strongly that I need dramatic changes in the occupiers\u2019 presence and their willingness to cooperate with conditions we\u2019ve set up,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them an immediate opportunity to demonstrate\u201d compliance.\nOne protester after the meeting said she was heading back to the camp to clean up with brooms and mops, but it remained unclear whether any evictions would occur if tents weren\u2019t removed.\nLee was clearly not happy with the encampment overnight.

Easy to set up and use. Relatively affordable. Good range. End-to-end encryption.\nCan't contact emergency services. No voice calling or picture messages. Store and forward (mesh network) prohibited by FCC regulation.\nThe GoTenna is a radio-based off-the-grid communication tool that lets you reliably send texts and share location data with other users from your smart device, making it a good alternative to pricey satellite phones.\nAnyone who's been camping knows what a chore it can be to get a cell phone signal out in the middle of the wilderness. Most of the time you're lucky if you can even send texts, let alone pull up a map. The GoTenna ($199 for a pair) is a stick-like off-the-grid communication device that uses a 2-watt Very High Frequency (VHF) radio to send messages and location data to other users. That means you and your camping buddy can communicate by text and arrange to meet up using your Android or iOS device, without having to depend on dubious network connectivity. Its reliable performance, combined with easy usability, earn the GoTenna our Editors' Choice.\nThe GoTenna is a two-tone stick that measures 5.8 by 1.0 by 0.5 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.8 ounces. You get two GoTennas per package, each of which has a bright nylon strap. Our review units came with purple and orange straps, but there are also straps in green and blue. The strap helps attach the GoTenna to your backpack, an article of clothing, or other equipment. Attaching it to your backpack is easy, and it's light enough to you won't even notice the addition.\nThe bottom half of the stick is gray aluminum with GoTenna branding, and the top half is black, textured plastic. A white notification LED sits in the middle\u2014flashing to tell you when the device is on and if you're connected. Up top is an extendable antenna that you pull out to activate the GoTenna. A plastic flap on the bottom covers a micro USB port.\nThe GoTenna is fairly durable, designed to be resistant to both dust and water, but it's not ultra-rugged, so you should still be relatively careful. That said, it did survive an accidental coffee spill.\nYou need to download the free GoTenna app to your Android or iOS device to get started. The app runs you through the setup process, which involves connecting to the GoTenna via Bluetooth 4.0. You can use your phone number to set up your profile on the GoTenna app, or you can have the app generate a general identification number (GID) at random. I connected the GoTenna to an iPhone 6s Plus with a phone number and a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 with a GID, and each setup process went off without a hitch. Once paired, your phone will automatically connect with the GoTenna when it is withing Bluetooth range (about 100 feet).\nThe GoTenna app itself is simple and functional. There are three main things you can do from the home screen: You can send One-on-One messages to anyone on your contact list with a GoTenna; send Shout messages to"}

It all depends on why and when you are canceling your trip, what sort of ticket you bought and what sort of coverage you have. Before making demands on a hapless ticket agent, read through United's policy carefully to determine exactly what you are -- and are not -- entitled to receive.\nPer federal regulations, all tickets bought directly through United are eligible for full refunds, without penalty, within 24 hours of purchase. After canceling, you can get your refund through United's refund webpage. If you bought your ticket through an agency or other third party, you should contact that party for its refund policy. After that 24-hour window, you are no longer eligible for a refund unless you bought a refundable \"Y\" class ticket. If you cancel a nonrefundable ticket, United usually will apply the cost of the ticket to a future flight, minus a fee. If you get a credit, ask about what restrictions apply, such as a time limit.\nUnited will refund your ticket regardless of fare class in certain extenuating circumstances. These include serious illness or death of an immediate family member or your travel companion, or your own illness that prevents you from traveling. United requires documentation: a death certificate in cases of death and a formal letter from the attending physician in cases of illness. If you have to miss your trip because of jury duty, you also might be entitled to a refund, but you will have to provide a copy of your jury summons. In all of these cases, United charges a $50 processing fee, but you otherwise should receive a full refund.\nIf a delayed or canceled flight forces you to cancel your trip, United will refund your ticket regardless of its fare class. If you already have started on your trip and get stranded in a connecting city, United will return you to your home city and provide a refund. Any compensation beyond that will depend on the circumstances around the cancellation since no federal requirements exists. If United was at fault -- aircraft maintenance or missing crew members, for example -- the company might provide food, meal vouchers and hotel accommodations while you are stranded. If weather, air traffic control or other circumstances outside of United's control canceled your flight, United still might provide meals or food vouchers, but it will not provide a hotel. It might, however, give you access to discounted rates at nearby hotels.\nUnited offers trip insurance through Allianz Global Assistance. Buying it entitles you to full reimbursement of any deposits or nonrefundable tickets should you have to cancel your trip for a variety of reasons. This could include getting into a traffic accident on the way to the airport, getting laid off from your job, or an illness or death in the family. If you are concerned about a potential cancellation when booking your flight, read the policy carefully to see whether it will apply to your circumstances. You also could buy a policy from third-party insurers, which are more expensive but have fewer restrictions.\nAirfare Watchdog: Should You Buy Travel Insurance From Your Airline or Online Travel Agent?"}

{"idx": "30909", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Racial disparities in the restaurant labor force of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport are hurting African-American employees and contributing to poverty in Baltimore, according to a study released Monday by the national labor organization Unite Here.\nOfficials with AirMall USA, which subcontracts concessions operations at the airport for the Maryland Aviation Administration, rebutted the findings.\nThe study, which Unite Here produced in collaboration with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, found African-American employees disproportionately work in low-wage positions at fast-food chains and in the back of airport restaurants as dishwashers and cooks, while white employees tend to fill higher-paying, front-of-house jobs as bartenders and servers.\nBased on a survey of 437 employees of BWI concessions contractors, the study also found 83 percent of the black employees live in Baltimore. A separate wage survey of 180 employees found a median hourly wage for nontipped workers of $8.50, which the study concluded served to \"perpetuate rather than alleviate poverty\" in the city.\nThe study specifically calls out AirMall USA for allowing racial disparities to exist, even though AirMall subcontracts BWI's concessions to independent businesses that make their own hiring decisions.\nBrett Kelly, vice president of AirMall Maryland, said in a statement that the claim of racial disparities among BWI concessions employees was \"simply unfounded.\"\n\"The concession program at BWI Marshall has brought new businesses to the airport, resulting in more jobs and opportunities for everyone in our region,\" he said. \"We stand behind the merits of the program and our strong track record. To attempt to make this a race issue is careless and unsubstantiated.\"\nLast year, AirMall commissioned a wage survey that it said found its subcontractors' employees make more than similar employees who work nearby, with the average hourly food and beverage worker at BWI earning $11.62 per hour.\nIt cited Bureau of Labor Statistics data that showed similar workers in Anne Arundel County, where the airport is located, made an average of $8.67 per hour.\nJonathan Dean, an airport spokesman, said one of BWI's \"primary objectives is to have a diverse, inclusive\" concessions program that offers opportunities under the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, which requires airports to provide business opportunities to minority companies. Such companies currently represent more than 36 percent of all concessions sales at BWI, he said.\nThe airport also has about 1,500 concessions employees, Dean said, more than three times the number surveyed in the Unite Here study.\nUnite Here, which advocates for hospitality workers nationwide, does not represent the concessions workers it surveyed, though it has been working to help BWI employees negotiate for wage increases.\nGerald Stansbury, president of the Maryland State Conference of the NAACP and author of the study's introduction, called the findings \"unconscionable\" in a statement.\nStansbury said the report is meant to help in \"diagnosing the problem\" of racial disparity at the airport, and that the state should consider ending its contract with AirMall unless something changes.\n\"That this inequality should exist in a facility named in honor of Thurgood Marshall \u2014 one of this country's most influential leaders in the struggle for equal rights \u2014 makes it even more egregious,\" he said."}

Now health officials are reaching out and redoubling their efforts.\nIronically, just a few years ago Somali children in Minnesota had extremely high vaccination rates. Then, in 2008, an apparent cluster of autism cases among Somali children in Minneapolis prompted a scare based on a discredited theory involving the measles vaccine that was popularized 20 years earlier by British researcher Andrew Wakefield.\nVaccination rates among Somali children plummeted. For Somali 2-year-olds, they were as high as 92 percent in 2004, but today stand at just 42 percent.\n\u201cThe community is not afraid of immunization [in general],\u201d Ashkir said \u2014 just fearful that there is something suspect about the measles shot.\nThat link has been debunked by many scientific studies in several countries, stretching back several decades. In addition, expert reviews conducted by medical professional societies and other advisory bodies, including the National Academy of Medicine, have said there is no evidence to prove that the vaccine causes autism.\nAnab Gulaid, a former member of the Health Department\u2019s public health advisory group, stresses that sort of research when she counsels Somali parents.\nBut she also said health officials have to understand why Somali parents are anxious. She recalled a Somali mother who spoke at a public health meeting at the Brian Coyle Community Center some years ago. She had given birth to several healthy children in Africa, but her first child in the United States showed autism symptoms at an early age.\n\u201cThe day care told us we can come back if the kids don\u2019t get sick in three weeks,\u201d she said.\nSayid said she doesn\u2019t oppose vaccines in general \u2014 she plans to get her oldest vaccinated at 7 and the younger two at age 4 \u2014 but she\u2019s heard that early vaccination can damage an infant\u2019s language skills.\nTo overcome this lingering skepticism, outreach workers like Fatuma Irshat, a member of the Somali public health advisory group, said she stresses science and community responsibility as she makes the rounds in her St. Louis Park neighborhood, talking to other Somali parents.\nShe points out that some infants are too young to have completed their MMR vaccination cycle, and she tells parents with older children they have an obligation to protect other families\u2019 children.\nIn a related effort, several Twin Cities health care providers are tapping Muslim chaplains who may have special influence among devout families.\nSharif Abdirahman Mohamed is an imam at the Dar al Hijrah mosque in Minneapolis and a chaplain for Fairview Health Services. When he visits Somali families he cites the hadith, the sayings and actions of the prophet Mohammed, and verses from the Qur\u2019an to allay fears.\nIslam says \u201cyou should ask the people who have expertise and knowledge, if you don\u2019t know the subject,\u201d Mohamed said. Islam, he said, also instructs Muslims to protect others in their community.\n\u201cSpreading measles is harming the community, not just your kid,\u201d he added."}

The shooting occurred in the area of Dixwell Avenue and Argyle Street, blocks from the New Haven-Hamden line.

{"idx": "30919", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Joel Santo Domingo Google Pixelbook The Google Pixelbook is a powerful, upscale 2-in-1 convertible laptop that will serve well-heeled Android and chromebook fans well.\nChromebooks have made inroads in business and education as cheap, streamlined, yet capable laptops. But can Google muscle into the ultra-premium convertible market? The Google Pixelbook (starts at $999; $1,119 as tested) is a chromebook with a stylish metal design, and seems tailor-made for the status-conscious Chrome OS user who wants the flexibility of a 2-in-1 convertible laptop. The big issue is that high-end Windows convertibles like the Lenovo Yoga 920 and the HP Spectre x360 13 are around the same price, have similar components, and offer greater utility, thanks to a vast install base and Windows program support. To switch to the Pixelbook, you have to give all that up.\nThe 12.5-inch 2,400-by-1,600 display is covered by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass. Viewing is excellent in all modes, with virtually no dimming or color shifts, even at extreme angles. It's bright, rated at 400 nits, the same as the screen on the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. Screen quality is satisfyingly crisp, text has no jaggy edges, and photos and videos have excellent detail and color fidelity.\nUsing the touch screen is smooth and a digitizer is built into the display to support the optional $99 Google Pixelbook Pen. The pen allows for subtle or broad strokes in drawings and hand-written notes, and works seamlessly in all four convertible modes, though there is a bit of screen bounce if you draw or tap in laptop mode. The blunt end of the stylus works as an eraser. There's no storage for the pen on the laptop, unlike the Surface Pen that handily clips to the Surface Laptop magnetically.\nThe pen also has a cool trick: Instead of invoking a right-click, as on most Windows-based pens, the Pixelbook Pen's button activates Google Assistant, a tool that searches anything you circle on the screen. For example, if you encircle a picture of a painting, Google Assistant will bring up its Wikipedia entry, identify the artist, and even give you directions to the museum displaying the art. It's an addictive tool, and works quickly in most apps. Saying the words \"OK Google\" or tapping its dedicated keyboard button will also wake up Google Assistant for queries. In my tests, it couldn't identify everything, though. For example, it had trouble finding some app logos, but I anticipate that performance will improve over time as Google's databases adapt.\nThe Pixelbook's chiclet-style backlit keyboard has a shallow keystroke, similar to the Apple MacBook Air, but the springs feel a lot snappier, so it's more satisfying to type on. Like other chromebooks, the function keys have been replaced with a row of Chrome OS-specific keys. In addition, a search button replaces the Caps Lock key, and a Google Assistant key is where the Start key would be on a Windows laptop. It took about 30 minutes to get used to the new layout and key feel. It's more comfortable using the Pixelbook on my lap than a 2-in-1 with a flappy keyboard cover, like the Apple iPad Pro or the Microsoft"}

{"idx": "30925", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Meredith Gardner, who has died aged 89, was the American codebreaker responsible for breaking the ciphers that led to the arrests of the atom spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and the break-up of the Cambridge spy ring.\nDuring the late 1940s, Gardner was the main cryptanalyst working on the Venona material, messages sent between the KGB's Moscow Centre and its agent handlers abroad using the theoretically unbreakable one-time pad system.\nFluent in French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Lithuanian, Russian and Spanish, Gardner joined the United States Army's codebreaking organisation, the Signals Security Agency, early in the Second World War.\nHe worked initially on German ciphers and then on Japanese super-enciphered codes, in which messages were first encoded in five-figure groups taken from a code book and then enciphered by adding a series of randomly produced figures, known as an additive, which was taken from a second book.\nThe techniques needed to break these messages were to be extremely useful to Gardner when, in late 1945, he was assigned to work on what was then known simply as \"the Russian problem\".\nKGB messages were produced in exactly the same way as Japanese super-enciphered codes. But where the Japanese gave the codebreakers a way in by repeatedly using the same sequences of additive, the Russian system did not.\nAs its name suggests, the additive appeared on separate sheets of a pad. Once a stream of additive had been used, that sheet was torn off and destroyed, making the message impossible to break.\nBut because of wartime shortages, the Russians made a critical mistake. Several pads had been duplicated and sent to different KGB stations abroad. Although it was still not easy to break, the American codebreakers had the help of a partially burned codebook abandoned in Finland.\nThe intelligence which they produced represented the crown jewels for the FBI and MI5, vital information on the many Soviet agents operating against the West. The breakthrough came on December 20 1946, when Gardner read part of a message that contained a list of leading scientists working on the Manhattan Project, the development of the atomic bomb.\nSent two years earlier, the message was the first hint that there might be Soviet spies working at the Los Alamos atomic weapons plant. By August 1947, when he produced his first report on the Venona messages, Gardner had found a number of agents all referred to by codenames.\nOne, codenamed Liberal, had appeared in six separate messages. The only clue to his identity lay in the name of his 29-year-old wife. Gardner, a lifelong fan of crossword puzzles, was particularly pleased with the way in which he had come up with the wife's name.\nThe KGB cipher clerk had spelt the name of Liberal's wife out in single letters but there were only three groups, the first representing E and the third L. \"I had never come across a three letter meaning in the spell code,\" he later recalled. \"Then I said: ah, but they anticipate sending a lot of English text, and the most common word in the English language is 'the'.\"\nThe name of Liberal's wife was Ethel, one of the key clues that led to the uncovering of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who, in 1953, were sent to the electric chair.\nAnother wartime Venona message, which Gardner was finally able to break in 1949, revealed that a"}

This means you can explore cow barns, pens full of llamas and goats and see a bunch of horses.\nSince this is (sort of) a fair, you can also buy corn dogs underneath an Interstate 70 underpass and drink a Coors Light (sorry beer aficionados, this is a place for macro-brews) in a bar that happens to be directly adjacent to a cow barn.\nIt's also worth it just to see people from Highlands Ranch whip out their cowboy boots once a year.\nThe National Western Stock Show Complex is basically just off of I-25 and I-70 at 4655 Humboldt St. This is technically the Elyria-Swansea neighborhood, but it\u2019s close enough to River North where you can easily stop at places like Great Divide or The Source to grab a drink or some food before or after you enjoy the Stock Show itself.\nHow much does it cost to get in?\nGrounds admission is $10 to $20, depending on which day you go. This allows you to explore the Stock Show grounds and see people show livestock in the smaller venues, but it doesn\u2019t get you into the rodeo, which costs extra.\nLike with anything else, food and beer are both sold separately \u2013 and bring plenty of cash to buy that pair of cowboy boots you didn\u2019t know you needed, but totally do now that you realize that\u2019s an option and most people look pretty good in them.\nWith all of this being said, parking is free in certain lots.

The local oyster industry has taken hit after hit since POMS was detected in Tasmania in 2016. While it was that outbreak which crippled the local industry with no spat allowed in from the state where local growers typically purchased about 80 per cent of their spat \u2013 it was the outbreak of the disease in feral oysters in the Port River at the beginning of March which put the industry on edge. Local growers and the wider industry have had to face and overcome spat shortages, restrictions on the movement of pacific oysters and lots of uncertainty in the last two years. According to South Australian Oyster Growers Association chief executive officer Trudy McGowan, PIRSA\u2019s quick response to the Port River outbreak played a big part in putting growers minds at ease. The state government has also tried to lessen the financial burden on growers by putting a hold oyster lease fees for growers. While there is no questioning POMS has been devastating to the industry, both here and interstate, the silver lining is that the Eyre Peninsula will come out of it with more security than ever before. Two years on and Eyre Peninsula has two new hatcheries \u2013 one based at Cowell \u2013 to supply growers with pacific oyster spat. Eyre Shellfish hatchery at Cowell also has enormous potential for growth. Once the the backlog of spat for local growers has been filled there is no reason why the state-of-the-art facility could not sell spat interstate, to become a net exporter of juvenile oysters. The development of the hatchery also lessened the impact of the Port River outbreak on Cowell growers as they were still able to move local spat from the hatchery onto Cowell leases. However, there is the potential for POMS to find its way into the industry in the future so perhaps developing a POMS resistant oyster is the way forward. One thing is for sure, the (supposed) oncoming cooler weather and water temperatures will give growers and the industry a much needed breather to work out where to from here.\nTHE commercial oyster industry on the Eyre Peninsula breathed a sigh of relief last week when Primary Industries and Regions SA announced the whole of South Australia\u2019s oyster industry was free of POMS (Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome).\nThe local oyster industry has taken hit after hit since POMS was detected in Tasmania in 2016.\nWhile it was that outbreak which crippled the local industry with no spat allowed in from the state where local growers typically purchased about 80 per cent of their spat \u2013 it was the outbreak of the disease in feral oysters in the Port River at the beginning of March which put the industry on edge.\nLocal growers and the wider industry have had to face and overcome spat shortages, restrictions on the movement of pacific oysters and lots of uncertainty in the last two years.\nAccording to South Australian Oyster Growers Association chief executive officer Trudy McGowan, PIRSA\u2019s quick response to the Port River outbreak played a big part in putting growers minds at ease.\nThe state government has also tried to lessen the financial burden on growers by putting a hold oyster lease fees for growers.\nWhile there is no questioning POMS has been devastating to the industry, both here and interstate, the"}

He simply couldn't recapture the qualities that made the character so memorable in the first three films, leaving us thirsting for a taste of that rogue hero.\nFrom \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\" Ford's Indy was a cranky James Bond in the desert, equipped with a whip and revolver rather than fancy gadgets, governed by a hunger to protect threatened history in the face of organized evil trying to exploit it. He was feisty, quick-witted, vulnerable and funny. By his last incarnation, in \"Crystal Skull,\" he had become a caricature \u2014 the byproduct of Ford dusting off a character left on the shelf for 19 years as well as a story lacking any of the intrigue and drama that made its predecessors real heart-racing adventures.\nNonetheless, Ford is Indiana Jones, and any other actor (there was actual dread that Shia LaBeouf would be the heir apparent) would be a betrayal to fans who remember sitting enraptured \u2014 whether as youngsters or adults \u2014 watching \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d unfold back in 1981.\nAnd being in his 70s makes Harrison Ford an exceptionally rare movie hero. The real question about \u201cIndiana Jones 5,\u201d due out in 2019 when Ford will turn 77, is whether Steven Spielberg get a screenwriter to craft a story befitting the iconic hero. If the material isn\u2019t there, there's nothing Ford can do to save things. If it is, expect the star to recapture some of the magic that has made Indy one of pop culture's most beloved figures.\nSince its birth, Hollywood has been a young person\u2019s town with a product to match. Producers are always scouting the hot 18-year-old property to push their decrepit 30-year-olds literally out of the picture. And while the cynic may recoil in thinking this is the moldy \u201crespect-your-elders\u201d argument \u2014 I\u2019ll take it a step further. Movies beat us over the head with the notion that valor is a quality reserved for the young. The doctor doesn\u2019t prescribe bravery along with an older person's cholesterol medicine.\nThink about it. What immediately comes to mind when you picture characters of retirement age on film? They\u2019re often needy, fragile and infirm, perhaps a thorn in the protagonist's side or maybe just cooking dinner for everyone.\nAnd then there\u2019s the common thread to America\u2019s action heroes.

Also, they can withstand 900 times their body weight without being hurt. That's equivalent to a 200-pound man who wouldn't be crushed by 90 tons on his head.\nThe amazing cockroach inspired scientists to create a mini-robot that can mimic those feats of strength and agility.\nThe researchers hope swarms of future roach-like robots could be fitted with cameras, microphones and other sensors and then used in earthquakes and other disasters to help search for victims by squeezing through small cracks. The skittering robots could also let rescuers know if the rubble pile is stable.\nCockroaches \"seem to be able to go anywhere,\" said University of California at Berkeley biology professor Robert Full, co-author of a study about the prototype cockroach robot. \"I think they're really disgusting and really revolting, but they always tell us something new.\"\nThe study was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe palm-size prototype, called the Compressible Robot with Articulated Mechanisms, or CRAM, looks more like an armadillo and walks sort of like Charlie Chaplin when it's compressed. It's about 20 times the size of the roach that inspired it. And it's simple and cheap.\nCo-author Kaushik Jayaram, a Harvard robotics researcher, said the most difficult part was the design, but after that he used off-the-shelf electronics and motors, cardboard, polyester and some knowledge of origami. He could probably put one together in about half an hour, he estimated.\nAll told, the prototype probably cost less than $100, Jayaram said. He figures if mass-produced, with sensors and other equipment added on, the robots could eventually cost less than $10 apiece.\nIn the past, when engineers looked at trying to create robots that could get into tight places, they thought about shape-changing soft animals like worms, slugs or octopuses, Full said. But the cockroach, which already is studied by roboticists for other abilities, has certain advantages, including crush-resistance and speed.\nWith nothing in its way, the American cockroach can travel 50 body lengths in a second, which would be the equivalent of a human running more than 140 mph, Full said. When compressed, the cockroach slows to 20 body lengths per second, which is still pretty fast.\nFull and colleagues found roaches used a newly identified type of locomotion to ooze through cracks and crevices based on the ideal amount of belly friction.\nCockroaches have inspired other robots, including ones that travel on six legs to get over debris more easily, said Johns Hopkins University mechanical engineering professor Noah Cowan, who wasn't part of the study. He said cockroaches and insects in general are great design guides for roboticists to borrow from.\n\"There's definitely a case for machines that can go into environments that are not safe for humans to go into,\" Cowan said.\nStill, the robot designers have no love for the bug that inspired them.\n\"I'm still creeped out by them,\" Jayaram said. \"I"}

This time, that number was 15.7%. The New York-based real estate investment trust (REIT) announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday and its shareholders, who have grown accustomed windfall profits by the company, were not disappointed.\nIn addition to the increase in FFO, there were many other positive revelations stemming from the company's earnings release. The commercial office space landlord announced that same-store net operating income of its wholly-owned properties increased by 22.3% versus the year-ago quarter and that the company's net income had increased by 26.5% on a per share basis. As an added incentive for income investors, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 16.7%. The announcement marks the ninth consecutive year that management has upped its dividend payout rate to common shareholders.\nSL Green is coming off a big year in which its stock price stormed up the charts, churning out a 78% return for investors plus dividends. Using Dec. 31 as an endpoint, the stock has risen 221% from three years ago and over 800% from nine years ago. For Fools looking at a long-term investing horizon, this security has been a clutch performer. Out of curiosity, I took a look back to see if there were any prolonged periods where shareholders of this company suffered, and there really weren't any. The stock has been virtually unstoppable for the better part of the past nine years.\nI believe one of the primary motivating factors for purchasing shares of this REIT is fairly simple. The majority of SL Green's office space is located in Manhattan, and last time I checked, rent wasn't getting any cheaper in the Big Apple. For its Q4, the company was able to ink average starting office rents that represented an almost usurious 28.7% increase over previously fully escalated rents. Occupancy also increased from 96.1% in Sept. 2006 to 97% in Dec. 31, 2006. These remarkable occupancy rates are a theme common among SL Green competitors Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) and Brookfield Properties (NYSE:BPO), who also lease commercial property in the New York metropolitan area. Both REITs maintain occupancy rates of over 95% for their New York properties.\nSL Green has definitely set the bar high for itself. It might not return shareholders another 78% this year, but I think outperforming the market will not be a concern. The stock has already appreciated 10% one month into 2007. The company's Q4 numbers serve as yet another reminder that this REIT can deliver the financial results necessary to back up the lavish returns to its shareholders.\nLooking to escalate your portfolio's returns from stocks with strong dividend histories?

As concerning as this provision is, it is not the only one that warrants careful scrutiny.\n- the introduction of collaboration and donor-funded schools, at which donors and private entities are afforded a significant stake in the governance of public schools in a manner that undermines the principles of democratic governance and accountability.\n- the introduction of intervention facilities for pupils found guilty of serious misconduct (a form of educational halfway house.\n- the establishment of new school evaluation body that will report directly to the MEC.\nIn its submission on the Bill, Equal Education (EE) argues that many of the proposed amendments are variously unlawful, redundant, contrary to the spirit of democracy and redress in education, unlikely to improve educational outcomes, and potentially directly harmful.\nThe draft legislation is making its way through the provincial legislative process.

If you are not with us, you are against us.\"\nIngram's .ca address sparked the notice from CompAtlanta, based in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Canada is one of a number of countries that said it would not support an American invasion of Iraq without United Nations' approval.\n\"I've made a winning bid,'' Ingram said. \"To discriminate against me because I'm a Canadian is ridiculous.\"\nSid Mitchell, CompAtlanta's president, could not be reached for comment. However, an e-mail exchange between Ingram and Mitchell clearly laid out the company's policy: \"What part of this listing do you not understand?\" Mitchell wrote Ingram. \"This item will not be shipped outside the USA, and we do not accept bids from Canadians. Both are plainly stated.\"\nThat didn't stop Ingram from trying again over the weekend. He bid for the laser printer a second time, offering $107.50 to avoid being outbid and specifying delivery to an American address. In a separate message, he informed Mitchell that he wanted the printer shipped stateside.\nJudging by Mitchell's reply, however, Ingram isn't likely to get his printer from CompAtlanta: \"You are obviously trying to get around the fact that you are Canadian,\" Mitchell wrote to Ingram, \"and we will not honor your bid or ship to any location for you.\"\nIngram said Mitchell lacks a good business reason for not shipping to a Canadian who uses an American address. \"If they're going to do that,'' Ingram said, \"then they shouldn't sell to the 50 percent of Democrats and the 20 percent of Republicans that aren't supporting the war, either.\"\nCompAtlanta is one of a small number of companies boycotting countries opposed to the war. The German newspaper Deutsche Welle reported late last week that a German shoe-supply manufacturer lost a contract with an American firm over Germany's stance on the war. There have also been reports of American consumers boycotting French wine and cheese.\nBut the boycotts aren't widespread yet. JoAnn Dupont, a customer service representative with eBay vendor IkeSound.com of Florida, said her company's policy of shipping to Canada and other countries has not changed as a result of the war.\nAnd some eBay vendors selling such items as Saddam Hussein \"terrorist hunting licenses\" and dart boards will ship them anywhere in the world.\nAndre Lemay, a spokesman for the Canadian department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in Ottawa, said he wasn't aware of any reverse boycott.

We read the details, and we are outraged: a father who committed suicide after his 3-year old son was torn away from him, one mother seeking asylum who was separated from her 18-month-old son for two months, another mother seeking asylum who could hear her 7-year-old daughter \u201cfrantically screaming\u201d from the next room as the two were separated. But we may also feel helpless. What, after all, can any one of us do to stop this?\nIt is natural to feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of such government action. The reality, however, is that each of has choices we can make, and actions we can take, depending on our specific circumstances and roles.\nDonald Trump has smugly lied by claiming that laws passed by Democrats force the separation of children from parents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions insists that it is necessary to separate children from their parents when they are detained at the border. Anyone serving in this administration has a choice to make: If they remain in their jobs without saying anything, then they are supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s lie, and endorsing Mr. Sessions\u2019 claim that the administration\u2019s policy is necessary. Administration officials could send a strong message by calling out the lie, denouncing the policy and resigning from their posts.\nElected leaders cannot act alone. They depend on subordinates willing to carry out orders \u2014 in this case, orders directed to ICE and other government officials to separate young children from their parents. Many of the people who carry out these orders are undoubtedly \u201cordinary\" people in the sense that, outside of their work, they likely treat their neighbors and co-workers with kindness and do not intentionally seek to harm others. They should be moved to face the contradiction between what they do at work and the people they imagine themselves to be.\nJournalists can play an important role by investigating what is going on and refusing to engage in \u201cstenographic reporting\u201d that uncritically repeats the government\u2019s position without comment. Dara Lind has explained in exacting detail why the Trump administration\u2019s cruel policy makes no sense; work like hers is essential.\nA San Diego federal judge ruled that the Trump administration policy of separating unauthorized immigrant parents from their children is unconstitutional, describing the allegations of forced separations as \u201cbrutal\u201d and unfair.\nBusiness leaders are positioned to stand up to the president, if they choose to do so. This is a moral question, so one might conclude CEOs of leading companies will see no upside in speaking out. But some took action based on moral principle last year, after Mr. Trump\u2019s words of support for white supremacists and neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville. CEOs could, and should, do so again now.\nAs for the rest of us, we may not have the direct ability to influence action in the way that others listed here do, but that doesn\u2019t mean we are helpless.

However, our military service has taught us that intelligence is an integral part of Israel's military occupation over the territories.\"\nThey also mentioned how, unlike with Israeli citizens, there is virtually no protection of Palestinians from surveillance, nor any limits to it.\nThey explained that it is a decision based on conscience and a realization that continuing to carry out their duties effectively robs millions of their human rights. The letter was also driven by a sense of \u201curgency and responsibility,\u201d one captain in the reserves, Daniel, told the Haaretz newspaper.\n\u201cIn the end, I served there for seven years. I believed in what we did there \u2014 and for all those reasons, I must take responsibility for what I see as the perpetuation of the cycle of violence. We hope that people will think critically about these things,\u201d he said.\nIsrael Radio relayed the reaction of Palestinian intelligence. Their spokesman, Adnan Damiri attested to the positive reception of the IDF signatories\u2019 initiative back home, saying that the humanitarian and moral character of their decision was notable and appreciated.\nHaaretz also reached the IDF to get some comment on how the letter was perceived.\nThis is not the first instance that a complaint was publicly filed by the unit\u2019s own members questioning its methods.\nAccording to The Guardian, a decade-old case involved several pilots who refused to take part in targeted assassination missions. This is seen as a very rare case in the Israeli military, where commitment, as well as a desire to extend the service, seems to be commonplace.\nAlthough those involved told the newspaper they were proud of some of the missions inasmuch as they served to defend Israel, they also pointed to how there was also a culture of impunity which frowned upon questioning the legality of any decisions taken and strategies planned by superiors.\nThis somewhat contrasts with the IDF spokesman\u2019s words to Haaretz.\nThe servicemen told The Guardian there were \u201cno rules\u201d regarding the procedure for targeting Palestinians for intelligence purposes or to be used as informants.\n\u201cThe intelligence gathering about Palestinians is not clean. When you rule a population that does not have political rights, laws like we have, [then] the nature of this regime of ruling over people, especially when you do it for many years, [is that] it forces you to take control or infiltrate every aspect of their life,\u201d Nadav said.\nAll in all, the idea voiced by the soldiers is that without coercion and repression, there can be no governance.

If we trust the media and government agencies, this seems to be so. If you examine the emails sent during the last 3-4 years you arrive at the conclusion that this is a group of India-haters who want to avenge atrocities perpetrated on Indian Muslims. However, whatever apparently seems is normally far from the truth. Intelligence agencies resort to fictitious versions and misleading messages in order to cover up facts. LeT or similar organisations based in Pakistan could be behind I.M. Ever since Pakistan has attracted worldwide condemnation for being the epicentre of world terror, Pakistani agencies have been trying to prove that the Kashmir or Indian incidents are the consequences of local unrest and Pakistan has nothing to do with it.\nSaffron network?: It is also quite likely that Hindu outfits might be operating under the garb of \u201cIndian Mujahideen\u201d. These groups had resorted to such heinous tactics in the past too. Instead of Pakistan being their target, Indian Muslims have suffered their ire. This might to be a strategy to tarnish the image of the Indian Muslims throughout the country to incite hostile feelings against them so that they might be relegated to class three citizens. Ever since this group has been caught red-handed, it is trying to divert the attention of investigation agencies. In the past, too, raids conducted on their hideouts discovered fake beards and skull caps. Under the garb of Muslim identity, they were found indulging in nefarious activities. After the arrest of Hindu extremists, there had been a sharp decline in bomb explosions. It was being said that as Hindu extremists are behind bars, explosions have stopped as they alone were responsible for the violence. In order to disprove the above feeling, the Varanasi bomb could be an attempt to prove otherwise. A terrorist act could be resorted to divert the attention of investigation agencies from Abhinav Bharat and RSS.\nIsraeli conspiracy: Israel and its intelligence agency Mossad can also conspire to tarnish Indian Muslims behind the mask of \u201cIndian Mujahideen\u201d. Persons who are conversant with the Mossad strategies know that its agents not only target foes but also attack friends and by using Muslim identity they try to invoke hatred for Muslims all over the world. The aim is to create ill-will against them so that its own actions against Palestinians gets legitimacy. Mossad has been active in India since long because Israel and Zionism want India\u2019s support and win her to its camp. In order to win majority support it might be operating behind the garb of \u201cIM\u201d by tarnishing Indian Muslims.\nAmerican game plan: There might be an international group under the cover of \u201cIM\u201d. since long India and other European nations have been raising the question: while Muslims all over the world are involved in terror acts why do Indian Muslims condemn them? Throughout Europe, America and Australia I have been bombarded with this question: why Indian Muslims are different from other Muslims?

Wading through a sea of internet sites could often drown a Soldier in waves of confusion about medical benefits, retirement pay, life insurance and more. It can be even more troublesome for what is called \"gray area\" retirees. \"Gray area\" retirees are those who have retired from the reserve components but have not reached age 60 and will not draw retirement pay until then. In some cases, they spent more time in the gray area than they did in the military and have no idea how to go about getting their benefits.\nIn April 2012, , the U.S. Army Reserve Command created retirement services officers and assigned them to each Regional Support Command in order to alleviate the problems retired Soldiers were experiencing. Each RSC has a captain and a master sergeant as retirement service officers who can go to each state and provide a linkage between service providers and the retirees as well as points of contact for all retiring and retired Soldiers, surviving spouses and their families who have questions. \"This pilot program was created to provide the National Guard and Reserve an opportunity to come to an event in their state and find out all the information about retirement programs and benefits,\" explained Capt. Maya Troupe, one of the RSOs for the 81st. The placement of RSOs in each RSC was in response to Army Family Action Plan issue # 529 which made the recommendation.\nAccording to T1roupe, when the RSOs first got to their assignments, people were totally oblivious to them as well as their benefits.\nAs part of the Soldier For Life concept, not only does the Army do what they can to get a person into the service, but when the time for retirement comes, it's important to make sure the Soldier has all the pertinent information to successfully make the transition.\nThe 81st RSC was the first command to be fully staffed and they have been conducting retirement seminars in each of the states in the southeast region. Because the pilot program is not funded, they have to work with a military installation in each state to provide a central location where providers and retirees can come together and sort out the issues that pertain to each service member.\nThere are consequences for not getting or paying attention to the information about retirement. With the Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Program, a Soldier can either end up paying for some kind of coverage they didn't need or want or have no coverage at all because no choice of coverage was chosen by anyone. Also, some Soldiers have gone for years without receiving their retired pay because they didn't know how to apply for it. There is a statue of limitations on applying for retired which is six years. After six years, the applicant can only get pay from age 60 to 66 and the date of the application and will miss out on the money from anytime after age 66 to the date of application..\nMany retired Soldiers tell the 81st RSOs that they wish they had received the information sooner, thereby assisting them to make better informed decisions. Service members who haven't yet retired are glad the information is being made available so they can avoid the pitfalls of their predecessors.\n\"This is great that all this information is in one place,\" said Brig."}
{"idx": "30959", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Taiwan's legislature took a half-step back on Thursday night from an immediate confrontation with China, passing a bill that would allow national referendums on constitutional and sovereignty issues only under very narrow circumstances.\nChinese officials had tried to dissuade Taiwanese politicians from endorsing any bill to provide for referendums, but had devoted most of their criticisms to a rival measure, supported by President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan, that would have made it easy for him to call referendums. Most provisions of that bill were defeated in the legislature on Thursday night.\nChinese and American officials had feared that legislation permitting a referendum on Taiwanese independence from the mainland would lead to a showdown in the Taiwan Strait that neither China nor the United States wants now.\nChina is trying to pay more attention to economic growth, especially in its interior provinces, while the United States has been preoccupied with Iraq and with seeking China's cooperation in trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.\nThe Bush administration has reaffirmed repeatedly the principle that there is one China encompassing Taiwan and the mainland, but Chinese officials have called for the United States to do more. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has threatened to use military force to prevent it from becoming a fully independent nation.\nMr. Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party have tried to move Taiwan gingerly toward somewhat greater independence status and had sought a referendum bill for that purpose. But most of the provisions in the final bill came from amendments by the opposition, which opposes full independence and has more seats in the legislature than Mr. Chen's party.\nEven a narrowly written bill could still irk Beijing's leaders, by establishing a precedent for holding any referendums at all on what Beijing regards as Chinese soil.\nThe final bill bars referendums on changing the flag of Taiwan or Taiwan's official name, the Republic of China. The legislation also makes it extremely hard to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution and bars referendums to draft a new or completely rewritten constitution.\nFollowing approval of the bill, lawmakers from Mr. Chen's party were so upset that they tried to schedule additional votes to undo it. They contended the law involved an unconstitutional transfer of power from the executive branch to the legislature, by allowing the legislature to call referendums but making it hard for the president to do so.\n''There are certain items we find unacceptable,'' Hsiao Bi-khim, a member of the legislature who is the director of the party's international policy division, said in a telephone interview. She said Mr. Chen might veto the bill if it survives.\nA government spokesman said the executive branch would not comment on the legislation immediately.\nA provision that could still cause some dismay in Beijing is one allowing Taiwan's president to call a referendum on ''national security'' if the island is faced with a clear foreign threat that could erode Taiwan's territorial integrity. Even this provision did not explicitly allow a referendum on independence.\nDozens of other provisions were adopted at the suggestion of the Nationalist Party and its smaller ally, the People First Party, which favor an eventual reunification with the mainland.\nJustin Chou, a Nationalist Party spokesman, said the party was ''very happy with the result'' of Thursday's voting. The party was not acting because of the threats from China but because of what it saw as the best course for Taiwan, he added.\nThere was no immediate reaction to the bill from Beijing.\nThe Nationalist Party and People First Party have long"}

But does fried fish count?\nThat\u2019s not a surprise, says the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Fadi Nahab, director of the stroke program at Emory University Hospital, given the popularity of fried foods in the South. But the results highlight one of the major contributors to the higher rates of stroke in the region, and that involves diet.\nIn this part of the U.S., the odds of people eating the federally recommended two servings of fish a week in non-fried form are 17% lower than in other areas of the country. People in the stroke belt are also 32% more likely to be consuming two or more servings of fried fish each week than other Americans.\nNahab, a neurologist, had an interest in explaining why stroke-belt residents are 20% more likely to have a stroke than those living elsewhere in the U.S. Intrigued by government nutrition statistics showing that African Americans, who have the highest stroke rates in that region, were eating more than two servings of fish each week, he decided to tease apart exactly what people in that part of the country were eating.\nStudies have already shown that consuming more omega-3 fats, whether from pelagic creatures or in supplement form, can lower the risk of heart attack, but the data is less conclusive when it comes to protecting against stroke. Nahab is planning to follow up this study by looking at stroke patients who take regular supplements of fish oil, to see if their risk of a recurrent stroke is any lower than among those who don\u2019t add pills of omega-3 fats to their nutritional regimen.\nUntil then, the current study suggests that it\u2019s not enough to simply eat fish, but to make sure that it\u2019s cooked any way but fried. That may not be so easy to do in the South, but it could potentially shrink the girth of the stroke belt."}

As part of that partnership, Macy's has taken a minority stake in b8ta, which helps brands build out physical stores.\nB8ta, founded in 2015 by Nest alums Vibhu Norby, William Mintun and Phillip Raub, helps shoppers try tech gadgets before buying them, even if those products aren't yet in stores. With its new Macy's partnership, it will sell items, such as a digital art canvas, that Macy's typically would not offer.\nB8ta will also provide the back-end support for Macy's constantly rotating pop-up store.\nFor Macy's, the announcement is the latest in a series of moves to transform the shopping experience with technology and investments. The retailer has some of the best real estate compared with its department store peers, but has had to rethink the use of that space, as the draw of merchandise is no longer enough to bring shoppers to stores.\nMacy's just last month announced its acquisition of New York-based Story, a shop that rotates merchandise based on a theme every few months.\n\"We are deeply committed to creating an in-store experience that is new, compelling and exciting,\" said Marc Mastronardi, Macy's EVP of business development. \"The model that Story has built in their location [in New York] is entirely about experiential retail ... [and] the same concept is behind Market @ Macy's and b8ta.\"\nMarket originally launched in February as a pop-up concept in just 10 of Macy's stores. As part of the program, the retailer opened its ground floor to brands that don't yet have their own locations. After positive initial feedback, Macy's now plans to expand Market more broadly, Mastronardi told CNBC, though he did not provide details around scale or a timeline.\n\"We learned that the idea of newness for the consumer [in] physical retail is really attractive to our customer and to our brand partners,\" he added.\nIt's \"too early\" to answer whether shoppers in Market are translating into more spending elsewhere in the store, said Mastronardi, but the pop-up concept is creating an \"overall halo\" for the store's shopping experience.\nMeantime, taking an equity stake in b8ta allows Macy's to further deepen its relationship with the company.\nFor b8ta, which has nine standalone stores across the U.S., the Macy's deal provides it a path to quickly expand its footprint. It also works with Lowe's to run stores within its stores for smart-home products.\nPrior to Macy's investment, b8ta had raised $19.5 million in funding.

Now he has designs on something bigger: changing the toy industry. Calello is hoping that a toy he invented - Automoblox - will spark a movement away from disposable plastic toys and a return to toys that can be passed down for generations.\nHis idea is also driving sales at specialty toy stores around the country, and could be a vehicle for turning a Wharton, N.J.-based company into a major player in the toy industry. That sector has struggled until recently. U.S. toy sales increased 0.3 percent last year, reversing a decline from a year earlier, according to market research firm NPD Group Inc.\nAutomoblox, the company founded to sell the cars made out of wooden building blocks that Calello created, sold about 140,000 of the toys last year, Chief Executive Officer Joe Barrett said. Though the privately held company doesn't reveal its revenues, that adds up to $4.9 million spent on Automoblox in 2006 (at a retail price of $35 per car).\nThe toys are sold at some Learning Express stores, at other specialty toy shops and at some museum stores. They consist of wooden blocks, wheels and assorted plastic parts that can be assembled and reassembled to create different kinds of cars.\nMary Diaz, manager of the Learning Express store in Englewood, N.J., said the cars sold out over the holidays and that the shop is now selling its third shipment of the toys. \"And none of them have been returned - which is a very good thing,\" Diaz said.\n\"We like to say this is the reinvention of the classic wooden car,\" Calello said. \"What we really wanted to do is bring great styling, craftsmanship and heirloom quality to children.Essentially, what we're combating is the disposability of the mass toy industry.\"\n\"The mass-market toy market is all about flash, bells and whistles, noises and distraction. And we're trying to bring substance and quality and real learning benefits,\" he said.\nChildren, Calello believes, will learn to take care of their toys if you give them something worth taking care of.\n\"Your typical mass-market toy, usually the box is more exciting than the toy,\" he said. \"It's typical to get a Christmas or Hanukkah present and by spring it's already in the garage sale. I think it's a bad message to give kids that the world is disposable.\"\nThe father of a 4-year-old, Calello says: \"I'd rather my daughter have five wonderful, delightful toys that are really engaging and have real value than 50 disposable, Happy Meal-style toys.\"\nCalello, a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, is an industrial designer who first had an idea for a high-quality toy car made of wood in 1992 while in college. He kept the idea in the back of his mind while pursuing a career in industrial design that included a stint at Colgate-Palmolive Co.\nA rough year, in which he experienced the separate deaths of his parents and a brother, moved him in 2003 to devote himself full time to making his Automoblox dream a reality.

{"idx": "30972", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Game is the Same and the Rules Don't Change\u2014So Why Do the Controls?\nIn basketball, it was the three-point line, or the reintroduction of the zone defense. In baseball, it's the designated hitter, or an All-Star game played for stakes. In American football, it's instant replay, or the two-point conversion, or moving the goal posts to the back of the end zone. All sports have confronted and incorporated epochal changes in how they are played, many within our lifetimes.\nSports video games seem to do it every year.\nFriday, 2K Sports revealed a revision to the controls in NBA 2K13, a remarkable midstream change for a game that hasn't had a competitor since 2010. In quick summary, the left trigger on a console controller last year initiated freestyle ballhandling moves with a corresponding gesture on the left thumbstick. Now the left trigger press is responsible for shooting once you push on the right thumbstick. A right thumbstick gesture alone will create a ballhandling move.\nTo those who don't play this series, the significance of the change may be hard to grasp. For those who have played it for several years, though, it's akin to re-learning the basic, physical fundamentals of playing basketball before tip-off of the next season.\nIt seems that only sports video games are faced with this prospect, even though other series\u2014Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty most notably\u2014release every year and confront the same obligation to grow their audience in the mainstream.\nThough it is perceived as a year-in-year-out consistent performer, MLB The Show is maybe the most notorious case, with wholesale changes to its pitching systems in each of the past two years. The curveball has been in existence since at least 1870. How you throw it in The Show has been different in 2010, 2011 and 2012, thanks to the game's pitching meter, analog pitching and, now, \"pulse pitching\" systems. All three require a discrete sense of familiarity and timing to throw a breaking pitch accurately.\nIn basketball, I expect to explode naturally off of a fake toward the basket. It's as instinctual to a slashing guard as it is to an assassin.\nThe difference is that MLB The Show, to its great credit, has probably the most broadly accommodating control systems in a console sports simulation.

{"idx": "30973", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Dozens of advertisers have left Bill O'Reilly. Can Fox News stand by him?\nBill O'Reilly's future at Fox News is the number one topic among Manhattan media executives, entertainment agents and journalists. But the network is keeping mum. Seemingly the only place where it isn't being discussed is on Fox News.\nNeither O'Reilly nor Fox has said much about last weekend's report in the New York Times about settlements with five different women who accused the host of sexual harassment or verbal abuse. The matter has only been addressed briefly on Fox's air, and O'Reilly hasn't discussed it in the two editions of his show, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" that have aired since the story broke.\nFox's strategy of silence might make sense for now, given that O'Reilly is more than just a profit center for the company: he is an institution there, almost inseparable from the network, and long seemingly invincible.\nThen again, that's exactly what media observers said last summer when Roger Ailes was sued by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment. Ailes resigned two weeks later.\nAs Ailes faced an onslaught of sexual harassment allegations, several of the network's on-air personalities strenuously defended him in the press. And when O'Reilly faced a sexual harassment lawsuit in 2004, he delivered a ferocious response on-air the night it was filed.\nNow, though, even as more than 40 advertisers have dropped his show, O'Reilly and his network aren't fighting back publicly.\nFox News' relatively subdued response has driven speculation throughout New York media about whether the longtime king of cable news could be on the way out -- and whether such a scenario is even plausible. Most would have dismissed the idea offhand at any other time, but the marked contrast between Fox's strategy in the past compared to now is fueling the discussion.\nIt could be a sign that network mogul Ruper Murdoch and his sons are following through on their pledge to remedy the network's culture.\nOn the other hand, the Murdochs might be quietly circling the wagons, demonstrating the same type of loyalty that Ailes inspired in many of his employees and perhaps bowing to financial reality.\nFox renewed O'Reilly's contract knowing that the Times story would be coming out. The Washington Post reported that the new deal extends at least through 2020.\nContracts have clauses and escape hatches. But if it really goes to 2020, those could be very expensive for the network.\nThen there's the matter of a replacement. Fox has no obvious person in line to succeed O'Reilly right now.\n\"They are running plays from the Roger Ailes playbook and it is out of date,\" said one media executive at another company. \"The Murdoch sons were supposedly 'disgusted' by Ailes' style and tactics, and couldn't wait to run him out of the company -- but if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, they seem to be heaping praise on Ailes this week.\"\nOf course, there could be millions of reasons why Fox News is standing by O'Reilly. As in millions of viewers, and hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\"The O'Reilly Factor\" has been the no. 1 program on cable news for 16 years running, and it's coming off the best quarter of ratings it's ever had.\nOn"}

If you say, \"Go right,\u201d they will go left. If you say, \"Sit still,\u201d they will run. Impulsive, impatient, and reckless, defiant bullies want to live on their own terms. They reject every attempt parents make to manage their behavior. If you\u2019re a single parent, defiant kids can be particularly aggressive: with only one parent to focus on, you\u2019re likely to get a double-dose of defiance.\nSelf-righteous and puffed up with false confidence, such kids delight in debate and are determined to win every argument. For them, being \u201cright\u201d takes priority over being respectful or getting along. When you try to stand up to their bullying, they may turn obsessive and harass you until you give in. Determined to get their way, they\u2019ll stop at nothing.\nDefiance is not necessarily a problematic trait. Many artists, inventors, designers, and original thinkers have a healthy defiant streak. They pioneer new ways of thinking because they oppose conventions. They use their defiance as a creative force for inspiration and vision. In other words, when defiance is fused with ambition and channeled into creativity, it is progressive. Defiant kids have a lot of unbridled and unfocused energy. The challenge is to help them channel it into a positive outlet.\nBut in fact, every well-adjusted kid has a healthy dose of defiance. If children are too cooperative or accommodating, they lack definition and leave no lasting imprint on others. You don\u2019t want your kid to agree with you all the time. You want her to have her own opinions and views.\nNow here\u2019s the bad news about defiance: It takes a lot of effort to help a kid with a defiant bullying style see any relationship as a two-way street\u2014and the longer the pattern has been in place, the more difficult it is to reverse. It takes energy and commitment to help a defiant kid break old habits and foster new ones.\nWhat Drives the Defiant Kid?\nUnderneath the bravado of defiance is a kid who, for some reason, feels unrecognized and undervalued. She lives with a fear of others forgetting her or leaving her out. No matter how much attention she gets, positive or negative, it\u2019s rarely enough.\nYou\u2019d never know how vulnerable defiant kids feel because they conceal their insecurities so well. And yet ultimately, defiance is a form of dependency. Here\u2019s why: In order to feel whole, defiant kids must have something to defy. Pushing against someone or something gives them a false sense of strength. For example, imagine a kid leaning against a wall. He may appear secure but what happens when you take the wall away? He falls down. Defiance works in the same way: Without someone or something to defy, defiant kids can\u2019t keep their stance.\nWhat do defiant kids gain from their defiance? Defiance forms a protective barrier against interpersonal insecurities, providing a temporary identity for kids who feel uncertain about their individuality. Kids with a defiant bullying style are easily misinterpreted: Their defiance creates the illusion that they are strong and secure when actually it\u2019s just the opposite.

Amidst the careful choice of words that has in recent decades comprised American politics, this year voters are faced with oft-unbridled radicalism on either side that threatens to upset the norm one way or another. Natural Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton can\u2019t seem to shake the shadow of her haunted email server; Gov. Jeb Bush seems inescapably bogged down by the legacies of his father and brother. Where political experience once represented strength, anti-establishment attitudes now infiltrate, unimpressed by such choices as Gov.

The answer to that question requires closer scrutiny of this rat race for media love.\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump has publicly criticized federal profit from student loans, a scheme he has called one of the \u201conly profit centers\u201d in government. Though the critique is warranted\u2014federal loan programs yielded a $41.3 billion profit in 2013\u2014he has not yet put forth a concrete solution, an approach that so far seems to be a common theme for the pale-haired Apprentice host\u2019s campaign.\nThe latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll places neurosurgeon and fellow out-of-left-fielder Ben Carson just one percent behind Trump in conservative preference. He proposes an altogether circumvention of loans and instead seeks to remove the stigma associated with working before attending college. \u201cSomehow, people forgot that you don\u2019t buy a house that costs more than two-and-a-half times your annual salary,\u201d he said in a 2014 interview.\nFormer Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina has flourished in recent polls as conservatives stake their claims in the latest voice of the American anti-establishment. In August, she told the Des Moines Register that the feds are to blame for driving up college costs with expensive accreditation programs and restriction of for-profit alternatives. Furthermore, she claims the federal nationalization of the loan industry has permitted the government to drive interest rates on loans up to unfair levels. Her formal education policy will likely take shape around concerns such as these.\nFlorida senator Marco Rubio, whose claims to $150,000 in repaid loan debt may help him resonate most with students nationwide, has clawed his way up to a tie with Fiorina at 11 percent conservative support.

He was always provided for, but he was also, in a way, homeless--without a stable backdrop of buildings or even people.\nBy the age of seventeen, he had moved twenty times. Almost all of these moves happened because of his mother, Marguerite. Often he shuttled between Dallas-Fort Worth and New Orleans, but he also lived in New York. His briefest stay, in Manhattan, lasted six weeks; his longest, in Fort Worth, four years. He averaged 10.2 months per address. (This did not include stints with family or friends who filled in when Marguerite was absent, or his three-week detainment at a home for troubled youths, in the spring of 1953.) Not surprisingly, nearly all of these homes were rentals or places owned by other people who let them live there for free.\nLee\u2019s father, Robert Edward Lee Oswald, had been an insurance premium collector, and he died of a heart attack in August 1939, two months before his son was born. His death and absence from the boy\u2019s life might be regarded as the defining trauma of Oswald\u2019s entire life, setting in motion a youth of chaos and frenzy. Marguerite and Lee rarely changed addresses because of a new opportunity, but rather because of a failure or crisis that almost always crept up suddenly. (Nearly half of the moves that took place between addresses numbers 7 and 21, when Lee was of school age, took place during the school year.) Mostly their hopscotching was prompted by Marguerite\u2019s run-ins with men, landlords, family, or employers. Often an infidelity or job termination was involved. In some cases, Lee\u2019s older brother, Robert, or older half brother, John Pic, moved with him; in other cases, it was just Lee and Marguerite. Some moves were more traumatic than others: Lee spent 1943--the year he turned four--at the Bethlehem Children\u2019s Home in New Orleans. But from late 1945 to mid-1946 he lived in a comfortable brick house in Benbrook, a Fort Worth suburb, with his mother and Edwin Ekdahl, her new husband. Ekdahl was well-off--this was probably why Marguerite married him--and he had an evident fondness for Lee. For a little less than a year, he was the closest anyone ever came to being a father figure to the little boy. Ultimately, this relationship, and the one between Marguerite and Ekdahl, was a failure, too.\nMarguerite was hardly capable of playing the role of one parent, let alone two. She was unreliable, frantic, harried, hectoring, needy, and prone to irrational outbursts. Throughout Lee\u2019s childhood, she vacillated between two poles--that of the self-involved, self-imagined victim in search of love and support, and that of the doting, controlling mother. She either paid very little attention to Lee\u2019s wants and needs--yanking him out of school, moving him away from what friends he had--or fawned over him in an effort (obvious to all, including Lee) to compensate for her selfishness. That selfishness, and her inability to provide any semblance of stability and normalcy for her youngest"}

The National Achievement Survey (NAS) \u2014 conducted by the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) to assess competency levels in elementary classes \u2014 has reported poor performance by students of classes 5 and 8 in mathematics.\nOf 24,046 children of Class 5 who took the test in select schools in all districts of the state, 37% could answer more than half the questions of their class. Ferozepur, Gurdaspur and Sangrur emerged as best districts, where the number of such students was more than 50%. Bathinda, Barnala and Muktsar are at the bottom. In Bathinda, half the 1,546 students assessed could not answer even 30% of questions.\nThe numbers for Class 8 were worse, as only 12% of the 24,920 students could answer more than half the math questions meant for class-appropriate competencies correctly. Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and Amritsar fared better than others. Muktsar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Patiala did worst. In Barnala, Bathinda and Mohali, 60% students could not answer even 30% of the questions.\nThe assessment test was conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in November last year to evaluate learning competencies of students in state-run and aided schools; to understand educational health of schooling, diagnose maladies, and institute measures to fill them, said an official. Students of Class 5 were assessed in three subjects (math, English and Punjabi), and the test for those from Class 8 had science too. The findings will be used as inputs in designing initiatives to improve learning outcomes.\nStudents fared better in languages \u2014 52% of Class-5 students answered more than half the questions correctly.

Really,\u201d said McVay, blaming his own play selection for his top back\u2019s lack of involvement. \u201cI never enabled us to get into a rhythm offensively. I was not pleased at all with my feel for the flow of the game, or (lack of) making some adjustments as the game unfolded, to give ourselves a chance to put some points on the board. They did a good job and I certainly didn\u2019t do enough for us.\nSo the boy genius suddenly turned stunned? Because how hard is it to stick to a plan. Just give the guy the rock.\nDuring the season Gurley rushed for over 100 yards in half of his starts, and over 200 in one of them. He\u2019s also a threat in the passing game with 59 catches for 580 yards this season but 788 receiving yards when he played the entire 2017.\nIf he\u2019s healthy and he keeps getting the ball, the Rams score more than three points Sunday. They may even score 14, which would be one more than the Pats.\nAlso strange is that Gurley didn\u2019t even seem bothered by not getting a serious chance to affect the outcome.\nGurley signed a four-year, $60-million contract extension last July.
