While this period is usually associated with the appearance of crafty oligarchs, in Georgia also less wily businessmen could exploit the circumstances, among them many Turks.\nAs the American journal The Tennessean wrote in 1977: \u201cSoviet blue jeans may look like jeans, but that doesn't mean they are\u2026 One of the country's most exasperating problems is trying to satisfy the Russian hunger for jeans.\u201d In the late 1980s, my father observed how Turkish traders made fortunes by bringing jeans, women\u2019s bras and other chintzy clothes to Georgia and exchanging them for precious metals and other valuables. A bit later, when the Soviet economy had entirely collapsed, the infamous asset-strippers entered the scene: whole factories were dismantled and exported as scrap metals for a penny on the dollar. Many of these \u201cexports\u201d went to Turkey, which was geographically the most natural destination. In turn, the Turks sold their textile products in Georgia, as Western apparel was considered a highly prestigious and therefore desired commodity by Soviet and post-Soviet consumers. As a result, the Turkish textile industry experienced a boon, having its heyday around the turn of the millennium.\nFrom an economic perspective, having a strong textile industry is a double-edged sword due to its heavy dependency on low labor cost, particularly when it comes to the most labor-intensive CMT activities (cut, make and trim). A country will have a textile industry only so long as it offers the cheapest labor. Once economic development sets in, textile producers will be the first to leave. Turkey was not exception to this general rule. Between 2000 and 2010, apparel and textile industry were among the largest and best-performing sectors of the Turkish economy. By 2009, the country operated 56,000 apparel and textile companies which employed around two million people. The industry\u2019s exports accounted for 18.69% of Turkey's total exports (CIA World Fact book, IMF World Economic Outlook, 2009).\nYet, between 2009 and 2013, Turkish salaries almost doubled, leading to the country\u2019s loss of its cost advantage. The creeping demise of Turkey\u2019s textile industry became already visible in 2005, when the World Trade Organization eliminated all quotas in textile trading between its member nations: a competitive industry would have benefited from such a development, yet the Turkish textile industry lost market share, demonstrating its vulnerability.\nA similar development could be observed on a much larger scale following the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Textile production was at the heart of industrialization, and except the steam engine, most other important inventions of that period related to clothes, like the Spinning Jenny, the Spinning Mule, and the Roberts Loom. Yet, already in the 19th century, textile production in Europe had come under enormous pressure, leading to hardship among those employed in the sector, as described in the verses of Heinrich Heine\u2019s poem The Silesian Weavers (published in Karl Marx\u2019s Vorw\u00e4rts! newspaper in 1844): \u201cTheir gloom-enveloped eyes are tearless, They sit at the spinning wheel, snarling cheerless\u2026 A curse"}

Wayne Leonard, the chief executive of New Orleans-based Entergy Corp., has upped the ante on his demand that the federal government and his fellow major industry executives deal with global warming, abandoning support for a national carbon emissions \"cap and trade\" program in favor of a per-ton fee on carbon emissions. The carbon fee would be levied on all carbon emissions to provide a financial incentive to reduce emissions, with money from the fee used to reduce the national deficit and help low-income families, Leonard said. Some of the money from the fee would be funneled into support for research and development of carbon reduction technology and alternative energy.\nEntergy CEO Wayne Leonard is encouraging the government and his industry peers to deal with global warming issues.\nLeonard had long supported unsuccessful efforts to get Congress to adopt some form of carbon cap and trade initiative, where the federal government would enforce a slowly lowering cap on emissions, with some companies selling reductions beyond their cap levels to others that were likely to violate the cap.\nIn an emotional speech to executives of the National Wildlife Federation on Friday night, Leonard said his controversial support for what would amount to a carbon tax stems from his attempt to face his own mortality.\n\"You start to find yourself posing the question of 'After I die, what?', and then it really starts to dawn on you that the real question is, 'Before I die, what?,'\" he said, in accepting an award from the federation for his company's environmental programs.\n\"I can think of no time in history when the planet is in as much peril as it is today,\" he said. \"We were not supposed to be facing the possibility of mass extinctions in anybody's lifetime ... but here we are.\"\nLeonard dismissed as a \"trick answer\" the arguments of critics of climate change science that it's uncertain whether the effects of global warming will be good or bad.\n\"What we can't be certain about is how bad is it going to be: Are we going to end up with 25 percent of species extinct? Or 50 percent? Is man going to be one of those species?\" he said. \"There are no good outcomes at all,\" he said.\nThe United States, as the greatest historical producer of carbon emissions, which helped build the world's largest economy, has a moral duty to lead the way in reducing those emissions, Leonard said.\n\"Every single ton that's put into the atmosphere is just going to have to pay its own way, a small fee for every ton,\" he said. \"People are going to argue that there are losers in that.

Their current line of attack is an unsubstantiated claim that legalizing the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States will be too costly for our nation. Playing to ignorant prejudice, these groups falsely suggest that immigrants are \u201ctakers\u201d\u2014people who use more public benefits than other groups\u2014and that as a result, legalization would cost the United States trillions of dollars.\nMainstream economists have thoroughly debunked this general stereotype of immigrants as takers, finding that immigrants are a net positive for the economy and pay more into the system than they take out. In fact, immigrants\u2019 contributions have also played a key role in prolonging the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund. And the truth is that the cost-benefit analyses that immigration restrictionists have used to make their wild cost projections simply are not well-rounded or accurate.\nImmigrants are in fact \u201cmakers,\u201d not takers. Below, we demonstrate the clear evidence that proves this point and shoots down some of the recycled claims about the cost of immigrants to the United States.\nHere are just a few examples of how immigrants pay more into the U.S. economy than they take out.\nResearch by UCLA Professor Ra\u00fal Hinojosa-Ojeda shows that legalizing our nation\u2019s undocumented immigrant population and reforming our legal immigration system would add a cumulative $1.5 trillion to U.S. GDP over a decade. These big gains occur because legalized workers earn higher wages than undocumented workers, and they use those wages to buy things such as houses, cars, phones, and clothing. As more money flows through the U.S. economy, businesses grow to meet the demand for more goods and services, and more jobs and economic value are created. Hinojosa-Ojeda found that the tax benefits alone from legalization would be between $4.5 billion and $5.4 billion in the first three years.\nResearch by Notre Dame economists Juan Carlos Guzm\u00e1n and Ra\u00fal Jara finds that passing the DREAM Act would add $329 billion to the U.S. economy by 2030. The DREAM Act provides a double boost to the economy: First, DREAMers will be able to work legally (generally at higher wages), and second, because of the requirements to complete high school and some college or military service, they will have more education and training, which translates into better and higher-paying jobs. All of these extra wages circulate through the economy, supporting new job creation for the native born as well.\nA large body of literature illustrates that naturalized citizens are more economically beneficial than even legal permanent residents. In the United States the University of Southern California\u2019s Manuel Pastor estimated that naturalized citizens earn between 8 percent and 11 percent higher wages after naturalization. Pastor concludes that if even half of those who are currently eligible\u2014the Department of Homeland Security estimates that there are more than 8.5 million people in this category\u2014became citizens, it would add between $21 billion and $45 billion to the U.S. economy over five years.\nImmigrants\u2014even the undocumented\u2014pay a significant amount of money in taxes each year.

Officers had mistaken Love for a robbery suspect.

Los Angeles Police took up the chase, and Glendale Police became involved when the pursuit ended in the city's shopping district, where one or more suspects abandoned their BMW and took off on foot.\nLove and companion Ayesha Dumas, 39, had gone to the Apple Store a block away and were about to depart the Americana when Love realized he had forgotten to validate their parking, he said.

Dumas said she was threatened with arrest as an \"accessory,\" and believes their focusing on her resulted from racial profiling.\nLove recalled being held in the back of an LAPD car, and at one point seeing a plainclothes sheriff's deputy identify him.\n\"That's our guy.

Love said he showed his parking stub to the law enforcement personnel and told them security camera video at the Apple Store would verify he had been there shopping during the time of the pursuit.\nHe was transported to LAPD's West Valley station and held there while personnel did follow-up.

For this reader, the level of detail was just right; enough to be thoroughly convincing and yet explained clearly enough for a neophyte to follow. The tense atmosphere, especially in the submarine Kentucky, but also in the other vessels, planes, and command centers, is well maintained, supported by frequent and convincing reiteration of the high stakes involved. In addition to the impending obliteration of Iran and the knowledge that to stop it may involve US forces killing their own, Campbell has built into the plot a number of other tensions. These include the sub-plots of the intensely personal issues between Christine O\u2019Conner, the national security adviser and Kevin Hardison, the president\u2019s chief-of-staff and between Christine and her ex-husband, Dave Hendricks, the deputy director of the National Military Command Center. Even more gripping is the agonizing assignment taken on by Capt. Murray Wilson to stop the Kentucky from launching its nuclear missiles, which could well result in the death of his own son, Tom, the Kentucky\u2019s Assistant Weapons Officer.\nThe characters of the naval officers and crewmembers are generally well drawn, as are those of the civilians who have more than just a passing mention. But the effectiveness of the whole book really hinges on the credibility of the motivations of the various, mostly secondary, actors who take the drastic actions (some treasonous) that allow the plot to progress. Barak Kogen, the Israeli intelligence minister is apparently intent on destroying Iran, convinced that that is the only hope for the security of Israel. Levi Rosenfeld and Mike Patton are convincingly portrayed as motivated by hatreds bred of terrible personal losses. We learn that Chief Electronics Technician Alan Davidson\u2019s first loyalty is to Israel rather than the US, while Dana Cooke, who engineered the flaw in the recent upgrade to the fast-attack sonar systems, was financially strapped as well as greedy, and was in the dark about the larger purpose of his actions. These motivations are convincing, as is the shadowy part played by Metsada agent Daniel Landau/William Hoover in orchestrating the various elements of the plot. Less convincing is the part played by Dave Hendricks. He, we learn near the end of The Trident Deception, is convinced that it will take a massive catastrophe to force the US to seriously beef up its defenses and he is prepared to help create that catastrophe. This is the least convincing of the various motivations, especially as it also means he is prepared to murder his ex-wife to pursue that end.\nThe one area left surprisingly blank is the role of other security agencies in trying to unravel the plot. A CIA agent is briefly involved and reference is also made to the FBI, but apparently only the Navy and a handful of civilians high up in the administration were knowingly working on the case. Campbell\u2019s explanation for this is the urgent political imperative to keep the whole thing under wraps. This reader finds the prospect of a nuclear attack on Iran by the US so dire that any administration would surely call on all resources available to prevent it and then worry about spin later.

{"idx": "6029", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Why Did Chris Christie Embrace Obamacare's Expansion Of Medicaid?\nMany Republicans have never forgiven New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his effusive praise for President Obama days before the 2012 presidential election. Obama\u2019s leadership, said Christie, had been \u201coutstanding\u201d after Hurricane Sandy. But a less-remarked-upon decision by Gov. Christie\u2014to embrace Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid\u2014is of much greater policy significance.\nAs originally enacted in 2010, Obamacare\u2014then known as the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d\u2014required every state to expand its Medicaid program, or face the consequence of having the federal government pull out of the state\u2019s preexisting Medicaid program.\nHowever, in 2012, the Supreme Court determined that this provision in Obamacare exceeded the federal government\u2019s authority. In its opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius, the high court ruled that states must have the option to accept or decline Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\nChristie argued that New Jersey taxpayers would save $227 million in 2014, because the federal government\u2019s infusion of Medicaid dollars would pay for uncompensated care for the uninsured, and because some of New Jersey's spending on Medicaid will be replaced by federal spending on Medicaid.\nIn Christie's best-case scenario, then, it's not so much that New Jersey will spend less, but that the entire country will spend more. Indeed, if you include federal spending, the New Jersey Medicaid expansion will increase U.S. taxpayer liabilities by as much as $25 billion through 2022.\nAnd it's far from clear that Christie will be proven right about Obamacare's fiscal benefits for New Jersey. Through 2022, the Heritage Foundation estimates that Christie\u2019s Medicaid expansion will cost New Jersey taxpayers about $1.2 billion.\nThose estimates precede news that the New Jersey Medicaid rolls have increased by over 400,000 since Christie\u2019s decision. That\u2019s 71 percent more than the 233,000 that the expansion was projected to cover in 2012. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that the state had been \"overwhelmed\" by the surge in enrollment.\nHow will Christie debate Hillary on Obamacare?\nChris Christie, it must be said, is no John Kasich, the Ohio governor who like Christie is running for President. Kasich has said that opponents of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion will rot in hell, and implemented the expansion over the objections of Ohio\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature. Christie governs a reliably blue state with a Democratic legislature.\nNonetheless, Christie\u2019s decision to expand one of the nation\u2019s largest entitlement programs stands in contrast to his stated desire to reduce entitlement spending. \u201cEvery other national priority will be sacrificed, our economic growth will grind to a complete halt and our national security will be put at even greater risk,\u201d said Christie earlier this year, in making the case for entitlement reform. But Medicaid is one of the entitlements causing all of those problems\u2014and Christie expanded it under Obamacare.\nOf the 32 million people who were to gain health coverage under Obamacare, half were to get that coverage from the law"}

According to the Interior Department, Mexico\u2019s homicide rate this past year equated with 20.5 murders per 100,000 residents; in 2011, that figure was 19.4.\nThe homicide rate is still significantly below those of Brazil and Colombia (both 27), Venezuela (57), or El Salvador (60.8), AP reports. However, the per-100,000 figure is based on the number of police investigations, rather than individual deaths, Mexico security analyst Alejandro Hope said, meaning the total real rate is likely far higher.\n\u201cThe violence in Mexico has many causes. Drug trafficking is one of them, of course, but it is not the only one,\u201d Hope told AP, while suggesting that the increasing toll is a \u201cregression to the mean\u201d over the lower murder rates Mexico enjoyed between 1997 and 2007.\nMexico President Enrique Pena Nieto had campaigned pledging to end the epidemic of drug cartel violence that plagued the country between 2006 and 2012, but his administration saw only a temporary dip in homicides between 2012 and 2014.\nMexico is preparing for another election in July, with left-wing provocateur and former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador the early frontrunner, and gang violence may again prove a key polling issue. In the beginning of Jan., nine people were brutally killed in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz in a suspected conflict between rival gang factions, Reuters reported."}

Motion sickness is characterized by a set of symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. The global motion sickness treatment market was valued at approximately US$ 670.0 Mn in 2017 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of more than 3.0% from 2018 to 2026 to reach approximately US$ 900.0 Mn by 2026. Adoption of prescription motion sickness drugs is high in developed countries. Rise in adoption of these drugs in emerging countries due to the increase in number of travelers is likely to drive the global motion sickness treatment market.\nMotion sickness is a common condition experienced by around 50% to 60% of the general global population. It is more common in children and elderly. Various prescription and over the counter (OTC) drugs and products are available for treat motion sickness. Adoption of prescription drugs such as scopolamine patches and tablets and promethazine tablets is increasing in developed markets as these provide long lasting relief, better efficacy, and fewer side effects. Higher prices of these products are likely to drive the motion sickness treatment market. Surge in number of travelers across the globe is estimated to increase consumption of motion sickness remedies. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2017, international tourist arrival grew by 7% as compared to 2016. Studies estimate that around 50% of travelers experience motion sickness in course of travel. However, recent introduction of generic transdermal scopolamine patches and over dependence on OTC and traditional medicines for motion sickness treatment are likely to hamper the global market.\nThere are several OTC products to treat motion sickness; however, there are limited options for children or pediatric specific drugs. Transdermal scopolamine patches are indicated for use only in adults. In May 2012, Dramamine, an OTC product was introduced for children indicated in reduced drug dose. However, there is an unmet need for children specific motion sickness treatment products. New drug formulations are being developed which can be administered through alternative routes such as intranasal scopolamine spray. GT Biopharma, Inc. is developing a transdermal patch containing muscarinic receptor antagonist as a key ingredient. Industry players are also focusing on prescription to OTC switch of the motion sickness treatment remedies to expand their market reach and increase accessibility to patients. People with motion sickness often self-medication with vastly available OTC and traditional medicines.\nThe global motion sickness treatment market has been segmented based on treatment type, route of administration, distribution channel, and region. In terms of treatment type, the anticholinergic segment is projected to dominate the market and is expected to continue this trend during the forecast period, followed by antihistamines. Anticholinergics such as transdermal scopolamine patches are available as prescription drugs. Antihistamines such a dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and cyclizine are available as prescription and OTC drugs which has contributed for their significant market share. Based on route of administration, the transdermal drugs segment is projected to account for a dominant share of the market in terms of value during the forecast period, followed by oral drugs.

{"idx": "6036", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: After parliament rejects bail-out what is the solution to the crisis in Cyprus?\nMarx wrote in the 18th Brumaire that history repeats itself first as a tragedy and then as a farce. This is what is happening in Cyprus. We are witnessing a situation similar to two years ago when the EU put pressure on Greece to accept a bail-out, but this time around 56 Cypriot politicians have created a huge problem for capitalists across Europe.\nThe bail-out that the newly elected President Nicos Anastasiades formally asked for at the recent European summit merely follows the previous four requests in Europe. Cyprus was going to be the fifth economy of the euro zone to be intervened in after Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Yet the no vote in the National Parliament of Cyprus has sent alarm bells ringing for European governments and the financial markets. Cyprus has been under the spotlight since last year when the government announced the need for a bail-out. This was done before the Presidential elections of February 2013.\nOn 24 February Cyprus held the first round of its Presidential election where the right-wing candidate, Nicos Anastasiades (DISY Party) came first with 45% of the vote. The result was a referendum on the policies of the Communist Party (AKEL) that had held the Presidency up to these elections. It got a relatively good result with 27% of the votes with the nationalist party (DIKO) getting about 25%.\nBut the real indication of the social mood was the increase in abstentions. In Cyprus voting is compulsory (and you risk a fine if you don\u2019t vote) and yet there was an increase of 7% in abstentions in the first round where the turnout was 83%. Workers and youth were voting with their feet. This weakened AKEL in the second round. What was the point of voting at all if all parties had agreed that the people had to pay their \u201cshare of the burden\u201d? It was only a question of how big the share had to be. It was impossible for AKEL to enthuse voters with a programme that keeps Cyprus within the straight-jacket of capitalism, and particularly casino capitalism!\nThe speech by the then President Demetris Christofias (AKEL) in November 2012, saying that the \u201cpill was going to be bitter\u201d, was putting a red carpet out for the right wing to enter the Presidential palace. Voters must have been wondering what a Communist Party was for if it was not going to stand for the interests of working people.\nOn 3 August 2011 DIKO had already withdrawn from the coalition citing its differences over a resolution of the Cypriot conflict and consequently leaving AKEL with a minority government. Since that date the Cypriot Government has stumbled from one crisis to another, having for instance voted several times for a fiscal amnesty. The class lines of government policy were blurring and so too was its electoral base. So Cyprus has lived through two years of financial troubles, as well as accidents with a huge economic impact [such as the explosion of a power plant that had a terrible effect on the economy, an explosion that still provokes huge polemics in Cyprus today] and the bursting of the housing bubble.\nWith the announcement of austerity measures as part of a package to re-negotiate the loan with Russia, many just lost faith in the ruling Communist Party.

The importance of Mr. Rohde's discovery - that mass execution of Muslim prisoners took place in Srebrenica last July - should not be underestimated. The exposure of this atrocity was one of the factors that led to US involvement in Bosnia, resulting in the Dayton peace accord and the creation of NATO's international peacekeeping force in Bosnia, known as IFOR. One hopes that the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre will be brought to trial before the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. Congratulations to Rohde for his Pulitzer and to the Monitor for maintaining its commitment to international news reporting.\nThe front-page article \" 'Living Wage' Drive Accelerates in Cities,\" April 10, did not expose clearly enough the absurdity of executives' and economists' claims that low wages will rise sufficiently when \"investment revives and the [economic] cycle matures.\" Real wages are at a 40-year low, not because of short-term fluctuations in economic growth, but because most modern corporations pay little attention to their hourly workers and will do anything (or nothing, when it comes to wage hikes) to maximize profits for shareholders and executives. A higher minimum wage sends some companies to foreign countries in search of cheap labor.\nAs someone who lives on a minimum-wage salary, I would argue that people with five-figure salaries have little reason to complain about workers' requests for higher wages. The need for a higher minimum wage is an issue that should be taken up by the government at one or more levels. Trusting corporations to take the necessary action will only lead to further inaction and worker abuse.\nRegarding the article \"Are G-Rated Movies Too Much for Young Kids?\" April 15: I have worked for more than 11 years in the management of movie theaters. My experience has taught me that there hasn't been a movie made that is appropriate for everyone. G-rated movies are suitable for most kids, but not all. Some children are more sensitive to frightening scenes or are more easily influenced by what they see on the big screen than others.\nThe question is, does the rating system have to take into account the mentality of every child? There are too many variables to do this. The rating system provides guidelines to parents. It cannot endorse a specific film for a specific child.\nIf your children are sensitive to what they see, you should find out what is in the movie before your kids see it. You can do this by calling the theater and asking specific questions about the content of the movie. Movie reviews also offer valuable information. Of course, the best system of all is to see the movie yourself before you take the children.\nYour letters are welcome.

When confronted by a number of environmental organisations about the obvious necessity, to find alternative export transportation routes (lest this ecological marvel, a priceless natural legacy for successive generations, be completely destroyed), this politician replied that the economy was more important than the ecology.\nAnyone who knows the difference between the encompassing planetary ecosystem, on which all life depends, and a sub-system such as the human \u201ceconomy\u201d, would know how moronic this statement is: without the planetary ecology, there would NOT BE a human economy.

For me and other students from the Borders and Bodies Collective, the day was filled with mixed emotions.\nAlthough I was filled with joy as I walked across that stage to smiles and cheers, a knot formed in my throat at the thought about the sacrifices my parents made for me to get there. They left a life in Hong Kong and raised two boys in a foreign land to ultimately give us this opportunity.\nAs each one of my friends from the Borders and Bodies Collective crossed that graduation stage, I knew that they, too, were standing on the backs of giants. Giants who, like my own mother and father, braved countless dangers, walls, hate, ignorance, pain, and even death. Who, with full hearts and broken bodies, would witness their children crossing the graduation stage carrying forward their hopes and dreams for a brighter future.\nThat\u2019s why the day after graduation, we raised our voices at the steps of the California capitol in support of expanding health coverage for low-income undocumented Californians. Currently, two champions on health care, Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula (D-Fresno), have authored legislation \u2014 SB 974 and AB 2965, respectively \u2014 that would extend Medi-Cal eligibility for low-income undocumented adults ages 65 and older and individuals under the age of 26.\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Californians gain health insurance, undocumented immigrants remain explicitly and unjustly excluded from health coverage, even though they contribute $3 billion to our state\u2019s economy, and are an essential part of industries such as agriculture and domestic service.\nThanks to hard-fought efforts by undocumented leaders, California has already passed #Health4AllKids, which has made it possible for undocumented low-income children under the age of 19 to access comprehensive Medi-Cal. Access to key screenings and checkups are critical to preventing costly health emergencies and promoting healthy habits. But children\u2019s well-being does not exist in a vacuum, and access to basic health coverage needs to be extended to their caretakers as well.

Over the last four seasons, 230 NFL players have suffered torn ACLs, a common injury for athletes across many sports. Dr. Martha Murray, also a Harvard Medical School assistant professor and orthopedic surgeon at Children\u2019s, appears to have developed a way for the ACL to repair itself. Currently, reconstructive surgery on the ligament involves the use of cadaver or hamstring tissue or the patellar tendon of the patient to restabilize the knee. Recovery time is months, and 80 percent of ACL repair patients will develop osteoarthritis in the joint within 14 years. Murray\u2019s method creates a scaffold of sorts around the torn ligament, allowing blood to flow between the torn ends, and the ACL essentially repairs itself. In animal studies, the animals had less muscle loss, with no occurrence of osteoarthritis.

But three oil company lobbyists were given day-to-day oversight of the effort to save the reptile.\nWhen Texas promised to protect a threatened lizard in the oil-rich Permian Basin, state officials entrusted the day-to-day oversight to a nonprofit that sounds like an environmental group: the Texas Habitat Conservation Foundation.\nWhat\u2019s not advertised is the occupation of the board members who created it.\nThey are all registered lobbyists for the powerful Texas Oil and Gas Association, also known as TXOGA.\nThe industry group's prominent role in the fate of the dunes sagebrush lizard has angered both environmentalists and influential GOP lawmakers who want to reform the way Texas oversees threatened and endangered species. The flap has also exacerbated traditional tensions between corporate oil interests and independent producers, and it has put Comptroller Susan Combs in the crosshairs of some fellow Republicans.\nThe controversy has its origins in the special session of 2011, when then-state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, slipped an amendment onto the innocuous-sounding \u201cfiscal matters\u201d bill that had to pass because it provided badly needed revenue for a cash-strapped Legislature.\nChisum\u2019s amendment, which he said was pushed by the oil and gas association, granted key state authority over the handling of endangered species matters to the office of the comptroller, a role that has traditionally been played by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, officials said.\n\u201cThere was a group of us, the people from TXOGA, and we said we need to get this done,\" Chisum told The Texas Tribune. \"That\u2019s how it got started. Of course, we brought the comptroller in.\"\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had already proposed listing the lizard as endangered by then, a move strongly opposed by TXOGA and others in the oil industry, along with virtually any Texas Republican near a microphone.\nIn response, Combs, working with the oil industry, landowners, local government officials and others, proposed a voluntary program to protect the dunes sagebrush lizard. The idea was to forestall a declaration or \u201clisting\u201d of the lizard as an endangered species, which would come with environmental restrictions that opponents said would inflict serious economic damage on a region described as the nation\u2019s top oil producer.\nLacking wildlife expertise in the state\u2019s chief tax agency, Combs then contracted with a division of Texas A&M University \u2014 the Texas AgriLife Extension Service \u2014 in November 2011. But A&M needed help on the ground, so it sent out a request for proposal for a contractor that could handle contacts with landowners and oil companies who would sign up for the voluntary program and undertake measures to save the lizard \u2014 like cutting down mesquite and removing old oil equipment.\nOfficials say no one responded to the contracting request. TXOGA then went to Combs and floated a plan to have the oil and gas lobby group start up a nonprofit foundation to implement the Texas Conservation Plan in the lizard\u2019s oil-rich habitat in the Permian Basin, according to TXOGA lobbyist and foundation board member Deb Hastings.\n\u201cWe did have a conversation with the comptroller\u2019s office to see if it would be appropriate if we set up a foundation temporarily,\u201d Hastings said.

Italy\u2019s civil defence authorities are debating how to use the system and communicate the forecasts to the public.\nThe question is not trivial: mangled communications about tremors that preceded a deadly quake in the town of l\u2019Aquila in 2009 led to jail sentences for six Italian scientists accused of not warning the public. All but one conviction was later quashed.\nThe problem, says Ian Main of the University of Edinburgh, UK, is that despite a huge effort, researchers have yet to find a signal that reliably predicts individual earthquakes.\nThe magnitude-6.2 earthquake in Italy on Wednesday \u2013 with an epicentre only 45 kilometres from l\u2019Aquila \u2013 was not preceded by even one warning tremor, says Warner Marzocchi, head of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome.\nEarthquakes do tend to cluster, though, meaning any tremors raise the likelihood that there will soon be more tremors by a hundred or even a thousand-fold.\nOn the basis of this, Italy is installing a national system that feeds seismic monitoring data into mathematical models of historical data to predict, every 3 hours, the likely number of quakes in the coming week.\nThe system should be especially good at predicting aftershocks, such as the magnitude-4.3 tremor that hit the central Italian quake zone on Thursday. The bigger the quake, says Marzocchi, the more tremors are likely afterwards.\n\u201cWe cannot predict magnitude,\u201d says Marzocchi. But the more tremors there are, the more likely one will be big, so the system signals when there could be enough for one to clear a magnitude of 3, 5 or 6, and what areas might experience actual ground-shaking. The increased probabilities, however, are still a few per cent or less.\nItaly\u2019s Civil Protection Department must now figure out how to use these forecasts, a perennial headache for authorities faced with a slightly increased risk of low-probability but high-impact events like earthquakes, epidemics or terrorism.\nPerhaps because of this, the system was initially called Cassandra, after the Trojan princess doomed to utter true prophecies but never be believed \u2013 but the name has now changed to OEF Italy, standing for operational earthquake forecasting. \u201cOtherwise people could see us as bearers of doom,\u201d says Marzocchi.\nWhat might make the forecasts more realistic is another system being developed by seismic engineers at the University of Naples Federico II. \u201cQuakes don\u2019t kill people, collapsing buildings kill people,\u201d says Marzocchi.\nMany private buildings in the quake zone are not quake-proof.

But to prefer a tooth extraction or surgical procedure over filing taxes seems a little extreme.\nEither way, one thing is clear: Americans find the process of filing taxes daunting and unappealing. But in reality, it doesn't have to be that way.\nBecause the tax code is cumbersome, many filers are quick to assume that the process of filing a return is apt to be tortuous. But here's the truth: Filing taxes doesn't have to be complicated, especially if you're a salaried employee and aren't itemizing. If that's the case, you simply take the information on your W-2 and 1099s, plug it into whatever software you decide to file with, and basically call it a day.\nNow if you're self-employed or own a small business, it's a bit of a different story. Identifying the right deductions to claim can be tricky if you're not well-versed in the tax code or are new to that sort of arrangement. But if that's the case -- or if your taxes are just a bit more complex than the average person's for another reason -- then there's a simple solution at hand: Hire a tax preparer.\nGranted, paying someone to do your taxes doesn't mean you'll play no part in the process. It'll still be on you to gather the right paperwork and financial information (think receipts for business expenses, invoices, and all records of income, to name a few) to allow that professional to do his or her job. But it might make things move more quickly and take some stress off of your plate.\nEither way, no matter how much you might loathe the idea of filing taxes, don't make the mistake of waiting until the last minute to get your return done. The April 15 deadline will be here before you know it, and if you procrastinate too long, you may end up rushing through the process and making mistakes that cause your return to get rejected or audited. Instead, carve out some time over the next week, take a deep breath, and get ready to tackle that return.

By 1960, that number had plunged to 3 million \u2014 thanks largely to the Detroit auto industry.\nIt goes without saying that with Uber and other highly disruptive mobility services on the rise, valued at billions, GM doesn't want to have done to it what it did to the horse.\nBut can a company this old, building millions of cars and trucks every year that are intended to be owned and driven by individuals, really make the shift?\nIf you've watched the rocket-like ascent of Uber, now valued at $68 billion, making it worth more than GM and crosstown rival Ford (each with about $45 billion in market cap), you might think that GM doesn't have a prayer.\nBarra does, and that's why she kicked off her first earnings call of 2016 talking not about Chevys and Cadillacs, but ride-sharing and electric cars (GM in January revealed its $30,000 Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas).\nGM also recently invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft, at a $5.5 billion valuation.\nAgainst Uber's daunting, unicorn value, that might look like small potatoes. But there's a way it could be the start of something big for GM \u2014 and Uber should pay attention.\nIf GM wants to jump into ride-sharing in a massive way, it has two things that Uber doesn't: factories to build cars; and a bank to loan people money to buy them with.\nUber is really a technology platform that facilitates on-demand transportation. Its drivers are all contractors, and it doesn't own any actual cars. This is very typical for a Silicon Valley startup, where you can achieve a valuation in the billions with a dozen employees, some laptops, rented server space, and an app.\nBut of course Uber's drivers need cars. And Uber customers like it best when these are nice, clean, relatively new cars. This makes Uber, in the eyes of most, better than taxis and more convenient than traditional \"black car\" limos. And if over the next decade, a shift to autonomous cars takes place, Uber \u2014 if it's still around \u2014 will need to provide that type of vehicle.\nThis is where all the friction is in Uber's business model: the technology is easy compared to growing a fleet of cars and several armies of drivers.\nGM, meanwhile, can easily build many, many cars. And more importantly, because it has a captive financing arm, GM Financial, it can come up with affordable ways for drivers to buy or lease a vehicle. On the autonomous front, GM is an industry leader; it's preparing to introduce a super-cruise feature on Cadillacs that should function as well as Tesla's Autopilot.\nOur announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else.

She did so by agreeing to acquire Abbott Laboratories\u2019 European generic drug business.\nThe deal is just the latest example of a so-called inversion \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s actually called a \u201cspinversion\u201d \u2014 and may be the most surprising of such deals given Ms. Bresch\u2019s family background.\nMs. Bresch says she entered the deal reluctantly, and she genuinely seems to mean it.\nIf Ms. Bresch\u2019s deal is not a call to Washington to address what is clearly a growing trend that it has remained nearly silent on, the nation will most likely continue to lose large employers and taxpayers in droves to countries with lower tax rates. Almost 20 large United States companies have announced plans to give up their United States citizenship over the last two years. Just on Monday, the Irish drug maker Shire cleared the way for a merger with AbbVie, the drug maker based in Chicago, and Walgreen is considering an inversion through a deal with Alliance Boots, a European drugstore chain.\nShe\u2019s right about her competitors. Teva Pharmaceutical Products, which is based in Israel, and Actavis, which is now based in Ireland after a tax-driven acquisition of Warner Chilcott in 2013, pay much less in taxes.\nHow much less will Mylan pay?\nMs. Bresch, who said the company\u2019s current effective tax rate is about 25 percent, said the rate would come down to 21 percent in the first year of the deal and then move into the high teens after three to five years. Mylan will continue to pay taxes in the United States on its domestic profits, but not on its business operations abroad.\nPresident Obama has proposed a top corporate rate of 28 percent, and a rate of 25 percent for manufacturers. However, that number would appear to be too high to hold on to the likes of Ms. Bresch. Even 20 percent \u2014 some Republicans have floated that number \u2014 might still be too high.\nThis tax-rate arbitrage among global companies creates a race to the bottom as countries try to outcompete one another until the rate becomes zero, a number that many shareholders might be thrilled about, but would be unlikely to produce enough money for the Treasury\u2019s coffers. There have been proposals to curb inversions, but those are only short-term solutions.\nWhen"}

Dunham said some minor CPA projects might still be viable in that interim.\nDunham said the overall Phase I wastewater goal would be a treatment plant that would be publicly owned and privately operated. James and Selectman Michael Miller accentuated the point that East Sandwich property owners likely would never tie into a treatment facility, but wastewater funding would also extend to areas where drinking water quality is degrading in term of nitrogen impacts.\nThe two percent plan would cost the owners of a $392,000 average home in town some $113 in additional property taxes a year.\nDunham said public outreach is a key part of upcoming wastewater funding votes. Health Agent David Mason agreed, though he also said some of that basic work has already begun.\nDunham said a 74-page report from the Cape Cod Commission recommends a one-year public outreach effort.\n\u201cI think we can do it faster than that,\u201d he said.\nThe commission report issued in 2017 contains recommendations that Sandwich should follow to achieve goals in its Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan. Goals include increasing stakeholders\u2019 knowledge of regional and local water quality issues, as well as the contents, costs, and benefits of the CWRMP.\nThere is also a need to increase local recognition for the need for consistent and predictable municipal funding for the CWRMP, and to build trust, confidence, and buy-in for the Sandwich CWRMP with an open and transparent engagement process.\nThe report dovetails with that issued by consultant Wright-Pierce for Sandwich\u2019s water resources management plan, a document that as of last week selectmen were still wading through. The overarching issue involves nitrogen degradation of shorelines, bays, and inlets, mostly via septic system impacts on groundwater and ultimately shared watersheds.\nAn initial wastewater/treatment facility project cost estimate by Wright-Pierce totals $30 million, with an $86 million cost over the next 25 years. Primary focus encompasses the so-called Three Bays watershed, including Popponesset and Waquoit embayments.\nThe commission report, meanwhile, suggests a 12-month communications work plan for this calendar year; something that might result in selectmen asking voters at a fall Special Town Meeting for water resources funding on the wastewater infrastructure planning front.\nA waste treatment plant would service two elementary schools, a new police/fire station, part of Quaker MeetingHouse Road, the industrial park, and developable areas.

Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun, 34, turned himself in and was being flown Sunday from an undisclosed location in the Middle East to Norfolk, Va. He is to be moved Monday to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, according to a spokesman, Capt. Eric Flanagan. Maj. Gen. Raymond Fox, commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Lejeune, will determine whether to court martial Hassoun.\nIn a written statement from its headquarters at the Pentagon, the Marine Corps said the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \"worked with\" Hassoun to turn himself in and return to the U.S. to face charges. Hassoun disappeared from his unit in Iraq's western desert in June 2004. The following month he turned up unharmed in Beirut, Lebanon and blamed his disappearance on Islamic extremist kidnappers. He was returned to Lejeune and was about to face the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing when he disappeared again. Flanagan, said the Hassoun case is unrelated to the matter of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who disappeared from his post in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009 under unexplained circumstances. Members of Bergdahl's unit have said he walked away on his own and should face desertion charges. The Bergdahl case triggered a flood of controversy in part because of questions about the deal the U.S. struck with the Taliban to gain his release May 31, after five years in captivity, in exchange for freeing five senior Taliban commanders from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl has not commented publicly on the circumstances of his disappearance and the Army has made no charges against him. It is unclear where Hassoun, 34, has spent the past nine years after disappearing during a visit with relatives in West Jordan, Utah in December 2004. Nor is it known why he chose to turn himself in now. He was born in Lebanon and is a naturalized American citizen. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in January 2002 and was trained as a motor vehicle operator. At the time of his disappearance from a Marine camp in Fallujah in western Iraq in June 2004 he was serving as an Arabic translator. That was a particularly difficult year for the Marines in Iraq. In April they launched an offensive to retake Fallujah from Islamic extremists but were ordered to pull back, only to launch a second offensive in November that succeeded in regaining control of the city but at the expense of dozens of Marine lives. Seven days after his June 2004 disappearance, a photo of a blindfolded Hassoun with a sword poised above his head turned up on Al-Jazeera television. A group called the National Islamic Resistance/1920 Revolution Brigade claimed to be holding him captive. On July 8, 2004, Hassoun contacted American officials in Beirut, Lebanon, claiming to have been kidnapped. He was returned to the U.S. and eventually to Camp Lejeune. After a Navy investigation, the military charged Hassoun with desertion, loss of government property, theft of a military firearm for allegedly leaving the Fallujah camp with a 9 mm service pistol, and theft of a Hum"}

Philip Hensher traces the career of \u2018one of the greatest novelists in English\u2019.\nDoris Lessing\u2019s Nobel win came as a surprise to everyone, the author apparently included. Despite her enormous, decades-long international reputation, she was less fancied than dozens of patently smaller writers. That could only have been ascribed to a cynical estimate of the way the Swedish academy works. On literary merit, no one would have questioned her right to it. She is one of the greatest of novelists in English.\nHer career is a matter of savage breakthroughs into quite new territory, as if her searching, sceptical intelligence could never be satisfied with stasis for long. It begins, dauntingly, with a novel of unmatched technical command, The Grass is Singing. This overwhelming tragedy, published as long ago as 1950, immediately revealed a novelist of huge natural gifts, and, when she chose to exercise it, a natural sense of classical style. Though set in Africa, and dense with the smells and sights of the veldt, its technique showed, surely, a writer who had greedily drunk up the great Russians. Lessing, born in Persia, grew up in rural Rhodesia. From the start, there are intimations of the girl who lived for the occasional parcel of books, eagerly submitting to them; her early writing is the work of someone who has read every word of the great classics several times over.\nThe scale of her ambition was immediately revealed after this small, perfect novel with a substantial, five-volume bildungs-roman, Children of Violence. The cycle, concerning the political and sexual maturity of Martha Quest, could certainly not be regarded as perfect. It clearly shows the strain of its lengthy gestation, published over 17 years. The first volume, Martha Quest (1952), is a very different novel from the last, The Four-Gated City (1969). When Lessing began it, she was a member of the Communist party; she left it in 1954, and the disillusioned fervour of the later parts show a very different style of ideological engagement.\nAnd, of course, in the middle of writing the long cycle, she broke off to publish what is still one of the most argued-over and important novels of the last century, and was never the same novelist again afterwards. The Golden Notebook starts from the insight that the lives of women are intimately connected to the accounts of themselves they are permitted to give, and that insight moulds, with thrilling aesthetic life, the form of the novel itself. It was greeted with considerable outrage in 1962; predictably, the author now finds more to argue with in this work of her youth than do those feminists who elevated it to an early canonical text. She moves on; her admirers barely keep up.\nOnly the most clairvoyant of readers could have predicted the next step in her career. From Journal of a Descent into Hell, much of the 1970s and early 1980s was spent in a visionary exploration of fantasy and science fiction, culminating in another quintet of novels, the to me perfectly astonishing Canopus in Argos: Archives. The loathing these wonderful novels inspired and go on inspiring is, frankly, a puzzle, for an engagement with the pleasures of reading at the highest possible level is nowhere more highly apparent in Lessing\u2019s work.

The 188-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, will hold their spring policy meetings.\nIn advance of those weekend discussions, finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 leading economic powers will also meet. The United States will be represented by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nIn her remarks, Lagarde noted that the G-20 finance officials in a February meeting in Australia had committed to pursuing policies that would boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over the coming five years.\nLagarde said if the G-20 countries can do so, it would \"place the global economy on a substantially different and better trajectory from today.\"\nLagarde said she thinks the global economy is turning the corner from the Great Recession of 2007-2009, but she said overall growth remains too slow and weak.\nShe warned that the recovery could be put at risk by the wrong policy decisions and by rising geopolitical tensions.\n\"The situation in Ukraine is one which, if not well managed, could have broader spillover effects,\" Lagarde said. \"Unless countries come together to take the right kind of policy measures, we could be facing years of slow and sub-par growth, well below the solid, sustainable growth that is needed to create enough jobs and improving living standards in the future.\"\nShe noted that among major industrial countries, growth is strongest in the United States. But she said it would be critical for the Fed to \"carefully manage the gradual withdrawal\" of its support for growth.\nThe Fed last month approved a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases, which have been aimed at keeping long-term rates low. This week, Yellen said she thought a key short-term rate would need to remain low for a considerable period to bolster growth.\nLagarde said Europe's central bank, which handles rate policies for countries that use the euro currency, should further lower rates to make sure extremely low inflation doesn't hold back economic growth.\nShe also called on Japan, the world's third-largest economy, to pursue structural reforms for its economy to help lift the country from two decades of sub-par growth.\nIn emerging markets, Lagarde said there's a risk of heightened market volatility associated with the moves by the Fed to cut back on bond purchases. The U.S. effort, by increasing rates in America, could trigger flows of capital out of emerging market countries \u2014 something that resulted in a period of market volatility last year.\n\"Countries with weaker fundamentals ... are likely to be more affected,\" Lagarde said, urging nations with high budget and trade deficits to work to close those gaps."}
{"idx": "6089", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Service-oriented architecture is real and it is all about your business.\nForrester defines service-oriented architecture (SOA) as a business-focused approach to solution design and software architecture. By providing open, flexible access to the business capabilities and transactions buried within an organisation's applications, SOA makes it easier to adapt business software to new business requirements. CIOs who think of SOA merely from a technology perspective will miss the business view of SOA and miss an opportunity to lead their organisations forward. SOA is only the start and the foundation of a much-broader shift in the future of business-focused IT architecture, which means that those who get SOA wrong will have a poor business foundation for many years to come.\nFifty-six per cent of enterprises say they are using SOA now and an additional 12 per cent will be using it by the end of 2010. Among Global 2000 organisations, 74 per cent are using SOA now. All this SOA usage is not just industry hype and experimentation, either. SOA has been delivering tangible results that make IT executives want more of it: 52 per cent of current enterprise SOA users say it has delivered enough benefit that they plan to expand its use. Only one per cent of SOA users say they are cutting back on SOA because they see little or no benefit while, for 30 per cent, it is still too early to tell.\nHowever, getting SOA right takes work: 18 per cent of enterprise SOA users say they are struggling to get the benefits and, in Forrester's experience, this is often caused by a technology-focused approach to SOA.\n\u2022 SOA aligns your software with your business. While it is true that SOA is fundamentally an approach to software architecture and design - which makes it sound tech-oriented - the most important SOA concept is to design software around the business capabilities you need to run your organisation. Each SOA-based business service performs a complete business transaction or query, hiding the complexity of your IT applications behind a pluggable digital software interface for a specific, targeted business capability such as \"submit order\" or \"distribute sales lead.\"\n\u2022 SOA creates a portfolio of business capabilities. By designing for the business capabilities your organisation needs, a business-oriented approach to SOA creates a coherent portfolio of business services that directly reflect the design of your organisation's major business transactions and processes. These services are built upon and leverage your existing base of siloed and overlapping legacy applications. They insulate your business from existing complexity by providing a service layer where business alignment is built directly into your software.\n\u2022 SOA brings business capabilities where they are needed. With a portfolio of SOA business services, your organisation can quickly connect your business capabilities to any business process, employee, customer, partner, supplier, government entity, mobile device, or anything else as needed to adapt to changing business conditions and implement business improvements.\nThere is benefit in SOA itself, and there is further benefit in the foundation for business process flexibility, intelligence, and visibility that SOA provides. Because SOA business services are designed to embody your business transactions and queries, other technologies have a business-focused foundation to build on. For example, business process management software orchestrates a series of services to create a managed end-to-end process. Event processing software keys off of services to identify and automatically respond to business events. Analytics software consumes services data to tell you how your business is doing. Unless these and other technologies have SOA's business foundation to build on, implementing them only creates more technology integration issues.\nTo elaborate on the broader opportunities that arise from an SOA foundation, Forrester"}

Developer Phil Tagami is seeking permission to ship millions of tons of coal from Utah via rail. It would be stored in massive dump pits and warehouses at the foot of the Bay Bridge and conveyed onto ships bound for Asia to be burned in power plants.\nThe city's 2016 ordinance banning coal handling and storage was designed to put an end to Tagami's plans. But Tagami then sued to overturn the city's ban.\nChhabria decided at today's final pretrial hearing in the case that he simply doesn't have enough information to decide if the city's decision to ban coal was based on accurate evidence that showed a substantial threat to health and safety.\n\"How do we know it's a substantial danger?\" Chhabria asked the city's attorneys. The judge requested some kind of baseline or comparison, such as how much particulate matter is emitted from the city's freeways, or other industrial activities such as the ABI Foundry in East Oakland, which currently receives and burns coal to produce metals.\nKevin Siegel, a private attorney helping represent Oakland, told Chhabria that it's unnecessary to have a baseline to compare the coal dust emissions to.\nAny increase in particulate matter measuring around 2.5 micrometers \u2014 tiny airborne particles that can embed deep in people's lungs and even bloodstream \u2014 is dangerous, said Colin O'Brien, an en environmental attorney whose organization, Earthjustice, is an intervenor in the lawsuit. Oakland residents, especially those in West Oakland near the proposed coal terminal site, are already exposed to large amounts of this PM 2.5 dust, and any addition to that would constitute a danger, he said.\nOne clause contained in Oakland's contract with Tagami's company allows the city to take actions affecting his development rights, if, after a public hearing, the city determines there is sufficient evidence that the health and safety of residents and workers could be harmed.\nBut Chhabria, called the city's official report on the health and safety impacts of coal dust \"pretty vague\" and said he needs some kinds of comparison to understand how much more deadly particulate matter would be spewed into the air by allowing coal shipments.\nThat official report was prepared by Environmental Science Associates (ESA). But at today's hearing, one of Tagami's attorneys, Robert Feldman, criticized what he said were errors in the report. He called ESA's work \"completely screwed up\" and \"speculative nonsense.\"\nFeldman said ESA massively overestimated coal dust emissions from trains and warehouses by using a mathematical model based on a pile of fine coal dust on a concrete pad instead of an actual pile of coal rocks.\n\"If you go, phew!, to fine dust,\" said Feldman, blowing into the palm of his hand as if he were spewing dust into the courtroom, \"it's going to go everywhere.\" Feldman said the measurement"}

Teaching is a not just a job; it is a labor of love.\nThe calendar turns to September, and in my house the agonizing grunts and groans of my children can be heard. All I have to say is \u201cBack to school!\u201d and they scream and carry on as if they are going into a rock quarry to begin hard labor. Since Labor Day always falls around the beginning of the ninth month, and the first day of school usually comes a day or two after it, the start of school and this holiday seem inextricably linked. Perhaps that is as it should be, for while our children fear the first day of school, their teachers have been preparing for it all summer.\nThat is why it is necessary and compelling to thank an educator for Labor Day. You probably won\u2019t see your child\u2019s teacher until later this week, but why not go out and get a \u201cthank you\u201d card now? On the first day teachers \u2013 even the most veteran \u2013 always have a few butterflies too. They think: \u201cWhat will my class be like?\u201d They also think about you \u2013 the parents and guardians \u2013 because teachers know that if the school year is to be successful, they are going to have to establish a strong relationship with parents as soon as possible.\nParents who start the year with a \u201cthank you\u201d are already letting teachers know from the start \u201cWe are on the same team.\u201d Your child\u2019s teacher will know that you respect the efforts he or she will make during the year. Your child will also learn something from this \u2013 he or she will know that you value that person and respect him or her. That is a nice way to get things started in the hectic first days of school.\nPeople who are not educators do not understand the \u201clabor\u201d involved in being a teacher. When I first started teaching everyone \u2013 my friends and family included \u2013 all thought I had it easy. Some even went so far as to say I didn\u2019t have a \u201creal\u201d job. These people were suffering from delusions because they thought that I was off on holiday vacations and during the summer, but they didn\u2019t realize that teachers are never off. Teachers usually take some courses over the summer, or they travel to learn about something they are teaching more intimately. They also research during the school year, mark papers, prepare lessons, and correspond with parents. The school day does not end with the last bell for teachers, as they work many more hours doing things students and parents never see.\nIn essence teachers are always teaching even when they are not in the classroom. Teaching is a not just a job; it is a labor of love. The greatest teachers are there because they live to teach, to impart wisdom to their students, to enhance their understanding of not just subject matter but the world in which they live. In this way teaching is a sacred profession, and most teachers I have known see their charge as one they take seriously and appreciate deeply. It is truly an honor and a distinction to be able to stand in a classroom and be a teacher, and the best ones understand this and are thankful for this precious opportunity to help shape the future for their students.\nLabor Day is a day when we honor all workers. \u201cWork\u201d is something that should be respected on all levels.

{"idx": "6111", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A new subdivision in a flood-prone section of West Ashley faces a challenging road forward under Charleston's new building regulations.\nThe Harmony project, which was slated to include more than 200 homes by national firm D.R. Horton, initially won City Council's approval in 2015. Developers met with the city's Technical Review Committee Thursday, one of the last steps before work can begin on the 166-acre site near Glenn McConnell Parkway and Bees Ferry Road.\nBecause the city recently instituted new building regulations in that area, part of the Church Creek basin, Harmony's developers were told they will now face much stricter regulations that require completely redesigning \u2014 or perhaps even scrapping \u2014 the neighborhood.\nThe requirements of the updated regulations \"changes their design significantly, I would expect,\" said Kinsey Holton, the stormwater program manager for the city of Charleston. While other ongoing projects have been affected by the new regulations, Harmony is by far the most significant, he added.\nThe principal designer of the project did not respond to multiple phone messages Friday, but attendees of the TRC meeting said the news did not go over well.\n\u201cThe developer seemed quite concerned about the financial implications,\" said Betsy La Force of the Coastal Conservation League.\nCharleston had paused building around Church Creek until it finalized new development rules last fall. The drainage basin comprises thousands of acres on the edge of the city that formerly was marshland and phosphate mines but slowly been sectioned into suburban housing developments.\nOne group of condos flooded so frequently that it's the subject of a federally funded buyout program by the city to mitigate future flood damage.\nHarmony's developers knew Charleston was changing its rules when they met with city officials during the construction moratorium in 2017, Holton said, but they continued to move through the approval process.\n\"They proceeded at their own risk, and they were well aware of that,\" he said.\nOne of the principal problems near Church Creek is fill dirt, which is trucked in by developers to raise housing lots. Raising new homes is required in flood-prone areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Doing it with fill dirt disrupts the natural function of a floodplain, however, which works as a waiting area for water as it drains into a nearby stream or river.\nUnder Charleston's new rules, developers have to compensate for any new fill in a floodplain by digging a hole to hold any water that might be displaced.\nBecause so much of the Harmony tract is now treated as a floodplain by the city, developers will have to offset just about all the fill they bring to the site. That decreases the buildable land, which may mean fewer housing units and ultimately, less revenue.\nThe Conservation League previously urged the city to buy out the Harmony tract to stop development there.

He gets in touch with his wife Vidya (Tulaskar) for a land deal. In the process, they are forced to stay together for a few days and the reasons behind their separation unfold.\nReview: Sometimes, there might be no glaring flaws in a movie cinematically, but a subject that can't be related to, becomes the major reason for its downfall. Sohalla is a perfect example of this.\nA well-to-do engineer, Girish, is happily married to the love of his life, Vidya, and the couple has a talented young daughter as well. However, things don't really work out well between Girish and Vidya and the two decide to get divorced. After his divorce, when Girish is in a tough situation, a piece of land that the couple jointly owns is freed of bank charge. Soon, the couple decides to sell the land to help Girish get back on his feet. The court procedure though, forces the two to stay together for a couple of days and that's when we are introduced to the reasons that led to their divorce. So far, fine. However, the story fails to establish an emotional connect between the characters and the audience.\nDirector Gajendra Ahire is known for choosing interesting subjects for his films. His last film, The Silence, dealt with crime against women. As a subject, Sohalla is interesting and the director does a fine job of establishing a connect between the past and the present in the film, without confusing the audience. But the film seems stretched and takes its time to gain momentum.\nAs for the performance, Sachin Pilgaonkar is convincing as he plays the once happy-turned-disgruntled man. Shilpa Tulaskar does half her work through expressions. her eyes speak volumes in the scenes where she doesn't have line. In one word, she's fantastic. The supporting cast, comprising of Vikram Gokhale, Mohan Joshi, Lokesh Gupte and more is strong and the actors do justice to their characters.\nSohalla deals with a serious topic and if you are looking to sit-back and relax while enjoying a light-hearted movie in the cinema hall, it would be better to stay away from this one."}

Qu\u00e9bec has hydro-electric resources that could help alleviate the region's overwhelming dependence on natural (methane) gas while moving towards meeting greenhouse gas reduction goals.\nBut at what price would that power come?

The bill would make almost everyone buckle up, including those in both the front and back seats of most vehicles, including SUVs and pickup trucks. Currently, front-seat passengers and children younger than age 16 are required to wear belts, and young children must be in child-restraint seats. People age 16 and older are not required to buckle up in pickups but would be under the bill. Similar seat belt proposals have passed the Senate in previous years but have failed in the House. This year the legislation passed the House on a 55-41 vote but only after members included a provision to change the local road funding formula by phasing trucks into the equation over three years. Counting trucks in the formula would typically give rural areas increased road funding, while decreasing money for urban areas. The Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday took that provision out of the bill and then passed the seat belt proposal 7-4. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.

He had constructed a new Republican alliance -- a New Right -- of corporate elites, Christian evangelicals, conservative and neoconservative intellectuals, and a host of right-wing interest groups in hopes of undoing the liberal politics and programs of the past 40 years, reversing the cultural changes and developments of the 1960s, and establishing a new national governing consensus.\nConservatives certainly were not supposed to speak favorably of Paine, and for 200 years, they had not. In fact, they had for generations publicly despised Paine and scorned his memory. And one can understand why: Endowing American experience with democratic impulse and aspiration, Paine had turned Americans into radicals, and we have remained radicals at heart ever since.\nHowever, for more than a quarter-century, we have allowed the Republican right to appropriate the nation's history, de\ufb01ne what it means to be an American, and corral American political imagination. It is time for the left to recover its fundamental principles and perspectives and reinvigorate Americans' democratic impulse and aspiration. And we must start by reclaiming, and reconnecting with, Paine's memory and legacy and the progressive tradition he inspired and encouraged. We must redeem Paine's revolutionary vision, his con\ufb01dence in his fellow citizens, and his belief in America's extraordinary purpose and promise. Doing so will help us to remember not only what we stand in opposition to but, all the more, what we stand in opposition for.\nContributing fundamentally to the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the struggles of Britain's Industrial Revolution, Thomas Paine was one of the most remarkable political writers of the modern world and the greatest radical of a radical age. Yet this son of an English artisan did not become a radical until his arrival in America in late 1774, at the age of 37. Even then he had never expected such things to happen. But struck by America's startling contradictions, magni\ufb01cent possibilities, and wonderful energies, and moved by the spirit and determination of its people to resist British authority, he dedicated himself to the American cause. Through his Common Sense pamphlet and the Crisis papers, he inspired Americans not only to declare their independence and create a republic; he also emboldened them to turn their colonial rebellion into a revolutionary war, de\ufb01ned the new nation in a democratically expansive and progressive fashion, and articulated an American identity charged with exceptional purpose and promise.\nFive feet 10 inches tall, with a full head of dark hair and striking blue eyes, Paine was inquisitive, gregarious, and compassionate, yet strong-willed, combative, and ever ready to argue about and \ufb01ght for the good and the right. The story is told of a dinner gathering at which Paine, on hearing his mentor Franklin observe, \u201cWhere liberty is, there is my country,\u201d cried out, \u201cWhere liberty is not, there is my country!\u201d A workingman before an intellectual and author, Paine developed his revolutionary beliefs and ideas not simply from scholarly study but all the more from experience -- experience that convinced him that the so-called lower orders, not just the highborn and propertied, had the capacity both to comprehend the world and to govern it. And addressing his arguments to those who traditionally were excluded from political debate and deliberation, not merely to the governing classes, he helped to transform the very idea of politics and the political nation.\nAmerica's struggle had turned Paine into an inveterate champion of liberty"}

And Toronto came out of the gate strongly in the first half of the first period, getting high-quality scoring chances on Blueshirts goaltender Alexandar Georgiev.\nUnfortunately, none of Toronto's 13 shots in the first frame beat Georgiev, but when the Rangers pushed back at the Leafs in the second half of the first period, Frederik Andersen turned aside all 11 shots he faced. The Leafs' defensive structure was improved from recent games, and Andersen's confidence was on full display in this one.\nThe Leafs continued to play well in the middle period, keeping much of the play in the Rangers' zone and coming close to scoring on numerous occasions. However, Georgiev was sharp for the visitors, and he stopped all 10 Toronto shots he saw in the second frame.\nMeanwhile, the Leafs held the Rangers to only seven shots in the second period, and they deserved to be proud of their defensive effort through 40 minutes of action.\nHyman's goal sent the crowd at Scotiabank Arena into a roar of joy, and it pushed the Leafs into an even more energetic approach the rest of the way: Toronto outshot the Blueshirts 15-7 through the first 16 minutes of the third - and for a total of 43-25 through three periods - and came close to getting the go-ahead marker many times.\nThe Leafs had more chances to win the game in overtime, but couldn't find the precision it takes to score in high-pressure situations, and after they nearly ended it in the Rangers' zone, the Blueshirts came back the other way on a 2-on-1 rush.

It is the fourth Texas store \u2014 there's also one in Dallas and in Austin \u2014 and the 26th in North America, with 10 more to come before the end of the year. Suitsupply also operates a customer service center in Dallas.\nThe Woodlands store is a prototype for the company's rapid expansion. It's located in a 3,400-square-foot space (smaller than the West Ave store but still spacious) and the exterior is lined in eye-catching green ceramic tiles. Inside, it's colorful, with giant replicas of ads on the wall, cubbyholes displaying the full menswear collection, and a tailor's studio with sewing machine prominently displayed. As at other Suitsuppy stores, alternations can be made while the customer waits.\nWhile suits continue to be a mainstay \u2014 they are priced at $399, $499, and $999, depending on the quality of fabric \u2014 the Amsterdam-based brand has expanded into athletic and leisure wear, formal wear (a tuxedo package, including shirt, bow tie, and shoes is $799) and accessories, including shoes, belts, backpacks, dop kits and sunglasses.\"You can only buy so many suits,\" de Gruiter said.\nThe spring/summer Suitsupply collection is inspired by the Bauhaus movement, with clean lines and minimalist colors of grey, beige and white that can be mixed and matched for different looks. The eclectic collection includes button-front sweatpants that can be worn with a polo shirt and jacket for casual travel and, if headed to a business meeting, the wearer can substitute a gray pair of slacks, shirt and tie.\n\"The collection that we carry here is all year round. The merchandise mix here works for this weather \u2014 linen or very lightweight wools, unlined jackets, pique shirts. It's perfect merchandised for a climate like this,\" de Gruiter said.\nChecked vests come in a variety of colors, which can freshen up an old suit. \"Every guy has a navy suit. You can add a vest for a whole new look,\" he said.\nDe Gruiter finds that, particular in Sunbelt cities, customers \"like stuff that travels well. They want to be comfortable and they want more casual, so you listen to your client. And based on that you can build your collection,\" he said.\nThe brand recently launched The Box Office, an online service in which a Suitsupply stylist picks items based on the client's lifestyle and sends them directly to him. The service offers free shipping, free returns, and the client isn't charged for 30 days.\n\"It's convenient for guys who don't want to do into the store,\" de Gruiter said. \"We make a very serious product, but we don't take ourselves too seriously.\""}

Richard Phillips. Later taken hostage by the pirates on a lifeboat, Phillips was rescued when Navy SEAL snipers aboard a destroyer killed the gun-toting captors with a volley of precisely timed shots.\nThe merchant mariner from Underhill, Vt., recounted his ordeal to more than 100 people Wednesday night at a dinner in his honor at the Riverside Yacht Club.\nThe morning after the warning came, Phillips said his crew spotted a speedboat three miles away moving quickly toward their 17,000-ton ship that was carrying emergency supplies to Mombasa, Kenya. The crew began evasive maneuvers, he said, but couldn't shake the pirates.\nWhen they closed to within two miles, his crew began shooting up flares, and when they came within a mile, Phillips sounded the alarm. When the pirates drew closer, he began shooting flares at their boat, hoping it would catch fire.\nThe pirates returned fire, he recalled.\n\"Now the pirates are shooting at us. I'm shooting flares at them, and I can hear the ping, ping, ping of their bullets (hitting) the side of the ship.\"\nBy the time the pirates boarded the cargo ship, most of the crew had hidden below deck, as per safety protocol, while Phillips and two other members remained on deck.\nPhillips said he played dumb when asked where the crew had gone.\n\"I don't know where they are. I'm here with you,\" he told the pirates.\nOrdered to pilot the ship, which had been brought to a halt, Phillips said he lied to them: \"I can't make it go. I can't, because you broke it.\"\nThe pirates' hijacking plans soon began to unravel, Phillips recalled. One of the four men was captured by crew members when he went below deck to search for them. And the pirates' damaged boat had sunk.\nPhillips said he decided to cut a deal with the leader. \"We'll give them back their missing guy, and all four will sail off to Somalia,\" offered the captain, who volunteered to help the pirates board the Maersk's lifeboat, thinking it would be the best way to protect his crew and cargo.\nPhillips said that it was a common misconception from media reports that he surrendered himself as a hostage. \"The fact was, without the assistance of one crew member to get the lifeboat into the water, the pirates couldn't leave the ship. I decided that crew member would be me.\"\nBut the pirates reneged: Once in the boat, they refused to let him reboard his ship, as they had promised.\n\"It's another lesson I learned: Never trust a pirate,\" he quipped.\nPhillips said his hopes of being rescued began to fade as the days passed inside the enclosed lifeboat, where conditions became unbearably hot in the warm weather.\nBut he remained defiant in his dealings with his captors. \"I vowed that I would not give up.

In fact, that's just about the only thing anyone is talking about.\nFor Israelis and Palestinians, September is the universally understood shorthand for the likely United Nations vote that month on whether to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state. Right now, Israeli and Palestinian officials are traveling to European and other capitals, furiously soliciting votes. But no one on either side of the debate doubts that a majority of the U.N.'s 192 member states will vote with the Palestinians.\n\"We have no chance of winning,\" said Ron Dermer, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shaking his head. \"We have maybe 30-40 countries on our side.\"\nIn theory, the General Assembly vote is merely symbolic. It holds no force of law. Still, both sides predict grievous consequences - a sustained international legal assault on Israel, and at the same time deep frustration and possible violence among Palestinians when the vote does not instantly create a fully sovereign state.\nSalam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, insists that's not true. \"The ICC is not a forum we can join until we are a state,\" he said, adding that the Palestinians aren't pursuing that as their goal in any case.\nBut just a few weeks earlier, he told the United States Congress that he would never be willing to negotiate territory based on the 1967 lines - the current Israel-West Bank border established at the end of the Six-Day War in 1967.\nNetanyahu took affront in May when President Obama offered that as the starting position for territorial negotiations, with mutually agreed upon \"land swaps.\" But here's a little-noticed fact: This has been United States policy since 1967, when Secretary of State Dean Rusk stated that in future negotiations \"the Israeli border along the West Bank could be 'rationalized'; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties.\" At that time, Israel conditionally agreed. But don't expect much from Netanyahu's last-minute gambit now.\nAt the same time, in the West Bank the Palestinian leadership may be setting up a crisis of their own. Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki found in a recent survey that \"the public supports the September process,\" but \"the minute the leadership returns from New York, Palestinian youths expect them to begin exercising absolute sovereignty.\"\n\"That's not my thinking about September at all - assert absolute sovereignty unilaterally.\" The truth is, he added, \"the day after the vote will in no way be any different, the same as the day before.\" Fayyad has publicly criticized Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, for raising public expectations. All of the public discussion \"is based on a false premise. What I find objectionable is that this has not been explained to the Palestinian people.\"\n\"The public is a lot more radical about September than the leadership is,\" said Shikaki. His most recent poll of West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, in June, found that 80 percent favored asking the U.N. for \"recognition of a Palestinian state.\"\nAs the \"September\" initiative leads inexorably toward a showdown that could turn violent, both sides hold blame - Palestinian leaders for raising expectations that cannot be met, Israelis for making only disingenuous proposals for peace.\nJoel Brinkley, a Pulitzer"}

The U.N. panel said there were \"strong indications of the supply of arms-related material manufactured in, or emanating from, the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" in violation of a U.N. embargo on Yemen.\nBut the report also had harsh words for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of the Trump administration's closest Arab allies, saying they have continued or expanded their support for Yemeni forces that undermine the authority of the government and could hasten the fragmentation of the state.\nThe U.N. experts were particularly critical of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition. The U.N. previously had said that the majority of the more than 5,000 civilian deaths in the conflict were a result of the airstrikes, which are carried out by a handful of coalition countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, often using U.S.-supplied munitions.\nThe report, which has not yet been made public, was obtained by The Washington Post.\nThe panel's findings, nearly three years after the eruption of widespread hostilities in Yemen, add weight to repeated warnings by aid workers and analysts about the risks of a humanitarian catastrophe, rampant human rights abuses and the potential for the battle to spill over Yemen's borders.\nWith the proliferation of local rivalries and armed groups with competing loyalties, \"Yemen as a state has all but ceased to exist,\" the report said.\nWhat began as a largely domestic fight after the Houthi rebels seized control of Sanaa, the capital, and drove the government from power has been transformed into an arena for the regional feud between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition, which receives military support from the United States, entered the war in 2015 to restore the government and dislodge the Houthis, whom the Saudis accused of acting as an Iranian proxy force, a charge the Houthis have long denied.\nEight million people, or a third of Yemen's population, are facing famine.

Director David Nutter \u2014 who also helmed the infamous Red Wedding episode \u2014 breaks down all the twists and turns behind the episode.\nHow do you approach such a big, complicated episode?\nMy first reaction is complete and utter fear. How am I going to basically do this? How am I going to direct this? I always try to remember that pyramids are built one stone at a time so I try not too freak out too much. I try to hammer it down to how to make it doable.\nWhat was the toughest scene?\nI have to say probably Cersei\u2019s walk of shame because that needed to have the scope and immensity and size of King\u2019s Landing and it was important to me to sell what she was going through emotionally and physically, and the real true hate that the people of King\u2019s Landing had for her that needed to be demonstrated in the way that was correct \u2014 and reflected all the terrible things that she\u2019d done through her tenure as queen.\nTalk about Lena Headey\u2019s performance in that scene.\nLena is one of the most talented actresses I\u2019ve ever worked with. We did \u201cThe Sarah Connor Chronicles\u201d together for Fox years ago. Getting a chance to reunite with her as Cersei in the last two years has been a wonderful thing. She\u2019s an amazing talent and someone is so very gifted and should be recognized for her ability to really bring it. She\u2019s really something and we enjoy working together. She really can provide magic. She\u2019s someone who leads with her heart and gets so invested in what she\u2019s going through.\nThe scene goes on for so long. Why was that length so important?\nWhat was important was to sell this journey. It wasn\u2019t the kind of thing where she could walk down a set of stairs and the next minute she\u2019s at the Red Keep. We needed to sell the fact that she was having to go through the sewers of King\u2019s Landing and see what she\u2019s brought to the fore with respect to the hate these poor people who live in this world have for her. That\u2019s what was important for her walk of shame. To be with her in this entire journey, to be quite moved by it. It wasn\u2019t the kind of scene you could cut to or do a short version of. It was important to do it right and uphold the integrity of the sequence.\nWas it difficult to shoot the final scene, with Jon Snow\u2019s death?\nVery difficult. As when we shot the Red Wedding, the death of Robb and Catelyn Stark, these are people you spend years with and these people become your family. Kit Harington is just a great guy and Kit was sad to leave the crew. It\u2019s an emotional feeling as well. But I felt it was important to set up the sequence as quickly as possible so you didn\u2019t expect it or wait for it. I didn\u2019t want it to linger. I wanted it to catch you by surprise. I think in how David (Benioff) and Dan (Weiss) wrote it and how I decided to shoot and how our editor cut it, it was something it was quite powerful and stunning and surprising to great effect.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of speculation online. So can you say emphatically that Jon Snow is dead?\nI can say emphatically"}

And for the receiver, it can be difficult or even unrealistic for a busy professional to coordinate bespoke consultation appointments for everyone who asks.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of asking a superstar in your field out for coffee so you can learn what makes them tick \u2014 and how you can apply that knowledge to your own career path \u2014 here\u2019s how to do it right.\nDorie Clark, adjunct professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business and the author of \u201cEntrepreneurial You,\u201d said asking to pick someone\u2019s brain has become overused to the point of thoughtlessness. Done wrong it almost certainly sends the wrong message, she said, and these requests can seem as if you\u2019re following a generic script.\nShe suggests changing the language from, \u201cCan I pick your brain?\u201d to the more friendly, \u201cI would like your advice.\u201d People respond more positively to that phrasing because it conveys intention; that you\u2019re approaching a certain person for very particular reasons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about checking a box.

Mentioning you both interned at the same radio station is better.\nNext, articulate why this person is distinctly qualified to give you the knowledge you seek.

Expect light homework, deferrals, referrals or delays in response to a cold email asking to pick their brain.\nFor Ms. Clark, homework assignments are useful for evaluating a seeker\u2019s fortitude.

This helps ensure that the following conversation isn\u2019t superficial.\nAs far as referrals go, Dr. Grant appreciates when people give him an out by saying something like, \u201cIf you\u2019re too busy, is there somebody else you could recommend?\u201d He can still be helpful even if he doesn\u2019t have the time to meet up or take a call.\nJolie Kerr, advice columnist and host of the Ask a Clean Person podcast, suggests you treat the meetup as if it were a job interview.

Players are sharing in the riches, with 29 current NBAers in the middle of contracts worth at least $94 million in deals that range from three years in the case of LeBron James to five years for most of the 28 others, according to data from Spotrac. The significance of $94 million: It is more than the career earnings from playing salary of the sport's greatest player, Michael Jordan, who earned $93.8 million with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards.\nBut don't shed a tear for MJ. Sure, he made more than $4 million during only two of his 15 seasons in the NBA (Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf also paid Jordan his $4 million salary during the full season he took off to play baseball). Yet Jordan elevated athlete endorsements to an entirely new level, which has continued long after he hung up his high-tops for good in 2003. The result: Jordan is the highest-paid athlete of all time at $1.85 billion in 2017 dollars (the tally is $1.5 billion in current dollars).\nJordan has partnered with dozens of brands since he turned pro in 1984, including Gatorade, Hanes, MCI, Oakley, Upper Deck, Wheaties and more. His biggest backer has always been Nike, which signed Jordan ahead of his rookie year to a five-year deal worth $2.5 million, plus royalties. The Jordan Brand exploded for Nike and is now a $3.1 billion global business with revenue up 13% over last year and $800 million from two years ago. Jordan's estimated cut of the business is $140 million this year.\nJordan showed the path to a fortune built on endorsement earnings that has since been followed by Tiger Woods, who ranks second at $1.7 billion. Like Jordan, Woods reached the pinnacle of his sport while shying away from any controversy, making him a marketing darling for sponsors like Accenture, American Express, EA Sports, General Motors and Nike.\nWoods banked $600 million (adjusted for inflation) between 2006 and 2010, with endorsements and appearance fees fueling most of the earnings. The image of Woods as the perfect pitchman came crashing down on a Thanksgiving night eight years ago, but he remains the top draw in golf when healthy. His earnings are off 68% from their peak but still rank among the highest in golf.\nForbes' earnings estimates include salaries, bonuses, prize money, endorsements and licensing, as well as fees from books, golf course designs and appearances. Earnings cover from the time the athletes turned pro through June 1, 2017, and include money earned after playing careers were over, as well as earnings by the estate in the case of Arnold Palmer. We do not include investment income, and we back-filled years where we did not publish earnings figures, such as prior to 1990 for Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. We adjusted all figures for inflation.\nThe 25 highest-paid athletes of all time played a mix of eight sports, with golf, basketball and boxing landing five entries each.

But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be graded.\nThe exhibit is called \u201cPulse,\u201d and it opened last week at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. It has three installations that create art by collecting visitors\u2019 biometric data. (Biometric data is information that identifies your body. A fingerprint is one example.) \u00adLozano-Hemmer uses electronic sensors to gather a person\u2019s data and project it through lights, screens and water pumps to create art. He said the purpose of this exhibit is to show people that while we have our differences, we all share a heartbeat.\n\u201cWhat I like about this is that the art is fundamentally out of my control,\u201d says Lozano-Hemmer, a Mexican Canadian artist.\n\u201cPulse Index\u201d is the first installation visitors walk into at the Hirshhorn. It is a panoramic view of 10,000 fingerprints that are collected from visitors through a microscope. When a finger is inserted in the microscope, a fingerprint scan will show up on the wall among thousands of others. Each time a scan is taken, it knocks an old one off the wall. More than 100,000 fingerprints have been part of this installation, which has traveled around the world.\n\u201cPulse Tank,\u201d the second part of the installation, uses visitors\u2019 heartbeats to create rippling waves projected onto the walls in a light show.

It\u2019s all generated by amplifying the electrical activity of the heart,\u201d says Lozano-Hemmer.\nLozano-Hemmer was a chemist before he became an artist. When his wife was pregnant with twins, he listened to their hearts through an ultrasound machine at a doctor visit. He asked the doctor to place a monitor on each baby and noticed each beat was different. This inspired him to learn more about how technology and science can be visualized into art.\n\u201cUnder all this work is the desire to see. I would like people to come to the museum with a sense of wonder to visualize data and metrics,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPulse Room\u201d is the last installation. Visitors walk into a room filled with more than 200 flickering lightbulbs. When two metal rods are held with both hands, it records a person\u2019s heartbeat. That recording is transmitted into a flashing lightbulb. The bulb blinks to the rhythm and speed of that heartbeat. The room roars and rumbles with sounds of different beats.\nIn the first few days, the heartbeats were a mix of those from Hirshhorn visitors and those who saw the exhibit this year in Seoul, Korea. But \u201cPulse\u201d continues to evolve.

But the crackdown wrought by a failed military coup in 2016 has been among the most wrenching, he says. Friends and family are leaving Istanbul, trade has nearly ground to a halt, and his faith that he and his fellow Armenians have a future in Turkey has dwindled.\nIn the wake of the coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has jailed more than 50,000 people, and the authorities have banned hundreds of news outlets and civil society groups. The country\u2019s lurch toward Islamist-tinged nationalism under Erdo\u011fan has left religious minorities feeling vulnerable. Recent attacks on minorities, although apparently isolated and spontaneous, have heightened those suspicions.\nMobs angered by Israeli policies pelted stones at Jewish synagogues in Istanbul last year. Vandals marked the homes of members of the Alevi sect, a heterodox offshoot of Islam, and stoned the empty offices of an Armenian association in the eastern town of Malatya. In September, unidentified assailants threw stones and shouted \u201cDeath to Armenians\u201d at churchgoers celebrating a baptism in Istanbul.\nErdo\u011fan expanded civil liberties early in his rule, but after 15 years in power has become increasingly authoritarian. He has condemned some of the incidents, but the authorities' failure to prosecute the perpetrators has stirred fear that such attacks could continue.\nTurkey\u2019s largest group of non-Muslims, Armenians have seen restored churches wrecked in military operations and the government block their efforts to elect a new spiritual leader. At stake is a tentative opening over the last decade that had eroded long-standing taboos, especially about the World War I-era genocide when as many at 1.5 million Armenians perished as the Ottoman Empire collapsed.\nArmenians \u201cremember their past, what happened to their grandparents in this kind of atmosphere [which encourages] crimes. They know there is a big risk,\u201d says Garo Paylan, an ethnic Armenian lawmaker from the opposition Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party.\nTurkey still denies the massacres amounted to a state-orchestrated genocide, but Erdo\u011fan in recent years has expressed condolences over the loss of life; public commemorations are allowed to take place; and criminal prosecutions for discussing the genocide have ceased.\nMinorities in Turkey have benefited from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s embrace of the legacy of the multicultural Ottoman Empire. The secular Turkish Republic that replaced it has, at times, viewed religious and ethnic diversity as a threat to national unity. Turkey\u2019s population of 80 million is officially 99 percent Muslim, but it is also home to some 60,000 Armenians, 17,000 Jews and 3,000 Greeks.\nPaylan does not believe Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) deliberately targets these groups, but worries rival political forces can \u201cplay the card any time, knowing there is bias against the Armenian identity, and organize provocations against minorities.

Text by Diana Magallon. Photos by Jeremy Lim.\nAn empty arena, a couple of staff members cleaning, the sound of things being tightened: this is what noon looks like at Roger\u2019s Arena on the day that Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Quidam is set to have its dress rehearsal.\nA very fit man in track pants and a t-shirt rolls a big metal wheel onto the stage; a scattered assortment of people observe and discuss from a distance. This is Cory Sylvester\u2019s stage time to rehearse his act, the German Wheel. He smiles at the photographer and me, rubs his hands together, does a quick neck stretch, and off he goes: spinning, climbing, balancing, rocking, sitting, and flipping masterfully with, on, and inside the wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s different than performing with a wall next to you,\u201d he says during a brief pause.\nIt is most definitely different. For tour publicist, Jessica Leboeuf, this second incarnation of Cirque\u2019s 1996 show is different in more ways than just its venue. The switch from the Grand Chapiteau to the arena allows the load-in to take eight hours (not seven days) and the run of the show to be six days (not six weeks).\nThe company stays in a hotel; family members do not come along for the tour; and the pace is faster and constantly fresh. \u201cIt feels more rock and roll,\u201d as Leboeuf so aptly put. The t\u00e9l\u00e9pherique, a structure designed and built specifically for Quidam, uses five tracks to fly performers on or off stage simultaneously, while functioning as the device for a variety of aerial acts. In a space where light, sound, performance, and attendance can be expanded to the maximum, the story of Quidam is allowed to resonate more deeply in the minds and hearts of contemporary audiences.\nInspired by the Latin word for \u201cstranger\u201d, Quidam is an urban, intensely introspective show that tells the story of a young girl, invisible in her own surroundings, who discovers unique characters in a world of seemingly ordinary passersby. Today, living in a digital age of Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and Wordpress, \u2013 an age in which everyone is someone and no one at the same time \u2013 Quidam seems even more relevant now than it was fifteen years go.

It displays very graphically how Harvard and other Ivy League institutions have contributed to and perhaps even caused the toxic political polarization of this country. How can an institution which proclaims as its goals leadership, excellence, and diversity have 93 percent participation in one party in a country balanced between two parties? Surely half of America will come to despise institutions which appear willfully to have created such polarization.\nPresident Faust is right when she reminds listeners that the world\u2019s current turmoil represents a systematic crisis that has arisen from a failure of \u201cwider vision\u201d (\u201cEducating Professionals,\u201d January-February, page 58). Connect the dots. Al Gore asks his audience (\u201cGore Boosts a Greener Harvard,\u201d page 58) to substitute renewable energy for carbon-based energy in order to control global warming. Turn to page 61 for Elizabeth Gudrais\u2019s report on the development of heating, lighting, and plumbing in low-cost homes in Latin America (\u201cFor Santiago\u2019s Poor, Housing with Dignity\u201d). Astute readers may spot the great dilemma of the twenty-first century. How can nations reduce the use of carbon-based fuels while lifting the poor out of poverty? When leaders combine a social-justice agenda with their environmental-protection concerns, there\u2019s hope for humanity. When the desire to save \u201cMother Earth\u201d overrides human-rights concerns, brace yourself for a time of troubles.\nI detected no note of irony in the reporting that \u201cThe consciousness-raising during Harvard\u2019s Sustainability Celebration included lots of giveaways\u2026\u201d (page 58). Do Harvard students need stickers to remind them to reduce food waste? Are they generally without T-shirts? When are we going to recognize that sustainability means \u201cless stuff\u201d and that self-styled \u201cgreen\u201d swag is actually not \u201cgreen\u201d at all?\nYour excellent profile of Frances Perkins (Vita, by Adam Cohen, January-February, page 32) was accompanied by a stock photo of her with \u201csteelworkers constructing the Golden Gate Bridge.\u201d Ms. Perkins, a friend of organized labor, would have known they were \u201ciron workers.\u201d Steel workers make steel, iron workers erect steel buildings and bridges. This would be trivial, except that it kills a little history. The first metal buildings and bridges were built of iron, often small pieces of cast iron. Those iron workers adapted to the new steel technology, moving from low-rises to skyscrapers (the Empire State Building, et al.), but they kept their hard-won and proudly spoken union name. So, for another example, do the Teamsters who now drive a team of cylinders, not horses.

Suddenly, she's the lucky \u2014 and literal \u2014 star of her own rom-com. But rather than take delight in this new world, she feels instantly trapped.\nIf, in your jaded heart, you loathe romantic comedies, you'll get scant satisfaction from this one.

If, however, you have a soft spot for the genre \u2014 and, aw, we won't tell \u2014 \"Isn't It Romantic\" delivers the goods, on multiple levels.\nThe movie gives its audience credit as it dissects the cliches of the genre.

The only person Natalie can talk to is a co-worker, Josh, played by Adam Devine, Wilson's romantic foil in the \"Pitch Perfect\" movies. Josh, of course, worships her, though she's, um clueless.\nTrapped in a PG-13 world, Natalie can't even swear properly; random noises bleep out her strongest curses.\nWilson heads up a strong cast, but it is director Todd Strauss-Schulson \u2014 whose 2015 comedy \"The Final Girls\" made such excellent fun of 1980s slasher flicks \u2014 lights the way with a deft satiric touch, balancing humor and heart.

As Dr. Meyer argues, sudden appearances and explosive events in the fossil record are an enigma that bedeviled Darwin in his day, still disturbs the sleep of evolutionists, and forms an initial observation in the case for intelligent design.\nWe now know that like the horseshoe crab, trilobites reproduced by seeding gametes from a pore in the head. We know that because fossilized trilobite eggs have been found in situ in Upstate New York, the results having been published in the journal Geology. These trilobite eggs are from the Ordovician, which followed the Cambrian. Their discovery is a first.\nDespite a plethora of exceptionally preserved trilobites, trilobite reproduction has remained a mystery. No previously described trilobite has unambiguous eggs or genitalia preserved. This study reports the first occurrence of in situ preserved eggs belonging to Triarthrus eatoni (Hall, 1838) trilobites from the Lorraine Group in upstate New York, USA. Like other exceptionally preserved trilobites from the Lorraine Group, the complete exoskeletons are replaced with pyrite. The eggs are spherical to elliptical in shape, nearly 200 \u00b5m in size, and are clustered in the genal area of the cephalon. The fact that the eggs are smaller than the earliest-known trilobite ontogenetic (protaspis) stage suggests that trilobites may have had an unmineralized preliminary stage in their ontogeny, and that the protaspis shield formed only after hatching. The eggs are only visible ventrally with no dorsal brood pouch or recognized sexual dimorphism. The location of the eggs is consistent with where modern female horseshoe crabs release their unfertilized eggs from the ovarian network within their head. Trilobites likely released their gametes (eggs and sperm) through a genital pore of as-yet unknown location (likely near the posterior boundary of the head). If the T. eatoni reproductive biology is representative of other trilobites, they spawned with external fertilization, possibly the ancestral mode of reproduction for early arthropods. Because pyritization preferentially preserves the external rather than internal features of fossils, it is suggested that there is likely a bias in the fossil record toward the preservation of arthropods that brood eggs externally: arthropods that brood their eggs internally are unlikely to preserve any evidence of their mode of reproduction.\nAccording to Wikipedia, crab roe is eaten as a delicacy in France and China. I\u2019m not certain about horseshoe crabs.\nAs a plausible explanation of life\u2019s complexity, Darwinian thinking emerged when cellular biology was a great blur. As what we know about cells and their contents has dramatically sharpened in detail and focus, orthodox evolutionary thinking correspondingly fades in its persuasiveness.\nAnd that is true not only of cellular biology but of biology in general, including paleontology.

Supreme Court Justice William Ehrcke following a three-day hearing in December.\nThe developments occurred just as China and the United States are set to begin a new round of trade negotiations on Wednesday in Washington. President Donald Trump said he would get involved in the Huawei case if it would help produce a trade agreement with China.\nIt's claimed Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, tried to cover up the Chinese tech giant's business operations in Iran.\nNeither Mr Lametti nor Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland gave any hints on whether Canada would back the extradition request.\nBoth sides have characterised this month's lower-level talks as \"good\".\nThe Chinese government described the indictments as \"deep political motivations and manipulations\".\nThe charges unsealed Monday accused Huawei of trying to take a piece of a robot and steal other technology from a T-Mobile lab that was used to test smartphones. US are accused of 10 charges related to theft of trade secrets, wire fraud and obstruction of justice. If Huawei is found guilty of Wire Fraud and Obstruction of Justice, it could face a maximum fine of US$500,000.\nThe indictments follow a 2014 T-Mobile civil suit accusing Huawei of stealing trade secrets related to a robotic phone-testing device known as \"Tappy\".\nCanada's Department of Justice confirmed in an email that Canadian officials had received a formal extradition request from the United States on January 28 and that Canada now has until March 1 to issue an authority to proceed.\nIt's separate from a 13-count case that accuses Huawei of misleading banks about the company's business and violating United States sanctions.\nIn a separate case, the Justice Department said Huawei stole robotic technology from T-Mobile.\nThe escalating tensions between the USA and China come as the Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He landed in Washington DC for talks to resolve the ongoing trade row between the two countries.\nIn 2012, engineers at Huawei's United States branch were given access to Tappy after the two companies entered into a supply agreement.\nMeng's arrest nearly two months ago touched off an ongoing diplomatic furor that resulted Sunday in the firing of John McCallum as Canada's ambassador to China after he publicly expressed confidence in her ability to fight extradition to the United States. Last week, Vodafone, one of the world's biggest mobile phone companies, said it would stop using Huawei gear in its core networks.\nIn a previous sworn affidavit, Meng said she is innocent and would contest the allegations at trial in the United States if she is extradited."}

But now the situation has become all the more clear after Rocket Internet released its latest financial results.\nAs an early-stage venture builder, losses are to be expected for Rocket Internet\u2019s dozen or so global e-commerce businesses but, as companies reach maturity, the scales need to tip and show signs of a sustainable business lurking to break out. In the case of Lazada, the figures show a company that was undoubtedly growing, but had become too capital intensive to continue on its path.\nFour-year-old Lazada reported \u20ac275 million ($310 million) in revenue during 2015, a figure that was up 78 percent on the previous year. That\u2019s impressive growth but it came at an unsustainable cost: a \u20ac296.5 million ($334 million) loss for the year, more than double the loss it posted in 2014.\nInterestingly, GMV \u2014 the total value of transactions made on the Lazada platform \u2014 grew nearly three-fold between 2014 and 2015 \u2014 rising from $384 million ($432 million) to cross the $1 billion mark for the first time. That figure\u2019s growth is wildly different from the company\u2019s revenue, which suggests that Lazada was offering deep discounts to incentivize both merchants to sell and consumers to buy from its site. As Uber and others can testify, that\u2019s not sustainable in the longterm.\nGiven its lack of cash and issues raising funding, as we reported yesterday, it\u2019s no big surprise that it entered into a massive deal to preserve the business. The fact that Alibaba, with its deep pockets and interest in expanding beyond China, was available to step in and inject $500 million into the coffers was ideal since Lazada needed massive amounts of capital, and quickly.\nThe company\u2019s growing revenues and $1 billion-plus GMV show that there is clearly demand for e-commerce services in Southeast Asia \u2014 GMV for the final quarter of 2015 almost matched that of the whole of 2014 \u2014 but it looks like a long game. (Indeed, we reported yesterday that the company set its initial targets far too aggressively.) Alibaba is the right entity to push things forward since it can bring experience and technology into the business and, most importantly, it has the money to ensure that Lazada can continue on the road towards profitability.\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting to note is that Singapore sovereign fund Temasek is an investor in both Alibaba and Lazada, and, furthermore, it is the only Lazada shareholder that is not selling its shares as part of Alibaba\u2019s investment. TechCrunch understands that the firm played matchmaker for the deal, which may have been informally planned for some time, or at least since Temasek led a $250 million round for Lazada in November 2014. Given that the Lazada business had become financially unsustainable, it seems that was the critical factor in the deal\u2019s timing."}

{"idx": "6194", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A new study on news consumption via tablet computers suggests catching up on the news is one of the most popular activities on the devices, rating even higher than social networking and gaming. But the research, conducted by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Project for Excellence in Journalism with The Economist Group, found that most users still aren\u2019t willing to pay for news on tablets.\nA year and a half after the iPad\u2019s introduction, the study overall said 11% of U.S. adults now own a tablet of some kind. The vast majority (77%) use them each day for an average of an hour and 35 minutes. Among them, more than half (53%) access news on their tablet every day, reading long articles and checking headlines.\nThat\u2019s about the same proportion that uses email each day (54%), more than those who use tablets for social networking (39%), gaming (30%), reading books (17%) and watching video (13%). In another positive sign for the industry, three in 10 tablet news users say they now spend more time getting the news than before they had a tablet. Only 4% spend less time, and about two-thirds spend the same amount of time.\nTablet news users also say they now prefer their new devices over traditional PCs, print publications or television as a way both to get quick headlines and to read long-form pieces.\nTablets are displacing computer use in particular -- eight in 20 users say they now get news on their tablet that they previously got on laptop or desktop computers.\nBenefiting most from the emerging tablet news audience have been established brands such as CNN, USA Today and The New York Times. That\u2019s largely because most people rely mainly on just one to three news sources on their tablets and look primarily to recognized names. Among those with news apps, 84% said the news organization was a major factor in deciding what to download.\nNews readers for tablets like Flipboard, Zite and Pulse have lately attracted much buzz and venture capital, but so far have not gained much traction with tablet users, according to the Pew report. They accounted for only 9% of new sources named by survey participants. When checking headlines, 90% of app users went directly to a specific news source, compared to 36% turning to a news aggregator like Pulse.\nDespite publishers\u2019 emphasis on developing tablet apps, the study found the mobile Web is still the No. 1 option for accessing news content. Some 40% get their news mainly through a Web browser, while 31% use news apps and the browser equally, and 21% get their news primarily through apps.\nThat said, those who mainly rely on apps are also the most avid news consumers. Among these so-called power users, 43% say they spend more time getting news than before -- twice the rate of those who mainly go through a browser (19%). And eight in 10 (81%) get news daily, compared to 63% via a browser.\nThese are the types of users publishers want to build on, because only 14% of tablet news consumers overall have paid for news on the tablet. Among those who haven\u2019t paid directly for content, only 21% said they would be willing to pay $5 a month, and 10% would pay $10 a month.\nThe Daily, News Corp.\u2019s iPad-only news app, which charges 99 cents a week or $39.99 a year, would meet that minimum price standard.

{"idx": "6196", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: LIVELY is a new online lingerie company that combines the style of traditional lingerie with the comfort of athleisure.\nAdding to its collection of affordable bras ($35), underwear ($10), and swimwear ($45+), LIVELY released a new wireless, strapless bra ($35) that was met with great enthusiasm and is already backordered.\nThough it's not perfect, we found it was a big improvement from the uncomfortable strapless bras we're used to wearing. That the bra manages to provide comfort and support while being wire-free is impressive.\nStrapless bras are the bane of every woman's existence. In an incredible feat of engineering and daring, most strapless bras manage to simultaneously dig into your skin and slip down your chest every few minutes. I personally stopped wearing strapless tops and dresses altogether to avoid this uncomfortable reality. Other times, I've decide I simply don't care enough that my straps are showing.\nFor years, I had to choose between subtlety and comfort, but I recently tried a strapless bra that didn't compromise, and is completely affordable to boot.\nOnline lingerie startup LIVELY launched just two years ago in 2016 behind the leadership of Victoria's Secret veteran Michelle Cordeiro Grant, selling supportive and stylish bras for only $35. From the beginning, strapless bras were in high demand so the company started offering smooth and lace strapless bras the following year.\nNow, LIVELY has made a strapless bra that's still offers shape and support, but without the pesky wires. The new No-Wire Strapless Bra can even be bent and rolled up, without affecting its shape, for easy packing.\nThe No-Wire Strapless comes in two solid, neutral colors, Toasted Almond and Jet Black. It's lightly lined with foam padding and the back closure has four hooks for extra security, while the band is a breathable mesh fabric. Since there's no wire, the bra derives its support from the back closure and the structured sides where the cups meet the mesh band.\nI approached the bra with understandable skepticism, but came away happily surprised after wearing it under various shirts and dresses. Made with 85% nylon and 15% spandex, it's soft and also stretchy enough to give just the right amount of wiggle room without any gapping. I wasn't used to dealing with so many hooks in the back, but the extra hooks ultimately played an important role in keeping the bra up.\nThough I could still tell I was wearing a strapless bra throughout the day, I certainly thought of it much less often than I usually do because it wasn't painful to wear and I didn't have to constantly wriggle around self-consciously to readjust its position. Instead, I could carry on with my day, supported yet undistracted.\nI hate strapless bras \u2014 and I pretty much always have. But this LIVELY bra is one of the good ones; I actually, somehow, don't mind wearing it \u2014 and it has sufficient support (even sans underwire) to accommodate a 32DD/34D. It has a no-slip strip that works without leaving me feeling like I've been segmented with cable wires to withstand gravity and motion.\nThe adjustable, removable straps mean I've even found myself turning to this bra for its stability in my every day life, thanks to that no-slip strip and a blessed four level hook-and-"}

Mrs. Soto; we don't have a teacher.\"\n\"I could not fathom what they were talking about,\" Rosen told NBC's David Gregory in an intensely emotional interview on the \"Today\" show Tuesday morning.\nRosen, a 69-year-old retired psychologist, took the four girls and two boys into his home, and over the next few hours gave them toys, listened to their stories and called their frantic parents.\nRosen said he had heard the staccato sound of gunfire about 15 minutes earlier but dismissed it as an obnoxious hunter in the nearby woods.\n\"I had no idea what had happened,\" Rosen said. \"I couldn't take that in.\"\nHe walked the children past his small goldfish pond with its running waterfall, and the garden he made with his two grandchildren, into the small yellow house he shares with his wife.\nHe ran upstairs and grabbed an armful of stuffed animals. He gave those to the children, along with some fruit juice, and sat with them as the two boys described seeing their teacher being shot.\n\"I comforted them because I'm a grandfather,\" he told the \"Today\" show, despair in his voice. \"It was my grandchildren who taught me how to be with these children, and I am so thankful for that.\"\nVictoria Soto, 27, was a first-grade teacher killed when 20-year-old Adam Lanza burst into her classroom. It wasn't clear how the children escaped harm, but there have been reports that Soto hid some of her students from the approaching gunman. The six who turned up at Rosen's home did apparently have to run past her body to safety.\n\"They said he had a big gun and a little gun,\" said Rosen, who didn't want to discuss other details the children shared.\nRosen called the children's parents, using cellphone numbers obtained from the school bus company, and they came and retrieved their children.\n\"I wanted to read to them, but they were too upset,\" Rosen told \"Today.\"\nOne little girl, he said, spent the entire ordeal clutching a small stuffed Dalmatian to her chest and staring out the window looking for her mommy.\nAnd one little boy brought them all a moment of levity.\n\"This little boy turns around, and composes himself, and he looks at me like he had just removed himself from the carnage and he says, 'Just saying, your house is very small,'\" Rosen said. \"I wanted to tell him, 'I love you. I love you.'\"\nRosen said Sandy Hook had always been a place of joy for him. He taught his 8-year-old grandson to ride his bike in the school parking lot and took his 4-year-old granddaughter to use the swings.\n\"I thought today how life has changed, how that ground has been marred, how that school has been desecrated,\" he said."}

It\u2019s ensconced in a breathtaking, two-level Brutalist shell composed of panoramic glass walls, concrete, and steel. It could easily be mistaken for a film set from the movies.\nThat\u2019s because it nearly is. The museum, 007 Elements, is near two buildings\u2013the futuristic Gaislachkoglbahn Mountain Gondola terminal and ICE Q restaurant\u2013that were used as locations for 2015\u2019s Spectre. The latter, another modernist glass and steel structure, was featured prominently in the movie, doubling as a high-tech hospital at the service of the evil organization\u2019s chief.\nThe new museum was designed by the architect of the restaurant, Johann Obermoser, and when it opens to film fans (and unsuspecting skiers) on July 12, you\u2019ll be able to arrive at the summit in a gondola, go to the museum, and then have lunch at ICE Q overlooking the Alpine range. In fact, the museum is a joint venture between the producers of the Bond films\u2013EON and MGM\u2013and the company that owns the cable car line and the restaurant, Bergbahnen S\u00f6lden.\nInside, immersive media installations will walk visitors through all the locations and iconic elements of all 24 Bond films, with a combination of interviews, film clips, behind-the-scenes shots, archival footage and artwork, set design, and bespoke graphic animations. For example, one fascinating installation is an inside look at how the large-scale sets used to make old Bond films, like Moonraker and You Only Live Twice\u2013with its iconic Blofeld\u2019s Volcano Lair\u2013were built at the legendary Pinewood Studios in England.\nTwo of those large installations were designed and developed by Territory Studio, a London-based independent design and visual effects studio. The creative director for the museum, Neal Callow, was art director on the films Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, and Spectre, making the space a true extension of the film empire. He worked on this project in collaboration with Tino Schaedler, head of design at the creative agency Optimist Inc.\nIf you want to visit, you\u2019ll need to fly to nearby Innsbruck to grab a cab\u2013or just rent an Aston Martin and drive, like Bond would\u2013to S\u00f6lden, the ski town at the base of the Gaislachkogl. The only downside to the museum\u2019s stunning Alpine location? The weather. I would have chosen an oceanside site somewhere in the south of France or Italy, with an underwater wing that would allow you to pilot Bond\u2019s submarine car, while sipping Campari and watching British spies fighting sharks with laser-gun-equipped Rolex watches.

The Hutchinson offense marched 68 yards on seven running plays that resulted in a touchdown.\nThat's the formula that Hutchinson has used all season. The Salthawks' offense has run over the opposition with a combination of power runs inside by junior fullback Josh Smith while junior Deveon Dinwiddie, and seniors Shadrach Caudillo and Todd Schultz work the ball around the outside. That combination has equated to a school record 5,292 yards rushing and 75 touchdowns.\nDefensively, the Salthawks lock down team's running game and pressure the quarterback to come up with sacks or interceptions. It worked again today as Aquinas managed just 106 yards of total offense. Hutchinson forced four interceptions and four sacks.\n\"That's what Salthawk football is. We come prepared and we play physical,\" senior defensive lineman Forrest Stucky said.\nFacing a Saints team playing in its first state championship game, the Salthawks slugged away offensively with Smith. The 5-foot-9, 201-pounder had his best game, running for a season-best 257 yards on 39 carries and three touchdowns. Smith ended the season with a school record 1,958 yards and 34 touchdowns.\n\"I think we really did hammer on them,\" Smith said. \"Those first couple drives, we came out and we wanted to pound the ball away. We went hurry up and I think that really wore them down.\"\nAs the game wore on, Hutchinson's 11-minute edge in time of possession began to show.\n\"You could feel that they were wearing down later on in the game,\" senior center Brad Lambertus said. \"It just builds you up inside with so much confidence and that kept growing because we were getting it done up front.\"\nHutchinson's offense got a pleasant surprise as Schultz rushed for a season-best 137 yards on 15 carries with a touchdown. All that on a high ankle sprain that Schultz admitted was still hurting at times.\nSchultz went 29 yards on his first carry, 20 on this second to provide the long runs early while Smith chipped away on the inside. Schultz set up Hutchinson's final touchdown of the first half with a 36-yard run, his longest of the day.\n\"Todd Schultz just played unbelievable,\" offensive coordinator Dustin Delaney said. \"He had a high ankle sprain coming in and the kid's a warrior. He played through it and he led our team today.\"\nIn the fourth quarter, Schultz found the end zone with a 33-yard touchdown run to cap his best performance of the season. It also ended a season in which Schultz's decisions while running Hutchinson's triple option resulted in numerous long runs for Smith inside and Dinwiddie or Caudillo around the outside.\n\"Our quarterbacks have a big, big load. They process a lot of information in a short amount of time,\" Delaney said. \"We work on them with training them from the time we get them as freshmen. Sometimes, they do it wrong.

This beer denotes an earthy, grassy aroma and I can taste a hint of lemon flavor. Fun fact: Zwickelbier is named for the sampling device used for retrieving fresh beer from a cellar tank.\nOcean Beach's Belching Beaver (Fall of Troy): Referred to as a milkshake style, this double IPA is sweet, creamy and perfectly citrusy: the adult version of a creamsicle. The hops flavor comes through as an aftertaste.\nOcean Beach's Mike Hess Brewing (Ficus fig saison): This dark fig saison is brewed with organic, locally grown brown turtle figs (10 pounds per barrel). It was light bodied, sweet and creamy. This was a dark beer easy to fall in love with and packs a punch at 9 percent alcohol by volume.\nOB Brewery (B. Right On): We're both excited to see the award-winning beer offered today. It's light, crisp and hoppy. It's a simple lager but it's got a uniqueness to it, maybe the malts with a slight bitterness from the hops.\nOcean Beach's Pizza Port Brewing (Chronic Ale): I thought this amber ale was very light, almost airy; crisp and malty, with a lightly bitter aftertaste. I asked about the beer's name and the beertender tells me it's brewed with hemp seeds!\nOcean Beach's Kilowatt (Festbier): There seems to be a pattern here because this was another light, crisp fruity beer!

Is it still the government's place to support it?\nDONOVAN: Absolutely, it remains a dream for a huge number of Americans, and it's one we ought to help Americans achieve. But for too long, the country was too focused on getting people into homes, not sustaining them in homes. So what has to be our goal is sustainable homeownership.\nWe also need a balanced housing policy. For too long, we have focused on homeownership to the exclusion of rental housing. This isn't an either/or proposition. The real issue is, how do we create a ladder of housing opportunity, where each of the rungs along the way is solid and isn't going to fall out from under somebody as they step up that ladder?\nCan we have a sustainable market if the government is propping it up by guaranteeing home loans?\nDONOVAN: Look at what [the Federal Housing Administration] has done. When [the Obama administration] came in, it seemed every month there was another editorial in The Wall Street Journal or someplace saying FHA was going to be the next big bailout. And yet, FHA's been able to continue to [pursue] its mission of reaching low- and moderate-income buyers, including large majorities of African-American and Latino homebuyers. It's an explicit guarantee; it's fully priced at the time we make loans \u2014 with projected losses \u2014 and, in fact, since we came into office, we've outperformed the projections our independent actuaries had for how our revenues and our expenses and our losses would perform. I think we've done a lot to reform FHA and show how a government guarantee can be effective.\nIn the wake of the crash, is housing still a smart gateway to the middle class? Or should we be steering people to other investments?\nShould we go back to where we were three years ago? Absolutely not. Does that mean that homeownership is going to be more expensive? Yes. Does that mean that there are going to be some folks who were able to buy homes three years ago that won't be able to? Yes. But that doesn't mean that homeownership doesn't provide the fundamental bedrock of access to the middle class that it did for generations.\nThe author is economics correspondent for National Journal."}

That means the fantasy football playoffs are coming quicker than anyone would like to admit, so you should keep poring over the waiver wire to address needs in your lineup.\nFrom a fantasy perspective, Trubisky is one of the hottest quarterbacks in the NFL. The 24-year-old followed up his 354-yard, six-touchdown performance in Week 4 with 316 yards and three more touchdowns in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Miami Dolphins. He did throw one interception, his fourth of the season.\nTrubisky also is a sneaky-good runner, adding 53 rushing yards in Week 4 and another 47 yards Sunday afternoon. He has a favorable matchup in Week 7 against a New England Patriots defense that just allowed 352 passing yards and four touchdowns to Patrick Mahomes.\nYeah, the wire is thin.\nHear us out on Mack, though: The second-year back entered the 2018 season with the expectation that he\u2019d be Indy\u2019s bell-cow, but has been a fantasy afterthought after missing three straight games with a hamstring injury. He looked good in his return Sunday, however, rushing for 89 yards on 12 carries in a loss to the New York Jets.\nAside from injuries, the only knock on Mack is he doesn\u2019t factor much into Indianapolis\u2019 passing game. Still, if he can stay healthy, Mack could provide FLEX or possibly RB2 numbers moving forward.\nSometimes claiming fantasy wideouts is all about catching lightning in a bottle, and Gabriel certainly fits that bill. The speedy receiver has become the big-play threat in the Bears\u2019 offense, racking up 104 yards and 110 yards in his last two games, respectively. He also has caught at least five balls in four of five games this season, and gets the occasional carry out of the backfield, as well.\nHis touchdown totals aren\u2019t great (only two through five games), but Gabriel should be a consistent WR3, at worst, for the rest of the season.\nSpeaking of thin: How about fantasy tight ends this season? Woof!\nOptions are few and far between on the waiver wire, but Uzomah might be the best of the bunch. Tyler Eifert is done for the season after undergoing ankle surgery, and backup tight end Tyler Kroft reportedly could be headed for surgery to repair a fractured bone in his right foot. That leaves Uzomah to carry the load at tight end in the Bengals\u2019 offense, which has been solid so far this season.\nThe Auburn product caught two balls for 43 yards last week, and followed up that performance with six catches for 54 yards in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Rick Snyder released an energy and environmental policy blueprint.\nIt calls for increasing production of natural gas in Michigan while making no further commitment to requiring the state to rely more on renewable power sources in the coming years.\nThe Republican governor told The Associated Press that natural gas plays a central role in an energy policy that seeks greater efficiency and improvements to infrastructure such as pipelines and the electric transmission grid. It proposes establishing a \"strategic natural gas reserve\" designed to make the resource more affordable and defends the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" to extract gas from deep underground. Many environmentalists oppose fracking, which requires huge amounts of chemicals to be pumped into the ground, contending it pollutes groundwater.\n\"I am committed to ensuring that Michigan can take advantage of the reliability, affordability and environmental and economic benefits of natural gas, and that the rest of the country can benefit from our resources in that area as well,\" he said in a special message to legislators given in advance to the AP. He was scheduled to present his plan Wednesday at Kellogg Biological Station in Hickory Corners, about 40 miles southeast of Grand Rapids.\nSnyder previously has used special messages to discuss plans and goals in areas including health and wellness, public safety and education.\nMichigan voters this month rejected a ballot initiative that would have ordered the state's electric utilities to produce 25 percent of their power from renewable sources \ufffd solar, wind, biomass or hydropower \ufffd by 2025. Supporters described it as an improvement on an existing law, under which at least 10 percent of the state's electricity must be generated from alternative sources by 2015. Snyder's plan says it's too early to decide whether a stronger standard is justified, partly because of uncertainty about how federal policies will affect electricity reliability and markets.\nHe said his administration will ask lawmakers and the public for suggestions and spend the next two years studying the matter.\n\"Renewables are an important part of our energy portfolio, and we should increase our use of them,\" Snyder told the AP in a phone interview. \"The real question is at what pace should that happen.\"\nIn the meantime, he said, Michigan should press ahead with development of natural gas, which it has in abundance. He said he would fight a proposal before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to abandon a pipeline that supplies one-third of the state's natural gas.\n\"We need timelines that will let us look seriously at transitioning existing plants to this fuel, a commitment to pipeline infrastructure and a stable, environmentally protective set of regulations that allow companies to create a business plan built around new natural gas supplies,\" he said. \"Michigan has done what it can in leading the way on this issue. We will do whatever we can to help our federal partners develop and implement a consistent strategy in short order.\"\nSnyder said he had instructed the Department of Natural Resources and the Public Service Commission to work with private industry on development of the natural gas reserve.\nPresently, when Michigan leases rights to drill for gas on public land, it takes immediate payments in cash from production companies. But under the reserve initiative, the state would keep some of the gas in storage and sell it under long-term contracts that could help keep winter heating prices down.\nThe governor's plan also envisions a continued role for coal-based energy, even as the Obama administration has imposed regulations on coal-fired plants that limit their emissions of mercury and heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming.

Remember that old saying, \"Don't nickel-and-dime me?\" The inference was that nickels and dimes are peanuts in the big picture.\nHowever, coinage is quite meaningful when considering all of the daily transactions in retail establishments. May I suggest that the U.S. government begin to implement a round-up strategy in which any \"change\" in the form of coins be converted into a tax? In that way, there will be huge savings at the retail level as coins would no longer be necessary, consumers won't have to cart around coins in their pockets and the rising value of copper and nickel will allow the government to recoup spending on these metals that can better be used in the private sector.\nInflation has made the value of a penny minuscule, as is the value of a nickel. To protect a high tax on low-cost transactions, I suggest that people buy more than one of something that sells for less than a dollar. Or the tax on any transactions under $5 could be waived.\nThis is an easy tax to collect, not as burdensome as some suggested tax increases, and it can add up to a bundle. Since 45 percent of people in the U.S. don't pay federal income taxes, maybe this \"nickel-and-dime\" tax would be fairer to us all and keep the federal government from declaring bankruptcy."}

{"idx": "6246", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: 3-D printing technology, used industrially for the last few decades, is poised to break into the mass market. Its endless and swiftly developing possibilities -- from entrepreneurial manufacturing to the potential sculpting of human organs -- could become the next industrial revolution.\nWhen the TV series Star Trek first brought the starship Enterprise into German living rooms, the concept of a replicator was pure science fiction, a fantastical utopian vision we might experience one day centuries in the future. Replicators, something of a mixture between computer and miniature factory, were capable of creating food and replacement parts from next to nothing. They were highly practical devices, since Captain Kirk couldn't exactly take along a lot of supplies for his journeys through outer space. That futuristic vision, though, has receded far into the past -- overtaken by the present.\nThe real-world replicator-like technology poised to revolutionize the world is known as 3-D printing, though that term is misleading, since the process has little to do with printing. Three-dimensional printers can be as small as a suitcase or as large as a telephone booth, depending on the object they are meant to faithfully replicate from a 3-D computer blueprint. Inside the machine, the product is assembled by stacking extremely thin layers of material on top of one another, sort of like reassembling an apple that has been cut into super-fine slices.\nMany different technological routes can be taken to reach the same goal. In one variation, nozzles spray liquid material into layers. Another method, which produces even better results, aims laser beams at finely powdered material, causing the grains to fuse together at precisely the spot where the beam hits. All 3-D printing techniques, however, follow the same principle: The object grows layer by layer, each one just a few hundredths of a millimeter thick, until it acquires the desired shape. This technique can be applied to steel, plastic, titanium, aluminum and many other metals.\nAssembling, screwing together, adhering, welding -- all these processes are rendered obsolete when even the most complex shapes can be produced by a single machine using this casting technique. The end result can be an artificial hip, a hearing aid, a cell phone case, customized footwear or even the Urbee, a prototype car that has been making a splash.\nEngineers at the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) have used this technique to print out an entire bicycle that only needs added tires and a chain to be fully functional. British researchers, meanwhile, have printed a maneuverable drone with a rear-engine drive. Printed components are also used in Formula 1 racing and at NASA. Dental laboratories use 3-D printers to produce crowns, while doctors experiment with artificial heart tissue. Filmmakers also print animation models and automotive parts suppliers create replacement parts.\nThe printing of electronic components is even in the works. American corporation Xerox, for example, has developed a silver ink that functions as an electrical conductor and can be printed directly onto plastic or other materials, making it possible to integrate simple circuits into printed objects.\nGiven the potentially vast global impact of this new technology, it's surprising that so far only around two dozen companies dominate the market. Along with US giants 3-D Systems and Stratasys, about 10 German companies provide this technology, some of them market leaders in their respective segments, for example Eos and Concept Laser, both in the southern state of Bavaria.\nSome of these German 3-D"}

{"idx": "6249", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The boom, bust, and rebirth of the former silver mining camp of Calico, located northeast of Barstow, is one of the most fascinating chapters in California\u2019s frontier history.\nThe chapter begins in the rugged outcroppings of multi-hued rock known as the Calico Mountains that rise some 2,500 feet from the desert floor. This small range is painted with a colorful patchwork of minerals that cover the mountains like a vast rocky quilt.\nIn 1880, experienced mine operators Robert W. Waterman and John L. Porter relocated a lost silver claim in the Calico Mountains, about 9 miles west of the present-day site of Calico. The men expanded their claims and built a successful operation that became known as the Waterman Mining District.\nThe Waterman Mines shipped their ore down to a tiny settlement on the Mojave River that was originally called Grapevine, and later became known as Waterman Junction. That settlement eventually became part of the thriving railroad town of Barstow.\nRobert W. Waterman gained fame and fortune with his mining and land investments, and he went on to become governor of California from 1887 to 1891.\nIronically, it was a man named Lowery Silver who staked the first claim near the future town site of Calico in early 1881. As his claim became more successful, it attracted the usual assemblage of gritty prospectors, barkeeps, scalawags, prostitutes, and eventually, a semblance of civilization.\nA firsthand account written by a Daggett resident named Frank Mecham in the 1930s, provides the most authoritative version of the first major strike at Calico, and the beginning of Southern California\u2019s greatest silver bonanza.\nAccording to Mecham\u2019s account, he went to San Bernardino to muster up some help locating a ledge of promising red ore that his father had discovered in the Calico Mountains several years before. Mecham joined up with his uncle George Yager, Hues Thomas, and Tom Warden, and they set out for the Calico Mountains. The group was grubstaked and provisioned by San Bernardino County Sheriff John King in return for a share of any successful claim.\nThe four prospectors located the ledge and staked out several claims that eventually became the famous \u201cSilver King Mine\u201d (named after Sheriff John King).\nThe bustling little town of Calico sprang up between the mines, stretching out across a narrow, sloping plateau. A single main street supported most of the town\u2019s buildings, but shacks and mining structures dotted the surrounding hillsides.\nIn spite of the fanciful tales describing the naming of the town, it\u2019s likely that the Calico name simply came from the multicolored rocks of the area. The fitting description stuck, and was later applied to the town.\nIn July 1882, there were around 500 people in the newly formed Calico Mining District, and there were seven saloons to serve them. The Calico Stage Line ran daily, delivering a steady stream of newcomers who could stay at one of the towns six boarding houses and hotels.\nThe year 1885 was a banner one for the Calico District, which saw a population peak of around 3,500. A town hall was built, and a fine one-room school house was constructed on a high knoll at the north end of town.\nEstimates of the overall silver production in the Calico District range as high"}

W. Ayer formally announced that they would move into a new building at 49th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.\nThese relocations westward follow the southward shift of several large agencies, which began about five years ago.\nOnly two of the nation's 16 largest agencies, Young & Rubicam and DDB Needham, remain on Madison Avenue. Fewer than half are based east of Fifth Avenue.\nAdvertising agencies are moving largely to escape the East Side's high rents at a time of slow advertising growth and declining agency profit margins. But some also say they are looking to join a new ''communications center'' developing in New York City.\nA tally by Ogilvy & Mather indicates that ad agencies also fill 750,000 square feet of office space in lower Manhattan and 300,000 square feet between 20th Street and 35th Street, two other areas that have seen a wave of agency migrations in recent years.\nThe phrase ''Madison Avenue'' was first used to define advertising around 1923, and by the late 1920's it was both a prevalent and geographically accurate term, according to ''Advertising the American Dream,'' by Roland Marchand, a historian at the University of California at Davis.\nBy the 1950's, Madison Avenue and advertising were so intertwined that when the Erwin Wasey agency moved from Madison to Third Avenue, ''it was considered a daring move, a landmark,'' recalled Carl Spielvogel, the chairman of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide.\nLeaps west of Fifth Avenue by an adventurous few agencies took their toll on employee and client relations. When Ted Bates Worldwide, one of Backer Spielvogel Bates's predecessor agencies, moved to the site of the old Astor Hotel on Broadway and 44th Street about 20 years ago, ''they suffered,'' Mr. Spielvogel said. N. W. Ayer moved to Sixth Avenue in 1969 and ''no one wanted to work there,'' recalled Louis T. Hagopian, the chairman of Ayer.\nBut during the last five years, growth in advertising spending has slowed to less than 7 percent a year from more than 15 percent, said Veronis, Suhler & Associates. The resulting squeeze on agencies has hastened an exodus from Manhattan's East Side, where rents tend to average more than $40 a square foot, advertising executives and real estate people say.\nThe annual rent of Ogilvy at its site at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street is $42 a square foot. At its new headquarters, Worldwide Plaza, which stands on the site of the old Madison Square Garden, its rent will be $32 a square foot.\nAlthough Ayer is moving to Worldwide Plaza from its West Side headquarters, it is also relocating people from the Madison Avenue office of Cunningham & Walsh, an agency purchased by Ayer in 1987.\nHigh rents also prompted last year's move by Saatchi & Saatchi Advert"}

His outspoken advocacy for the music of his time earned him fans \u2014 and detractors. He died Tuesday at his home in Baden-Baden, Germany. He was 90 years old.\nJust as the chaos of World War II was coming to an end, Pierre Boulez was emerging into his life as an artist.\n\"At the beginning of the war, I was 14, and at the end of the war, I was 20. That's the main development years you have, when you forge yourself,\" Boulez said in a 2005 interview with WHYY's Fresh Air.\nWhat Boulez wanted to forge was not just his own creative identity: He wanted to liberate the sound of European music entirely.\n\"Between 1945 and now, I think I tried through a certain discipline, to find freedom,\" he said.\nAfter the war, Boulez worked with theater directors, poets and other young artists who wanted to overthrow the status quo. In his own music, he drew upon the energy and inspiration of all of those art forms, along with music from around the world.\nIn the late 1970s, he founded IRCAM, an institution dedicated to exploring all of the possibilities of contemporary music.\nAmong the first composers to work at IRCAM was American Tod Machover. He says that Boulez had gifts beyond music.\n\"He was incredibly charming \u2014 the kind of person who could have a conversation with just about anybody. He was a very political person,\" Machover adds. \"He knew how to speak to Georges Pompidou. He knew how to speak to the richest of patrons.\"\nOver time, Boulez became part of the establishment \u2014 or, maybe more correctly, the establishment embraced him and his ideas. He was invited to conduct major orchestras around the world. As music director of the New York Philharmonic, he had audiences sitting on rugs on the floor, decades before classical musicians started playing in bars. And along the way, he won 26 Grammys.\nBoulez was a singular figure, says conductor David Robertson, who led Boulez's group, the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Now, Robertson is the music director of the St. Louis Symphony.\n\"There was an incredible, exacting intellect, but it was combined with a marvelous sense of humor, and enormous practicality, and really a sense of comradeship and friendship that was unique,\" Robertson says. \"I've never met anyone like him.\"\nBut Boulez could be quite a firebrand, too. His polemics became infamous. And even in his later years, he did not mince his words.\n\"You must not really think of reaching an audience.

Crohn, a leading gastroenterologist whose work greatly advanced the understanding of ileitis -also known as Crohn's disease - died yesterday at the New Milford (Conn.) Hospital. He was 99 years old and lived in New Milford and Manhattan.\nFor most of his professional life, Dr. Crohn was associated with the Mount Sinai Medical Center. It was there, with two associates, that in 1932 he produced a report hailed as a major advance in the identification and definition of ileitis, an inflammation of the intestinal tract.\nJoining in the preparation and writing of the report were Dr. Leon Ginzburg and Dr. Gordon Oppenheimer. The work by Dr. Crohn and his associates, ''Regional Ileitis: A Pathological and Clinical Entity,'' provided the name Crohn's disease to an ailment that was once mistakenly thought to be a form of tuberculosis rather than an inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract.\nDr. Crohn joined Mount Sinai as an intern in 1907 and in 1920 was named the first head of the department of gastroenterology there. He was also named a consultant in gastroenterology at Columbia University in 1946, after having been on the staff there since 1920. A consultant in gastroenterology at Mount Sinai since 1945, he was named consultant emeritus last year. He retired from private practice several years ago.\nBecause of his eminence in the field, Dr. Crohn was widely consulted by the press when President Dwight D. Eisenhower was stricken with ileitis in 1956. Although not a member of the surgical team that attended the President, Dr. Crohn sought to assure the public that the President should recover without difficulty.\nDr. Crohn was born in Manhattan on June 13, 1884. He received a B.A. degree from the City College of New York in 1902 and his medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1907.\nAsked recently by an interviewer why he had chosen medicine as a career, he replied: ''Originally, because my father had terrible indigestion. I decided to help him by studying medicine.'' Among Dr. Crohn's other interests were painting and Civil War history. He was a member of the Housatonic Art League in Connecticut, and his watercolors were shown frequently at New Milford galleries.\nDr. Crohn, a self-described ''great admirer'' of Abraham Lincoln, said he believed that the 1860's represented a watershed in American history, when the nation was tested and found worthy of its ideals.\nDr. Crohn lectured and attended medical conferences around the world. He was among those who felt that the name Crohn's disease was inappropriate despite its almost universal use. His own preferences were for regional ileitis, regional enteritis or cicatrizing enterocolitis.\nHe related once how he had opposed at a conference in Prague a resolution officially designating ileitis as Crohn's disease. But when he rose to voice his objection, he was ruled out of order and the resolution was otherwise adopted unanimously.\nDr. Crohn was awarded the Townsend Harris Medal by City College in 1948, the Julius Friedenthal Medal of the American Gastroenterological Association, of which he was a past president"}

Stephenson\u2019s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation.\nThe ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe.\nAnd for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson\u2019s time. Now at last Network Rail is looking at mechanising track renewals and working hard at new signalling systems that can deliver 40 per cent more capacity on the same track.\nOthers, meanwhile, are rethinking the whole principle of fast inter-city travel. Plans to build a hyperloop between Abu Dhabi and Dubai raise the prospect that a great transport revolution could have the same transformative impact as the Rocket did nearly 200 years ago.\nThe hyperloop is the brainchild of Elon Musk, the man behind PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX, who has always been fascinated by space and time as only a Silicon Valley billionaire can afford to be.\nIt offers connectivity on a scale previously only seen in science fiction. It encapsulates the idea of travel at aircraft speeds but in rail-like conditions.\nEssentially, passengers would travel in pods inside tubes from which air is extracted, creating a near vacuum in front of the pod.\nThose of us old enough to remember how your grocery bill was sent from counter to till by just the same method will recognise that this is actually not new, albeit now imagined on a massively different scale.\nThe UAE is already a global hub for business and is fast becoming a real leader in transport innovation. A hyperloop between Abu Dhabi and Dubai will see journey times between the two cut from 120 minutes to 12. Geography will cease to be a barrier for employment, business growth, and culture.\nWould a hyperloop work in this country? There is certainly no fundamental reason why not.\nOne of its attractions is that it is significantly less expensive than conventional rail infrastructure. It could connect Gatwick and Heathrow so that they operated as one super-hub airport. It could link London to Glasgow faster than HS2. It could unlock the Northern Powerhouse.\nConnectivity is the key to addressing income inequality.\nToday\u2019s stark reality is that London is a fortress: one from which those who live within dare not escape \u2013 because the day they sell their two bedroom flat in Hackney for a five bedroom house in Newcastle is the day they will never be able to afford to buy it back \u2013 and that those who might see job opportunities in the capital simply cannot afford to access.\nAlready we see the capital\u2019s travel-to work-area stretching to Brighton, Bournemouth, Ipswich, Bristol, Birmingham, and even Newark, more than 100 miles away to the north.\nThat journey currently takes 80 minutes each way. Imagine if it took 20. It would not only spread wealth more evenly across the whole country \u2013 it would solve our housing crisis at a stroke. This is what hyperloop-enabled reality looks like.\nAs the old song said, people laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round.

The series of town halls followed extensive reporting on the troubling state of youth mental health in the state, reporting that has involved all 10 USA TODAY NETWORK newspaper sites in Wisconsin.\nThe third and final chapter of the Kids in Crisis series begins March 20 and will incorporate feedback collected from the town halls.\nLori Hilt, an assistant professor of psychology at Lawrence University and one of Thursday's panel members, said parents can also advocate by seeing what their children's schools have available.\nSome schools participate in the 10-minute computer-based \"connected community wellness screens\" for mental illness, she said.\nHilt said parents can ask their children's school about getting the screening done, and let other parents know about it.\n\"Spread that knowledge throughout our community. We want to reach everyone,\" she said.\nMore than parents can play a role in our kids' mental health, though. The panelists urged community members at large to look into initiatives like QPR (\"Question, Persuade, Refer\") suicide prevention training and Youth Mental Health First Aid.\nA hallmark of QPR is teaching people how to ask the \"suicide question,\" asking someone if they are thinking of killing themselves, despite how uncomfortable it feels.\n\"Giving educators, giving fellow students the tools to be able to ask those questions I think can go a long way,\" Hilt said.\nIf nothing else, just be kind and compassionate, said Elizabeth Hudson, head of the Wisconsin Office of Children's Mental Health. She said to think not about what's wrong with a parent or child who is struggling in a grocery store, but what has happened to them that day or in their life. Rather than look at them with disdain, ask how you can be supportive.\nThe panelists agreed stigma is a huge barrier to kids getting the mental health care or prevention services they need.\n\"Stigma prevents so many individuals from reaching out to those care and prevention services,\" said Casey Hanson, a clinical psychologist with Catalpa Health. \"Be kind and spread that understanding of the needs of all in our community.\"\nOne parent in attendance reported her child was told to simply \"snap out\" of their mental illness.\n\"We would never say, 'Snap out of it' to a child who has some other kind of a disability,\" Davis said. \"If a child needed to use a wheelchair, we would never say, 'Well, if you really wanted to, you could walk.'\"\nTo see a replay of Thursday's Kids in Crisis"}

The study documents a novel use of tools by chimps to dig for tubers and roots in the savanna woodlands of western Tanzania.\nThe chimps\u2019 eagerness for buried treats offers new insights in an ongoing debate about the role of meat versus potato-like foods in the diet of our hominid ancestors, said first author Adriana Hernandez-Aguilar, who collected the field data for her doctoral research at the University of Southern California.\nThe debate centers on the diet followed by early hominids as their brain and body size slowly increased towards a human level. Was it meat-and-potatoes, or potatoes-and-meat?\n\u201cSome researchers have suggested that what made us human was actually the tubers,\u201d Hernandez-Aguilar said.\nAnthropologists had speculated that roots and tubers were mere fallback foods for hominids trying to survive the harsh dry season in the savanna 3.5 million years ago and later (hominids are known to have consumed meat at least as early as 2.5 million years ago).\nBut the study found that modern chimps only dig for roots during the rainy season, when other food sources abound.\nThe finding suggests, but does not prove, that hominids behaved the same way. Researchers view modern chimps as proxies for hominids because of similarities in habitat, brain mass and body size.\n\u201cWe look at chimps for the way that we could have behaved when our ancestors were chimp-like,\u201d Hernandez-Aguilar said.\nThe tuber-digging chimps \u201csuggest that underground resources were within reach of our ancestors,\u201d added co-author James Moore of the University of California at San Diego.\nThe study was based on observation of 11 digging sites in the Ugalla savanna woodland of western Tanzania.\nChimpanzees were linked to the excavated tubers and roots through knuckle prints, feces, and spit-out wads of fibers from those underground foods.\nSeven tools were found at three of the sites, with worn edges and dirt marking implying their use as digging implements.\nBecause chimpanzees in the area are not habituated to humans, Hernandez-Aguilar was unable to observe them directly. She plans to conduct further observations in the area and to advocate for greater protection for the savanna chimps.\n\u201cChimpanzees in savannas have not been considered a priority in conservation plans because they live in low densities compared to chimps in forests,\u201d she said.\nHernandez-Aguilar conducted her thesis work under Craig Stanford, professor of anthropology at USC.\nThe research was funded by the LSB Leakey Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Jane Goodall Center at the University of Southern California, the University of California Committee on Research, the Palaeontology Scientific Trust and the Ugalla Primate Lab from UCSD.

Many in the museum world and beyond have argued that the higher profiles, larger audiences and advanced security systems at some institutions make them more appropriate places to house cherished artifacts and ensure they are available for worldwide study and appreciation.\nThe Met has previously returned a Khmer item, a 10th-century Shiva head that was given to Mr. Im\u2019s agency in 1997 at the urging of Martin Lerner, the Met\u2019s Southeast Asian curator at the time.\nAnne LeMaistre, the Unesco representative in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u2019s capital, said her agency is assembling a report laying out evidence that the Met statues and the Sotheby\u2019s warrior belonged to a 12-statue Khmer empire grouping first broken up when Cambodia was destabilized by civil war.\nThe Met, which was given the statues by benefactors in four pieces between 1987 and 1992, said it has not been contacted by Cambodia and has no information to suggest the works were stolen. The museum acknowledged that beyond the names of the donors it has no records on the statues\u2019 origins, despite a longstanding policy to investigate the history of donated antiquities.\nThe Met\u2019s policy in 1992 allowed it to accept works without a detailed provenance. Such acceptance, though, was supposed to come after an effort had been made to root out the history of a piece in case it was illicit. In recent years, as countries have increasingly sought to protect their cultural heritage, the Met and other museums have adopted a stricter policy. It discourages the acceptance of antiquities like the Kneeling Attendants if they lack a documented history showing they left their country of origin before 1970.\nIn the wake of the Sotheby\u2019s case Cambodian officials have formed a task force to return artifacts removed from their country and possibly held by American and other foreign museums.\nMr. Lerner, who was the Met\u2019s Southeast Asian curator from 1972 to 2004, said he could not recall what was done to research the provenance of the attendant statues.

The ruling by Judge Douglas Smith allowed an indictment of six people arrested in a police raid of a dispensary to stand.\n\u201cWe have one district court saying that medicinal marijuana is unconstitutional.

Mosley also dismissed drug trafficking and other charges against two people \u2014 Leonard Schwingdorf and Nathan Hamilton.\nSchwingdorf and Hamilton operated Sin City Co-op, where those with state-issued medical cards believed they could legally buy marijuana to ease pain related to their ailments, much the same way they would go to a pharmacy. Their co-op was among several shut down last year by a Metro Police task force working with the Clark County District Attorney\u2019s office.\nAlthough Nevada voters changed the state\u2019s constitution in 2000 to allow people who need marijuana for medicinal purposes to possess seeds and grow their own plants and to possess marijuana, the law allows no legal way for them to buy the seeds or to purchase marijuana if they can\u2019t grow it themselves. The dispensaries were similar to some in California, where medical marijuana has gained wider acceptance.\nThe co-op organizers accepted donations to provide members with marijuana. However, prosecutors say the donation constituted a sale, which violates state and federal laws.\nTurco and Draskovich said Mosley\u2019s order conflicts with Smith's ruling, which they have appealed to the Supreme Court. In that case, Smith allowed an indictment to stand against six people arrested in a police raid of a dispensary called Jolly Green Meds, and also hinted at the difficulty he had reaching a decision following oral arguments Sept. 16.\nThe state's medical marijuana laws aren't too vague to allow charges to stand against six people arrested in a police raid of the Jolly Green Meds dispensary last November, Smith said.

Previous negotiations have included difficult junctures, but this time the US is considering the imposition of tariffs worth billions of dollars, and the Japanese are promising to drag the US before the World Trade Organization for arbitration.\nPresident Clinton is expected to announce how the US will react to the breakdown in the negotiations this week. There are reports that the Americans may institute nontariff trade barriers, such as limits on the expansion of Japanese car dealerships in the US, suggesting that Washington may be striking a Japanese approach in its dealings with Tokyo.\nThe official's comments indicate frustrations that have resulted from US efforts to open markets here. Japan had a $130 billion trade surplus with the rest of the world last year. Its surplus with the US was $66 billion, of which 60 percent was in the automobile and auto-parts industries.\nWith rare exceptions, bilateral trade deals have been characterized by vague Japanese promises to deregulate parts of their economy or otherwise make it easier for foreign companies to do business here. The Clinton administration came into office vowing to negotiate more concrete deals that would boost the US economy by expanding exports to Japan. The Japanese vigorously criticized US negotiators for attempting to ''manage'' trade, accusing the US of demanding quotas of improved foreign sales in Japan.\nOver the past year, the US has appeared to backtrack from its get-tough approach, settling in some agreements for ''significant increases'' in foreign access to Japan's markets.\nBut in this round of talks, the US is insisting that Japanese carmakers renew a ''voluntary plan'' to forecast their purchases of US-made auto-parts. The US views the plan, initiated under President Bush in 1992, as an effective device, since Japanese automakers fulfilled their goals and last year purchased some $20 billion worth of US-made parts.\nThe repudiation of government ''intervention'' in the economy by a Japanese bureaucrat might ring a little false to longtime observers of Japan. Tokyo's economic bureaucracies are now encouraging other Asian governments to mimic their tight control of industry and official guidance of development.\nThe two sides are also discussing changes that would make it easier for foreign producers to gain access to car dealerships in Japan and to sell replacement parts, such as new mufflers or alternators. Japanese negotiators have said agreement might have been possible on those fronts had the US not insisted that a voluntary plan accompany the deal.\nYesterday, the top executives of Japan's leading automakers supported their government's position, saying the US was in no position to make demands of foreign companies."}

{"idx": "6289", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Originally published under the title \"Do we worship the same God? Wheaton College, Larycia Hawkins and Miroslav Volf.\"\nThe recent suspension of Larycia Hawkins by Wheaton College is a symptom of a fault line among evangelicals about Islam. The question of whether the God of the Qur'an is the same as the God of the Bible is an important and complex one, but it is unhelpful to politicize inquiry into it by insisting that anyone who disagrees with one position or another is a bigot.\nThose who claim that Muslims and Christians do not worship the same God base this upon Muslims' denial of the Trinity and the incarnation.\nJews deny the Trinity and the incarnation, yet Christians down the ages have not claimed that Jews worship a different God.\nTherefore, those who do not accept the \"same God\" thesis must be motivated by enmity, not reason.\nThere are problems with this reasoning. One is the premise. Wheaton had not itself stated that it objects to the \"same God\" thesis on the basis of Muslims' beliefs about the Trinity and the incarnation. However Volf appears to impute this thinking to all Christians who do not accept his \"same God\" thesis.\nThe Qur'an projects an understanding of God very different from that of the Bible.\nAnother is the leap from pointing out a supposed inconsistency in the reasoning of other Christians to making a severe value judgment about their motives.\nIn reality the best and strongest reason for rejecting the \"same God\" thesis is not Muslims' disbelief in the Trinity or the incarnation. It is that the Qur'an projects a different understanding of God from the Bible. As Denny Burk of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville put it, \"our books are very different.\"\nThe theological differences involved are subtler and more fundamental than ticking or not ticking the Trinity box.\nEminent Orthodox Jewish theologian Michael Wyschogrod observed that the Christian doctrine of the incarnation was grounded upon the fundamentally Biblical \u2013 and thoroughly Jewish \u2013 concept of the indwelling of God's Shekinah presence with his people. Christian beliefs about the Trinity and the incarnation developed out of Jewish incarnational theologies.\nUnlike the Old Testament, the Qur'an completely lacks a theology of the presence of God. Although the Arabic term sak\u012bnah \u2013 borrowed from Hebrew shekinah \u2013 appears six times in the Qur'an, it has been repurposed to mean 'tranquility', and the concept of the personal presence of God is not comprehended by Quranic theology. It is not just that Islam rejects the incarnation of Jesus: in complete contrast to Judaism its scripture offers no basis for an incarnational theology.\nJudaism differs from Islam in its organic relationship to Christianity in two key respects.\nChristians and Jews share scripture. Islam rejects the authority of the Bible.\nFirst, Christians and Jews share scripture. Judaism bases its understanding of God on what was the Bible of Jesus, the Tanakh or Old Testament. This is not the case with Islam. Muslims do not base their theology on any part of the Bible. Indeed mainstream Islam rejects the authority of the Bible, for reasons clearly stated in the Qur'an.\nSecond, Jesus was a practicing Jew, and so were his disciples, so it would be absurd to state that the God of the faith Jesus practiced is different from the Christian God. This same observation does not apply to Islam."}

Following is a rundown of the top minor league players to watch heading into the offseason as Colorado begins to prepare for next season.\nThe Isotopes featured a handful of players who are likely to challenge for big-league roster spots next spring. Most notably, top prospect Brendan Rodgers (.268, 17 home runs for the Yard Goats and Isotopes this season) will figure to compete with Garrett Hampson for a potentially vacant second base job.\nAlso, right-hander Peter Lambert (3.28 ERA in 26 starts across Double-A and Triple-A) could be in the mix for a rotation spot. Also, keep an eye on right-hander Jairo D\u00edaz, first baseman/outfielder Jordan Patterson and third baseman Josh Fuentes (2018 Pacific Coast League MVP).\nThe Yard Goats feature a number of players likely to start in Triple-A in 2019. Right-handers Ryan Castellani and Jesus Tinoco as well as southpaw Mitch Horacek are among the club\u2019s seven representatives on the Salt River Rafters in the Arizona Fall League.\nSo is outfielder Sam Hilliard, a left-handed hitter with raw power. Outfielder Yonathan Daza (who led the Yard Goats with a .306 average) is also one to watch even though his season was cut short in late July after he suffered a shoulder injury.\nRight-handed sidearmer Justin Lawrence is playing in the Arizona Fall League, as are corner infielders Tyler Nevin (who took Rodgers\u2019 spot on the team due to the shortstop\u2019s shoulder tightness) and Colton Welker. Nevin hit .328 with 13 home runs and 62 RBIs for the Jethawks, while Welker posted slightly more impressive numbers with .333/13/82.\nMeanwhile, Lawerence had a 2.65 ERA in 55 relief appearances, making him, left-hander Ben Bowden and right-hander Reid Humphreys (1.83 in 35 before being promoted to Hartford in late July) the best bullpen arms on the team.\nYou won\u2019t be hearing these names announced over the P.A. at Coors Field anytime next season, but a handful of prospects in the organization\u2019s lower levels are already making impressions.\nThe short list of those highly touted players include right-hander Riley Pint (Boise Hawks), shortstop Ryan Vilade (Asheville Tourists) and Grand Junction southpaw Ryan Rolison and first baseman Grant Lavigne down in rookie ball."}

Official returns are expected to start coming in on Friday around 1 a.m. local time (Thursday at 8 p.m. EDT). About 50% of the returns are expected to be counted within the following three hours.\nIf the \"leave\" camp wins, the process of a British exit from the EU would begin. Some estimates say the negotiations could take more than two years.\nIf the \"remain\" side wins, global markets will breathe a huge sigh of relief. The UK will begin to regroup and heal from the restlessness that's divided the country for months.\nA UK Treasury analysis shows the nation would become much more impoverished if it left the EU. The report said productivity and the average GDP per person would decline substantially due to the Brexit's negative effects on the UK's economy.\nAccording to the analysis, the British government would also see weaker tax receipts. Those losses would vastly outweigh the benefits of reduced contributions to the EU.\nThe Bank of England, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and several other organizations have warned of the negative long-term effects of a Brexit. The IMF said Britain leaving the EU would permanently lower the average income of UK citizens and could trigger an economic recession.\nStill, pro-Brexit momentum has grown in the last couple of weeks due to growing support over the country's prospective immigration policies. The UK's current EU membership jeopardizes its employment market and social services, which will suffer under the bulk of too many new residents.\nThe vote will likely come down to the wire. Polls released Monday had \"leave\" firmly in the lead. But as of today (Tuesday, June 21), polls have \"remain\" with a slim 2% lead.\nFitz-Gerald said the most defensive \"offensive\" way to play the referendum is to go long the U.S. dollar with the PowerShares U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (NYSE Arca: UUP).\nBy betting on the dollar, you can bank returns from its upward momentum as global investors buy it as a safe-haven alternative to the pound.\nThe dollar will also benefit from the decline in other currencies affected by the vote, including the Swiss franc and euro. In other words, you'll profit from a knee-jerk currency reaction that will be felt across several major economies.\nFor investors looking for a more direct exposure to the British pound, Fitz-Gerald recommends the Short GBP Long USD (LON: SGBP).\nThis exchange-traded fund (ETF) lets you both short the pound and bet on the dollar's rally.

The Satellite Database of the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates there are currently 1,738 operating satellites in orbit.\nThe FCC cited NASA guidelines when it said the go-ahead for the SpaceX application was conditioned upon \u201capproval of an updated description of the orbital debris mitigation plans for its system.\u201d In other words, they wanted assurances that SpaceX would clean up its trash.\nFor its part, SpaceX said it will deorbit its satellites only a year after their mission is complete, far less than the 25-year guideline proposed by NASA.\nSpaceX has made no announcement of upcoming Starlink launches or a timetable or when the first constellation might be complete."}

The expected headline takeaway from his stay will be the signing of $20 billion worth of commercial contracts.\nThe late Uzbek leader, Islam Karimov, who died in September 2016, was never an enthusiastic comrade for Moscow, so the bonhomie is being interpreted by some observers as a historic turn by Tashkent. A more sanguine reading is that President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is cultivating equally warm ties with all and sundry in his ongoing mission to pull his nation out of its long-standing isolation.\nThis fits an established pattern.\nLast April, an agreement was signed between Russia and Uzbekistan on expanding military-technical cooperation, which envisions the mutual supply of military wares, the maintenance and repair of weapons and military equipment, and assistance in research and development.\nUzbekistan has also recently resumed sending military personnel to be trained at army colleges in Russia \u2013 an arrangement that was ended in 2012. This year, 340 Uzbek officers enrolled at the colleges.\nAnd Russia has been supplying weapons to Uzbekistan at reduced prices since 2016.

{"idx": "6316", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: I Walked through the doors of The First Baptist Church in the spring of 1995after having been somewhat of a prodigal son for roughly 10 years. I had recently rededicated my life to Christ and wanted to once again be a part of a loving church family. As I entered and sat down to the joyful noise of a magnificent choir and orchestra praising God in song, my heart and soul were filled with wonder, excitement and great expectation. I was truly being prepared for worship.\nWhen the preacher finished his sermon, I was spiritually refreshed and energized for the week ahead. His message had been clear, powerful, convicting, biblical and full of the Holy Spirit. Over time I grew to love this brother in Christ because of his faithfulness and passion for the gospel. After visiting the church for some months, I knew I had found a church home.\nA couple of years later, the pastor invited me to lunch at a nearby country club he frequented where he mentioned in passing his desire to eventually do away with the First Baptist Church name and simply call it \"The People's Church\", claiming \"that's what everyone called it anyway\". Still taken by the man's persona, I smiled and nodded in approval as he told me of wanting to take the church in \"a new direction\", away from the Southern Baptist stigma that he felt had somehow hindered us in the past and move on greater things. Unfortunately, he didn't elaborate on what that \"new direction\" was and I mistakenly assumed that he meant toward a non-denominational identity.\nIn the coming weeks and months a new message began emanating from his pulpit not unlike what had been coming from, of all places, the presidential podium of Bill Clinton during the height of his scandals. A re-occurring theme of \"tolerance, diversity and unity\" seemed to permeate almost every sermon. It became increasingly clear to me that the pastor's \"new direction\" was worldly and that he was now being guided by someone or something other than God. Friction grew between the two of us over the course of time as his sermons turned away from the gospel that leads to repentance and faith in Christ to the social psychology of get-alongism. Sure, the Bible calls us to live in peace with one another, to keep and maintain healthy relationships with our brothers and sisters in Christ, but NOT at the expense of God. The pastor I once held in such high regard began reciting \"group-think\" platitudes like: \"YOU CAN'T BE RIGHT WITH GOD AND AT ODDS WITH EVERYONE ELSE\", meaning it was now time for us all to compromise our conscience and convictions for the collective. This is the \"Consensus Process\" at work, a 200 year-old socialist brainwashing technique known by social psychologists the world over as the \"Hegelian Dialectic\", developed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the late 1700's that involves the practice of compromise to achieve social harmony between opposing groups and/or belief systems. The \"Hegelian Dialectic\" is especially damaging to those of the faith who are compelled by the process to accept the unacceptable in order to gain the approval of the group. It is the herd mentality of humanist thinking and an abomination before God.\nYou see the Bible is FULL of godly men who stood alone and died fighting the heresy of the herd mentality, including Jesus Himself.

Astonishingly, amid all these rules and regulations, the Post Office is losing billions of dollars.\nI see a lot of scope for bipartisan agreement here \u2014 unshackle the Post Office so that it has a hope of serving the country indefinitely into the future. Republicans like deregulation, right?\nThe problem, I think, is that for all that Republicans like deregulation, they really hate the idea of a state-owned organization competing with the private sector. Of course, the Post Office does that already \u2014 it competes with FedEx and UPS. But the USPS, as a government-subsidized organization with thousands of locations nationwide and a massive reserve of public trust, could be a formidable competitor in all manner of different markets and none of the incumbents in those markets would welcome the competition.\nOver the long term, however, I suspect that the only way to save the Post Office will be to allow it to move into financial services. There\u2019s a lot of expertise in the rest of the world when it comes to the questions of how to set up and run a post bank. Meanwhile, banks in the U.S. are mistrusted and disliked and many people would love to be able to just bank at the Post Office instead.\nIt might be too late now to set up a post bank \u2014 but I doubt it. (This is still a country, after all, where most people still use paper checks.) There\u2019s a window of opportunity here. Let\u2019s grab it, before it\u2019s too late."}

Williams girls\u2019 basketball program reached the Patriot District championship game in 2011 and 2012, only to fall short each year against West Springfield.\nThis season, the Titans finally solved the Spartans, beating West Springfield twice during the regular season. However, TC lost twice to Lake Braddock and ended up sliding to the No. 3 seed in the district tournament.\nOn Feb. 13, TC finally figured out Lake Braddock, beating the Bruins in the semifinals. Two days later, all that stood between the Titans and their first district title since 2009 was the Woodson Cavaliers \u2014 and TC played like a team ready to seize its opportunity.\nT.C. Williams defeated Woodson 58-35 to win the Patriot District championship on Feb. 15 at Lake Braddock Secondary School. The Titans outscored the Cavaliers 19-2 in the second quarter en route to a 22-point halftime lead. TC led by at least 12 for the remainder of the contest, ending West Springfield\u2019s three-year run atop the district.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d TC junior Angie Schedler said.\nSenior guard Christian Roberts spent four seasons on the TC varsity and said coming up short in the past made Friday\u2019s victory that much sweeter.\nOne of the Titans\u2019 biggest concerns was Woodson guard Keara Finnerty. The senior scored 40 points and made 8 of 11 3-point attempts during a victory against West Springfield in the semifinals on Feb. 13. Schedler matched up against Finnerty and helped limit the sharpshooter to 10 points and just two field goals.\nSchedler\u2019s success wasn\u2019t limited to the defensive end. She also scored 14 points, all in the first half, including four 3-pointers. Schedler\u2019s second shot from behind the arc gave the Titans a 15-10 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nT.C. Williams sophomore Rejoice Spivey scored 29 points against Woodson in the Patriot District championship game on Feb. 15 and earned tournament MVP honors.\nTC led 34-12 at halftime, but Woodson started to chip away and eventually pulled within 12 when Anna Walker converted a three-point play with less than a second remaining in the third quarter, cutting the Titans\u2019 lead to 41-29. But the Cavaliers would get no closer as sophomore guard Rejoice Spivey led TC to victory. Spivey finished with a game-high 29 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter.\nSpivey was named tournament MVP. According to stats from the Washington Post\u2019s Web site, Spivey scored 30 points against Lake Braddock in the semifinals on Feb. 13 and 13 against West Potomac in the quarterfinals on Feb. 12.\nRoberts scored seven points for TC.

Attackers could also maliciously alter the voting software itself during the build process, if it\u2019s created on a personal computer instead of in a controlled environment, the researchers said Monday during a press conference about their findings in Tallinn, Estonia.\nThe system uses a vote confirmation procedure based on QR codes than need to be scanned by users with their mobile phones after casting their votes. However, a compromised voting application can potentially alter votes and QR codes in real time, meaning this additional verification system can\u2019t protect users from sophisticated attackers, the researchers said.\nSuch false verification attacks have been used in the real world against online banking users, so they\u2019re not just theoretical and could easily be applied to Internet voting, they said.\nTo compromise the electronic voting servers, attackers could either exploit vulnerabilities over the Internet or could target the people responsible for deploying the servers by first infecting their computers and then altering the server software. Because of the lack of security checks and control, a malicious insider could also carry out such attacks, the researchers said.\nThe research team included J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan who studied electronic voting systems in different countries around the world; Maggie MacAlpine, an advisor on post-election audits in the U.S.; Harri Hursti, a Finnish independent security researcher known for previously demonstrating a successful attack against a Diebold voting machine; Jason Kitcat, who previously led an investigation into electronic voting in the UK for the Open Rights Group, a digital rights organization; and Travis Finkenauer and Drew Springall, two PhD students at the University of Michigan.\n\u201cThere are so many attack vectors by which you could dirty the machines used to set up the elections that we believe this to be a very credible and viable attack; and we have photographic evidence on our website showing a personal computer with links to poker sites being used to set up the critical election systems [in Estonia],\u201d Kitcat said.\nThe Estonian election officials should improve their operational procedures,"}

The company is in the movie business, the car-selling business, the food-delivery business, and the entertainment ticketing business. And now, it&apos;s announced the launch of a futuristic hotel.\nThe 290-room hotel in Hangzhou, China, called FlyZoo, aims to use updated technology to fix a number of typical hotel annoyances, such as long lines to check in, losing your keycard, and dealing with rude staff members. The project was a combination of efforts from Alibaba&apos;s online travel platform, Fliggy, as well as other businesses from Alibaba, such as its artificial intelligence (A.I.) arm and its cloud arm.\nYou probably guessed that FlyZoo has a savvy app for the booking process. However, you might be surprised by some of the specific room options. Not only can you choose the floor you want to stay on, you can also choose which direction your room faces.\nThe app also cuts down on guest-staff interactions because most guests can check in and out through the app. But if you&apos;re a foreign passport holder, you will also need to visit a kiosk at the hotel as part of the check-in process.\nPerhaps the most common inconvenience at traditional hotels is having to keep a keycard or key to get into your room and other areas of the building. And if, as in some cases, the keycard malfunctions, you must return to the check-in desk for a new one.\nFlyZoo does away with this issue by installing facial recognition systems to allow guests easy and secure access throughout the hotel. Even the elevators are accessed through facial recognition.\nThe system recognizes you as a guest based on the photo taken of you during check-in. This updated form of a keycard should help guests feel safer, as well as less anxious about whether they left their keycard in the room or car.\nEach room in FlyZoo also comes equipped with a complimentary voice-activated home speaker called the Tmall Genie, Alibaba&apos;s version of the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo. The device acts as a personal assistant with the ability to perform simple tasks, such as adjusting the temperature; operating the lights, curtains, and TV; playing music, and answering simple questions about things like the weather or WiFi code.\nThe Tmall Genie also further reduces time spent interacting with staff. Instead of calling the front desk for water or fresh towels, guests can give the simple request to the Genie. The water and towels will then be delivered by an Alibaba-branded robot.\nAlibaba&apos;s Genie was introduced in July 2017 at a price of $73, and the company sold 2 million units in just under a year. The device was made exclusively for China, so it doesn&apos;t compete directly with Amazon&apos;s Echo.\nAlibaba has always quickly adapted to trends in order to take advantage of surging markets. China&apos;s hotels made almost $800 billion in 2018, according to a report from the China Hospitality Association and Shanghai Inntie Hotel Management Consultants. Alibaba has taken note of the booming travel industry and wants to be sure its hotels stand out from the crowd.

Now No 1 in NZ and the fourth most admired wine brand in the world, Villa Maria is a leader in innovation, with a passionate team of people making exceptional wines, proudly pursuing the visions and ambitions of the company\u2019s founder.\nIn the first years, George was on his own, but his success led to taking on staff in the 1970s and first exports were achieved in 1988. George has undoubtedly been instrumental in helping the global success of New Zealand wines, and was knighted in 2009 for services to the wine industry \u2013 the first award of its kind.\nWith nerves of steel, he has always pushed the boundaries in the pursuit of excellence. Experiments with different grape varieties and different techniques both in the vineyard and in the winery, continue to this day, with Albari\u00f1o and Verdelho having particularly good results, apart from the iconic Sauvignon Blanc in all its manifestations. Sometimes these innovations have expansions have been problematic and the company has had its troubled times in the past. A recent experimental planting was eventually abandoned after some years.\nThe company currently exports to more than 50 countries world-wide, with the majority of the grapes coming from Marlborough in the South Island and Hawkes Bay in the North.\nI personally have always been a great fan of Villa Maria wines and from their very wide selection, I have yet to find one not to my liking. During the lunch at 67 Pall Mall, London, we were treated to some very special wines, some of which are only available at the cellar door. A trip to New Zealand beckons! Sir George now undertakes the role of Global Brand Ambassador, a task no-one on Earth could perform better.\nBut without the need for a trip down under, Villa Maria wines are widely available in the UK. Two of my favourites are the Reserve Sauvignon Blanc from Clifford Bay (Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a315.95) and the Cellar Selection Pinot Noir 2016 (Majestic \u00a312.99 at the mix six price). The Sauvignon Blanc 2017 comes from the Awatere Valley in Marlborough is powerful, with aromas of wild flowers and fresh lime, complementing the tropical flavours on the palate. The Pinot Noir is also from Marlborough, medium bodied with delicious red berry fruit and subtle, integrated oak.

Broadway. The 490,000-square-foot structure is part of the Transamerica complex in South Park that was purchased in May by Johnson's Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund.\nThe proposal, scheduled for a council vote next week, was recommended after Deaton said Johnson's consortium offered the best deal of several competing plans, agreeing to sell the building for $50.7 million.\n\"This is the most cost-effective proposal,\" Deaton said.\nStill, some City Hall critics said the deal appeared to be a poor one for taxpayers and smacked of politics because Johnson and partner Kenneth Lombard have been active political supporters of Mayor James K. Hahn and City Council members involved in the deal.\n\"It's cronyism,\" said Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization.\nReal estate experts said it appeared that Johnson's partnership would earn a handsome profit on the sale.\nThe group paid $100 million in May for a complex that includes the prospective city building as well as a second 11-story office tower, the 32-story Transamerica Center Tower, three parking structures and 5.5 acres of adjacent land.\nThe entire complex includes 1.4 million square feet of office buildings.\n\"It's pretty obvious that it would be a pretty good deal for Magic,\" said Steve Allwright, a veteran real estate broker with Metro Resources.\n\"The city could have had [it] at a better price if they had bought it directly, but the public sector hardly ever does as well as the private sector at projecting real estate market trends and buying property,\" said Larry Kosmont, a real estate consultant who has done work for the city.\nAllwright said the downtown real estate market \"is just taking off like crazy,\" so it appeared that the city would be paying a fair price for the Broadway building, especially since it includes 1,700 parking spaces in an area where parking is at a premium.\nLAPD officials have complained for years that Parker Center is obsolete and unsafe and should be replaced.\nThe city has proposed a $470-million replacement for the police headquarters near City Hall, to be completed in 2008, but concluded that it would be less expensive and more practical to move employees out of Parker Center during construction.\nRather than lease space for the temporary police headquarters, Deaton said, the city would save $8 million a year by buying the Broadway building for use during construction of a new headquarters and then moving other city agencies into the building when the police vacate it.\nThe purchase was recommended by the city's Municipal Facilities Committee, which includes Deaton, City Administrative Officer Bill Fujioka and Hahn's chief of staff, Tim McOsker.\nJohnson campaigned for Hahn in the 2001 mayoral election. Though critical of the mayor last year for not backing Bernard C. Parks for another term as police chief, Johnson co-chaired Hahn's anti-secession campaign L.A. United last year.

The Tahoe Truckee Unified School District recently began a Play it Safe Concussion Care program to provide education and insurance for student athletes in case of concussions.\nTRUCKEE, Calif. \u2014 Tahoe Truckee Unified School District student athletes have a new line of defense against concussions.\nThe Play it Safe Concussion Care program provides them education on concussions, a resource to identify one, and insurance coverage to access physicians trained in evaluating and managing concussions for those who suffer one.\n\u201cOne of the big things is you look totally normal when you have a head injury, whereas if you break your arm, you have a big cast on,\u201d said Dr. Nina Winans, sports medicine physician and medical director for the Tahoe Center for Health and Sports Performance.\nTo help detect a concussion, student athletes take a preseason ImPACT exam that tests brain function, including memory, processing speed and reaction time, to establish a baseline for each individual athlete.\n\u201cOur hope is that you never have to use it again and that you\u2019ll never have to access this insurance because that means you had a head injury,\u201d Winans said.\nThose suspected of getting a concussion are pulled from play and evaluated by a physician trained in head injuries. The student athlete then undergoes a post-injury ImPACT test, with the results being compared to the baseline results to determine the extent of the concussion.\nIf a concussion is present, an individual follow-up plan is created by the physician and carried out by the student athlete until he or she is cleared to return to play.\nInsurance coverage through the Play it Safe Concussion Care program covers up to $25,000 per injury with no deductible and no co-pays. It acts as a second insurance for those with primary coverage and primary coverage for those without insurance.\n\u201cWe want parents to get the best care (for their children) and not have to worry about it,\u201d said Mike Lamb, vice president of Play it Safe Concussion Care program for Wells Fargo, which helped develope the program.\nAll TTUSD high school student athletes involved in a sport where there is a risk for concussion such as football and soccer are included in the program.\nIt comes at no cost to TTUSD families and the school district, with funding coming from the Gene Upshaw Memorial Fund and the Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research.\n\u201cIt just brings us a much higher level of care than we\u2019ve had before,\u201d said Corine Harvey, executive director of student services for TTUSD.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year U.S. emergency departments treat an estimated 173,285 sports- and recreations-related traumatic brain injuries, including concussions, among children and adolescents. In the past decade, emergency department visits for such injuries has increased by 60 percent.\nThe NFL is currently embroiled in a concussion lawsuit with former players.\nA $765 million settlement between the league and its 18,000 retired players was reached in August 2013.

He was concerned that everyone in the microstock photo agency business had the same message of what they had to offer: great images, great search, great quality and millions of images at great prices.\nEach company's advertising had great pictures and all were featured as full-page ads in designer magazines. The ads were so similar that one logo could be substituted for another. The problem with the beautiful ads was that they didn't say anything special about any company.\nMr. Lor decided it was time for Fotolia to do something different \u2013 but how?\nFotolia is a microstock photography agency launched in November, 2005. Unlike other agencies, it was started by Europeans and is more international. Fotolia sells in local languages, with its largest markets being France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, in addition to the United States. To facilitate international sales, Fotolia allows online payments with all major credit cards, PayPal and Skrill (used in more countries than PayPal).\nFotolia and other microstock photo agencies source their photos from both amateur and professional photographers via the Internet. Fotolia.com was the first global online social marketplace for creative digital stock images, and its mission is to allow photographers and designers of all skill levels to share and monetize their artistic imagery.\nPhotographers upload photographs, required releases and keywords to Fotolia. Its collection also includes vector illustrations and videos. Files are reviewed by Fotolia for quality and composition prior to being accepted for inclusion on the site. When an image is purchased, the photographer is paid a royalty, which will vary depending on the type of license purchased.\nCustomers download photos for virtually any design project, including websites, presentations and advertisements. Customers purchase the photos by using credits (starting at 75 cents each) or by purchasing a subscription plan. The price of a photograph will depend on the rank of the photographer and type of licence use.\nFotolia more than doubled in size from 2008 to 2010. In October, 2008, it had more than 800,000 members who uploaded more than 4.2 million photographs and vector illustrations. By July, 2010, it had almost 2 million members and 9.8 million images, vector illustrations and videos.\nDespite this growth, Mr. Lor was aware that the industry was highly competitive and the need to differentiate Fotolia from its competitors was crucial to maintaining its momentum.\nMr. Lor wanted Fotolia's new advertising campaign to deconstruct the fa\u00e7ade. His team wrote a request for proposal that contained Fotolia's mission statement, background information on the business and the industry, and examples of various (boring) ad campaigns from Fotolia and its competitors.\nThe information was delivered to Calgary's top advertising agencies with a request to meet with their top creative minds.\nMacLaren McCann came up with an unusual campaign. It was everything that Mr. Lor's company asked for: different, unique, funny and interesting.\nHowever, there was no use of pictures, no URL, no phone number, no offer\u2026none of the traditional elements of a good ad.\nThe ad immediately split the Fotolia team. Half of them loved it and the other half hated it.\nAmong those who loved it were comments like it was unlike anything they had ever seen; reminded them of an avant garde French poster (reflecting Fotolia's European presence);"}

It was during the confirmation hearing of Cornelia Pillard, now a judge on the D.C. Circuit.\nUsually, they then proceeded not to answer it. However, Pillard, a professor, was somewhat more inclined to answer than Lynch, a litigator.\nIt seems clear that Pillard and Lynch received the same coaching. And both followed instructions quite well.\nIs there anything wrong with this? No. But the point is worth making in the context of Lynch\u2019s confirmation proceedings.\nThe question before Republican Senators \u2014 as one of them after another stated \u2014 is whether they can be confident that Lynch will not be another Eric Holder. Lynch expressed no disagreement with any position taken, or practice engaged in, by the Holder DOJ.\nBut Lynch wasn\u2019t herself during the hearing. Her answers were programmed and generic. She was Cornelia Pillard (and who knows how many other nominees), serving up testimony choreographed by a consultant.\nAgain, this isn\u2019t problematic unless one accepts the premise \u2014 which many Republican Senators espoused and some may even believe \u2014 that the Holder Justice Department is beyond the pale. If one accepts that premise, then more should be required of Lynch than a deferential, coached answering style and meaningless \u201ccommitments\u201d to uphold the rule of law and to meet with Senators to address their concerns.\nWhat\u2019s required is an acknowledgement that something is wrong at DOJ. Lynch never even hinted that there might be something wrong. Moreover, the evidence strongly suggests that she\u2019s fully on-board with the radical, lawless agenda of Eric Holder, who helped put her in the position to succeed him.\n\u201cThank you for that question, blogger.\u201d It answers itself."}

Grainger (NYSE:GWW) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly.\nShares of Domino's Pizza declined 5% after the company released its third-quarter financial report. The popular pizza chain announced solid growth in retail sales that helped earnings per share soar by more than 65% from the year-ago period. However, investors weren't satisfied with Domino's same-store sales growth numbers, which included gains of just 3.3% internationally and 4.9% at company-owned locations domestically. For a company that's routinely put up double-digit-percentage gains in comparable sales figures, the realization that Domino's period of hyper-growth is coming to an end seemed to chill investor sentiment despite the impressive bottom-line growth that the pizza chain produced.\nInnophos Holdings fell nearly 17% in the wake of the issuance of its preliminary third-quarter results and new full-year guidance. The specialty ingredient company said it now expects 2018 growth to come in between 10% and 12%, down from its previous 12% to 14% range due to weaker sales in the second half of the year. Innophos made a strategic decision to discontinue some of its low-margin operations in order to concentrate on more lucrative parts of its business, and that will be responsible for much of the top-line contraction. Higher ingredient costs have affected many food companies, and they've forced Innophos to increase the prices it charges its customers as well. Although Innophos has confidence in its long-term strategic moves, investors aren't happy with the short-term impacts of the decisions it's made recently.\nFinally, shares of W.W. Grainger finished lower by 12%. The supplier of maintenance, repair, and operating products said that its revenue rose 7% during the third quarter from the previous year's period, with adjusted earnings jumping 44% due to better margin figures and lower taxes. Yet despite the strong performance, investors seem to be uncertain about whether the company's rising sales from large and medium-sized customers will be able to continue indefinitely into the future. As long as Grainger can keep its overall expenses under control without jeopardizing its sales, today's decline seems like an overreaction to concerns that might very well never materialize."}

By 2014. the plan is for nearly every car in the lineup of each brand will be interchangeable, said Carl-Peter Forster, president of GM Europe. In an interview with Wards Auto, Forster said from now on, whenever we develop a vehicle, we have to make sure we can export it to the U.S., and vice versa. The idea is to be very flexible.\nWhile the recently introduced Saturn Aura rides on the Epsilon platform that also underpins the Opel Vectra, the cars were developed separately, with different designs. The plan for the next-generation Aura and Vectra is for both vehicles to be developed at the same time by the same designers. General Motors will also be bringing the Opel Antara SUV and the Astra compact to the States soon as replacements for the Saturn's VUE and ION models. Production of the Saturn versions of both models is expected to begin at the end of 2007, reports Trend.\nWhile most of the vehicles will come from Opel to Saturn, at least one vehicle is going the other way, with the Saturn Sky being sold in Europe as the Opel GT. The only potential exception to the model sharing is larger vehicles, like the all-new Saturn Outlook, because the crossover is too large for most Europeans. But, Bryan Nesbitt, who oversees design for Opel and Saturn brands from Europe, says it could be a different story in five years when the next-generation Outlook hits the market."}

This is a reactive drinking vessel known to light-up depending on the mood of the party or a game day celebration.\nePint, as reported by Kickstarter, has a campaign with over 130 backers with a goal of $50,000. The mugs can also connect to the internet for when the mugs detect you\u2019ve had too much beer. In fact, it can be set up so that it may call a cab in case you\u2019re too inebriated to drive. Also, according to Tech Times, the idea was implemented by Xtreme Tech, LLC. for the needs of the avid party goer.\nSensors have been fitted for when you get low on fluid and keeps count the number of drinks you\u2019ve had. For those with a smart phone that goes along with the smart beer mugs, there are Android and iPhone apps that work in conjunction with the device. The Bluetooth range for the mug is up to 180 feet.\nKeep in mind, the \u201cdrink responsibly\u201d mantra only applies if you responsibly pre-set the smart phone app for the amount of beer it takes until it\u2019s necessary to call a cab. That would depend on you, of course. When that\u2019s all done, you can make your way to the party and when the beer limit is exceeded, the mug will do its thing.\nAccording to Female First, there are other fascinating features for these beer mugs. For instance, it is equipped for drinking games or lights up when a fan\u2019s team scores a point. A bottle opener is located at the bottom of the mug for convenience. There\u2019s also a feature for the purpose of \u201crecovery\u201d where it tells you the amount you need to re-hydrate, as well as amount of required exercise needed to recuperate.\nThis worked nicely with fill-in flash and ambient back lighting.

His administration picked some low-hanging fruit in the mining industry shortly after coming into power a year ago, earning him much-needed goodwill among mining companies and investors.\nThe withdrawal of the hugely controversial Mining Charter imposed by former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane in 2017, which led the Minerals Council SA suing the government, was a big win, with the new version seeing most stakeholders getting most of what they wanted \u2014 but not everything. Leaving no party completely happy at the signing ceremony is probably the best sign of a relatively fair outcome for all.\nThe elephant in the room is, of course, Eskom, which Ramaphosa promised will be addressed prudently and urgently.\nMineral resources minister Gwede Mantashe asked parliament to withdraw the long-delayed amendments to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Act, which were seen as one of the key sources of regulatory uncertainty hampering investment in the sector. And while he is not put anything in writing into the charter or regulations, Mantashe has repeatedly said that his department will no longer require empowerment shareholdings for prospecting licences, removing a significant financial burden on companies that plan to embark on risky, expensive rights.\nMantashe also acted quickly to try and clean the rot in his department. There is hardly a company operating in SA today without some horror story about licence application delays or other applicants copying their applications unlawfully, or section 54 safety stoppages imposed without merit. These were the easy pickings. Now the real work awaits.\nThe elephant in the room is, of course, Eskom, which Ramaphosa promised will be addressed prudently and urgently. The problem, however, is that regardless of the plan the government comes up with for the struggling utility, it will need not only eye-watering amounts of money, but also time. There is simply no quick-fix for years of inaction and mismanagement.\nBallooning tariffs have added to miners\u2019 woes, and the Minerals Council has warned that Eskom\u2019s proposed increases for the next three years will shutter all but one gold mine in the country. Security of supply has also been of concern, and for mining firms with exploration or expansion plans, access to Eskom power may just be the hurdle that proves impossible to cross.\nTherefore rest assured that no serious investment dollars will be heading this way before there isn\u2019t only a plan for Eskom, but significant and definite action. The other certainty is that none of this will happen painlessly. Elsewhere on this page, the National Union of Mineworkers promises to greet any plans of unbundling with \u201cmilitancy and radicalism\u201d.

Mining communities, with the help of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) and social justice lawyers, are becoming increasingly effective at organising themselves and demanding their slice of the pie.\nXolobeni on the Wild Coast, where the majority of the community has been opposed to mining rights for years, is one high-profile example.

Three conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - said they would have granted the request for an indefinite postponement of the trial. Trump\u2019s new appointee to the nine-member court, Brett Kavanaugh, did not state publicly how he voted on the matter.\nThe decision benefits the 18 states challenging the census citizenship question in part because such a postponement could have made it impossible to resolve the dispute before census forms are printed starting next year.\nThe administration had argued there should be no trial until the justices rule on a fight over evidence. That dispute includes whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, should be forced to answer questions under oath about his motivations for the politically charged decision.\nOpponents of the citizenship question have said it would deter people in immigrant communities from participating in the census, disproportionately affecting Democratic-leaning states\u2019 electoral representation and federal funding by undercounting the number of residents.\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who is among the state officials suing the administration, said the Trump administration has tried \u201cevery trick in the book\u201d to block the case.\n\u201cYou really have to wonder what they\u2019re trying to hide.

The first, spearheaded by Democratic officials, was brought by 18 states as well as a number of cities and counties. The other was filed by several immigrant rights groups that accused the administration of discrimination against non-white immigrants.\nThe administration, in explaining the citizenship question, has said more precise citizenship data is needed to better enforce a voting rights law in order to protect minorities.\nThere has not been a census question about citizenship status since 1950.

Over 2 billion people worldwide check Facebook each month; 45 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook. Together with Google, it captures half of all digital advertising revenues worldwide. Yet more people say they greatly distrust Facebook than any other member of the big five \u2013 Amazon, Apple, Google or Microsoft.\nIn March 2017 Facebook started taking responsibility for quality control as a way to restore users\u2019 trust. The company hired fact-checkers to verify information in posts. Two months later the company changed its algorithms to help users find diverse viewpoints on current issues and events. And in October 2017, it imposed new transparency requirements to force advertisers to identify themselves clearly.\nBut Zuckerberg led off 2018 in a different direction, committing to \u201cworking to fix our issues together.\u201d That last word, \u201ctogether,\u201d suggests an inclusive approach, but in my view, it really says the company is shifting the burden back onto its users.\nHowever, Facebook will rely on users to rate how trustworthy groups, organizations and media outlets are. Those ratings will determine which third-party publishers do make it to users\u2019 screens, if at all. Leaving trustworthiness ratings to users without addressing online political polarization risks making civic discourse even more divided and extreme.\nUnlike real-life interactions, online exchanges can exacerbate both passive and narcissistic tendencies. It\u2019s easier to be invisible online, so people who want to avoid attention can do so without facing peer pressure to participate. By contrast, though, people who are active online can see their friends like, share and comment on their posts, motivating them to seek even more attention.\nThis creates two groups of online users, broadly speaking: disengaged observers and those who are competing for attention with ever more extreme efforts to catch users\u2019 eyes. This environment has helped outrageous, untrue claims with clickbait headlines attract enormous amounts of attention.\nThis phenomenon is further complicated by two other elements of social interaction online. First, news of any kind \u2013 including fake news \u2013 gains credibility when it is forwarded by a personal connection.\nAnd social media tends to group like-minded people together, creating an echo chamber effect that reinforces messages the group agrees with and resists outside views \u2013 including more accurate information and independent perspectives. It\u2019s no coincidence that conservatives and liberals trust very different news sources.\nUsers of Facebook\u2019s instant-messaging subsidiary WhatsApp have shown that even a technology focusing on individual connection isn\u2019t always healthy or productive. WhatsApp has been identified as a primary carrier of fake news and divisive rumors in India, where its users\u2019 messages have been described as a \u201cmix of off-color jokes, doctored TV [clips], wild rumors and other people\u2019s opinions, mostly vile.\u201d Kenya has identified 21 hate-mongering WhatsApp groups. WhatsApp users in the U.K. have had to stay alert for scams in their personal messages.\nFacebook\u2019s actions appear to be responding to public pressure from the U.S. and Europe. But Facebook is experiencing its fastest growth in Asia and Africa.\nResearch I have conducted with colleagues has found that users in the developing world are more trusting of online material, and therefore more vulnerable to manipulation by false information. In Myanmar, for instance, Facebook is the dominant internet site because of its Free Basics program, which lets mobile-phone users connect to a few selected internet sites, including Facebook, without paying extra or using up allotted data in their mobile plans"}

Gul, who hates the United States with a passion, is also promoting Mr. Khan, Pakistan\u2019s most popular living legend, as a natural successor to President Pervez Musharraf.\nIran should continue its quest to become a nuclear power by enriching uranium to weapons-grade quality.\n\u0095 Muslim countries and smaller countries should develop nuclear capabilities to thwart America\u2019s aggressive policies.\n\u0095 Only Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability prevents war with India.\n\u0095 Had Iraq possessed nuclear weapons, the United States would not even have thought of attacking.\n\u0095 The largest uranium enrichment plant is in Pakistan.\n\u0095 Mr. Khan is a \u201cMoshin,\u201d or \u201cbestower,\u201d of Pakistan. Thanks to him Pakistan is the world\u2019s only nuclear Muslim country.\n\u0095 Nuclear Pakistan terrifies the world, and this serves Pakistan well.\n\u0095 Knowledge and technology cannot be prevented from traveling anywhere. It is like air, which can go in any direction.\nThe United States is still denied direct access to Mr. Khan to pin down an exact accounting of the nuclear knowledge he passed on to Iran\u2019s \u201cMullahocracy.\u201d He first began visiting Iran\u2019s atomic energy agency in the mid-1980s and has made a number of trips to Iran since then.\nMr. Khan ran a clandestine nuclear black market for two decades. These secret activities made him one of Pakistan\u2019s wealthiest men. Following repeated complaints from the United States, Mr. Musharraf, then chief executive before he made himself president, relieved Mr. Khan of his official nuclear responsibilities and made him a private adviser. Mr. Musharraf also told U.S. interlocutors he knew nothing of clandestine Khan activities and the U.S. could not prove its allegations.\nIn late 2003, then Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage confronted Mr. Musharraf with detailed accusations of Mr. Khan\u2019s secret proliferation activities. Mr. Musharraf still claimed it was news to him, which stretches credulity, as he was army chief of staff prior to staging a coup in October 1999. Mr. Khan frequently traveled on Pakistani military aircraft.\nMr. Khan was allowed to go free and keep his nuclear black market gains in exchange for a televised apology \u2014 in English. The overwhelming majority of Pakistanis speak only Urdu.\nU.S. attempts to have direct access to Khan to find out exactly how he assisted Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions have been rebuffed by Mr. Musharraf. During Miss Rice\u2019s first visit to Islamabad, Mr. Musharraf agreed to send Mr. Khan detailed questions about his secret work in Iran. Direct access was denied."}

{"idx": "6381", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: These charts will give you quick insights into the operations of one of the leading dollar store chains.\nAlthough it was the smallest of the three national dollar store chains, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) made up for its size by applying competitive pressure to its rivals by selling merchandise in its network of 5,000 stores for $1 or less.\nIt was a successful strategy that allowed it to become the most profitable of the dollar store chains, and gave it the ability to challenge industry leader Dollar General (NYSE:DG) in a bid to acquire failing rival Family Dollar. It won that battle, and for good or ill, the five charts below give investors key insights into what makes this business tick now that it's a much bigger business.\nDollar Tree was always a distant third behind Dollar General when it came to generating sales, no matter how successful it was in its niche. But now with the contribution from Family Dollar more than doubling its top-line numbers, it is closer to being on the same level as its rival, providing a true competitive threat.\nEven though Dollar Tree had to sell a few hundred stores to newly created Dollar Express to get regulatory approval for the acquisition of Family Dollar, it largely left its footprint intact because there was little overlap in the two stores or their concepts. It was one of the main selling points in helping it beat out Dollar General.\nWhere Dollar Tree was virtually a pure play when it came to being a dollar store -- all the items it sells are $1 or less, and its higher-priced Deal$chain made up just a negligible portion of its operations -- now with Family Dollar on board, the higher price points of its one-time rival accounts for the largest proportion of sales.\nOne of the problems with Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar was the merging of the lower-margin, faulty business operations of its rival with its more successful model. That impact became immediately apparent after the merger's closure as gross margins took a big hit, dropping from 34.2% in the year-ago second quarter to 28.4% this year. That faltering performance continued in the third quarter, with gross margins dropping to 28.3% from 34.6% last year.\nWhere Dollar Tree had once been the strongest of the dollar store chains in terms of operating margins, bringing Family Dollar into the fold kneecapped those profits by cutting them by more than half.\nA day late and a dollar short?\nDollar Tree has become an industry equal in terms of size but at the cost of profitability. Over the past six months, its stock has been relatively flat as the market apparently waits to see whether the integration of Family Dollar will work as well as Dollar Tree has suggested. But the illustrations above should give you a good working knowledge of what you need to know about this dollar store's operations."}

Tranel, Amber Ritchie et al.\nThe Teton Mountains are shaped by interactions between glacial, fluvial and mass wasting processes. In this study we investigate the influence of process interactions on quantitative estimates of erosion rates based on sediment transport and accumulation. Sediment characteristics were measured on talus fan and stream channel deposits. These observations were used to evaluate weathering and rounding, which can indicate transport history and mixing between the two deposits and processes. Talus fans were studied to quantify the stability of fan surfaces and determine the frequency of material transport. Streams were studied to determine the efficiency of meltwater flow to move sand and coarser materials deposited on talus surfaces. Similarities between sediments in the fluvial and talus deposits support strong coupling between these processes. Streams are capable of moving smaller sized talus materials, however active rockfalls continue to supply new sediment and limit stream incision. The source of recent rockfalls appears to be ridges at high elevations or along north facing walls indicated by the frequency of surface weathering and lichen cover on selected talus fans.\nTranel, Lisa M.; Ritchie, Amber; and Strow, Meredith (2011) \"Investigation of Postglacial Sediment Storage and Transport in Garnet Canyon, Teton Range, Wyoming,\" University of Wyoming National Park Service Research Center Annual Report: Vol. 34 , Article 23."}

We're not talking about making medical marijuana legal or decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of pot. These two states just gave the green light to an entirely new industry including but not limited to the large scale production, distribution and sale of marijuana. Just like in Amsterdam, only more comprehensive.\nThere's only one problem: Marijuana is still illegal at a federal level. Ever since states started to legalize medical marijuana in the 1990s, state and federal authorities have locked horns over the enforcement of drug laws. It was entirely legal from the states' point of view for folks to run commercial marijuana farms and to set up medical marijuana dispensaries. The DEA, however, has continued to raid farms and dispensaries, leaving many to wonder if the latest marijuana initiatives will fly on a federal level.\nGenerally speaking, we'll have to wait and see. In both states, it's going to be a number of months before shops actually start to sell pot. When they do -- based on the legislation that voters approved on Tuesday -- the tax revenue generated will go towards important things like improving schools. Attorney General Eric Holder hasn't said yet how exactly he plans to deal with the new state provisions, but if history is any indication, he's not going to give them a free pass.\nWe doubt any of this news is going to get the potheads of Colorado and Washington down. Supporters of the measures have poured millions of dollars into the campaign to get them passed, and they've succeeded in two out of the three states that had legalization on the ballot. Additionally, Massachusetts legalized marijuana for medical use. No matter what the federal government does, nobody can deny that there's momentum behind the movement to legalize pot. Then again, a lot of people probably said the same thing back in the 1970s when Oregon became the first state to decriminalize pot. Forty years later, voters have legalized pot completely in two states. At this rate we should be able to buy packs of joints by the 22nd century."}

The technology allows people to run multiple OSes -- including Linux -- using one physical hardware running Windows Server, and is available slightly ahead of the latest schedule Microsoft had for the software.\nEven so, Windows Server users have been waiting a long time for Hyper-V. The technology originally was supposed to be a part of the Windows Server 2008 release, which itself was pushed back more than once but finally got to users at the end of February.\nHyper-V was expected to be available 180 days, or about six months, after that release, which would have meant by the end of August.\nMicrosoft ended up delaying the release of Hyper-V, originally code-named \"Viridian,\" because the company opted to pull out some originally planned features.\nVirtualization is becoming a key way companies are driving costs out of the data center by running OSes in virtual machines (VMs) rather than physically on servers. Microsoft aims to catch up to virtualization leader VMware in providing this technology for hardware systems not only running on Windows, but also Linux and other OSes.\nThe company has said it aims to make virtualization a key part of its system-management strategy going forward, and is also expanding beyond hardware into desktop and application virtualization.\nAccording to Microsoft, more than 250 customers have participated in the early adopter programs for Hyper-V, including Land O'Lakes, HotSchedules and The SCOOTER Store.\nHyper-V features a 64-bit kernelized architecture, and is key to Microsoft's plan to move customers from 32-bit to 64-bit versions of Windows Server. Indeed, customers have said the technology should drive this shift, which Microsoft also is pushing by offering some versions of its business software -- such as Exchange Server -- as 64-bit only.\nOther features of Hyper-V can include support for up to four multiple processors in a VM environment so multi-threaded applications can be virtualized, Microsoft said. The technology also includes new virtual switch capabilities so VMs can be configured to run with Windows Network Load Balancing Service to balance VM loads on different servers.\nAdditionally, Hyper-V has a new virtual service provider/virtual service client architecture that allows hardware to access and utilize core resources more effectively, and also is optimized to migrate VMs from one physical host to another with minimal downtime, Microsoft said."}

It\u2019s too easy to blow the budget before achieving the goals, even if these are known at the outset.\nFaced with such dilemmas, the availability of a platform of components for \u2018smarter\u2019 retail would appear to be a boon. So, what gives? I had an email exchange with Thinaire CEO, Mike Ventimiglia, to find out more.\n1. In the face of an increasingly diverse pool of \u201csmart\u201d retail solutions, what is the problem Thinaire sets out to solve?\nFor far too many retailers, a customer that doesn\u2019t have their branded app, and isn\u2019t logged in, is essentially invisible. On top of that, when we ask retailers about the penetration rates of their apps, we generally get numbers well under 10%, which is frighteningly low. That\u2019s often where the conversation with Thinaire starts: our technologies dramatically lowers the effort required by consumers to access the full range of smarter retail solutions.\nWhether it\u2019s fine-grained location data driving product positioning, advanced loyalty programs, shelf-talkers, unattended retail, or all of the above and more, Thinaire reduces friction, simplifies delivery, and derives meaningful data at every stage of the customer journey. In many cases Thinaire is able to deliver measurably better retail experiences with no requirement for an app, and we offer a range of no-capex options if there is any infrastructure required to support any particular deployment.\n2. What consumer demographics are driving the need for digitally oriented solutions?\nWe know that under 25\u2019s spend, on average, 9 hours per day curating their digital selves, and other cohorts are not far behind. Everyone demands that their smart device intercede with the real world for them!\nThis data signals, among other things, a massive and growing demand for content to support each individual\u2019s \u201cpersonal brand.\u201d So retail brands that frictionlessly deliver images, video, offers, experiences, etc. aligned with customers\u2019 \u201cpersonal brands.\u201d This will generate a large pool of passionate advocates by making authentic personal recommendations, and hence building their brands concurrently.\n3. And meanwhile, what kinds of efficiency savings can be had by smarter use of in-store technology?\nThe future of retail is either extremely high-touch, or no-touch. In other words, fully digitally connected, personalized immersive experiences, or simply \u201cget out of my way\u201d unattended.\nTo realize efficiencies from \u201chigh-touch,\u201d cycle time is absolutely key. So technology that already knows who you are and what you want before you\u2019re even in the retail space (for example) can powerfully assist in delivering faster turnaround. Thinaire\u2019s \u201cvirtual loyalty\u201d technologies are deployed to provide exactly this capability.\nThe drivers of \u201cno-touch\u201d are quite different.

The journalist was told by ISIS that his former cellmates would be executed if he spoke to the media, but they have since been beheaded anyway, and Espinosa penned an exclusive account for the Sunday Times.\nIn it he describes Islamic State executioner \u2018Jihadi John,' since then revealed to be Kuwaiti-born UK citizen Mohammed Emwazi, using a combination of psychological and physical torture to break down Espinosa and more than 20 other hostages.\n\u201cFeel it?

Unimaginable pain,\u201d Emwazi told him as he held an antique scimitar to his neck.\nEmwazi, who is pictured wearing a mask in the ISIS beheading videos, also pulled out his gun, put it to his temple, and pressed the trigger, only for the terrified Espinosa to discover it wasn\u2019t loaded. He also forced prisoners to describe pictures of dead victims of previous executions, and choose whether they or their colleagues would be the first to be executed.\nEspinosa met humanitarian worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded last November, who described being physically tortured.\n\u201cWhen they realised I was American and that I had been a soldier in Iraq they went crazy,\u201d Kassig told the Spanish journalist.\nBut Espinosa admitted that Western hostages were treated better than locals, because they were valuable bargaining chips and public relations tools \u2013 even if for the spectacle of their deaths.\nAlthough his initial place of incarceration was in the basement of an Aleppo mansion, he was transferred to Raqqa, the ISIS capital. There, he and the other hostages heard constant beatings of captured Syrian soldiers and civilians from the other side of the wall, which often ended with gunshots, then silence.\nEspinosa\u2019s story mentions 23 foreigners, including he and Vilanova, who were being held hostage by the extremist group. Six of them have been executed, while another American hostage, Kayla Mueller, was allegedly killed in a US air raid. Fifteen of the hostages have been set free.\nGovernments of the countries from which the released men and women originated would typically neither confirm nor deny if a ransom was paid to set the individuals free. An unconfirmed report said that Italy paid 10 million euro ($12 million at the time) for the release of two young female aid workers.

She had to declare a major before being accepted, and wasn\u2019t sure yet what she wanted to do. Her parents suggested business, saying she couldn\u2019t really go wrong with that as a foundation for future success. But Cicoletti\u2019s first essay to the Haas School of Business was rejected, the administration requesting she be more specific about how she planned to apply her business degree. Foreshadowing her skill as a storyteller (and rebel), Cicoletti confesses to making her revised essay up, and being accepted.\nUpon graduation, her love of travel combined with a positive experience she\u2019d recently had working at Berkeley\u2019s Lair of the Golden Bear summer camp landed her at an orientation for the Peace Corps.

Attacks by jihadists on Christians in Africa and throughout the Middle East are so commonplace they barely get mentioned \u2013 one of the reasons people were so shocked when this type of attack was carried out in Europe.) There was something farcical in what the cameras filming the cinema construction team captured.

{"idx": "6412", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: When Dylan played Newport in 1965 he shocked the crowd. Will he do so again when he returns tomorrow?\nOn Saturday night Bob Dylan returns to the scene of the crime. For the first time since 1965 - when he appalled traditionalists by playing electrified rock'n'roll - he will be appearing at the Newport folk festival.\nHaving been Grammied, Clintoned and Poped, Dylan has no need of Newport's belated seal of approval. But it is a moment worth pausing over, especially now, with the hard rain headed Iraq's way.\nThe 16 minutes of music blasted out by Dylan on that summer night 37 years ago were to become, in the words of Dylan's biographer, Clinton Heylin, \"the most written-about performance in the history of rock\". And not without cause. Dylan's clash with the milieu from which he had emerged was high drama, and more. The moment was culturally, politically and commercially resonant - a fulcrum of the American 60s.\nHistory vindicated Dylan - and in short order. Like a Rolling Stone, booed at Newport, soared up the charts, detonating an explosion of pop music innovation and ambition (as well as pretension). But, unexpectedly, history may also end up vindicating Dylan's Newport opponents. One of those scandalised by the new sound was the folk archivist Alan Lomax, who died two weeks ago. Lomax's collections of American music were the foundations of Dylan's art. But when Dylan turned up the amps, all Lomax heard was a sellout to the forces the festival was supposed to challenge.\nThe festival had always been intertwined with the civil rights movement, giving northerners a taste of the freedom songs being sung on the frontline, and sending anthems such as Blowin' in the Wind back down south to expand the traditional repertoire. Also on the bill with Dylan that evening was Fannie Lou Hamer, not a singer but a Mississippi militant. Hamer was there because the festival organisers assumed the audience would share a political as well as a musical ethic. Indeed, to them, the two were one.\nA tenet of the folk revival was that young people should aspire not merely to consume but to participate - in music, in public life. In contrast to the manufactured sound of teen-targeted pop, folk promised something enduring, authentic and collective. Dylan himself had declared that folk music was \"the only true, valid death you can feel today\". In that context, as folk veteran Oscar Brand explained, \"the electric guitar represented capitalism\".\nIt sounds far-fetched today, but Lomax, as it turned out, had a point. Dylan's boundary-blurring rock'n'roll helped create a new record-buying constituency, a milestone in the construction of today's global music industry. Now dominated by a handful of giant media conglomerates, it is both more centralised and more socially segregated as executives calibrate the music to chime with consumer demographics. As Lomax feared, the demands of authenticity and political independence do indeed clash with those of commerce (ask George Michael).\n\"You don't need a weatherman to know the way the wind blows\" - but these days there is an army of well-paid weathermen advising us.

{"idx": "6413", "prompt": "Continue the following text: I appreciate the recently published, cleverly titled \u201cFirst, We Maslow, Then We Bloom\u201d column from Eagle County Schools Superintendent Philip Qualman. As an associate professor of teacher education at Colorado Mountain College, I congratulate the author for continuing the important conversation regarding standardized testing. Yes, it is time we \u201cevolve our thinking about standardized tests.\u201d However, I have some questions about the author\u2019s own thinking.\nMost of my questions revolve around the title, which, while clever, requires some unpacking. The author situates Maslow as a verb signifying \u201cwhole child\u201d education and Bloom as a verb signifying standardized testing. In regards to the title\u2019s temporality, the author seems to suggest that we are done Maslowing and are now ready to Bloom. This is hardly the case \u2014 not in Eagle, not anywhere. I do not mean to take away from the progress Eagle County has made in our commitment to the whole child (all noted by the author), but we have so much more work to do.\nWhen we say \u201cwhole child,\u201d what exactly do we mean? Are we only referring to the physical features of the child, using their skin as the defining ontological boundary? What about the child\u2019s history: their prior knowledge, their cultural background, the language they use at home, their relationships with the world around them? According to researchers of dynamic systems of identity, like Gregory Bateson and Lev Vygotsky, a concept like \u201cwhole child\u201d would have to include the social systems (e.g., relationships, beliefs, languages) in which the child exists.\nIt\u2019s the same way one cannot think about a marmot without also thinking about the tundra. And yet, the majority of the country insists on a standardized curriculum that makes difficult the inclusion of place-based education and cultural and linguistic diversity. As a result, children in much of the country celebrate Thanksgiving but do not understand the religious practices, social structures, or the ecological relationships of Native Americans.\nCurricula need to be standardized, after all, to remain aligned with the tests. To be clear, this is not to say tests are terrible. They are one perfectly valid form of assessment, but so are portfolios, presentations, poems, stories, performances, and so on. Leading cognitive scientists and educational psychologists, like Susan Brookhart and Robert and Elizabeth Bjork, have conclusively called for the use of multiple measures to provide a \u201cholistic view of a child.\u201d Currently, the national and local climates privilege a single assessment method \u2014 the standardized test \u2014 which directly opposes the very \u201cholistic view\u201d the author suggests we have met.\nMy final question has to do with the author\u2019s suggestion that proceeding onward into Bloom (i.e., standardized tests) will somehow not affect the Maslow we apparently just finished. Are we to say the standardized testing movement has not threatened the well-being of children? Haven\u2019t we all read Michelle Alexander, Jonathan Kozol, and Jesse Hagopian, educators and scholars who clearly demonstrate the ways standardized testing contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline, to performance segregation that privileges white, middle-class populations, and to the loss of creative, entrepreneurial thinking in schools?\nI want to reiterate that tests are not inherently bad. The very definition of assessment validity concerns the use of a test. Every test sets out to measure a particular construct, such as the levels of Bloom\u2019s cognitive domains: comprehension, analysis, or evaluation. Therefore, every test has a specific use based on the particular construct the test sets out to measure.\nLocal school districts must continue fighting for schools that"}

All 435 seats in the House of Representatives as well as 36 Senate seats are up for election in 2010, and most lawmakers want something tangible to take home, such as money for a highway or a new school, rather than promises to cut the federal deficit in half four years from now.\nThe president, however, must also navigate a legislative system that seems almost unfathomable, a Congress where it often takes weeks just to set up a hearing, let alone rewrite big chunks of the nation's tax code. And even if they're inclined to act, many lawmakers are reluctant to tear up policies and programs to start from scratch.\nFor instance, Obama this week emphasized again that he wants to end earmarks, or the local projects that lawmakers routinely insert into spending bills without having them scrutinized by the normal legislative process. Earmarks are controversial because they sometimes are favors for special interests and other times seem extravagantly wasteful, such as the infamous \"bridge to nowhere\" in Alaska.

{"idx": "6420", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Accomplished astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell has won a $US3 million ($4.1 million) Special Breakthrough Prize for her discovery of pulsars 50 years ago and continued leadership in science.\nBell Burnell has lived an accomplished life. Though best known for her discovery, she has become a leader in the field, serving in many top positions at well-known scientific organisations. She will use the prize money to begin a fund for students from underrepresented backgrounds.\nBell Burnell was a graduate student at the University of Cambridge reviewing observations from the Interplanetary Scintillation Array at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory when she noticed a strange radio signal. She calculated that it varied regularly with a 1.34-second period. Though first chalked up to \u201clittle green men,\u201d scientists have since determined that Bell Burnell had discovered the pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star sending out a beam of radiation like a lighthouse.\nToday, her discovery is widely considered one of the most important and exceptional in the history of astronomy. Pulsars now serve as vital astronomical tools for timekeeping, determining distances to map the universe, and measuring gravity. They were used to indirectly discover gravitational waves in 1974. We write about them all of the time.\nThe Special Breakthrough award mentions not only her pulsar discovery but her lifetime of leadership. Bell Burnell served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society, president of the Institute of Physics, and the first female president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s national academy of the sciences.\nThe Breakthrough Prize, whose sponsors include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and billionaire Yuri Milner, is a $US3 million ($4.1 million) prize awarded annually in December to scientists in the Life Sciences, Physics and Mathematics. However, the selection committee can award a Special Breakthrough prize whenever they\u2019d like. These special prizes need not be awarded for recent discoveries, as in Bell Burnell\u2019s case.\nBell Burnell told the BBC said she did not need the prize money, and hoped that the scholarship fund would counter \u201cunconscious bias\u201d in physics research. People of colour are largely underrepresented in the physics community. Women make up a fifth of the undergraduate physics majors, and have less than 5 per cent of the professor positions.\nSo, congratulations to Jocelyn Bell Burnell\u2014she deserves it."}

And you can do it from the comfort of your home.\nThese penguins live in Antarctica and other desolate places along the Southern Ocean. Adorable as they are, their nesting and migration patterns are changing lately. Scientists are concerned by the change because they\u2019re unsure of the cause. And, since these penguins live in such a harsh environment, it\u2019s difficult for researchers to track and monitor the penguins, much less get consistent, reliable data.\nTheir answer to that dilemma is Penguin Watch 2.0. It\u2019s an initiative that\u2019s part of the University of Oxford\u2019s Penguin Lifelines, a citizen science project geared toward ordinary, penguin-loving people everywhere. Using 50 satellite-linked cameras that take up to 96 images every day, the Oxford researchers have hundreds of thousands of penguin photos. That\u2019s more data than they can reasonably sort through on their own -- and that\u2019s where you can help.\nAnd you really can help them do just that. By clicking on some penguin pics.\nIndividually mark adult penguins, chicks, and eggs in the image by clicking on the center of each one's visible area. Sometimes just a head or tail is showing, other times you'll be able to mark the center of the chest/torso. We sometimes need you to mark up to 30 of each \u2014 and you can mark more if you want to.\nYou use the circles to classify different kinds of penguins (adults, eggs, and yes, babies). You can also use them to identify animals, plants, or other things that aren\u2019t penguins. After you\u2019ve determined how many penguins may or may not be in a picture. you can chat about it with the researchers and other volunteers on a message board. You can even share the image on social media.\nEvery penguin that people click on and count on the website - that\u2019s all information that tells us what's happening at each nest, and what's happening over time. Ultimately, we hope that our research can directly feed into policy as we build evidence to determine important regions for penguins and highlight specific colonies of concern.\nThe impact of this project - and other citizen science projects like it - can\u2019t be understated. The Internet really can help scientists observe and analyze massive amounts of data. It already is; Penguin Watch 2.0 is sponsored by Zooniverse, whose projects have produced many published research papers \u201cas well as several open-source sets of analyzed data,\u201d according to their site. Non-scientists are making science happen everyday while getting a first-hand, hands-on experience on doing science.\nPlus, as we\u2019ve already discussed, looking at adorable animals is scientifically proven to be good for your brain.

{"idx": "6424", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, comes across as a mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole. Overlong, talky, filled with meta references, and with a strangely low-energy tone, the movie never fully gels.\nTo give Shyamalan credit, he's not content to do a paint-by-numbers comic book movie but his ambitions exceed his abilities. In trying to develop themes about the differences between fantasy and reality and create a \"grounded\" superhero movie, he adds in characters who are either tangential, boring, or both. The interplay among the three leads - James McAvoy's The Beast, Willis' Dunn, and Samuel L. Jackson's Mr. Glass - is disappointingly perfunctory. McAvoy and Willis spend some time pounding on each other but, beyond that, there isn't much. Dunn and Mr. Glass have minimal interaction and, although Glass spends some time with The Beast, it's not especially meaningful.\nGlass picks up an unspecified time after Split. The multi-personality Kevin Crumb, now dominated by the superhuman Beast, is once again kidnapping girls. Security guard David Dunn, who works with his son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), has become Philadelphia's Batman - a shady vigilante who wanders the streets handing out justice without due process. He's on the search for Crumb and, when he finds him, there's a showdown that ends with both of them being taken into custody. They are transported to a maximum-security asylum to occupy rooms alongside a third special prisoner - Elijah Price a.k.a. Mr. Glass. The three are to be treated by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), a psychiatrist who specializes in \"superhero delusions.\" Her goal is to convince her patients that there's a difference between comic books and reality and no one in the \"real world\" has superpowers. Of course, she underestimates the three men and, while she lectures, the seemingly catatonic Mr. Glass teams up with The Beast and sets up a situation that forces Dunn's hand.\nOne of the problems with Glass is Sarah Paulson's character. Despite playing a crucial role, Dr. Staple is neither interesting nor dynamic. She's afflicted with verbal diarrhea and likes hearing herself pontificate about her philosophy of the demarcation line between what's real and what isn't. The movie also brings back three other characters - Joseph, Elijah's mother (Charlayne Woodard), and one of Crumb's victims, Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) - who don't seem to belong. Shyamalan might as well have put a neon sign over them all saying: \"Be Patient. They'll Eventually Be Important.\"\nGlass' superhero elements, although developed by someone who clearly understands comic books (although perhaps not as well as Kevin Smith), don't impress. The"}

They didn\u2019t need to, because they lived it.\nMost people lived in tight nuclear families, they knew their neighbors, they belonged to neighborhood churches, they participated in local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, they were members of school clubs and local service organizations like the Rotary Club, and people chose a career and stuck with it, often staying at the same job for all their adult life. These were all communities within communities connected to other communities.\nWithin this void has arisen social media and its many cousins that have created virtual communities where people with like interests and values can meet online and play a role in strengthening that community. That said, long-distance chatting with someone you know via only a digital photo and limited keystrokes can still leave an empty space where a sense of belonging, well, belongs.\nSometimes a person\u2019s desire to feel like they belong is put down as a sign of insecurity or neediness. It\u2019s not. Humans are social creatures and it\u2019s the most natural, basic thing in the world for us to want to be a member of a tribe , a pack or clan, and ignoring that need can be harmful.\nStudies have shown that the happiest and most content people are those who have a secure sense of community, or a sense of knowing they are valued members of a particular group.

Anders Behring Breivik\u2019s mass killings in Norway were followed by Tan Do\u2019s shooting of 5 family members and himself near Dallas. For me these events have brought 3 questions percolating to the top of my brain.\n#1 How does God respond to evil people?\n#2 Was Jesus an idiot? Does he just not understand evil, it\u2019s reality and power?\nOk, love your enemies. Jesus is wrong here, isn\u2019t he? Or painfully na\u00efve? Or speaking about another time (Hello Dispensationalists), or giving us an impossible ideal to make us feel rotten (Welcome home Lutherans) or (insert your favorite reason here_____). Bonhoeffer begs the question astutely asking, \u201cSurely we do not wish to accuse Jesus of ignoring the reality of evil (pg 144)?\u201d From Niebuhr on this has indeed been in vogue, ie, the irresponsibility of pacifism.\nJesus here is most assuredly NOT letting evil have its way! He is not being passive, or advocating a \u201cflight\u201d mentality. He is offering a third way between fight or flight which addresses evil head on: return evil with good. Consistent throughout the New Testament we find this same Christo-centric teaching.\nJesus gives us four examples of how to upend violence by doing good.\nExpose your violent attacker by turning the other cheek and demanding equal treatment.\nGive your cloak to one who unjustly demands the shirt off your back.\nGo the second mile when asked to go one.\nGive generously to all who ask.\nJesus teaches us to respond with goodness precisely because he does understand evil, perhaps more than anyone else in the history of humanity. He understood that violence grows when met with violence. The only way to \u201cdefeat\u201d an enemy is to stop having enemies altogether. In this way alone can the cycle of violence be overcome.\n#3 What kind of person do I need to become to love like this?\nOur typical response is to treat people how they treat us. We allow ourselves to drop down to the lowest common ethic and give our enemies (of all people!) permission to dictate how we will act. But Jesus reminds us anyone is capable of this ethic. It takes no faith, no grace, no sanctification to live like that! \u201cDo not even the Gentiles (and horrible bosses, jerks, and wall-street moguls!) do the same?\u201d Instead as Christians we are to respond based on who we are, not who they are. Bonhoeffer says, \u201cThe Christians behavior must be determined not by the way others treat him, but by the treatment he himself received from Jesus.\u201d And how has Jesus treated us?\nSomething is indeed wrong in our violent world. But Christ\u2019s precise response to evil is the only hope we\u2019ve got: goodness. A dear friend and member of Houston Mennonite Church wrote a Sending/Benediction for our summer worship series. I\u2019ll leave you with a favorite line: \u201cDo not be afraid of your own capacity for goodness.\u201d AMEN.

Intelligent cloud includes Microsoft's server and Azure cloud services, as well as the company's mobile enterprise business.\n\"Azure has been years in the making, and it's now a time where businesses are moving more data to the cloud,\" said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \"Microsoft benefited from consumers buying PCs, but the company has always been mostly focused on the enterprise.\"\nForrest, who serves as an assistant manager for the $50 million Fort Pitt Capital Total Return Fund (FPCGX - Get Report) , said Microsoft makes up 3.73% of the fund's holdings.\nThe strength of its cloud business helped Microsoft report a profit of 57 cents a share on revenue of $21.7 billion.

{"idx": "6443", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people.\nThe nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation\u2019s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.\nIn secondary and tertiary care, the policy moves from an input-oriented to an output-based strategic purchasing, which indicates an increased reliance on providing healthcare through the private sector. \u201cStrategic purchasing\u201d involves proactive decisions about which services should be purchased, how they should be purchased and from whom, rather than a \u201cpassive purchasing\u201d model under which pre-determined allocations are spent and bills are routinely reimbursed.\nThe policy envisages \u201cstrategic purchasing\u201d working in a stewardship role by directing private investment towards those areas and services for which currently there are few or no providers. Theoretically speaking, this is one of the key objectives of \u201cstrategic purchasing\u201d. This means services can be improved by linking plans and priorities to resource allocation and population health needs while customer expectations can be met by building into them purchasing decisions.\nBut the mechanics of \u201cstrategic purchasing\u201d will be long-drawn out and complex in the Indian environment, where the regulatory mechanism is weak, the private sector has grown fast and trust in the public sector health system is low. The increased reliance on the private sector, even if this is to be \u201cin the short-term\u201d (with no timeframe defined), then becomes an important thrust and change in direction that will mean a new territory for public health services.\n\u2022 India has one of the largest programmes of publicly financed antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs for HIV-affected persons. In addition, all drugs and diagnostics in vector borne disease control programmes, tuberculosis, leprosy, immunisation programmes and much of the maternity, newborn and infant care are free. Private sector contribution is limited in these areas.\n\u2022 The inability to cover the entire spectrum of healthcare needs through increased public investment has led to a rise in out of pocket expenditure and consequent impoverishment. Over 63 million persons are pushed to poverty every year due to healthcare costs.\n\u2022 In 2014, the average amount spent per child birth as inpatient in private hospitals was nine times that spent in public hospitals for both rural and urban areas across all quintiles.\n\u2022 Another concern is the denial of services by private hospitals for many categories of illnesses, and over supply of some services. Some hospitals, insurance companies and administrators have also resorted to various fraudulent measures.\n\u2022 There is evidence of supplier-induced demand and lack of standard treatment practices, leading to aberrations such as unnecessary injections, irrational treatment regimens and excessive medications being provided in the private medical sector.\nMany of these facts in the official document are sourced from non-government studies and reports, though each of them merits alarm bells that should make officialdom sit up and investigate. In reality, the picture may be worse. There have been indications of rank malpractices in some of the biggest names in the healthcare sector.\nAmong them are obnoxious systems that make in-patients go through diagnostics over weekends only to be charged extra because it is supposed to be a weekly holiday,"}

After participating in the program, kids have a clearer understanding computer science and a greater awareness of the possibilities the field opens up, she said.\n\"We are not trying to teach them to be computer scientists, but we are trying to help them feel more confident in using computers, to persevere when they are debugging things and help them understand the impact of computer science on the world,\" Johnson said.\nLorenzo Davis is a seventh-grader at Oakbrook Middle School in Ladson, S.C.

I was putting together a little rotator GIF for the top of the post, planning to talk about what is different about Paladins, but that damn Androxus image kept popping up, and I kept typing \"Overwatch\". It's a fair comparison. Both are character-centric team-based shooters, with heroes that look like Blizzard could have designed them, battling in objective-based game modes.\nThe difference is customisation. Paladins features a collectible card system that allows players to create a customised loadout of abilities and modifiers. Cards are found in chests earned through progression or purchase. Originally the cards were a choice given to players during matches, but since my initial impressions they have been changed to always-on mods, with a separate item purchase mechanic within matches.\nIt's quite fun, really. Not as tight as other games you may have watched over, but wonderfully playable.\nThe Paladins open beta is now available on Steam for free, along with a Founder's Pack (currently $US13.39 [$18]) that will give players a bunch of chests to open and access to every champion released for the game until the end of time.\nI'm sure this has been in development for quite some time and it's probably a coincidence. But in that trailer I couldn't help but think of Roadhog's hook and shotgun combo that is the bane of my existence when I play support.\nWhy doesn't somebody do something similar but not a shooter?\nOverwatch has fantastic character design & I'm fairly jealous hearing everyone else having a great time.\nI'll never play because it's a shooter.\nSurely you'd want to grab the crowd that isn't playing rather than trying to steal an existing crowd away.\nI dabble in single player shooters but they bore me to tears mostly.\nI've seen those other games and the character design didn't look as appealing as these two.\nThey're on my list of things to have a go of, but there's always something else I find more appealing.\nSo it's knockoff Overwatch with P2W elements. Yay!\nIt simply rotates it's heroes/characters like what League of Legends does, sure i would like access to all of the heroes for free but they have to make their money somehow right?\nAlso, you have to remember that Overwatch costs $70+ whereas you can get all of the (current) heroes in this game for about $15 along with some skins and such which isn't too bad considering it's amount of polish.\nU mean the game that came out before overwatch and has no p2w elements at all?\nIs there play of the game montages we see at the end of the match?\nThis isn't a 'knockoff of Overwatch'. Learn how game development works. This has been in development for quite some time. Just bad luck it came out after the Overwatch normiefest.\nThis looks like a pretty simple, low(ish) budget game that's only just going into beta. It's perfectly feasible that development started late enough to be \"inspired\" by OW. At the very least it's been tweaked to cash in on the OW hype.\nI'"}

The ump ended up face to face with Charlie Blackmon in the ninth inning after ringing up the center fielder on three called strikes that, according to Statcast, were all out of the zone.\nSo, with commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledging at the beginning of the season that Major League Baseball is \"much closer than we were a year ago\" to having implementable technology, why aren't Statcast-powered robots calling balls and strikes instead of Fletcher and his peers with, at times, amorphous zones?\nFor Rockies' manager Bud Black, a self-proclaimed pitching and baseball traditionalist, the implementation of a automated strike zone isn't an if but a when.\n\"When we talked about replay review, I was a little bit skeptical years ago, but I turned on that,\" Black said. \"Eventually, I think we're going to see (the automated zone).\"\nAdam Ottavino, one of the more out-of-the-box baseball minds in the Rockies' clubhouse, has often stated his support for an automated strike zone. He is of the popular position that the MLB should utilize the Statcast technology similar to how the league has incorporated replay review technology in order to make each and every call as correct as possible.\n\"Even if you are the best ump in the world and you are getting 92 percent of the calls right, that means if you have 200 pitches, there are 16 wrong,\" Ottavino told The Denver Post last September after an umpire's critical missed strike call. \"Those could be hugely impactful on the outcome of the game.\"\n\"Keep the umpires, even when they're horse (stuff),\" right fielder Carlos Gonzalez said.\nCatcher Chris Iannetta added: \"The game is based on subjectivity \u2014 it's part of the game, and it provides an entertainment factor, even though it can be frustrating if it doesn't go your way. It's a different layer and element to the game.\"\nThe measurement error of PITCHf/x, the tracking system used by the MLB prior to Statcast, was found to be below half an inch in each dimension, according to a 2011 report by analyst Mike Fast. No such reporting yet exists on the Statcast data, although it's interesting to note that the automated Zone Evaluation system used by the MLB to evaluate umpires has about a 2-inch margin for error.\n\"You can't rule out the emotional human factor of umpiring games, like when you make a borderline pitch a little off of the black that the robotic strike zone wouldn't call a strike but the umpire could give you,\" reliever Chad Bettis explained. \"Or, if you pitch to the glove, pitches spotted up just on the edge of the plate. That's where it gets questionable, because that's generally considered a strike, even by hitters.\"\n\"The trend has been if the fans speak loud enough for it, and if it's going to sell more tickets, then that's usually the direction they tend to go,\""}

State action must be emphatic to ensure that the human rights of people in Choc\u00f3 be respected, said Amnesty International.\nThe last early warning issued on 24 January by the Ombudsman\u2019s Office cautioned that, in the municipalities of Bojay\u00e1, Medio Atrato (Choc\u00f3) and Vig\u00eda del Fuerte (Antioquia), the risk of human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law persists and has gotten worse due to the \u201cstrong likelihood of armed clashes taking place in Afro-Colombian communities belonging to the Greater Community Council of the Comprehensive Farmers\u2019 Association of Atrato (Consejo Comunitario Mayor de la Asociaci\u00f3n Campesina Integral del Atrato, COCOMACIA) and on Indigenous reservations in these municipalities.\nThe Bojay\u00e1 massacre 16 years ago marked the beginning of a violent history in Colombia. Thousands of people were victims of clashes between the FARC and paramilitary groups, while the state took no measures to avoid this. Bojay\u00e1 is an emblematic case of the state\u2019s inability to protect communities living in armed conflict zones.

Statistics on murders and forced displacement, among other forms of violence that have arisen after the Peace Agreement was signed, are evidence of the re-victimization occurring in this area. With today\u2019s announcement that negotiations between the ELN and the government have been suspended, communities fear that the conflict is intensifying in the department, putting their lives and integrity at serious risk.\nIn a recent report, \u201cThe Years of Solitude Continue: The Peace Agreement and Guarantees of Non-Repetition in Choc\u00f3,\u201d Amnesty International warned that the environment of exclusion, neglect and invisibility of this territory, created by the Colombian state, reinforces these communities\u2019 vulnerable state without there having been a comprehensive institutional response beyond a merely military response.\nCommunities living in these areas have reported to Amnesty International that paramilitary structures are colluding with the state, and this has allowed them to realign within the context of implementing a Peace Agreement in the territories.\n\u201cThe state must take urgent measures so that a massacre similar to what took place in Bojay\u00e1 in 2002 does not occur again in Colombia.

After he gave a speech at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Republican Club, a usually staid establishment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, his Proud Boys fought with members of antifa on the streets, in what has been a publicity coup.\nThe group got denounced by New York Gov.

Then he came to realize, no, the mayhem itself was the point.\nThe violence of the Proud Boys has additional allure to a certain audience. It can be portrayed as merely defense against antifa goons. It is simple, and requires no effort at argument or persuasion. It is taken as a symbol of strength \u2013 the Proud Boys supposedly always win their fights.\nNeedless to say, this is all poisonous. You can oppose antifa without brawling with it \u2013 one mob does not justify another. Violence outside the law is always wrong.

In celebration, Bravo-Young spiked his headgear, which cost the Nittany Lions a team point for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nAt 141 pounds, No. 2 Joey McKenna brought a 5-2 lead over No. 6 Nick Lee into the third period before Lee escaped and took him down to tie it.

He took down McKenna three times in the bout, a rematch of a thriller in last season\u2019s dual, which McKenna won 7-6.\nJared Verkleeren made his fourth straight start at 149 pounds over Brady Berge at 149. He met No. 3 Micah Jordan in a wild, back-and-forth bout. Late in the third period, Verkleeren took down Jordan to tie the score 8-8 but fell behind after a stalling call. Jordan escaped after the stall to extend his lead to 10-8 and help the Buckeyes cut the Nittany Lions\u2019 lead down to 5-3.\nNo. 1 Jason Nolf dominated No. 6 Ke-Shawn Hayes for six minutes before winning by technical fall. Nolf won 21-6 after taking Hayes down eight times and piling up two and a half minutes of riding time.\nNo. 1 Vincenzo Joseph rolled past No. 6 Te\u2019Shawn Campbell with an 11-2 major decision to make the team score 14-3 at the intermission.

I lived there for a while. I wrote some big songs there. I wrote Every Breath You Take there. But I hadn\u2019t been in 20 to 25 years. So Shaggy took me back to do a concert for this (Bustamante) Hospital (for Children) that he funds and has for 16 to 17 years and we raised a million dollars for some ICUs.

Sage, which has been providing small and medium businesses with business software for more than 35 years, is planning to launch a chatbot this summer. This will help anyone from freelancers to small business owners manage invoices and expenses. Send the bot a picture of a receipt, for example, and it will store this away with your expenses claims.\nKriti Sharma, who built the bot for Sage, says one of the challenges has been ensuring that it is not annoying. She has spent considerable time thinking about how the bot should react in different situations. Ms Sharma was keen to avoid a fiasco like Microsoft\u2019s Tay chatbot, which was taught to parrot hate-filled posts by Twitter users.\nSwear at it and the Sage bot responds with a sad face emoji and says \u201cI\u2019d rather talk about accounting\u201d. Tell the bot you love it and it says you have excellent taste before gently steering you back to accounting. The responses sound remarkably similar to the self-deprecating but quietly determined way that Ms Sharma herself speaks.\n\u201cWe are very careful about the frequency with which the bot responds, and we have built the personality over time,\u201d says Ms Sharma. \u201cI now need to hire someone to take this further \u2014 a bot personality trainer.\u201d Such a person might be a creative writer rather than a technical specialist, she says.\nA vision of a future job flashes in front of me: as newspapers shed journalist jobs in the face of declining ad revenues we are gradually rehired as microcopy writers providing the \u201cvoice\u201d for robot interactions.\nCompanies would do well to invest in bot personalities.

While my formal job is as a management professor at a business school in China, my educational background and experience has been in political science, the US Air Force, and individual, group and organizational psychology as a Leadership Professor at a European management institute for 25 years.\nI\u2019ve been working in China for only a year-and-a-half, but I\u2019ve generally been unimpressed with academic articles and cases on business in China. They\u2019re generally focused on cheerleading celebrity CEOs and very large business deals \u2014 for example, Jack MA and the impending Alibaba IPO. But I\u2019ve been even less impressed by the typical American commentary that criticizes China and Chinese leadership while demonstrating a remarkably obvious ignorance, paranoia, and hypocrisy. An example is the July 10 commentary of Fox News\u2019 Bob Beckel: \u2018Chinese are the single biggest threat to the national security of the US. Do you know what we just did? As usual, we bring them over here and teach a bunch of Chinamen, uh, Chinese people, how to do computers, and then they go back to China and hack us.\u2019 Ignorance and hypocrisy are not a great way to report events \u2014 nor are they a great way to lead a corporation or a country. Reporting uninformed opinion as fact is irresponsible and misleading. And there\u2019s a lot of irresponsible and misleading reporting on China happening lately.\nThe business school where I work, CEIBS, has campuses in Shanghai and Beijing, and smaller operations in Shenzhen (nestled close to Hong Kong). It\u2019s a couple hours flight between the three cities. In the past two weeks I\u2019ve taught at all three locations \u2014 a CEO program, two EMBA programs, and an MBA program. Do you know what I noticed travelling back and forth from Shanghai to Beijing and Shenzhen?\nThe drivers picked me up in a General Motors Buick van, in a Buick sedan, and in an Audi A6. I flew on Air China and Shenzhen airlines in Boeing 737s. In fact, I\u2019ve flown only Boeing and Airbus aircraft on Chinese airlines in the year-and-a-half I\u2019ve worked here. The Chinese airports are the most modern and efficient that I\u2019ve been in. They make other airports like JFK and LA look like airports from developing countries. At the airports, I saw Chinese teenagers and businessmen and women on their iPhones and Samsung mobiles. On my flight to Shenzhen, the guy sitting next to me was taking pictures out the window of the Boeing 737 with his Apple iPad. He couldn\u2019t speak much English and I couldn\u2019t speak much Mandarin but we managed to get some good cloud shots at sunset.\nThe highways from the airports make the British and American highway system look antiquated. It takes the Chinese months, not years, to build a state-of-the-art highway with well-designed and well-constructed overpass systems. The Chinese bullet trains make AMTRAK and the British rail system look like a 19th century holdover. The cars I saw on the superhighways were all American, European, South Korean, or Japanese. The Shangri La hotel in Shenzhen has Colgate toothpaste \u2014 and so does Air China in their in-flight kits. And Bob Beckel and those who share his views claim China is a threat to US national security? You\u2019ve got to be kidding."}

My first thought upon receiving this huge increase was that the airport must really be in a financial bind. A review of the airport finances shows a cash position in excess of $1.5 million and 2018 receipts on track this year to produce $400,000 in excess of expenses,\u201d he said.\nTurner said his current lease is for 20 years, and he would prefer to see it stay at 20 years.\n\u201cThese hangars are major investments for many of the owners and a five year lease greatly devalues the hangars. When trying to sell a hangar, a new buyer would have a problem financing a hangar with only a five year lease. A five year lease discourages improvements and proper upkeep of the properties. At the last authority meeting, two new hangar builders were given 30 year leases,\u201d he said in a statement provided to The Citizen prior to the meeting.\nTurner also added the rate would be nearly twice what is charged at Coweta\u2019s airport, based on a square foot calculation.\nHe said there would also be an additional fee of 10 percent charged.\n\u201cThe new lease requires that in addition to the ground lease payment lessees shall also pay the airport 10 percent of all revenue taken in on the property. If I rent hangar space to other aircraft, I must charge at least 75 percent of what the airport charges in their large hangar. This is to be paid monthly and it is my responsibility to find out each month what the airport is charging their renters,\u201d he wrote in his statement.\nTurner suggested freezing the lease proposals until issues could be worked out with the tenant.\nAirport Authority members usually do not comment on issue brought as a public comment, but member Allen Morrison said he did want to address the issue.\n\u201cI agree with what you\u2019re saying. I think we should have workshops. If we present something to the FAA that is reasonable they would accept it,\u201d Morrison said to a crowd that applauded his comments.\nAn amazing job of capturing the spirit and core complaints of the many, many tenants who have supported this airport through the years during both good and BAD times.

When it comes to ordinary people scraping together pennies to give to children\u2019s hospitals or donkey sanctuaries, this is unquestionably true. Yet when it comes to wealthy individuals using large slices of their fortunes to make transformative donations to institutions such as universities and schools, we are a long way behind America.\nWhere are the Carnegies, the Rockefellers? We do have wealthy donors, but they are generally on a much smaller scale, and quite often feel inclined to make their donations anonymously, as if it were an embarrassment to be seen to be acting with generosity.\nThe donation of \u00a3100 million to Cambridge University by one of its Natural Sciences graduates, David Harding, will hopefully prove to be a watershed. The single biggest donation ever made by a British citizen to the university, it will be used to fund 100 PhD students at a time, drawn from around the world and with the emphasis on under-represented groups. More PhDs will lead to more innovation and business start-ups. It allows Cambridge to take a huge leap towards widening participation \u2014 something which it has tried hard to achieve but has struggled with.\nDavid Harding is not a household name, though his profession is sufficient in itself to have earned him a little notoriety. He made his fortune from managing hedge funds, setting up the investment house Winton. He represents, in other words, one of the chief bogeymen of our age. Since the financial crash of a decade ago, the very words \u2018hedge fund\u2019 have been enough to provoke a curl of the lip in many people. Those who run hedge funds stand accused \u2014 not unreasonably in some cases \u2014 of profiting from economic misery, and running off with the proceeds to palm-fringed tax havens.\nThe idea that hedge funds create easy pickings for amoral speculators has never been accurate \u2014 many hedge funds have lost their investors a great deal of money. With large rewards always comes the risk of equally large losses.\nYet the absence of hedge fund billionaires from civic life has provided much fuel for those, such as Jeremy Corbyn, who claim that the wealthy are not fiscally pulling their weight. The narrative that financiers made fortunes and then left ordinary people to pay for the damage wrought by \u2018casino capitalism\u2019 has succeeded in gaining a lot of traction, and has led voters to contemplate electing a Labour party which promises punitive wealth taxes \u2014 something which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.\nHow different things might be were there more David Hardings prepared to put their wealth into worthwhile social causes. Harding is putting his money to work on something which Corbyn would surely approve of: investing in the widening of education, and through that in the economic future of Britain \u2014 yet without the money having to be first confiscated by the government.\nWould it be better if the taxman had intervened and extracted the money from Harding involuntarily? Absolutely not. For one thing, Harding, who is believed to be worth \u00a31 billion, will already be paying huge sums in tax, helping to fund general public expenditure. With his donation to Cambridge University comes the benefit of his financial judgment. He would not have grown so wealthy if he had not developed a keen nose for what makes good and bad investments.\nNow he is putting his expertise to good use by focusing on what he has discerned to be an effective form of spending on education. To encourage wealthy individuals to spend their own money on social causes (rather than have the government tax them to the hilt"}

Why should I enroll?\nA. Health insurance is extraordinarily important to your family's health and overall well-being, and will keep you healthier.\nAlso, there is great peace of mind in knowing that you and your family are covered not just for routine preventive care but also against catastrophic injury or illness.\nUnexpected medical bills are a leading cause of financial stress. And if you don't sign up for health insurance, under the law you may have to pay a penalty.\nQ. Am I eligible to enroll through New York State of Health?\nA. To enroll for health insurance through the state marketplace, a consumer must live in New York and must be a U.S. citizen, national or lawfully present immigrant (different immigration rules may apply for people eligible for Child Health Plus or Medicaid). Enrollees also cannot be currently incarcerated.\nQ. I already enrolled at New York State of Health last year. Do I have to sign up again?\nA. People who enrolled last year in a Qualified Health Plan and have not had any changes to their personal information will be automatically reenrolled in the same plan.\nMany people who were enrolled in insurance in 2014 were automatically reenrolled for 2015. If you were not, you may need to update your information.\nIf you do need to update your information or aren't sure, you should go to the state health insurance marketplace at nystateofhealth.ny.gov and log into your account.\nQ. What will health insurance cost?\nA. Many New Yorkers enrolling at New York State of Health can qualify for tax credits to help pay for monthly Qualified Health Plan insurance premiums. An individual may qualify for tax credits if he or she earns up to $45,900 a year; a family of four can qualify while earning up to $94,200 a year.\nIn addition to tax credits, residents may also be eligible for assistance for co-pays, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.\nThe marketplace website will also help determine if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage from Medicaid or Child Health Plus.\nQ. How can I apply?\nA. You don't need a computer. Consumers are encouraged to apply online, at the site nystateofhealth.ny.gov, but they can also apply over the phone or in person.\nThe marketplace has a helpline open Monday to Saturday at (855) 355-5777.\nMarketplace-facilitating enrollers, navigators, brokers, agents and assistors are available to help people enroll in the exchange in many different languages."}

The mid-game ceremony has become familiar to Orioles fans during a well-orchestrated three-week countdown, but the sellout crowd of 46,804 exploded into an emotional 5-minute, 20-second ovation when an illuminated No. 2,130 was unfurled on the wall of the B&O; warehouse.\nThe record -- once seemingly unapproachable -- should fall tonight when the Orioles close out a three-game series with the California Angels, but it would be hard to imagine a more perfect evening than the one in which Ripken had three hits, three fifth-inning curtain calls and joined in a home run barrage that carried the Orioles to an 8-0 victory. Even the final score was a perfect tribute to No. 8.\n\"I'm not in the business of scriptwriting,\" Ripken said afterward, \"but that would have been a pretty good one.\"\nRipken, who has been in the starting lineup without interruption since May 30, 1982, came through the game without a bruise, making No. 2,131 pretty much a foregone conclusion.\nPitcher Scott Erickson helped assure the happy ending with a three-hit shutout, but who's going to remember the score 30 years from now?

With Fire TV you simply speak the title, actor, or genre into the remote and you're done.\"\nA remote with a microphone won't be enough for Amazon to win the streaming device wars, though.\nAt a press event in Manhattan, Amazon differentiated Fire TV by reading snippets of negative user reviews of other streaming media gadgets from Amazon.com. The complaints called out competitors like Google (GOOG) (maker of Chromecast), Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and Vizio by name.\nThe company said it identified three big issues that make streaming devices \"too frustrating:\" inadequate search tools, sluggish performance and closed ecosystems of apps.\nPeter Larsen, an Amazon vice president called Fire TV \"tiny\" and \"incredibly powerful.\"\nOne feature, called ASAP, predicts what TV episodes a user might watch next, and \"queues them up so that they start instantly,\" Larsen said.\nFire TV may help advance Amazon's streaming TV ambitions. The company has started to introduce original shows, like \"Alpha House\" and \"Betas,\" and has spent handsome sums of money to secure exclusive rights to other shows, like past seasons of Fox's \"24.\" But its streaming service is a fraction of the size of Netflix (NFLX)'s library.\nTo underscore the point that Fire TV doesn't just exist to support its Amazon Prime service, the demonstration showed off non-Amazon programs like NBC's \"Chicago Fire.\"\n\"It's the easiest place to watch Netflix,\" Larsen said pointedly.\nThe event also included a highlight reel for Amazon Studios' original shows, including a second season of \"Alpha House,\" which is in production now.\n\"Customers are loving these shows,\" Larsen said.\nAmazon highlighted Fire TV's easy access to its children's programming interface, called FreeTime, and music and photos.\nIn what amounts to an important move into gaming, Fire TV doubles as a casual gaming console; Amazon says it will have a library of thousands of games available to users, some free and others that exist as paid apps.

While it is important to highlight this topic, it is not important enough to warrant two articles.\nIn recent discussions on the relative happiness of people based on their religiosity, one of the points raised on why religious folk might be generally happier than non-religious folk is the sense of belonging that comes from \u201cchurch\u201d membership.\nI also noticed over the past year or so (especially when Rapport still had its own website) that there are a few atheists who belong to some kind of religious organisation, apparently because the fundamentals of said organisation is compatible with their atheism and grounded in science. So I thought, well hey, let\u2019s see if there is something worthwhile in the Theosophical Society (TS hereafter). Sense of belonging and all that.\nTo my shame, in retrospect, I ended two of my articles with the TS catch phrase \u201cThere is no religion higher than the truth\u201d and alluded to it in another. It sounded so virtuous, until I realised that firstly truth can be very relative and secondly the TS is as kooky as any other vanilla religious organisation, despite their deceptive motto.\nUsually whenever something tickles my fancy, I quickly scan the Wikipedia page. It generally gives an OK high-level overview and the accuracy is usually not too far off. Consulting the links and references at the bottom of every page is recommended though. Well, the Wikipedia page sketched a pretty woowoo picture.\nNot wanting to put my complete trust in or base my opinion on a Wikipedia page, I went to the source material itself. Considering that Helena Blavatsky\u2019s material is often and reverently quoted, that seemed the place to start. The local TS here in SA appear quite keen on her brand of Theosophy. Armed with the electronic copies, I waded through The Key to Theosophy, as well as some way through her magnum opus, Isis Unveiled. Magnum is indeed the operating word here, as the PDF is 1216 pages long. I tried but could not read the whole thing in minute detail, because the rational mind can only take so much woowoo. Licking a few brightly coloured frogs might have assisted further reading, but it really did not seem worth the effort. The Secret Doctrine was simply too much nonsense parading itself as encyclopaedic to be taken seriously without being hopelessly lost in the clutches of either mind-altering drugs, religion or both.\nI will now highlight some of the hilarity that makes up this religion.\nIn short, this is a Christmas vomit conflation of all the major religions, served with a side order of oriental mystical gravy, drizzled with a dash of conspiracy theory and topped off with a drop of superiority complex. The word \u201cesoteric\u201d is readily employed and any time someone starts dusting off that word, my BS alarm goes off. Noisily.\nThe aforementioned BS alarm goes nuclear whenever people start talking about reincarnation. I find the core acceptance of reincarnation peculiar, especially given the \u201cno religion higher than truth\u201d mantra. If truth (whatever and whose they mean by it) is so important, why is there no scientific evidence for reincarnation? At all. Why the need for a section called \u201cWhy do we not remember our past lives?\u201d in The Key to Theosophy, if not for justification of religious woowoo and some textbook special pleading?\nLet\u2019s take a few quotes from their holy"}

{"idx": "6506", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism.\nLast week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the \"free development\" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create \"growth and prosperity\" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration.\nThe proposal has elicited mixed reactions. Some have seen it as a novel economic proposition to stem a complex political challenge. Building on existing economic arrangements like Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Economic Processing Zones (EPZs), they argue that this would simply be the next stage in the evolution in the idea that economic exclaves that protect industries from the ravages of the open economy are the best way to stimulate growth. Now, instead of jeans and sneakers, we want to optimise people - or at least labour - by protecting them from the realities and ravages of their societies.\nUnderstandably, there has also been considerable pushback. The word \"colonialism\" has been raised, with critics arguing that Germany, especially, with its history of violent colonialism and genocide in Namibia, Cameroon, Tanzania and Togo, has no moral authority to even table such an idea. More broadly, many African countries are still struggling to recover from the damage from European colonisation. In many African countries, land tenure is still irregular and skewed to wealthy and often white minorities, engendering generational economic exclusion. Many African economies have failed to move beyond the extractive, labour intensive economies they inherited from their European counterparts. The violence of colonisation is still very present in Africa - should we really be talking about a new, trendy colonialism that only really hopes to address Europe's paranoia about a possible invasion by black bodies?\nThe easiest way to get to the heart of what's wrong with this proposal is to go back to basics - what is colonialism and why is it bad? The dictionary defines colonialism as \"a policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically\". Ultimately, it's about exploiting a power differential in order to reorganise one society for the economic and social benefit of another: saying that one society's economic and social imperatives are more important than the other's.\nSo, Nooke's proposal is fundamentally hipster colonialism - attempting to reclaim colonialism by couching it in neoliberal trends or ideology while advocating for a return to an essentially exploitative system of social and economic organisation. Many of those speaking in favour of this proposal do so it in sterile and agnostic terms, focusing on the economic dimensions and the potential financial growth and leaving out the most important element - the people involved and affected. Underneath this is a reductive premise that human beings, and Africans specifically, are not as fully actualised human beings who deserve holistic life experiences - Africans are just labour or economic opportunities.\nYet human beings are not just labour - we are complex, social and interconnected beings whose needs cannot just be collapsed into money. \"We do not want to be reminded that it is we, the indigenous people, who are poor and exploited in the land of our birth. These are concepts which the Black Consciousness approach wishes to eradicate from the black man's mind before our society is driven to chaos by irresponsible people from Coca-"}

Angry rhetorical bluster about \u201celites\u201d from the right might sting but the pain quickly recedes once the massive tax cuts and deregulatory medicine kicks in. What could actually cause more permanent pain is a left populism that directly threatens their economic interests and political power.\nNeoliberal elites like the Koch brothers try to build up the \u201ccentrist\u201d opposition, including the \u201cpro-business\u201d camp in the Democratic party, by seducing them with much-needed cash for the undoubtedly brutally competitive 2020 Democratic primaries. And they try to convince both elites and masses that \u201cextremist\u201d ideas like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 70% marginal tax rate or Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for all will drive away \u201cmoderate\u201d voters and, therefore, enable Trump to be re-elected.\nIn addition to carping from the aforementioned self-appointed billionaire saviors of American capitalist democracy, there has been a wave of less pubic lobbying by the rich and corporate leaders to get candidates like Joe Biden to run with a more \u201cbipartisan\u201d message than the progressive populism that is increasingly nudging the early field of Democratic presidential candidates left to embrace Medicare for all, a Green New Deal, free college, and (gasp) robust taxes on the rich to level the playing field for working Americans.\nProgressives who want to see significant policies to address economic inequality, universal healthcare, and the climate crisis should be buoyed by the trembling in elite circles. It\u2019s a sign that the left is finally winning the war of ideas by embracing bold policies that seek to return the Democratic party to its proud New Deal era legacy and away from the failed neoliberalism of more recent history. As Paul Krugman pointed out last week, despite Trump and company\u2019s hysterical fear mongering, most of what is being decried as a slippery slope to totalitarianism is simply the kind of policy that exists and works in social democracies in other, quite free and less unequal countries like Denmark and Sweden .\nSo progressives should be happy that they have changed the national political narrative; but they should also be clear-eyed in their choices and make sure that they follow the money, connect the dots, and don\u2019t end up settling for a candidate that talks left and walks corporate.\n2020 will be the election of our lifetimes, and we needn\u2019t just beat Trump.

Think again.\nWhen Vice President Al Gore unveiled the Clinton administration's new initiative to curb urban sprawl last week, you could sense both the peril and the promise in the move. That is, if you noticed it at all.\nGore announced the administration's \"Livability Agenda\" just as the Senate took up President Clinton's impeachment trial, when the Washington press corps was busy chasing down every last nuance of Sen. Trent Lott's ruminations and ignoring everything else. The White House, meanwhile, was busy trying to produce headlines that had nothing to do with impeachment: Gore presiding over a summit on \"21st Century Skills for 21st Century Jobs\"; Gore announcing 20 new \"Empowerment Zones\"; Gore convening an international forum on \"reinventing government.\" And of course, on Tuesday came the State of the Union address, in which Clinton once again buried the country in a slew of proposals -- including his \"Livability Agenda\" -- that would have had trouble competing with each other for attention in even the most placid of times.\nBut the proposals Gore outlined to curtail urban sprawl are worth noticing. Specifically, he laid out a plan to offer $700 million in tax credits to support \"Better America Bonds\" that will help restore urban parks, protect green space, improve water quality and clean up old industrial sites; boost spending on public transit and regional attempts to find alternatives to highways; and spend about $50 million to help metropolitan areas figure out how to \"grow smarter\" -- to avoid sprawl and put money back into existing roads, schools and sewers.\nMost media coverage of Gore's announcement played it as the first feel-good moment of the upcoming presidential campaign. But Gore's \"livability\" proposals were both cannier and riskier than the reporting suggested. For what the vice president has done is to join a battle that is really about the ways wealth and poverty etch themselves on our political landscape.\nYet Gore's proposals put him at the confluence of anti-sprawl currents that have been gaining force over the last several years. They strike a chord with urban neighborhood activists who are tired of watching limited public resources get spent on spanking new facilities 10 miles out of town. They appeal to suburbanites who resent spending twice as much time getting to work each morning as they did five years ago, even though the distance they travel is the same. They clearly play to environmentalists, for whom sprawl has become the next big battle. They even have an audience among farmers, who have discovered that their new neighbors in those split-levels next door have been complaining to local officials about manure-spreading at 5 in the morning.\nAll of that has the makings of a fine electoral coalition. But there's a hitch. \"Sprawl\" is not just about building indistinguishable new subdivisions with spaghetti-like road systems and houses whose most obvious feature is the garage. It is also about the far more personal matter of where we live and why, and it brings up uncomfortable questions with no easy answers: the fate of central cities, older suburbs and the people who live in them; our conflicted feelings about urban schools; the inequities of public spending and our rank failure to address them; the fact that suburban life, even for committed urbanites, is so enticingly cushioned.

It was the first time any ballclub had ever organized such an extensive celebration for the anniversary of the facility in which it played. The Red Sox developed the first ballpark anniversary logo in MLB history for the event, which was worn on Red Sox uniforms throughout the entire year and was used on special publications and commemorative merchandise. On April 20, 1987, the 75th anniversary of the ballpark's first regular season game, the Red Sox recreated pre-game ceremonies from that historic first game in 1912.\nDespite plans for such a grand celebration of Fenway Park, the heartbreak of the 1986 World Series still clung to the hearts of Red Sox Nation and 1987 started with a pair of sour contract issues. Catcher Rich Gedman enjoyed a quality season in 1986 but didn't receive a single offer when he entered free agency. Gedman was more or less forced to re-sign with the Red Sox and couldn't even do that until May 1. It was later determined that Major League Baseball had engaged in collusion and Gedman, along with a number of other players ,received a settlement payment. Roger Clemens, meanwhile, walked out of spring training and demanded more money from the team as part of a holdout.\nAfter a disappointing season-opening road trip, Bruce Hurst won the home opener with a 3-0, three-hitter. Clemens made his 1987 debut the following game and promptly surrendered four runs in four innings. When he was removed from the game, Clemens received hearty boos from the Fenway Park crowd who was still angry about the right-hander's holdout.\nClemens managed to turn his season around and won his second straight Cy Young award with a 20-9 record, seven shutouts and a 2.97 ERA. On the offensive side, Wade Boggs earned his fourth batting title with a .363 batting average and 200 hits and Dwight Evans supplied the power with career bests in home runs (34) and RBIs (123). The individual accolades were nice but the team fared poorly and couldn't even win half their games.

Jay Inslee on Friday formally launched a campaign for president that he said would seek to mobilize the country around an ambitious plan to combat climate change.\n\"I'm running for president because I am the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation's number one priority,\" Inslee said in a video announcement released early Friday morning.\nThe video, titled \"Our Moment,\" features images of Puget Sound and forest fire devastation, as well as archival TV footage of Inslee, a two-term Democrat, talking about climate change going back to his days in Congress.\n\"We have an opportunity to transform our economy, run on 100 percent clean energy that will bring millions of good-paying jobs to every community across America, and create a most just future for everyone,\" Inslee says in the video.\nInslee is calling his effort \"America's Climate Mission.\"\nIn announcing his bid, Inslee, 68, became the first governor to join a growing Democratic field dominated by U.S. senators. He also became the first serious candidate for president from Washington in more than four decades. The last was Sen. Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully in 1972 and again in 1976.\nIn addition to the video, Inslee is scheduled to hold a 10 a.m. announcement of his campaign at A&R Solar, a solar installation company in south Seattle.\nInslee has been positioning himself for a run for president for months. In October, the governor quietly registered a federal political action committee called Vision PAC, which has so far raised $242,680. In January, he visited New Hampshire, which holds the nation\u2019s first presidential primary election. Inslee has also been a frequent guest on cable news programs and been the subject of profiles and coverage in The Atlantic, The Washington Post and other publications.\nIn a statement Thursday, prior to the announcement, Caleb Heimlich, the chair of the Washington State Republican Party called Inslee\u2019s candidacy a \u201cvanity run for the White House\u201d and called on him to resign as governor.\n\u201cGov.

Lumpish, with stunted pectoral fins that they use for ponderously slow swimming in cold and dark Arctic waters, they have blunt snouts and gaping mouths that give them an unfortunate, dull-witted appearance. Many live with worm-like parasites that dangle repulsively from their corneas. They belong, appropriately enough, to the family Squalidae, and appear as willing to gorge on fresh halibut as on rotting polar-bear carcasses. Once widely hunted for their liver oil, today they are considered bycatch. For some fishermen, a biologist recently told me, netting a Greenland shark is about as welcome as stepping in dog poop.\nAnd yet the species has an undeniable magnetism. It is among the world\u2019s largest predatory sharks, growing up to eighteen feet in length, but also among its most elusive. Its life history is a black box, one that researchers have spent decades trying in vain to peer inside. Where do Greenland sharks mate? What is their global range and population structure? And, most enticing of all, how long do they live? A study begun in the nineteen-thirties suggested that the species\u2019s lifespan might well be extraordinary, based on the slow growth rate of a single shark that a scientist was lucky enough to catch twice. Verifying this, however, proved nearly impossible. To determine age in other sharks, biologists count the growth rings on their fin spines and vertebrae. But Greenland sharks have no hard tissues in their bodies; even their vertebrae are soft. The longevity question seemed unanswerable.\nThe mystery might have lingered were it not for the work of three Danish scientists\u2014a physicist named Jan Heinemeier and two marine biologists, John Fleng Steffensen and Julius Nielsen. Nine years ago, Heinemeier and four of his colleagues published a paper on lens crystallines, a class of proteins found in the human eye. Like all organic molecules, crystallines contain carbon, including trace amounts of the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Unlike other proteins, which undergo constant recycling and replenishment, crystallines remain stable throughout a person\u2019s life; they are envelopes sealed at birth, their contents an artifact from the womb. And, if crystallines are the envelopes, then carbon-14 is the postmark. The isotope has always occurred naturally on Earth, formed wherever incoming cosmic rays strike the atmosphere, but some of the current supply also comes from nuclear-weapons tests. The level fluctuates from year to year, and that means that every given time period has its own carbon-14 signature. (There was a particularly huge spike, called the bomb pulse, in the nuke-happy heyday of the fifties and sixties.) Experimenting on cadavers\u2019 lenses, Heinemeier found that he could measure how much carbon-14 they contained and use it to determine the deceased\u2019s date of birth.\nHeinemeier\u2019s paper made no mention of Greenland sharks. He and his co-authors did note, however, that their lens technique might be useful in the field of forensics. Not long after the study was published, Heinemeier received a request from police in Germany. They needed his help cracking"}

What\u2019s the basic plot here?\nMark Alpert: Well, the book is a science thriller about brain machine interfaces, which are electronics that are put into the brain so that basically it can communicate with machines. You have different types. You have chips that are attached to the motor cortex of the brain, and they can direct prosthetic arms, and these are actually being tested now. The first human tests are being conducted right now at the University of Pittsburgh. And then there are other types of chips that are implanted next to a damaged retina that can actually receive video from a camera that\u2019s hidden within a pair of sunglasses and actually reproduce the video images on a grid of electrodes and send those signals through the optic nerves to the brain, and it will actually partially restore eyesight for some people who have lost eyesight because of retinitis pigmentoso or macular degeneration.\nSteve Mirsky: Again, those actually happening now.\nMark Alpert: Right, these are \u2013 that device is actually on the market already in Europe, and it\u2019s up for FDA approval here in the US.

The 2008 season ended with an 11\u20135 record, but no playoff berth as the Patriots lost Tom Brady for the campaign in the first game. The 2009 season ended in a crushing loss to the Baltimore Ravens in a game where the Patriots never had a lead. The 2010 playoffs ended in even more brutal fashion with a lopsided divisional-series loss to the archrival New York Jets only a month after crushing them, 45\u20133, on Monday Night Football.\nAs a lifelong red-blooded New Englander, I do not hide my deep and abiding man-crush on Tom Brady, the first true Boston sports hero since Larry Bird. So it pains me deeply to write that the future Hall of Fame quarterback is the common denominator in each of the losses above.\nIn the Super Bowl against the Giants, New England had less than 100 passing yards in the first half, and Brady looked tentative all night. He started the Ravens game with a fumble, a three-and-out, and two interceptions, finishing with a dismal QB rating of 49.1. For context, Brady\u2019s career QB rating is 96.4, fourth-best in NFL history. On January 17, 2011, USA Today covered the game against the Jets with the headline, \u201cPatriots\u2019 loss shines light on Tom Brady\u2019s playoff woes.\u201d The Boston Herald noted that Brady\u2019s vision of the field and open receivers seemed to shrink during the game.\nThis year, the Patriots ended the regular season with a 13-3 record and once again had Wildcard Weekend off. Against the Denver Broncos in second-round action, Brady had the kind of game we remember from the glory days. With 26 of 34 passing for 363 yards and an NFL-record 6 touchdowns, Brady recorded an unworldly QB rating of 137.6. The highest possible is 158.3 and anything over 125 is considered spectacular.\nThis may have been more a reflection of the deficiencies of the Denver team than a renaissance for the New England quarterback. The very next week, against the much stouter Ravens defense, Brady struggled. He recorded no passing touchdowns, two interceptions, and an anemic 239 passing yards, finishing with a disappointing QB rating of 57.5.\nHow did one of the greatest clutch big-game performers ever to play become a playoff mediocrity?

{"idx": "6549", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: After decades of false starts, solar power in America is finally poised for its breakthrough moment. The price of solar panels has dropped by more than 80 percent since President Obama took office, and the industry is beginning to compete with coal and natural gas on economics alone.\nBut the birth of Big Solar poses a grave threat to those who profit from burning fossil fuels. And investor-owned utilities, together with Koch-brothers-funded front groups like American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), are mounting a fierce, rear-guard resistance at the state level \u2013 pushing rate hikes and punishing fees for homeowners who turn to solar power. Their efforts have darkened green-energy prospects in could-be solar superpowers like Arizona and Nevada. But nowhere has the solar industry been more eclipsed than in Florida, where the utilities\u2019 powers of obstruction are unrivaled.\nIt should come as no surprise that the utilities have fought so hard. The rise of cheap, distributed solar power poses a disruptive \u2013 and perhaps existential \u2013 threat to the traditional electric utility business.\nMonopoly electric utilities used to make sense. Dirty power, generated at a distance from population centers, was carried over a set of transmission lines to homes and businesses. Consumers got reliable power from a single provider. IOUs were guaranteed a profit \u2013 both for building power plants and transmission lines as well as for the electricity itself.\nBut in recent years, the nation\u2019s IOUs have been abusing their monopoly powers to profit from massive infrastructure projects. Utilities more than doubled their capital expenditures last decade; costs were paid for by electric customers, whose power bills have soared nearly 40 percent. For investors, the formula is simple: More infrastructure equals more profit.\nThe rise of distributed solar power poses a triple threat to these monopoly gains. First: When homeowners install their own solar panels, it means the utilities build fewer power plants, and investors miss out on a chance to profit. Second: Solar homes buy less electricity from the grid; utilities lose out on recurring profits from power sales. Third: Under \u201cnet metering\u201d laws, most utilities have to pay rooftop solar producers for the excess power they feed onto the grid. In short, rooftop solar transforms a utility\u2019s traditional consumers into business rivals.\nThe Sunshine State is a gold mine for its monopoly IOUs. Air conditioning drives the second-highest electrical consumption in the nation; the average Florida household spends $1,900 a year on power \u2013 40 percent more than the national average. Fossil fuel dominates electricity generation: Florida is 61 percent dependent on natural gas, followed by coal at 23 percent. Solar makes up less than one percent of the state\u2019s energy mix.\nKey policies that have spurred a rooftop solar revolution elsewhere in America are absent or actually illegal in Florida. Unlike the majority of states, even Texas, Florida has no mandate to generate any portion of its electricity from renewable power. Worse, the state\u2019s restrictive monopoly utility law forbids anyone but the power companies from buying and selling electricity. Landlords cannot sell power from solar panels to tenants. Popular solar leasing programs like those offered by SolarCity and Sunrun are outlawed. Rooftop solar is limited to those who can afford the upfront expense; as a result, fewer than 9,000 Florida homes have panels installed.\nFlorida\u2019s anti-solar policies are zealously defended in Tallahassee. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we play an active role in public policy,\u201d says"}

{"idx": "6554", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The latest international company to delve into the social gaming world is a Japanese mobile service provider by the name of C.A. Mobile. Since the Tokyo-based company focuses mostly on mobile content in the country, it partnered with French-Canadian developer, Montreal-based ODD1 to help it get a foothold with a simple little social Facebook app called Bingo Derby.\nWith a history of casual and mobile games \u2013 most recently the iPhone title Catch Me! If You Can \u2013 under its belt, ODD1 seems like a good choice. However, how did their first social game attempt measure up?\nWell, Bingo Derby is quite the simple app, and isn\u2019t exactly something that\u2019s going to enthrall the user with overwhelming game play. It\u2019s bingo, for the most part. Essentially players sit in a game with eight standard bingo cards and every couple of seconds a new number is called and is automatically marked off on all eight cards (since it is automatic, multiple games can, in fact, be played at once).\nThe standard rules of the game apply, which is five numbers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here is the gimmick though: it is Bingo \u201cDerby,\u201d comparable to a horse race in that players do not buy a bingo card, but bet on one. As numbers are called, a rating on the card will increase or decrease depending on how many numbers it is getting. Users will then pick one of those cards and bet a virtual currency \u2013 Coins \u2013 on it. The higher the rating is, the higher the payout, but the less likely it will win, while the lower ratings are the exact inverse.\nBingo Derby is amusing, at best, with its bright colors and quirky sounds, but unless you\u2019re a fan of bingo in general, it probably isn\u2019t going to be all that exciting. Furthermore, there doesn\u2019t look to be any way to get more coins other than actually buying them, so any additional games after you lose everything become a bit\u2026 difficult. Granted, it is simulated \u201cgambling,\u201d but it shouldn\u2019t simulate a completely empty wallet like the horse track does too.\nFrankly, this is a significant red flag as most games of a gambling nature (i.e. Texas Hold\u2019Em Poker) will grant a daily set of coins as soon as you log in the first time. This allows players to always have a safety net if they lose everything. They can always \u201ccome back tomorrow\u201d and try again. Of course, it\u2019s more than just a player safety net when it does indeed get them to actually \u201ccome back tomorrow\u201d as, usually, most developers want that anyway. If this exists for Bingo Derby, it certainly wasn\u2019t noticeable."}

The festivities will be rather spectacular for a nation that remains understandably skeptical of nationalistic displays. In Berlin, starting this Friday, three days\u2019 worth of tours, readings, and concerts are planned, all of them centered around an elaborate display of eight thousand lighted balloons that will stand along a nine-mile stretch of the city, tracing the path where the Wall once stood. On the afternoon of November 9th, Berliners will fasten written notes to the balloons and release them into the air, transforming the former border into a floating ribbon of light. A characteristic message from a \u201cvirtual balloon patron,\u201d posted on the event\u2019s Web site, reads, \u201cI hope that my children understand what it is to live in a city that is no longer surrounded by a wall.\u201d Many of the notes stress the importance of remembrance in an era when there are few visible remnants of the city\u2019s division.\nA lot has changed in Berlin, and throughout eastern Germany, since November of 1989, when a G.D.R. bureaucrat flubbed a question about new travel regulations on live television, making it sound like East Germany would open its borders. When he replied to a journalist that the policies were effective \u201cas far as I know, now\u2014immediately,\u201d thousands flooded the border crossings. (Amy Davidson wrote about the incident, and the anniversary, in the magazine.) In the early nineteen-nineties, East Berlin still smelled of the noxious fumes emitted by its state-produced automobile, the Trabant, and of the brown coal that was the G.D.R.\u2019s only domestic energy source. Its buildings were stark and modernist compared with the West\u2019s neoclassical frills, and its roads and bridges were more deteriorated.\nThe German Federal Republic had experienced a period of tremendous growth in the nineteen-fifties and early nineteen-sixties, known to German economists as the Wirtschaftswunder, or \u201ceconomic miracle.\u201d The boom was the result of several auspicious events. Most Americans have heard of the Marshall Plan, which dedicated billions of dollars to rebuilding Europe after the Second World War. By 1952, Germany had received about 1.4 billion dollars in Marshall Plan funds. It was a smaller portion than France or the United Kingdom received, but the moral boost that the aid provided\u2014plus the presence of several hundred thousand stationed American soldiers, spending U.S. dollars\u2014contributed to West Germany\u2019s postwar growth. Even more significant to the country\u2019s recovery, though, was the introduction of the Deutsche Mark, in 1948, followed by a long period of industrial growth and low inflation in the fifties and sixties.\nWith the opening of the borders, in 1989, East Germans soon began to share in the material fruits of decades of Western prosperity. After reunification, with the help of the equivalent of 1.6 trillion euros from the federal government and private German firms, eastern Germany experienced a growth spurt, too. Since 1991, unemployment in the region has fallen by about half, and wages have grown much faster than in the western part of the country (as would be expected). The per-capita G.D.P. of Germany\u2019s eastern states, as a whole, today ranks just behind Italy and Spain.\nThe changes are visible, too"}

Every Saturday, we round up the major twists, epic fights, new mysteries and anything else that goes down on The CW's Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and Black Lightning and Fox's Gotham. This week, THR breaks down all the epic moments from this week's midseason return of The Flash and the third episode of Gotham's final season.\nThe big news: In the midseason premiere, Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) came into contact with a meta-tech Lamborghini that essentially benched him for the entire episode by zapping his powers. He couldn't stop phasing, so to make sure he didn't phase through the ground and fall all the way to the Earth's core, he was put into the pipeline prison.\nWhat it means: While Gustin was seen in a few scenes talking to his daughter Nora (Jessica Parker Kennedy) and the rest of Team Flash via video chat, he was hardly in the episode at all. And according to his co-star Danielle Panabaker, that was by design so he could finish filming the Gotham-set crossover scenes in Chicago.\nBut with Barry's powers back to normal (and the crossovers finished), expect him to rejoin Team Flash properly on next week's episode as the battle against Cicada (Chris Klein) resumes.\nOther noteworthy moments: After the 100th episode cliffhanger that revealed Nora was in cahoots with Eobard Thawne (Tom Cavanagh), speculation ran wild as to why she would align herself with her father's nemesis. This week's episode didn't provide much explanation in that regard, but fans did learn that Eobard has less than an hour until he runs out of time. Is he on death row? Is he trying to get Nora to help him redeem himself before he dies? He's doubling down on his promise that he's seen the light and is trying to do the right thing now, but Nora should definitely be more careful than she's acting. Even this week's lesson of always giving someone a second chance has its limitations.\nPlus, Caitlin (Panabaker) and Cisco (Carlos Valdes) teamed up to create a meta-human cure, which means that someone before the end of the season will be taking it, willingly or not. This Chekhov's gun couldn't be more obvious.\nThe big news: One of Batman's most iconic feuds was sparked on this week's episode as Bruce (David Mazouz) prevented Selina (Camren Bicondova) from getting her revenge on Jeremiah (Cameron Monaghan).\nWhat it means: With Selina officially suited up as Catwoman on this week's hour following her miraculous recovery from paralysis, she set out to finally get revenge on the man who shot her and put her in that hospital bed to begin with. She came across Harley Quinn (Francesca Root-Dodson) rounding up followers for a new church worshipping Jeremiah, and she actually came pretty close to taking out Harley. There was an intense scene involving a game of Russian roulette, plenty of hissing (in case anyone doubted that Selina has gone full Catwoman) and Harley throwing out the iconic term \"puddin'.\" But by Bruce's good intentions of trying to stop Sel"}

Wanquan was succeeded by General Wei Fenghe, who was appointed to head China's defense ministry in March 2018.\n\"Mnangagwa's days in office are now numbered,\" said the military attache. \"Most Zimbabweans are not aware that Mnangagwa's tenure as president was discussed before the November coup that toppled Mugabe. An elite delegation of military officers travelling with Chiwenga met with Chinese generals, who were told that the current leader will be in power for no more than three years. Our military sees him (Mnangagwa) as a stopgap measure for stability, and he is just but a figurehead with no real power. His presidency expires in 2020, and we are going to see a retired general taking over soon to finish his term, like what Mnangagwa did to Mugabe. The military general coming in will then lay the ground for a civilian leader agreed upon by the Joint Operations Command.

Today, that empire, and its servants, represent the primary obstacle to the survival of both mankind and the planet as a whole, and the job of patriots in the United States, and every other nation, is to take away their power, once and for all.\nTo defeat the Empire, however, we must understand it in its naked essence as the oligarchical principle which has ruled the whole succession of empires since the Roman Imperium: especially by the suppression of the expression of mankind's creative powers through science and technology. Over the course of recent decades, the infection of the oligarchical disease has corrupted peoples so thoroughly that they can barely recognize either the enemy, or their own unique mental capabilities as human beings. Here, we briefly identify that infection as it has played itself out in two of its most spectacular demonstrations of evil\u2014the original Roman Empire and the Hitler period\u2014and then, exemplify its operation within the Obama Administration today.\nThe Roman Empire ruled and looted the world for approximately 500 years, with a policy of permanent warfare, degradation, and suppression of the human qualities of its population that has been a model for every empire since. Within Italy, for example, the Roman ruling class presided over a population of soldiers and dispossessed landless peasants and slaves, a large portion of whom they supported on the dole, and kept \"happy\" with public entertainment (the fabled \"bread and circuses\").\nFundamental to the Empire's ability to control its population was its commitment to spreading irrationalism, and suppressing atechnological progress. Roman imperial spokesmen proudly boasted of their \"practicality\" in comparison with the creative Classical Greek culture. The oligarchs saw no need to foster technological improvements in agriculture or industry to reduce or altogether replace human muscle power\u2014even if those improvements already had been devised. They would rather treat the people, from slaves to pauperized tenant farmers, as cattle.\nThe stupidity of this oligarchical decision was stunning in its implications for the real \"sustainability\" of Roman society. Over at least 600 years of Roman rule, from the Second Century B.C. to the Fourth Century A.D., there were no improvements in methods of agriculture\u2014from tillage, to fertilizer, to tools. They refused to use water wheels and water pumps as a means of improving productivity of the mills or mines, despite their much greater efficiency. Instead they used slave labor, claiming it was \"uneconomical\" to develop pumps which used water wheels\u2014despite the fact that this technology had been developed in Greece as early as the Fifth Century B.C.\nTo compensate for the lack of productivity of its agriculture, the Roman Empire sought loot where it could steal it\u2014especially by imposing enormous taxes. As the masses of impoverished farmers increased, they became easy prey for the northern German tribes (in some cases, even looked to them for liberation). The Empire collapsed\u2014demographically, and eventually, politically. By A.D. 500, St. Ambrose was writing of the \"corpses of half-ruined cities\" in Italy's once-fertile Po Valley. The anti-technology, as well as pro-war policies were genocidal, reducing the Empire's population in A.D. 6"}

It could be a good purchase for someone on a budget.\nApple, IBM, and sometimes Samsung aside, display manufacturers seem to put little effort into making the most of an LCD's style potential. We think design is important, especially in an LCD that does double duty as a computer and a home-entertainment display. Acer's AL1931 is no Cinema Display, but it has decent design and image quality and multimedia capability, and it's not terribly expensive. If silver plastic matches your office or home-theater setup and you don't need adjustability, picture-in-picture function, or an HDTV-compatible display, the AL1931 is a good choice.\nThe AL1931 has a few distinguishing physical characteristics. Its slim, 1-inch bezel is made of pale silver plastic, a discreet cluster of round chrome-colored buttons sits on the bottom bezel, and the power button glows a cool, soothing blue. Unlike most LCDs, its base and neck are made of metal, which adds about a pound to its weight, and its cables are made of braided silver rope encased in clear PVC. It's not austere Apple white, but at least Acer's trying.\nThe display has both digital and analog signal ports, conveniently arranged one on top of the other on the back panel and situated well clear of the neck, making them very easy to get to. Between the neck and the back panel are S-Video and composite-video inputs, left and right audio-in jacks, and a jack for connecting the built-in speakers to your computer. Unlike many larger multimedia LCDs, the AL1931 is not HDTV ready and has no picture-in-picture function. If you want the full range of video options plus more adjustability, check out the HP L2035.\nThe AL1931 has a solid neck with no cable feed system, but the panel sits a mere 2 inches from the base and has no telescope function, so cable dangle isn't an issue. However, most people will need to put it on a riser. You can neither swivel the display from left to right nor pivot it between Portrait and Landscape modes. The only adjustment you can make is to tilt the panel forward and back through a 25-degree range, but the hinge between the neck and the panel is so stiff that you have to grab it with both hands and use a good amount of force to tilt the display. The AL1931 is compatible with VESA mounts.\nAcer's onscreen menu handles all the usual adjustment options, such as brightness, contrast, and color temperature. What we love most about the onscreen menu are its unusual yet easy to navigate layout and its cheerful color scheme."}

The increase in opioid abuse was one of the forces behind the new law, Womack said.\nWomack worked with legislators to update the law for the first time in about a decade to make it easier to prosecute suspected stolen property ring members and to increase penalties on them if convicted.\nMack Mclamb, president of the 25-store Carlie C\u2019s grocery chain, said businesses have long figured shoplifting losses into the cost of their operations. But the proliferation of organized fencing and illicit sales over the internet has posed a bigger impact.\nBusinesses like Mclamb\u2019s are increasingly using software that allows them to keep much more accurate and immediate track of products. That alerts them to sudden losses that might otherwise take longer to discover when a store employee is just replacing them on the shelf.\nIt is typically the boosters who are arrested, and that\u2019s where investigators try to determine if the suspects are shoplifters stealing to sell on their own or are feeding a bigger operation. Womack said local prosecutors take the cases seriously, as do federal agents, who will take on an interstate ring if it is big enough.\nIn 2010, police detectives in Gastonia noticed that local heroin addicts were shoplifting over-the-counter medicine and health and beauty aids every day and selling them for drug money. Several of them told police about a woman who was their fence.\nSurveillance confirmed that she was receiving daily deliveries in garbage bags, plastic bins and boxes and storing them in a nondescript warehouse in Denver, a small town just north of Charlotte.\nThe owner of the warehouse, Steven Michael Hale, had been indicted federally in 1994, in a large statewide fencing operation based in Wake County that implicated law enforcement officers.\nHale had been accused of being a high-level fence dealing in over-the-counter and health and beauty aids. He and 10 other defendants were convicted, but most of the convictions, including Hale\u2019s, were thrown out on appeal. Judges ruled the evidence didn\u2019t show that the defendants had been \u201cwillfully blind\u201d to the fact they were dealing with stolen property.\nThe defendants contended there is a legitimate secondary market in salvage and liquidation sales. Also, there are companies that buy closed-out goods either directly from retailers or through suppliers that have access to the goods. Winn Dixie, for instance, had agreements with the manufacturers of Tylenol and other over-the-counter products to sell recalled, damaged or discontinued products.\nFederal prosecutors argued there was only a sparse secondary market, which"}

The intent of the awards program is to highlight examples of exceptional cooperation and diligence that will encourage further collaboration to achieve the full potential of community partnering, and their efforts have resulted in improved readiness.\nAccording to Murphy, \"Across the Army, we are becoming more efficient and effective. Partnerships are an important way America's varsity team is doing more with less, to ensure our resources support soldiers maintaining their tactical and technical advantage. Our partnerships enable us to learn from others, and make us more innovative. They are a priority, and we are pleased to recognize our winners.\"\nThe winners include partnership initiatives from the Tennessee Valley community and Redstone Arsenal; the New Jersey Army National Guard and Rowan University; Presidio of Monterey and the city of Monterey; Camp Guernsey and the town of Guernsey; and Alabama Army National Guard and Alabama Law Enforcement Agency; Andalusia, Dothan, Phoenix City, Central High School; USAF - Maxwell AFB - Gunter Annex; Alabama Department of Human Resources.\nLt. Gen.

His foreign policy must have been seen by enemies of the United States as weak and feckless, because these enemies became emboldened. Mideast terrorists staged a brutal, bloody attack in which innocent Americans were killed. The president\u2019s response could be seen as a display of shameful weakness rather than steely resolve.\nI\u2019m referring, of course, to Ronald Reagan and the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which claimed 241 American lives \u2014 and led Reagan to withdraw U.S. forces from Lebanon.\nIt\u2019s useful to keep this antecedent in mind as opportunistic critics embarrass themselves looking for ways to bash President Obama over the spreading anti-U.S. violence in Egypt, Libya and now Yemen.\nI mean, Mitt Romney. Really. U.S. diplomatic posts are attacked abroad, and your first reaction is to issue a statement blasting the president? J. Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other officials are killed in a commando-style assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, and your instinct is to seek not safety for other Americans at risk, not justice for the cold-blooded killers, but political advantage for yourself?\nRomney\u2019s rushed statement Tuesday night calling the Obama administration\u2019s response to the violence \u201cdisgraceful\u201d was a new low in a campaign already scraping bottom. And Romney\u2019s subsequent decision to double down on the attack, even as Americans mourned the first killing of an ambassador since 1979 and officials began investigating what now looks like a well-planned terrorist attack .\u2009.\u2009. well, I guess this whole performance says a lot about what kind of man Romney is.\nThe most charitable explanation is that he\u2019s in a panic over polls that show Obama opening a lead. If this is not the case, then Romney\u2019s ignorance of foreign policy is more profound \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 than anyone could have suspected.\nIt\u2019s one thing to pander on domestic issues. When Romney takes every conceivable position on health-care reform, when he promises tax cuts for all and sacrifice for none, when he conjures millions of jobs out of thin air \u2014 such reckless promises are written off as campaign rhetoric, nothing more.\nBut international affairs are different. For one thing, there is general consensus that at times of crisis, the United States must speak with one voice. Most Republicans, even some of Obama\u2019s most adamant foes, have respected this tradition. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) both issued measured statements recognizing that this is a moment for patriotism, not politics.\nMore important is the fact that words spoken in the heat of international crisis can have life-or-death impact. Romney\u2019s ostensible complaint was that Obama should have spoken up more clearly for American values \u2014 presumably, in this case, freedom of speech.\nIndeed, the administration has made clear that of course it supports the right of anti-Muslim extremists to make and disseminate an amateurish video whose sole purpose is to insult and enrage believers in Islam. This is protected speech under the Constitution. But imagine the reaction if Obama\u2019s first response had been not to try to quell the violence but to align the U.S. government with a piece of inflammatory garbage produced by twisted zealots.

While delivery will continue to be the most convenient and efficient option, this doesn\u2019t mean that lunch has to suffer.\nIf sit-down restaurants want to stay in the game, the solution won\u2019t be sacrificing quality or core values but finding creative ways that allow them to stick to their strengths: hospitable service, a welcoming atmosphere, relationship-building and thoughtful, well-prepared food.\nAll that said, we can compromise with customers on one front: price.

The menu was predictable: crocks of thick onion soup topped with melted cheese and a slice of bread; then savory crepes, stuffed with meat and cheese, which I endured to get to the dessert crepes, served with ice cream or chocolate mousse on top. Even the name of the restaurant, La Crepe, testified to the enticing allure of these French pancakes.\nIn the last 25 years, as Americans have become more adventurous and more knowledgeable about the world's cuisines, crepes have largely faded from menus. Still, unlike, say, the Chinese-American invention of chow mein, crepes have historical authenticity. You can still find them on a Paris street corner or in an auberge in Brittany.\nPALACINKA is the name of a new little restaurant, decorated with the sort of 1930's travel paraphernalia romanticized in J. Peterman catalogues. It is also the word for the crepes popular in Austria, Hungary and the Balkan states.\nThe cylindrical buckwheat-flour crepes are terrific, made with ham, Gruyere and egg ($6.50), and with roasted chicken, goat cheese and roasted peppers ($7.50). The mix of ingredients provides not only a blend of flavors, but also contrasting textures, with the dryness of the crepe moistened by the cheese and accented by the snap of the meat.\nI love the dessert crepes, particularly the lime ($4) made with white flour, dusted with sugar and drizzled with fresh lime juice, and the raspberry version ($4), which is simply painted with raspberry jam. The dessert crepes are folded into fourths, for layers of flavor in each bite.\nBISTRO 56 is the informal cafe next to the Park restaurant at the Lombardy Hotel, a nice place for a quick bite in midtown. It serves various old-fashioned dishes like croque-monsieur and quiche Lorraine, but its galettes, or savory crepes, are particularly good.\nI especially enjoyed the ficelles picardes ($7), pancakes filled with ham, cheese and mushrooms, rolled into thin cylinders, topped with a cheese sauce and baked. For dessert, I squeezed lemon juice over a plain sugar crepe ($3) for a refreshing end to the meal.\nLE GAMIN , a French cafe on Macdougal Street, has never stopped serving crepes. Recently, it opened a little takeout stand on West Broadway, reminiscent of the crepe vendors on Parisian street corners.\nThe crepe maker, with a double burner in front of him and barely enough room to turn around in his closetlike space, serves his wares in little wax-paper bags, convenient packets for a quick lunch on a park bench. Ham and Swiss cheese ($4.50) was the best combination, moister and better flavored than chicken and ratatouille ($4.50). For dessert, try the creme de maron crepe ($3), with sweetened chestnut paste.\nLA CREPE DE BRETAGNE reminds me of the French restaurant of my childhood. The staff is not uniformed, and it's a pretty dowdy place with a stained tile ceiling like some relic of the days"}

Having escaped the city rut, sipping coffee felt like one had recalibrated the mind, very refreshing. Over the years, Gajraula has emerged as a good mid-way stop with most of the top fast food brands present there. Tadka, a famous dhaba, makes some of the fluffiest naans. The thought of Munsiyari brought an instant smile on my face.\nA reclusive hill town, Munsiyari is tucked away behind the tall hills of Kumaon. Literally in the lap of the snow-capped Panchchuli peaks, I had seen a picture a photographer friend had clicked a couple of years ago. And boy! going by the photo, it looked spectacular and picture perfect. It had been my intent to drive up to this paradise for some time now, and finally I was on the road and the time had come. There were two routes to get to Munsiyari from Delhi. One was Delhi\u2013Rampur\u2013Rudrapur\u2013Bhimtal\u2013Almora\u2013Chaukori\u2013Thal\u2013Munsiyari and another was a deviation from Rudrapur to go to Tanakpur\u2013Pithoragarh\u2013Chaukori and follow the same road to Thal and Munsiyari. I had chosen the former.\nFrom Gajraula, however, the next big town was Moradabad. Having taken the bypass at Moradabad, the next to come was Rampur. Dusty, narrow, crowded and dirty roads greeted me. But thankfully not for long as I turned left towards Nainital (the turn is right in the middle of the town, opposite the railway station and is very easy to miss, so do look out carefully) from there. It was a two-lane road from there to Rudrapur (the first town in the state of Uttarakhand). As I turned, my mind was filled with some nasty memories. The distance from Rampur to Rudrapur is about 50 km, crossing Bilaspur in between. But this section for many years has been any driver\u2019s nightmare\u2014deep potholes (big enough for a loaded truck to sway dangerously), dusty tracks and errant traffic (some of the bikes manage 60 kmph, I don\u2019t know how and I also saw a few Maruti 800 cars fly past). I have been driving on this road for 15 years now and have never seen this stretch tarred and cared for. Some say it is because this is nobody\u2019s baby (border stretch between Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand). Maybe it\u2019s true! But guess what, this truth is not just limited to India. I have driven extensively all over the world and typically, most border crossings, about 50 km stretch this side and the other, are always in pathetic condition. I had noticed this at China-Kyrgyzstan border, Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan crossing and many more. So, Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand crossing was not unexpected. But yes, one so hoped that this wasn\u2019t the case.\nDriving at snail\u2019s pace, the 50 km stretch took nearly 3 hours. Tired and irritated, I stopped for some tea.

{"idx": "6620", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: With parents occupied with pre-Pessah cleaning and children soon to be on vacation, the accidental poisoning season has begun.\nWith parents occupied with pre-Pessah cleaning and children soon to be on vacation, the accidental poisoning season has begun. Beterem, the Nation Center for Child Safety and Health, noted that the number of accidents involving child poisonings rises significantly before Pessah, but all of them can be prevented, as can occasional drownings of toddlers in pails left on the floor with even a small amount of water. Fat-removing chemicals, including cold-oven cleaners, containing a high concentration of caustic soda are among the most dangerous, as they cause severe internal burns when swallowed, said Beterem director Dr. Michal Hemmo-Lotem. Packaging and labelling of these products are inadequate, and they should not be used in homes where there are children, she added. In the US and Europe, there is an option of barring the use of such products even though they are labelled with relevant warnings. The Israel Standards Institution's standards committee recently approved a standard that would require such chemical cleaners to be sold in safety packaging and contain active ingredients at a concentration that cannot harm health. However, this recommended standard is not binding until the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Employment officially accepts it. A recent case involved a two-year-old child who drank half a cup of caustic soda cleaner and was hospitalized in intensive care for two weeks and a week in the surgery department. He suffered severe burns to the esophagus and stomach and couldn't swallow solid food for a long time afterward. A two-year-old boy who sprayed oven cleaner on his face suffered severe facial burns. A four-year-old boy swallowed oven cleaner that his mother had placed on a high shelf, thinking he couldn't reach it. A nine-month-old baby girl crawled to a bathroom cabinet and pulled out chemicals that poured out on her leg and caused burns. A new Beterem survey by Hemmo-Lotem and Liri Andy-Findling found that 56 percent of the public have no idea that mere skin contact with these leaning materials can cause harm to health. More than two-thirds were unaware that cold-oven cleaners containing caustic soda were very dangerous when swallowed. Always read instructions before use, said Beterem's director. In the event of a suspected poisoning, immediately call the National Poison Control Center at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa at (04) 854-1900. If someone swallows acidic cleaning materials (like toilet cleaner) or alkaline chemicals (like oven cleaners), give the victim half a glass of water or milk to drink if there are no breathing problems and he is fully conscious. Do not cause the child to vomit, as this could intensify the damage. If chemicals reach the eyes or skin, wash them with large amounts of running water. Meanwhile, Yad Sarah, the country's largest home health equipment lending and community service organization, advised the public to use proper body mechanics and pacing to get their pre-Pessah cleaning done in time. Start now and do cleaning in small increments. Take frequent breaks to stretch or just relax your muscles and be sure to drink plenty of water. Don't waste time stooping and bending over from the waist; instead, sit on a low stool or use a helping hand-reacher."}

It covers bauxite or laterite - a soil and rock type rich in iron and aluminium - extracted or won by Alpart in any calendar year in excess of 1.45 million tonnes of alumina actually shipped.\nThe five-year waiver was previously disclosed by former Finance Minister Audley Shaw in the wake of an IMF review of Jamaica.\nIn its April 2017 country report on Jamaica after conducting the first review under the current standby agreement, the International Monetary Fund was critical of the revenue loss from discretionary waivers, citing \"leftover exemptions on the bauxite levy\" as contributing to the estimated 0.1 per cent fallout relative to GDP.\nThe grant of the waiver means that the Government will be giving up about US$14.6 million in revenue annually, which equates to nearly $1.9 billion."}

Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter with arthrogryposis.\nStreep denounced Trump's incivility toward Kovaleski: \"Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.\"\nIn response to Streep's speech, Oscar-winning actor Marlee Matlin tweeted, \"SPEAK THE TRUTH!\"\nComedian, writer, and disability rights advocate Maysoon Zayid responded similarly to Streep's speech. \"She won't get the Cecil B. DeMille Award again \u2014 it's once in a lifetime, and she chose to use that platform to condemn something that was so painful to so many of us,\" she told BuzzFeed News on the phone.\nThe speech, however, was a reminder that Hollywood itself has a long way to go in destigmatizing disability. \"Last night, the only mention of disability was Meryl Streep reminding the world that Donald Trump mocked us and became president,\" Zayid said.\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, people with disabilities make up nearly 20% of the population, and yet \u2014 as Zayid said \u2014 they were not represented at the Golden Globes. A recent study by the Ruderman Family Foundation confirmed that those with disabilities are grossly underrepresented in television \u2014 and when they do appear, they are almost always played by actors who do not have a disability themselves.\nDanny Woodburn, an actor who is on the Screen Actors Guild's Performers With Disabilities Committee, wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News: \"To progress as a people, we need to embrace those who have been excluded.\"\nMatlin, speaking with BuzzFeed News via a Twitter direct message, said that Hollywood needs to \"make disability and actors with disabilities part of the diversity conversation, which includes hiring actual people with disabilities to play disabled roles.\"\nAs Woodburn put it, \"My industry, [which] has always been the standard-bearer for addressing injustice ... needs to continue on the path that has really only just begun for the disabled.\"\nZayid offered concrete steps. She said Hollywood needs to \"make sure that studios and auditions are ADA-compliant so that the disabled community \u2014 the largest minority in America \u2014 can actually have representation on television. Right now, we're barely there.\"\nStreep's speech has come under fire from conservatives, for illustrating a \"liberal bubble.\" Countering this charge, Matlin said that increased inclusivity on TV shows and movies can work to puncture a bubble that mostly excludes people with disabilities. \"When you create a role for a character with disability, you get a potentially richer, more interesting story that accurately reflects the varied fabric of America,\" Matlin wrote."}

In the end, I felt that Nick and Amy deserved each other and were sort of addicted to each other.\nAll first drafts are jagged and wrong, but working as a journalist for 10 years demystified the writing process for me.

Now, the focus may switch to totally drug-resistant (TDR) tuberculosis.\nAlthough Indian cases have been reported for the first time, it was reported in Italy in 2007, where it affected two patients. Then in 2009, 15 patients were reported in Iran.\n\"We currently have 12 confirmed cases, of which three are dead,\" New Scientist quoted Zarir Udwadia of the Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre in Mumbai, as saying.\nWhat compounds the problem for India is that the strain has been found in a congested city like Mumbai, where it could spread very quickly.\n\"It's estimated that on average, a tuberculosis patient infects 10 to 20 contacts in a year, and there's no reason to suspect that this strain is any less transmissible,\" Udwadia said.\nAccording to him, the only thing that can be done is to keep the patients in isolated wards in hospitals so that they don't infect anyone else, but that is an impractical solution.\nUdwadia blames poor management of MDR over the years for the current situation.\nWhile the usual strain of TB has been covered very well in India's national programme, the same level of support and treatment was not provided to MDR-TB patients, with cost being a major factor for this.\n\"Years of mismanagement of MDR-TB at government and private care levels resulted in amplification of the level of resistance till we finally ended up with this untreatable strain,\" Udwadia said.\nPaul Nunn, coordinator of the STOP TB department of the WHO in Geneva, agrees with the assessment and calls on governments to provide better support, regardless of the cost.\n\"It's a wake-up call for countries to accelerate provision of proper care, particularly for multidrug-resistant patients,\" he said."}

The amount includes money that is spent to pay state bills, in addition to its investment portfolio.\nWells Fargo earns millions of dollars from these transactions, according to the Illinois Treasurer. But a spokesman for the bank disputed the number, claiming it's actually about $50,000 a year.\n\"Wells Fargo is a big financial player in Illinois and I hope to send the message that their unscrupulous practices won't be tolerated,\" Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs said Monday.\nThe one-year suspension means the state will not use the bank as a broker-dealer for any investments, nor buy any Wells Fargo debt.\nThe suspension doesn't apply to some business contracts with Wells Fargo that the Treasury is obligated to do honor. It also doesn't apply to Illinois' pension funds or bond underwriting, but Frerichs said he urged those investment boards to review their contracts with Wells Fargo as well.\nThe state owns $25.5 billion of Wells Fargo debt and $1.5 billion in other assets, which it doesn't plan to sell.\nChicago Treasurer Kurt Summers also reportedly said Monday that he too plans to divest what the city has invested with Wells Fargo, according to Bloomberg. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNNMoney.\nThe blows keep hailing down on the bank ever since federal regulators announced it had secretly created as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts since 2011.\nWells Fargo is now facing an onslaught of lawsuits, criminal investigations and fines of $185 million so far.\nIn a statement, Wells Fargo, said its business with Illinois and Chicago is handled in a division separate from the retail bank.\nThe bank said that it is \"very sorry and take full responsibility for the incidents in our retail bank,\" and that it is taking steps to address the issues that have been raised.\nFor now, Illinois will move its investments with Wells Fargo to other companies who will bid for the contract.

And as a result, the transfer-pricing smoke and mirrors have gone as well, and we can begin to see where real profits are made. Some years ago, a Taiwanese take on this was that the potential for profits was concentrated at the ends of the supply chain (in R&D and product design, and in dealing with end customers ) with no room for profits in actually making things.\nApple\u2019s cash mountain would seem to indicate that designing things and outsourcing their actual production can work very nicely, thank you. With manufacturing jobs leaving China over the last few years as the workers there have become too expensive, you would have to live with pay of $1-2 per hour to get lost factory jobs back.\nIn the midst of this, of course, the city and county are attempting to attract \u201cadvanced manufacturing\u201d businesses. Businesses that, to even have a hope of competing globally, will be employing as few people as possible as cheaply as possible and replacing even those jobs with robots as fast as possible \u2014 whatever conditions are attached to the grants and incentives they are gifted. Using our tax money to compete with nearly every other city in the country to attract those companies is unlikely to end well.\nIf you are frightened of the future, seeing Western North Carolina promoted as \u201cSilicon Mountain\u201d will seem a stretch. But this isn\u2019t about you. This is about trying to make a brighter future for our kids. Looking for creative businesses that don\u2019t require raw materials to be shipped in and products to be shipped out means that we can minimize our greatest weakness while working on our strengths. In addition to a new approach to attracting businesses, we would need to build a whole new infrastructure \u2014 better educational opportunities for our kids, startup-friendly office space, more and bigger angel syndicates and venture capital funds just for a start.\nIf the rich folk feel that they are being unfairly excluded from the city\u2019s future, here is their chance. The adventurous ones could invest in angel and VC funds while the more risk-averse could stick with their familiar property speculation and finance office buildings for startups.\nInstead, of course, they scuttled off to Raleigh to find themselves a bunch of lickspittles willing to coerce the city into a gerrymandered Council and policies to further entrench our unsustainable economy with its starvation wages and property speculation.\nUntil the bubble bursts and we are left with just the starvation wages.

This assumption is challenged by the fact that so much of Asheville\u2019s housing has been taken up, and at increasingly inflated prices, which suggests that someone is investing in something that hires somebody other than minimum wage service industry workers.\nWhoever is lobbying for gerrymandered districts in Asheville, I doubt it is disenfranchised potential investors."}
{"idx": "6637", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: How Often Should You Update Your Blog?\nYour blog is the backbone of your online content marketing strategy\u2014or at least, it should be.\nIt\u2019s the sticking point for new visitors, a conduit for attracting more traffic, a chance to build your brand reputation, and a focal zone for securing conversions.\nBut blogs don\u2019t work like billboards. You can\u2019t just create some good content, publish it, and sit back and wait and expect to see significant results. Instead, you need to promote that content, make regular changes, updates, and additions to it, and add new content periodically.\nSo how often should you update your blog? I\u2019m going to examine this question from two main angles. First, the small, regular updates, or in other words, the new blog posts you publish to your website. Then, the big, overarching updates, or web redesigns that affect your entire site.\nRegular readers. If your content is high-quality, your readers are going to look forward to newly published content on your blog. Give your regular readers what they want by publishing as often as you can, without sacrificing quality. Posting at least once a week is usually sufficient to establish a regular core of readers, and these readers are typically the ones who will form the core of your brand community. Without consistency, it\u2019s difficult to build brand loyalty.\nSEO. In terms of capturing the most traffic, more posts is generally better. According to research from Hubspot, companies that produced 16 posts or more every month saw more than four times as much traffic as those who posted between 0 and 4 times. This makes logical sense as well; four times the posts means four times the inbound linking and indexing opportunities. To use a fishing metaphor, it\u2019s like casting more hooks into the water; the more you cast, the more fish you\u2019ll catch. Of course, this assumes that all your posts are equal in quality. If the number of posts you make is like the number of hooks in the water, then the quality of your content is like the tastiness of the bait you use on your hook. Keep Google (and your readers) happy by publishing only super-high quality content.\nNews and updates. How often you should post new blog content also depends on how quickly new information unfolds in your industry. If you\u2019re a tech startup, you probably watch for new developments daily, and posting daily\u2014even if they\u2019re just short news update articles\u2014is a good idea. Slower industries that are less susceptible to change, like manufacturing, won\u2019t require updates as often.\nCompetition. How often are your competitors posting new blogs? If they have a bigger following than you do, this is an especially important question to ask. If you\u2019re trying to one-up your competition, you might consider posting more often than they do.\nBudget and resources. Finally, you\u2019ll need to consider the budget and resources you\u2019re willing to expend in your effort to attract more traffic. Assuming the quality of your content remains consistent, publishing more often is probably going to lead you to more opportunities; more blog posts means more indexed pages in search engines, more chances to hit with something viral, and more content to keep your most loyal readers happy. However, it\u2019s usually better to have one high-quality post than dozens of low-quality posts. In either case, the more you spend on your content strategy, the more it\u2019s likely to pay off, so your investment depends on your financial limitations and your overall campaign goals.\nTo summarize, if blogging is a core part of your strategy, you should be publishing a new post at least once or twice a week, but more often"}

I thought it would be too hard, too messy. But what better way to find out than to learn from the \"Chopped\" champ himself?\nMoore was a great sport, agreeing to come to my home in Old Louisville to show my husband and me how to go from whole fish to dinner plate.\nAnd I've got good news and bad news about the whole messy ordeal.\nLet's dive right in. Moore brought three fish for us to practice with, courtesy of Bluefin Seafoods, 617 E. Washington St.\nAlso on the bad news/good news front: they don't sell to folks like you and me in the general public, but you can source whole fish from Highland Fish Market, 3941 Chenoweth Square, for a recipe like this one.\nMoore learned to fillet fish as a kid from his dad and grandpa when they'd go fishing for bluegill and bass, he said. I learned no such skill, but it looked easy enough when he slid the slender, flexible fish knife into the back and essentially unzipped the grouper.\nThen it was back to the tail to cut across the fish body. From there, it was on to the belly where he repeated the process of first slicing through the skin and then lifting meat away from the bones as he filleted. The process is repeated on the flip side.\nThen my husband tried his hand on the fluke and kind of hacked his fish to pieces. I followed suit and wasn't doing much better until Moore guided my hand. So we made a plan B: roast another fish whole in case ours didn't turn out.\nMoore slit the snapper's belly just deep enough to add some thin slices of lemon and sprigs of fresh thyme, and, with a bit more thyme scattered across the top, a drizzle of olive oil and some sea salt, it was ready for the 400-degree oven. Except one hiccup \u2014 we didn't have a roasting sheet big enough. No problem, Moore said. Using aluminum foil, he fashioned an extension to hold the back of the fish.\nNow it was on to searing the fish fillets. After portioning them into four big pieces, Moore carefully placed them skin-side down in a blazing hot cast iron skillet coated with olive oil. The only seasoning was a special salt mixture he uses at the restaurant on nearly everything. He didn't have a prescribed time to cook the fish, just until the meat lost nearly all of its opaqueness, he said, cooking it longest on the skin side, and flipping it after the skin is crisp.\nMeanwhile, we got some pasta going (fresh spaghetti in this case) and some Brussels sprouts roasting in the oven. Once the fillets were ready, Moore whipped up a classic Picatta sauce right in the fish pan, with more capers than I'd have imagined. Think main ingredient, not garnish.\nThen it was a matter of portioning and serving up the fillets with a generous ladle of the sauce spooned over the pasta, and a pile of the"}

However, the polls saw a 43% voter turnout last year.\nMembers of both the groups confirmed that through the DUSU polls they have been trying to set the electoral mood among the youth before 2019 elections. While the NSUI said it is considering the DUSU polls as \u201celection of prestige\u201d, the ABVP also using the polls to promote the ongoing schemes of the BJP such as the \u201cEk Bharat Shresth Bharat\u201d programme at the campus.\nThe DU has also witnessed a new alliance of the Left-backed All India Students Association (AISA) and the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s students wing Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS). This alliance has promised to ensure installation of CCTV cameras, setting up of police booths on campus, ending the \u201cculture of hooliganism\u201d and opposing commercialisation of education.\nLaunched in 2014, CYSS had contested the DUSU elections in 2015, but could not win even a single post. Since then it had opted out of DU politics the last two elections. In their manifestos, both ABVP and NSUI appear to have raised more national issues rather the campus centric issues.\nFor instance, NSUI has campaigned around its demand for an \u201cInstitute of Eminence\u201d status for the DU. NSUI had, however, opposed the move when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre granted it to other six educational institutions.\nSimilarly, ABVP has also promised a \u201cBharat first\u201d agenda in its manifesto.

What's the connection between the Dacia Sandero and John Travolta?\nDACIA launched their Sandero in Scotland three years ago at Gleneagles, where a night in the Blue Tower suite is said to cost you \u00a36000.\nWhen John Travolta, who sung Sandy in the musical Grease, stayed there, he even hired out the entire top floor.\nThat\u2019s a very expensive room. Thankfully, we turned up at the plush entrance in a not very expensive vroom \u2013 the \u00a35995 Dacia Sandero.\nThis new hatchback is the cheapest car on sale in the UK. But the Sandero was not just the launch of a model \u2013 it was an entirely new value-for-money brand. Since then, it\u2019s been success after success.\nDacia used to be the Romanian state-owned car firm until they were bought by Renault in 1999.\nIn the last decade, they\u2019ve been transformed from outdated into Europe\u2019s fastest-growing brand.\nThey sold two million cars in 32 years before Renault\u2019s takeover. Last year they revealed sales have topped three and a half million .Dacia sales were up 10 per cent in 2015 to 26,228 vehicles in the UK and, for the first time ever, the Sandero finished in the top 10 best sellers in Scotland.\nIt was joined by two other models in Dacia showrooms, giving buyers three bargains.\nThe Stepway rivals the Nissan Juke but is nearly half the price \u2013 starting at \u00a37995. And the Duster remains the cheapest SUV, from \u00a38995.\nDacia are a simple, no-nonsense car firm. What you see is what you get \u2013 at a realistic price.\nThe company hope to appeal to used car buyers wanting a new vehicle for the first time.\nThe Sandero is a basic car \u2013 with wind-up windows, no radio and a 1.2-litre petrol engine.\nBut, for the price of a city car, you get a stylish four-metre supermini with room for five adults. And if you pay an extra \u00a3800, you can add a few extra creature comforts.\nHowever, unlike bargain basement buys of the past, the \u00a35995 entry-level Sandero does not feel cheap or nasty.\nInside, the plastics may have a hard feel but the car is well screwed together and laid out. You also get 320 litres of boot space, which increases to 1200 with the rear seats folded flat.\nAnd it drives OK, with Renault\u2019s tried-and-tested 1.2 petrol engine giving about 48mpg, while the 900cc three-cylinder is a lively little motor, giving around 57mpg.\nIf you want heavy-duty fuel economy, go for either of the 1.5-litre turbo diesel engines giving well in excess of 70-plus mpg.\nAll the Dacias handle well but they\u2019re not built for Daytona, just doing the daily drives.\nThe Dacias are a bit like Skoda in the early days, when they were first taken over by Volkswagen \u2013 a frills-free brand.\nLike Skoda, Dacia are benefiting from the latest technology of a mainstream manufacturer but with their own identity.\nDacia\u2019s current ad campaign asks you to do the maths.

I look forward to seeing the details of the proposal, so I can learn more about it.\"\nMcFarland touted how Tindall has offered a fresh perspective on how to handle business within the city since replacing former City Attorney Susan McGannon, who retired Nov. 1, 2015.\nTindall met with the council in private executive session for legal counsel four times without giving adequate public notice to discuss how to part ways with former City Manager Rob Lyons prior to Lyons agreeing to resign Dec.15.\nPrior to becoming city attorney, Tindall served as a city attorney and deputy city attorney from 2001 to 2013 in Glendale, Ariz.

Frank Reich retained DeGuglielmo after McDaniels changed his mind and returned to the Patriots, and NFL Network\u2019s Mike Garofolo reported both that Reich wants to make his own hire and that the Colts head coach is recommending the 50-year-old elsewhere.\nDeGuglielmo and Johnson helped a young, revamped line make a dramatic turnaround. One season after allowing a league-high 56 sacks, the line cut the number to a league-low 18. It also cleared the way for Marlon Mack to rush for 100-plus yards in five games \u2014 the highest single-season total by a Colts running back since Joseph Addai in 2007.\nNFL Network also noted the Colts ranked No. 2 in the NFL in pass blocking and No. 4 in run blocking, per Football Outsiders\u2019 metrics. Matt Eberflus, the defensive coordinator hired under the expectation he\u2019d be working for McDaniels, is expected to be retained. Mike Phair\u2019s defensive line also drew raves.\nDeGuglielmo\u2019s Patriots tenure was sandwiched by Dante Scarnecchia. DeGuglielmo was hired in 2014 to replace the retiring 13-year line coach and 30-year Patriots institution, then left in what was termed a mutual parting after the 2015 season, paving the way for Scarnecchia to rebuild the offensive line. DeGuglielmo\u2019s line faded badly in that final season, which ended with Tom Brady being hit 20 times and sacked four in an AFC Championship game loss at Denver.\nIn addition to winning a ring with the Patriots team that beat Seattle in Super Bowl XLIX, DeGuglielmo \u2014 a four-year football player at Boston University and 13-year NFL coach \u2014 was the assistant offensive line coach for the Giants team that ended the Patriots\u2019 undefeated season in Super Bowl XLII."}

This is particularly bad timing since food banks, disaster-relief organizations and other charities need our help now more than ever.\nDonate your time.

IRS Publication 526 explains how tax deductions for charitable contributions work and Publication 78 lists all IRS-approved organizations at www.irs.gov.\nMake sure any non-profit organizations to which you donate are well run and contribute at least 75 percent of contributions they receive to programs that serve their beneficiaries, as opposed to being spent on their own salaries and expenses.

One great program, the Make a Wish Foundation (www.wish.org), estimates it needs over 2.5 billion miles a year to fulfill the travel needs of the sick children they help. Check airline Web sites for links to organizations that accept miles.\nLocal food pantries and homeless shelters always need food contributions, especially around the holidays. Many also will accept and distribute toiletry items, so the next time you buy two-for-one toothpaste, set one tube aside for a needy family.\nAdopt a family. Numerous social and religious organizations sponsor programs that will align you with a family in crisis.

{"idx": "6663", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The world of film resists change, mostly because movies--even independent ones--take so long to conceive, plan and finance, let alone actually make. Plus, the majority of people who decide which movies get made and how are still white men, who are often slow to greenlight anything that might challenge them. No matter how you feel about either preserving the sovereignty of white dudes or shoving them aside, they're here to stay, at least for one more year.\nYet 2017's movies will seem radically different because we are radically different. Whether our worst fears will play out or not, plenty of us worry that we're entering a period of cultural regression--and just when we thought things were getting good too. If early 2016 was dominated by the #OscarsSoWhite debate, by the fall, those of us who care about the variety and substance of movies gave ourselves permission to breathe a sigh of relief. Barry Jenkins' Moonlight showed us men of color who, instead of just fulfilling all our cherished notions of who men of color are, were living lives we couldn't previously have imagined seeing onscreen. The picture told us something we didn't already know, about people we'd never seen before--probably because we just weren't looking hard enough. Other movies--like Jeff Nichols' Loving, Anna Rose Holmer's The Fits and Nate Parker's The Birth of a Nation--made 2016 seem more progressive, in terms of the types of stories we saw onscreen, than we might have expected in January.\nNot that everything was rosy: Asian and Latino actors and filmmakers weren't particularly well represented. And while a remake of bro-fave Ghostbusters featured women in the starring roles, that film opened the noisiest and dumbest battle of all, a showdown that reminded us just how ingrained sexism really is. At least our cartoons were steeped in civic principles: Byron Howard and Rich Moore's animated parable Zootopia described an animal Gotham where predators and their prey live peaceably, until nefarious government forces step in to instill fear.\nOn to 2017. While audiences clamoring for more movies made by and about white dudes are probably going to be in luck, what can the rest of us look forward to? Amma Asante's A United Kingdom (Feb. 17) dramatizes the real-life, apartheid-defying marriage between Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo), the man who would become the first President of Botswana, and Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike), a white London office worker. More than 20 years after his death, Tupac Shakur will finally get his biopic, All Eyez on Me (June 16). We'll see what director Patty Jenkins has done with Wonder Woman (June 2), starring the formidable Gal Gadot. Ava DuVernay is hard at work on her adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy classic A Wrinkle in Time (it won't be released until 2018, but it's one more thing to look forward to). And Sofia Coppola, anti-comic-book-superhero filmmaker extraordinaire, gives us a Civil War--era western, The Beguiled (June 23), starring Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst and Colin Farrell. Note that this is a remake of a 1971 picture directed by Don Siegel"}

But just as U.S. agents failed to arrest wanted trafficker and rebel leader Guy Philippe until his 2017 arrest, they also failed in attempts to capture Innocent.

The harassment of the common citizen \u2013 particularly from the ranks of the urban and rural poor-through denial of access to income, savings and livelihood will not be forgotten anytime soon.\nThe Modi government\u2019s supporters have termed demonetisation a \u2018surgical strike\u2019 against black money, calling it a \u2018bold\u2019, \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018well intentioned\u2019 step. A more rabid section of his fans see all complaints as coming from those who benefited from black money, mainly the BJP\u2019s political opponents. The Prime Minister himself has called upon the nation to \u2018make sacrifices\u2019 and put up with hardship for 50 days in this battle against corruption.\nHowever, growing consensus among economists both within and outside the country is that demonetisation is a foolish measure and will hurt the Indian economy badly \u2013 especially farmers, small businesses, labour and anyone part of the country\u2019s informal sector \u2013 and operates on a daily basis through cash transaction. The informal sector constitutes over 30% of the Indian economy in value and 2% in terms of workforce employed.\nSince the drastic policy was announced on November 8, all these have come to a complete standstill, leaving millions without livelihood or means to buy basic goods. As one respected economist has pointed out demonetisation may have permanently damaged India\u2019s informal sector.\nA severe deflation is predicted over the next six months to a year or even longer, as spending power disappears or goes down for millions of Indians and businesses shut down. There is also the concern that, with government issued currency losing credibility through demonetisation, more and more people will keep their money in unproductive but safe assets like gold and property.\nSo, why would the government take such a high risk step? What was Mr Modi really trying to do when he announced a measure that directly affects almost every single family in the second most populous nation on the planet? Who are the real beneficiaries of this drastic policy? Will it really stop black money from circulating in the economy and end corruption from the country?\nDespite all this propaganda it is quite clear now that demonetisation has nothing really to do with black money, that constitutes a sizeable 20% of the Indian economy, of which only 6% is hoarded in cash, the rest being stashed away in gold, real estate and foreign accounts. If the government was serious about hurting the beneficiaries of black money they would have started by prosecuting those who keep such ill-gotten wealth in non-cash assets.\nAlso, given the large-scale collusion of the Indian political class and bureaucracy in corruption the Modi regime should have first gone after its own ministers and government officials (particularly from the tax"}

Plausible deniability.\nIn the age of the Donald, there have been several instances of Twitter being used in the US as a platform for \u201cgoin\u2019 rogue,\u201d as the Sarah Palin-originated saying goes. The most high profile example is the National Park Service, which started pointedly and clinically tweeting out climate change science facts once Pres. Cheeto took office and deleted climate change from the White House website\u2019s list of issues. It was quickly slapped with a directive to knock it off, but several individual parks throughout the US then took up the cause. When they too were told by the new boss to stop making so much sense, \u201calternative\u201d accounts proliferated, like the AltNatParkService, purportedly run by disgruntled federal employees.\nOther such accounts joined in, like Rogue NASA and the like. As NPR (America\u2019s BBC equivalent, soon to be defunded, if the Trump budget is adopted) pointed out, there\u2019s no real way of knowing if these are run by actual federal employees in an act of resistance, or if it\u2019s just a fun, public-confusing phenomenon for anti-administration types to spend their free time on. Which means plausible deniability if anyone in the West Wing wants to start a witch hunt for the people supposedly running these accounts from within the belly of the beast.\nIn that spirit, it was great to see an official McDonald\u2019s company Twitter account goin\u2019 rogue on Thursday, tweeting directly at President Trump in no uncertain terms: \u201c@RealDonaldTrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands.\u201d Even better, the tweet was pinned to the top of the account.\nIt was since deleted, and the plausible deniability that we all knew was coming floated out into the public socialverse.

We took swift action to secure it, and we apologize this tweet was sent through our corporate McDonald\u2019s account,\u201d the statement read.\nDid an employee at the burger empire mistakenly tweet something personal from the wrong account? Was it an intentional, defiant act of Fight the Power? Was McDonald\u2019s actually hacked?\nThe Guardian points out that the tweet had been sent from Twitter web, \u201cwhile every other tweet on the McDonald\u2019s account had been sent using a social media management platform.\u201d Good backup for the \u201chacked\u201d theory. But then again\u2014why would the attacker only send the one lone tweet, and then retreat? It seems more of an act of scrambled desperation, a protest tweet from within that was quickly thrown up in an opportunistic manner before the supervisor returned from his smoke break.\nIt SEEMS that way.

People were so keen to get a seat in his courtroom that they took turns standing in line more than 24 hours ahead of the event.\nReuters reporters Diane Bartz and David Shepardson stood in line from 7 a.m. that morning to secure two of the 27 seats reserved for reporters. Shepardson\u2019s seat was the more advantageous of the two, nearer the aisle.\nLeon\u2019s rules were simple, but a nightmare for reporters working in a real-time, all-digital news environment.\nFirst, everyone in his courtroom was barred from having active electronic devices with them, and court officials tested each as people entered the court.\nWith those rules in mind, Reuters had another reporter, Ginger Gibson, outside the courtroom with a series of prepared alerts ready to transmit from her laptop covering a range of possible outcomes. Gibson was set up just outside the door where she could see a signal from Bartz or Shepardson telling her which alert to send.\nImmediately after the courtroom doors closed, however, another court official forced everyone who did not go into the hearing to clear the hallway. The last-minute twist meant Gibson was not where her colleagues would expect her to be when they came running from the court.\nInside the courtroom, Leon delivered his ruling: AT&T could proceed with the Time Warner purchase with no restrictions, widely seen as a green light to further media-telecoms mergers worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\nWhen Leon finished, Shepardson - a former high school hurdler - made a dash for the aisle and the door, vaulting briefcases and people. He burst through the crowd into the hallway looking for Gibson, who was no longer where he had left her.\nBut she had managed to stay in a position where she could see the door, and as it opened she ran forward with her open laptop, meeting Shepardson halfway down the hall. The ruling matched one of the prepared scenarios, and they sent the alert - 10 seconds ahead of the competition.\nWithin minutes, Time Warner shares were up more than 4 percent while those of AT&T tumbled 5.5 percent.

A number of approaches have been used by various agencies throughout the years. Rocket sleds. Powder guns. Compressed gas guns. Although each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, it is the disadvantages of traditional approaches that led to the creation of the Variable Energy Research Accelerator (VERA). Rocket sleds are often too expensive for small programs to utilize for extensive test series, and in addition to challenging packaging issues, traditional guns present a violent acceleration profile that can damage test hardware. The designer of VERA endeavored to create a cost effective system to deliver useful payloads to useful velocities while subjecting payloads to acceleration forces significantly lower than those associated with typical gun systems. The result of this effort is VERA. VERA is a low cost, low acceleration, compressed charge combustion gun featuring a 40 foot (12.2 m) barrel and a 19 inch (483 mm) bore. VERA was designed to minimize payload acceleration forces, accommodate large and/or oddly shaped projectiles, and allow for in-barrel instrumentation and control of energetic or inert payloads."}

Over the past few weeks, a number of articles and interviews have made some outlandish claims about the chances of a massive Yellowstone eruption. Yet, all this kerfuffle has come with absolutely no change in the state of Yellowstone itself. Instead, this tempest is purely the product of media \"churnalism\" that turns very benign source material into panic, doom, and horror.\nThis time around, the Yellowstone noise is loosely based on a disaster preparedness report from the European Science Foundation. The study, called Extreme Geohazards: Reducing the Disaster Risk and Increasing Resilience, isn't new scientific research but rather a position paper that makes the bold claim that \"hey, wouldn't it be great if we even thought about being prepared for a large volcanic eruption?\" It isn't even solely focused on volcanoes, but makes the point that large volcanic eruptions\u2014the same size or larger than the 1815 eruption of Tambora\u2014are potentially a larger threat to lives and property than we give them credit.\nYet somehow, this simple study has been distorted. Many articles claim the scientists are announcing that Yellowstone will erupt at any moment and we're all doomed and yada yada yada. The articles say things like \"the earth is actually in \u201cvolcano season,\u201d* *(nope), that \"volcanic eruptions have occurred at their highest rate in 300 years\" (again, nope), that \"super-volcanoes could erupt within the next 80 years.\" (They could.

No self-respecting volcanologist would ever say such a thing\u2014and, more importantly, the geologists at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory have never, ever even implied such a thing.\nThe number of times Yellowstone is mentioned in the 70+ page report: 2 (once for the date of its last massive eruption and once in the reference list for that date).\nThe number of times report talks about an impending Yellowstone eruption in the next 70 years: zero. none. never.\nThe number of times report even mentions the idea of a major Tambora or worse eruption definitely happening in next 70 years: absolutely nowhere.\nWhat about the notion that the Earth is in a supposed \"volcano season\" with more eruptions in the last 300 years?\nThe number of references to \"volcano season\"? Z____ero. The report very briefly discusses the idea of a \"flareup\", where there may be an increase in very large eruptions in different parts of the world but (a) we're not in one and (b) there is no indication we are headed towards one. Flareups are separated by millions or tens of millions of years. Even if it is the case, \"volcano season\" as a hypothesis claims that during certain seasons of the year, there may be slightly more eruptions\u2014and there is very little agreement that such a thing actually exists.

It also means that early humans must have co-existed with Neanderthals in this part of the world, something which a number of researchers have doubted.\n\"For many years, people thought Europe was a bit of a backwater, a Neanderthal stronghold almost, but the dating we've done suggests that is not so clearcut,\" he said.\nThe early humans who arrived in Torquay were pioneers who ventured into Britain along with other animals and either retreated or were wiped out when temperatures plummeted again at the end of the warm spell.\nThe bone fragments were originally dated at Oxford in 1989, but the reliability of the dating was called into question when scientists spotted traces of modern glue that had been used to stick the teeth in place.\nToo little of the specimen was uncontaminated to re-date the fragments directly, so Higham's team scoured the archives at Torquay museum for animal bones excavated above and below the spot where the jawbone was found.\nHaving collected the bones of wolf, deer, cave bear and woolly rhinoceros, the team used a new method called bone collagen ultrafiltration to remove modern contamination before dating the samples to between 50,000 and 26,000 years old. The team next used a statistical method to calculate the age of the human jawbone.\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature alongside another study that bolsters evidence for early human occupation in Europe.\nIn the second paper, researchers led by Stefano Benazzi at the University of Vienna, re-examined two milk teeth found in a cave in southern Italy in 1964.\nThe teeth, thought to be Neanderthal, were"}

She had chosen not to return to the U.S. because of how expensive it is to stay here during the holiday season. Unfortunately, that left her in another country during the time of the year that everyone spends with close friends and family. In her interview for the Genius Lyrics website, she talks about the fact that she was so isolated that she would literally open her window to remind herself that other people existed. Of course, this is an extreme example of a pattern we live through every day.\nOnce the slightest hint of loneliness or isolation sets in, people reach for their phones and check Instagram and snapchat, or in the words of the song \u201cMy God, I\u2019m so lonely/So I open the window/To hear sounds of people/To hear sounds of people.\u201d As reassuring as this open window into the lives of our peers is, it can also be distressing. Depending on what you\u2019re doing, the short rush of comfort can be quickly replaced by the dread of feeling left out, and a familiar pattern of thoughts can emerge. \u201cI\u2019m not with my friends\u201d can quickly become \u201cI\u2019m not wanted by anyone\u201d which can quickly become \u201cI\u2019m not lovable\u201d if left unchecked.\nTwo recent studies show that unhealthy thought patterns like those may not be so uncommon for social media users. A study from the royal health society in the UK calls Instagram the worst social media platform for mental health, with its worst factors being a lowered body image and a greatly increased fear of missing out. Fear of missing out is really just another way of saying we feel isolated, and another study shows a link between social isolation and physical pain, meaning in short that the technology we use to socialize isolates us, and humans feel isolation in a way similar to having cut oneself or otherwise undergone physical trauma. The song draws on these truths.\nMitski\u2019s isolation is obvious from the beginning. She wakes from a dream wearing a bathrobe, and as soon as she has collected herself, her bed spontaneously bisects itself, with one half simply sliding off to the other side of her bedroom, an image implying that even if she were willing to get a partner, she would be unable to share her space with them. Then, through a series of interpretive images, she walks us through some common fears that we feel when checking and using social media.\nAt one point in the music video, Mitski is using a magnifying glass to examine her diary. She looks back and sees herself magnified instead. She seems shocked and horrified by the intrusive scrutiny she\u2019s putting herself under. This is similar to how we see our flaws when checking our social media, always seeing the flaws in ourselves before seeing the joy on our faces. Or anything else for that matter. The absurdity of these thoughts is highlighted by the surreal image.\nSometimes we respond to a poll or reach out through direct messages, and those fleeting gestures towards another person can become a source of anxiety about ourselves and how lovable we are. The anxiety of a read, but non-responded-to-message or text can eat away at the common pleasures of life, hanging over us like the sword of Damocles, ready to fall and crush"}

So far this year he was out on his own Losing Sleep World Tour in January-February with support from Kane Brown and Lanco. He\u2019ll be doing a few fairs, festivals and other one-offs before picking back up with the tour in September, with Brown and Morgan Evans signed on to support that leg of the jaunt.\nHowever, having too many hits is a good problem to have, Young said. He remembers playing shows and having to pad the performances with covers and figure out where exactly to slip in the one single he had at the time. Now, with seven albums worth of material to sift through, he can be more selective with his covers, but enjoys watching an audience sing along to his own work.\nYoung did experience all of the feels when country legend Vince Gill surprised him last year with an invitation to be inducted as the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry in his hometown of Nashville.\nTickets: $75 general admission; $179 VIP admission; $799 Super Fan Pass; $39 beanbag rental; $15 locker rental with mobile charging.

Mike Duffy shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sue the upper chamber over his dramatic and protracted suspension without pay five years ago.\nGiving the go-ahead for the Senate to be part of Duffy\u2019s $7.8 million lawsuit would obliterate the protective walls aimed at ensuring the courts and Parliament don\u2019t overstep into the other\u2019s domain, they argued. They cited parliamentary privilege \u2014 a centuries-old right designed to protect legislators in the course of doing their jobs.\nChipping away at that right could potentially unleash a flood of cases that would result in an unprecedented tearing down of the separation of powers between the government and the courts, Maxime Faille said.\nThe portion of the lawsuit against the Senate hinges on Duffy\u2019s arguments that senators acted unconstitutionally and violated his charter rights when they decided to suspend him without pay in 2013 over questioned expense claims.\nFaille said the Senate, like the House of Commons, has the right to discipline its members free from judicial review.\n\u201cThe Senate may be wrong, the Senate may be incorrect, but that is a matter for the Senate to determine,\u201d he said.\nIf the court agrees, Duffy would only be able to sue the federal government for the RCMP\u2019s actions during the investigation.\nDuffy is seeking damages from the Senate and the Mounties in the wake of the high-profile investigation and suspension surrounding his expense claims, which culminated in a trial where he was acquitted on 31 charges in April 2016.\nHe filed his claim last August, claiming \u201can unprecedented abuse of power\u201d when a majority of senators voted to suspend him without pay in November 2013 before any criminal charges were filed.\nIn July 2014, the RCMP charged him with 31 counts of fraud, breach of trust and bribery \u2014 all of which were later dismissed in a lengthy and dramatic court ruling.\nThe Senate restored Duffy as a member in full standing within hours of that verdict.\nSenators who supported Duffy\u2019s suspension stuck fast to the argument that the Senate could govern its internal affairs and dole out administrative penalties without any worry about judicial review.\nDuffy\u2019s lawyer will argue otherwise.

{"idx": "6730", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Most people spend a great deal of their weekdays at their offices or job sites. It's not surprising, then, that employees face ethical dilemmas there. Several of these dilemmas pop up on a regular basis. With some common sense and a bit of analysis, employees can resolve common workplace dilemmas without losing their jobs or bringing harm to their employer.\nBecause employees tend to spend so much of their weekday hours on the job, they often are tempted to conduct personal business on company time. This can include setting up doctor's appointments on company phone lines, making vacation reservations using their employer's computers and Internet connections or even making phone calls for a freelance side business while on company time.\nAt first glance, this ethical dilemma is fairly clear: It is an abuse of your employer to conduct personal business on company time. But there are shades of gray here. What if your spouse calls to tell you that your children are ill? Is it OK for you to schedule a doctor's appointment? A good rule of thumb is for an employee to check with his manager or human resources supervisors to clarify what counts as an actionable offense in the company.\nEmployees often work in teams to create marketing campaigns, develop new products or fine-tune services, yet rarely does everyone in a group contribute equally to the final product. If three members of a five-person team did all the work, do those three members demand to receive proper credit while pointing out that two members of the team did not pull their weight?\nThis is a thorny question. If employees single out their co-workers in a negative light, it could foment resentment. The same thing could happen, however, if all employees accept equal praise even though only a select few did the real work. The best way to resolve this ethical dilemma is to not let it happen. Team members should insist that all employees perform specific tasks to help complete a project.\nEmployees often don't know what to do if they see one of their co-workers harassing another employee, either mentally, sexually or physically. Employees may worry for their jobs if they attempt to report a superior for harassment. They may fret that they'll be labeled a troublemaker if they report co-workers who display inappropriate behavior toward other employees.\nFirst, understand what constitutes harassment. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an occasional comment, slight or incident \u2013 unless it's very serious \u2013 isn't characterized as harassment. It's when the pervasiveness of such actions creates a work environment that would seem hostile, intimidating or offensive to most reasonable people.\nThe best way to resolve this ethical dilemma rests with the staff members who develop the company's employee handbook. It is their job to include specific language that spells out that employees won't be punished for reporting the harassing behavior or other inappropriate actions of their co-workers, and to make sure everyone knows and understands the policy and the consequences of violating it.\nWe all know embezzling from the company \u2013 taking money and hiding it by altering the records \u2013 is against the law. But what about taking home an occasional box of staples?\nJust because the supply room is well stocked with boxes of everyone's favorite pens doesn't mean it's okay for employees to help themselves to a pack for home. It may seem like a small thing, but when every employee takes something, it does add up against company profits. It is stealing, and an astute office manager will notice things going missing too fast.\nFalling profits affect everyone in the company, even future raises, bonuses or layoffs. Regardless"}

{"idx": "6740", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: CAN we talk? That's the question the French government is asking 9 million young people this summer. A questionnaire sent to all 15-to-25-year-olds seeks comments on 58 statements about school, family, work, and society. When responses are tabulated, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur hopes to learn why so many French youths have little faith in the future.\nWhat a novel idea - consulting young people about their opinions! How much easier it would be for talk show hosts and their adult guests simply to theorize about adolescent alienation, generation gaps, and the Angst besetting so-called Generation X. How much harder - and braver - to go to the youthful experts themselves, even giving them space on the questionnaire to write their own ideas and identify their priorities and ideals.\nThe completed forms will undoubtedly yield surprises. In fact, French officials eager for a preview might find clues in a much smaller poll of American teenagers conducted earlier this summer. The New York Times and CBS News asked more than 1,000 13-to-17-year-olds about their parents, friends, school, and work. The answers were often poignant, revealing young lives shadowed by violence, worry about the future, and distrust of adults.\nFour out of 10 said that their parents sometimes or often are not available when they need them. And although many teenagers find their peers a solace, they also see them as a source of fear and menace. Often isolated, lonely, and scared, these young people appear cut off from the very sources of support they most need.\nCall it Generation F - for Forgotten.\nYet contrary to stereotypes of teenagers as unwilling to communicate with adults, poll interviewers found young people, ``more often than not, were open and eager to talk,'' according to The New York Times.\nTalking teenagers, listening adults - the solution seems so simple. Still, talk alone can't make the present more satisfying and the future more promising for young people.\nIf adults are to help give teenagers moral bearings and a sense of purpose, says Rev. Michael Thompson, senior pastor of the Tabernacle Church in Melbourne, Fla., they must understand the ``major sociological shapers'' affecting young people. Writing in Ministries Today, Reverend Thompson places the breakdown of the family high on his list of these shapers. He states: ``No wonder kids today have almost no relational skills. They haven't lived in a family environment to develop them.'' Media saturation also takes its toll.\nWhat else do teenagers want? Even teenagers may not really know - which makes them just like adults. But trying to explain themselves - on a questionnaire or face to face - is a necessary part of the discovery process. It's certainly their turn to say more than, ``You don't understand me.'' And it's certainly the turn of adults who love them to listen with care and respect, as if the future depends upon connecting their generations. Which it does."}

{"idx": "6742", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: ABSTRACT: A much-celebrated aspect of language is the way in which it allows us to express and comprehend an unbounded number of thoughts. This property is made possible because language consists of several combinatorial systems which can be used to creatively build novel words and sentences using large inventory of stored, reusable units. For any given language, however, there are many more potentially storable units of structure than are actually used in practice --- each giving rise to many ways of forming novel expressions. For example, English contains suffixes which are highly productive and generalizable (e.g., -ness; Lady-Gagaesqueness, pine-scentedness) and suffixes which can only be reused in specific words, and cannot be generalized (e.g., -th; truth, width, warmth). How are such differences in generalizability and reusability represented? What are the basic, stored building blocks at each level of linguistic structure? When is generalization possible when is it not? How can the child acquire these systems of knowledge? I will discuss how tools from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics can address these problems. The general approach is based on the idea that the problem of computation and storage can be solved by using a probabilistic tradeoff between a pressure to store fewer, more reusable units and a pressure to account for each linguistic expression with as little computation as possible. This tradeoff is grounded in foundational principles of inductive inference, but has surprisingly far reaching implications across multiple levels of linguistic structure. I will discuss several specific models based on this framework and provide examples of how the approach can help solve long standing empirical puzzles, simplify existing theories, and connect linguistic theories to psychology and computer science.\nBIO: Tim is a Research Scientist at MIT and in his research, he develops mathematical models of language generalization, learning, and processing.

Their apparent project involves Kalanick\u2019s L.A.-based company, CloudKitchens, which enables restaurants to set up kitchens for the purposes of catering exclusively to customers ordering in, as that\u2019s how many people are consuming restaurant food in increasing numbers. (More on the movement here and here.) The kitchens are established in underutilized real estate that Kalanick is snapping up through a holding company called City Storage Systems.\nAccording to The Spoon, a food industry blog, the trend is beginning to gain momentum in particular regions, including India, where it says many restaurants struggle to afford the traditional restaurant model, which often involves paying top dollar for rent, as well covering wages for employees, from dishwashers to cooks to servers. Using so-called cloud kitchens enables these restaurateurs to share facilities with others, and to do away with much of their other overhead.\nSome are even being promised more affordable equipment. For example, according to The Spoon, the restaurant review site Zomato, through its now two-year-old service called Zomato Infrastructure Services, aims to create kitchen \u201cpods\u201d that restaurants can rent, and it\u2019s using data to identify recently closed restaurants that may be looking to offload their kitchen equipment for whatever they can get for it.\nShared kitchens have also been taking off in China, as notes the SCMP, which cites Beijing-based Panda Selected and Shanghai-based Jike Alliance as just two companies that Kalanick would be bumping up against.\nKalanick wasn\u2019t the first here in the U.S. to spy the trend bubbling up, but he seems to be taking it as seriously as any entrepreneur. Last year, he spent $150 million to buy a controlling stake in City Storage Systems, the holding company of CloudKitchens, through a fund that he established around the same time, called the 10100 fund. The money was used to buy out most of the company\u2019s earlier backers, including venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, according to a report last year by Recode.\nThat same report said that Kalanick now has a controlling interest in City Storage Systems. It also said that serial entrepreneur Sky Dayton \u2014 who previously founded EarthLink, co-founded eCompanies and founded Boingo \u2014 is a co-founder.\nCity Storage Systems isn\u2019t interested in on-demand kitchens alone, reportedly. The idea behind it is to buy distressed real estate, including parking lots, and repurpose it for a number of online-focused ventures.\nWhile the China twist looks like a new development, it wouldn\u2019t be a wholly surprising move. Having had to back out of China with Uber in 2016, Kalanick may be of a mind to jump into the country faster this time around, and with a local partner with whom he has a relationship.

Users can earn points based on the activity\u2019s difficulty, including the size of the animal killed and the distance of the shot.\nUsers also have the ability to comment on others\u2019 posts and view statistics on public profiles.\nGabriella Hoffman, a GoWild user, said the app is changing how the outdoor industry is viewed and is making it more accessible to individuals of all skill levels.\nGrimes said he was encouraged by his NU professors to be creative, which helped him create the app alongside CEO Brad Luttrell.\nLuttrell said other social media platforms can be ineffective for hunters trying to find an audience with similar interests. GoWild, he said, offers an online space to socialize and share tips.\nHe added that on other platforms, online threats and nasty responses can discourage novice hunters from expressing their interest in the activity.\nThe app is unfinished, Grimes said, as the GoWild team is still exploring new ways to earn points and gather data to maximize user experience.\nUltimately, Grimes hopes to change the way members of the outdoor community connect with both technology and each other, he said."}

The 90 products available through the app catalogue include Ikea sofas, chairs, beds, bookcases, chests of drawers and desks.\n\u201cOur customers want to be able to test out whether the products they\u2019ve been inspired by in our catalogue will work in their own homes \u2013 particularly when it comes to larger pieces of furniture,\" said Peter Wright, country marketing manager, Ikea UK & Ireland. \"Offering a way of using mobile technology to enable to test products means the technology has a practical purpose and really helps customers visualise the way their homes could look.\"\nIkea says the main goal of the app is to help customers to avoid buying the wrong size furniture. According to the company's research, \"many customers suffer from 'Square peg, round hole syndrome' as 14 per cent say they\u2019ve bought the wrong-sized furniture for their rooms and over 70 per cent say they don\u2019t really know how big their own homes are.\"\nIn further use of the app, the print version of the Ikea Catalogue will also have 50 pages that can be scanned with the mobile app to receive additional product information, videos and alternative views of products."}

A Page One story in the Feb. 14, 1994, Wall Street Journal portrays Murdoch as a details-crazed micromanager, reviewing before publication the next day\u2019s editorial in his New York Post.\nA wordy section of the Dow Jones code of conduct prohibits company employees from accepting money or gifts, either directly or indirectly, from anybody seeking a mention in the pages of a Dow Jones publication. A different code operated at Murdoch\u2019s Post until earlier this month when the paper acknowledged that its \u201cPage Six\u201d editor, Richard Johnson, had accepted a $1,000 gift from a restaurateur. Presumably the money was for \u201cplay\u201d in the pages of Murdoch\u2019s newspaper. The New York Times counts 15 favorable \u201cPage Six\u201d mentions of the restaurateur or his establishment in the two years since the gift-giving.\nOnce confronted, how did Murdoch\u2019s Post clear the ethical air? Don\u2019t be dense. Its editor, Col Allen, called the receipt of the gift a \u201cgrave mistake,\u201d meted out an unspecified reprimand to Johnson, and explicitly banned such future windfalls for employees.

Joe Lieberman blocked it.\n\"You may have more people today supporting single payer, Medicare for All than 10 years ago, but I\u2019m not sure that the floor has moved as much as the ceiling has,\" Murphy said.\nThe big question: Some Democrats want a public option to be offered in the employer market in addition to the individual market.\n\"Now, a public option for just the individual market would likely be unsatisfying to single payer supporters, providing no relief from health care costs for the much larger number of people with employer coverage,\" Levitt said.\nThe details: A central tenet of adopting a public option is using the government's purchasing power to bring down underlying health care prices.\n\"The common denominator of all Democrats is that they want more affordable options for people, and how broadly you apply the tool depends on how broadly you define the problem right now,\" said Chris Jennings, a Democratic health care consultant.\n\"Lurking behind the public option discussion is really the issue of health care prices. A public option of any kind would use the leverage and regulatory power of the government to get lower prices for health care,\" Levitt said.\nBut determining how far to go would be tricky and comes with risk.\n\"There is some room to put some downward pressure on provider prices without having significant adverse consequences on access to care or quality of care, but the big question is how much,\" said Aviva Aron-Dine of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the district where Tom Malinowski is running.

{"idx": "6779", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Santiago: Anglo American Plc will scrap its next big copper project if studies indicate the plan could harm nearby glaciers or there\u2019s major opposition from local communities in Chile, a top executive says.\nThe London-based company will file for environmental approval of the $3 billion (Dh11 billion) project to increase production at its Los Bronces mine during the third quarter, Henni Faul, who heads the miner\u2019s copper business, said in an interview. The project is sensitive because of its proximity to Andean glaciers and the Chilean capital.\nThe Los Bronces project is part of Anglo American\u2019s plan to expand its portfolio of copper assets organically, Faul said. Last year, the company started construction of the $5 billion Quellaveco mine in Peru, one of the few large copper mines being built at the moment.\nProduction at Los Bronces \u2014 the largest copper mine operated by the globe-straddling company \u2014 will decline in five years as ore grades decrease. The output expansion at the site, which has been mined for over 150 years, could take annual production from 369,500 tons last year to about 400,000. The company plans to use new technology to increase efficiency and to dig underground tunnels to avoid impact on the nearby glaciers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for six years and we trust we have the best scientific input,\u201d Faul said of the Los Bronces plans.\nAbout 80 per cent of South America\u2019s glaciers are in Chile, and they cover about 3 per cent of the country\u2019s land area. Rising temperatures combined with mining activity have sped up the melting of Andean glaciers, Francisco Ferrando, a geography professor at University of Chile in Santiago, said in June.\nThe Juncal Norte and Olivares Alfa glaciers, about 4,000 metres (13,100 feet) above sea level and close to Los Bronces and Codelco\u2019s Andina mine, are melting at a faster pace than others further away, he said.\nFaul expects it will take about three years to obtain the necessary permits for the project, including the environmental licence. Project development would take four years, and ramp up a further five years. A lot could happen during that time, especially as glacier protection and the impact of mining on the delicate Andean environment are being discussed in Chile\u2019s Congress.\nThe two mines are just about 65km away from Santiago, home to over five million people, about a third of the Chilean population. Developments around Los Bronces and the glaciers nearby are closely watched by local communities and large environmental groups such as Greenpeace, which opposes industrial and mining activities on or under glaciers.\nLast year, Codelco announced a re-design of a planned expansion at Andina that would have involved mining on six rock glaciers. The new plan will move mining activities away from glaciers following direct orders from Codelco Chief executive officer Nelson Pizarro not to work near the glaciers, the mine\u2019s sustainability manager Jorge Sanhueza said at the time.\nAnglo wants to start discussions about its Los Bronces plans with local communities during the second quarter, Faul said. But the project won\u2019t happen if there\u2019s significant opposition."}

Such tools acknowledge that not every reader wants in on the mania -- that some stories become so hot, so omnipresent, readers would like a mute button. In doing so, The Guardian redistributes a small amount of the power of editors over to readers. It's similar, in many ways, to what a lot of newspapers and magazines do in providing both international and national editions online, just as they have done for years in print.\nBut what if a news site took this further? What if instead of allowing readers to block coverage of a sporting or royal spectacle, they gave readers a button to hide news from an ongoing government scandal, trial, or even, war? Would we want newspapers to say to readers, your choice on these ones too?\nAnother instance of a newspaper trying out this kind of reader-led curation shows what this might look like, and can help us think about whether such mute buttons would, in fact, be troubling. Earlier this year the Norwegian tabloid Dagbladet created a button that allowed readers to hide coverage of the Anders Breivik trial, acknowledging perhaps some Olympics-like exhaustion, but also, differently, perhaps that many Norwegian readers found the events and related coverage traumatic, and did not want to encounter it while perusing a tabloid site for regular, fun reading.\nAnd I have to say, this doesn't strike me as a problem. Readers already have the ability online to pick the kinds of stories, writers, and publications they want to read. How to make important content compelling and attractive -- that's the job of writers, editors, and other creators online. But giving people greater power to choose what they see on your site -- that's just bringing the Internet's self-curation ethos home."}

Whatever, the full significance of these may yet be shown to be, the immediate effect, we are entitled to believe, is the complete failure of another phase of the enemy's great offensive. The German official despatches may discount the success of the Allies as they will, but they cannot disguise the facts that the Allies are now established at and beyond Chateau Thierry, that they dominate Soissons, and that the Germans themselves have paid a bitter price for their initial success in crossing the Marne.\nA Press Association telegram from Christchurch states that on her trip from Wellington on Monday night the Maori experienced what was probably the roughest and most prolonged passage in her history. The vessel left Wellington at 3.19 in the afternoon, and immediately on emerging from Wellington Heads was caught by a southwest gale of hurricane force. The wind and a heavy sea reduced the vessel's speed to about five or six knots per hour and swept the decks frequently. At 9.5 p.m. she had reached Cape Campbell, where blinding snow showers were encountered. The vessel progressed about six or eight knots per hour, the opaque atmosphere making navigation difficult.

John McCain, R-Ariz., who had challenged the administration on the issue of torture policy, and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who has been highly critical of the president's management of the war.\nThe meeting marked the fourth time since Dec. 8 that Bush and his top advisers have met with lawmakers on Iraq, according to a White House official. The sessions are part of a White House public relations offensive that has included four speeches by the president in two weeks and a series of television interviews aimed at rallying public opinion around Thursday's Iraqi election and beyond. Bush will deliver another address Sunday night from the Oval Office.\n\"The reason he's doing it is because public support had dropped tremendously and because Congress ... has jumped in with both feet on the war on terror,\" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C. \"I think it is a long overdue, smart approach to what has been questioning by the Congress and the American people, and I think it paid dividends.\"\nThe decision to begin the White House meetings came after outspoken criticism, led by Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., that Bush had sealed himself off from advice and criticism by members of Congress. Murtha, who has recommended a rapid redeployment of all U.S. forces out of Iraq, compared Bush unfavorably to his father, who Murtha said frequently invited lawmakers to share their views in the months before the Persian Gulf War.\nAt a meeting Wednesday that included 18 House Democrats, most of them centrist and pro-military, Rep. Jane Harman, D-Rancho Palos Verdes (Los Angeles County), the senior Democrat on the House intelligence panel, turned to Bush and said, \"You ought to call up and thank Murtha.\" The implicit message was that Murtha had given the White House a wake-up call on Iraq.\nSince Murtha's attack on the president and his policy, White House officials have undertaken an offensive that they believe has begun to affect public opinion and give Bush some momentum heading into the new year.\nThe White House meetings have included presentations by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and from Iraq by video by Army Gen. George Casey, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, and Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.\nAs he reaches out to Congress and the American public, Bush is making a point of touching base with his counterparts in the Middle East as well. He called the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates on Friday to encourage them to help Iraq as it tries to form a new government.\nIn an interview Friday with Jim Lehrer of PBS, Bush offered a somber picture of an insurgency that eventually loses steam rather than ends entirely. \"If we have a policy of zero violence, it won't be met,\" he said, \"but the policy of getting the Iraqis in the fight and marginalizing those who are trying to stir up trouble will be effective.\"\nSen.

{"idx": "6808", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Though the sun lies 93 million miles (149 million kilometers) from Earth, its unceasing activity assures an impact on our planet far beyond the obvious light and heat. From a constant stream of particles in the form of solar wind to the unpredictable bombardment from solar flares and coronal mass ejections, Earth often feels the effects of its stellar companions. Less noticeable are the sunspots crossing the solar surface, though they are related to the more violent interactions. All of these fall under the definition of \"space weather.\"\nStudying the surface of the sun can reveal small, dark areas that vary in number and location. These sunspots, which tend to cluster in bands above and below the equator, result from the interaction of the sun's surface plasma with its magnetic field. According to NASA, sunspots are \"the most visible advertisement of the solar magnetic field.\"\nAt temperatures of 3,800 kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit or 3,527 degrees Celsius), sunspot temperatures are nearly 2,000 K (3,140 F / 1,727 C) less than the rest of the sun. But don't let the numbers fool you. If a single sunspot stood alone in the night sky, it would be 10 times brighter than the full moon.\nSimilarly, sunspots might seem small when compared to the 865,000-mile (1.392 million km) diameter of the sun, because they typically cover less than 4 percent of its visible disk. However, ranging from 1,500 miles to 30,000 miles (2,500-50,000 km) in size, they can reach the width of the planet Neptune, the smallest of the gas planets. But with a lifetime of anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, sunspots are far less permanent.\nSunspots do not appear in random locations. They tend to be concentrated in two mid-latitude bands on either side of the equator. They begin appearing around 25 to 30 degrees north and south of the center. As the solar cycle progresses, new sunspots appear closer to the equator, with the last of them appearing at an average latitude of 5 to 10 degrees. Sunspots are almost never found at latitudes greater than 70 degrees.\nAccording to NASA, it takes approximately 11 years for the sun to move through the solar cycle that is defined by an increasing and then decreasing number of sunspots. As it reaches the close of a cycle, new sunspots appear near the equator, while a new cycle produces sunspots in higher latitudes. The cycles overlap; sunspots from the previous cycle can still develop even after sunspots from the new cycle appear. So solar scientists have a very difficult time saying exactly when one cycle ends and the next begins.\nAs of early 2017, solar cycle 24 was approaching solar minimum. The 11-year cycle began in January 2008 and peaked in 2013, the weakest solar maximum in 100 years, according to NASA. Despite the low level of activity, one of the largest sunspot regions ever was observed in November 2014, reaching approximately the size of Jupiter.\nScientists measure the activity of the sun by keeping track of the number of sunspots appearing on its surface. Since the invention of the telescope, sunspot counts have been relatively constant. In 1849, astronomers at the Zur"}

Then on April 21, Rosneft and North Atlantic announced that the deal was being postponed an additional two years, and the terms would be renegotiated.\nThe good news is that the agreement isn&apos;t officially dead. The bad news, though, is that in the short term, North Atlantic will effectively lose four additional rig contracts. By September 2015, it will likely find itself with just three of its eight rigs employed,and potentially having to cold-stack -- put into storage at a cost of $110,000-$120,000 per day in maintenance fees-- five ultra deep-water or UDW rigs.\nThis will likely devastate North Atlantic&apos;s cash flow and make it extremely difficult for the company to service its $2.6 billion debt load. Luckily for the company Seadrill recentlyguaranteeing its debt-- bailing it out but potentially exposing its own shareholders to a 21% increase in annual interest payments.\nHowever, a recent Rosneft announcement also gives hope that the deal may eventually be salvaged.\nArctic drilling may not be dead after allBack in September of 2014,ExxonMobil and Rosneftannounced a major find in the Kara Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean.\nAccording to Rosneft, the Universitetskaya-1 well was a spectacular success and indicated that, \"The resource base estimate of just this oil trap is 338 billion cubic meters of gas [12 trillion cubic feet] and more than 100 million tons [714 million barrels] of oil. And this is just the estimates of this very structure.\"\nThe potential for oil and gas recovery in the Arctic is nothing short of astounding, with Rosneft estimating that theUniversitetskaya region alone contains 9.3 billion barrels of oil,while the entire Kara Sea is thought to hold up to 87 billion barrels of oil.\nSadly for Exxon, western sanctions against Russia forced it to suspend its work with Rosneft soon after the well was drilled, but on April 9th, Rosneft announced it would resume drilling in the Kara Sea in 2016 and is considering working with previous partners, including Exxon and North Atlantic Drilling, whose West Alpha rig was used in theUniversitetskaya-1 well discovery.\nWith North Atlantic losing its largest customer for the next two years, and Seadrill now on the hook to cover the company&apos;s debt, the short-term situation for both Seadrill and North Atlantic looks pretty grim.

It\u2019s through a myriad of setbacks that began with 9-11 and included two major stock market crashes; a housing crash and the Great Recession. However, consumer sentiment is still below its January 2000 peak and one has to wonder why.\nThere are so many narratives and theories as to why the stock market could be up so much, which begs the question: will consumer confidence remain range-bound?\nWhile there is no doubt the American consumer is stepping up to the plate, American businesses are stepping up as well. Larry Kudlow mentioned the \u201ccapital goods boom,\u201d which hasn\u2019t gotten any press coverage.

A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. Low 49F. Winds S at 5 to 10 mph.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo signs election reform bills in New York City Thursday. Seated, from left, are Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, Cuomo and actor/director Ben Stiller. Standing, from left, are Assemblyman Charles Lavine, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie and state Sen. James Sanders.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday signed legislation making New York the 38th state to allow early voting.\nThe bill, which the Democratic-led state Legislature passed last week, establishes a nine-day early voting period before election days. The early voting period would conclude on the Sunday before an election.\nDemocratic lawmakers attempted for years to adopt an early voting system, but the bill was blocked by Republicans when the GOP controlled the state Senate. With Democrats now in the Senate majority, the bill cleared that legislative hurdle.\n\"Early voting is going to be transformative for the system,\" said Cuomo, who has, for years, included early voting in his annual legislative agenda.\nThere is a question of how counties will fund the implementation of early voting, which will take effect this year. The estimated cost of early voting is $10 million, although others have suggested the cost is much higher \u2014 possibly as high as $1 million for each of the 57 counties outside New York City, according to the New York State Association of Counties.\nThe Let NY Vote Coalition, which advocated for early voting and other election reforms, called on Cuomo to include funding in the state budget for early voting. Cuomo's budget proposal doesn't include funding for early voting or other reforms.\nCuomo's office has said another reform \u2014 consolidating the federal and state primary elections \u2014 will save counties $25 million. The savings, they argue, can be used to fund early voting. But Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause/NY and founding member of the Let NY Vote Coalition, explained that for early voting to be successful there must be funding in the budget.\n\"While the consolidation of primaries will produce a cost savings as the governor suggests, a cost savings is not the same as direct funding,\" Lerner said. \"Additionally, primaries won't be consolidated until next year even though early voting is slated to begin this November. That would make early voting an unfunded mandate forcing counties to cover the cost.\"\nConsolidating the primaries was necessary because unlike every other state, New York had a separate federal and state primary election. Since 2012, the federal primary for congressional races has been held in late June. The state and local primary has been held in September.\nUnder the new law signed by Cuomo, the federal and state primary election will be held on the fourth Tuesday in June.\nThe other reforms Cuomo signed include transferring voter registration within the state if a resident moves to another county and allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote. When teens sign up for a learner's permit or driver's license at the Department of Motor Vehicles, they may preregister to vote. This would ensure they are registered to vote when they turn 18, the legal voting age.\nCuomo also closed the LLC loophole, which allowed"}

The company\u2019s new mobile app is making it easier than ever for businesses to buy and sell industrial equipment \u2014 allowing bids to be made on the move.\nSurplex has been hosting machinery sales and auctions for more than 15 years now. After strong and steady growth throughout Europe, the Surplex website now has more than 150,000 visitors every month, from 150 countries. The online services offered by this growing company now include various payment facilities, transport cost calculators and a comprehensive online search facility. With offices in Dusseldorf, Prague, London and several other European cities, Surplex is now the leading online auction house for metal processing and wood machining.\nThe story of the Surplex app began in mid-2012, when CEO Michael Werker discovered that the number of users using the online auction service was in excess of 5,000 per month. Several employees were pushing for the development of an app at this point, but questions remained about whether or not people would be prepared to make five-figure transactions via smartphone.\nAn initial development cost of \u20ac17,000 was calculated and a test registration page was set up in order to ascertain how many users would sign up and use a mobile app. The positive response persuaded the Surplex board to go ahead with the project, which would allow users to bid for metalworking and woodworking machinery on the go.\nFrom the moment the Surplex app was launched, the download numbers exceeded expectations. During the first month, the mobile app was downloaded 547 times. In Germany, it ranked 236 in the iPad business download chart and 241 for the iPhone. After just two months, the 1,000 downloads mark was achieved. Without any formal marketing budget, the Surplex app consistently achieves 100 downloads per week. To date, the app is used by more than 3,500 people across 95 nations. Between the iPhone and Android versions, the app is downloaded around 700 times a month \u2014 and this figure is growing.\nWhat Does the Surplex App Have to Offer?\nSimply opening the Surplex app for the very first time allows the user to view a list of current auctions or sale events \u2014 shown in order of expiry. Clicking on one of the sale events takes the user to either a list of the available machinery or a specific auction page. Many sale or liquidation events have several machines for sale, all of which are listed in order of the auction closing date. There is a brief description of the equipment for sale, along with details of the manufacturer, the quality of the machine and the relevant delivery terms.\nIndividuals, business owners and key decision makers now perform a lot of their duties on the go, so the ability to make significant purchases via a mobile app is becoming an increasingly important priority.\nEach user must register their details, along with an appropriate method of payment. Once the registration process is complete, the user can then bid on machinery via the app. Alternatively, there is also the option to add the item to a watch list, which means the user is automatically updated on developments. If more information about the equipment is required, full contact details of the Surplex employee overseeing the auction are available.\nThe online bidding process is simple and transparent. The app displays the current bid, the user\u2019s highest bid and the next bid that will be accepted. As long as the user has registered and accepted the terms and conditions of the auction, new bids can be placed with a press of a button.\nBuying"}

{"idx": "6823", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A recent top news story has been NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. The controversy was amplified when President Trump weighed in with objections to this behavior, and his recommendation that the NFL pass a rule disallowing it. This kind of controversy doesn't make life easier for NFL leaders, but it really isn't their biggest problem. Ratings didn't start dropping recently, viewership has been declining since 2015.\nNFL viewership had a pretty steady climb through 2014. But in 2015 ratings leveled. Then in 2016 viewership fell a whopping 9%. During the first 6 weeks of the 2016 regular season (into early October) viewership was down 11%. Through the first 9 weeks of 2016 ratings were down 14% before things finally leveled off. Although nobody had a clear explanation why viewership declined so markedly, there was widespread agreement that 2016 was a ratings crash for the league. Fox had its worst NFL viewership since 2008, and ESPN had its worst since 2005.\nInterestingly, later analysis showed that overall people were watching 5% more games. But they were watching less of each game. In other words, fans had become more casual about their viewership. People were watching less TV, watching less cable, and that included live sports. And those who stream games almost never streamed the entire game.\nAnd this behavior change wasn't limited to the NFL. As reported at Politifact.com, Paulsen, editor in chief of Sports Media Watch said, \"it's really important to note the NFL is not declining while other leagues are increasing. NASCAR ratings are in the cellar right now. The NBA had some of its lowest rated games ever on network television last year... It's an industry-wide phenomenon and the NFL isn't immune to it anymore.\" So the declining viewership problem is widespread, and much older than the recent national anthem controversy.\nMagna Global recently released its 2017 U.S. Sports Report. According to Radio + Television Business Report (RBR.com) the age of live sports viewers is scewing older. Much older. Today the average NFL viewer is at least 50. Similar to tennis, and college basketball and football. That's second only to baseball at 57 - which was 50 as recently as 2000. But no sport is immune. NHL viewers are now typically 49. They were 33 in 2000. As simple arithmetic shows, the same folks are watching hockey but few new viewers are being attracted. Based on recent trends, Magna projects viewership for the Sochi Olympics and 2018 World Cup will both decline.\nI've written before about the importance of studying demographic trends when planning. These trends are highly reliable, even if boring. And they provide a lot of insight. In the case of live sports watching, younger people simply don't sit down and watch a complete game. Younger people have different behaviors. They watch an entire season of shows in one day. They multi-task, doing many things at once. And they prefer information in short bursts - like weekly blogs rather than a book. And they are more interested in outcomes, the final result, than watching how it happened. Where older people watch a game play-by-play, younger people simply want to know the major events and the final score.\nTo understand what's happening with NFL ratings we really don't have to look much further than simple demographics -- the aging of"}

However, in Australia the unit suffered deaths by suicides, car and motorbike accidents and training accidents,\u201d Mr Williamson said. Each year on November 11, Australians observe one minute\u2019s silence at 11 am in memory of those who died, suffered or fought in all wars and armed conflicts. \u201cRemembrance Day to me is a day where I remember everyone that has sacrificed themselves for others in one way or another,\u201d Mr Williamson said. Growing up in Collie, Mr Williamson said he joined the army in infantry when he was just 19 years old. \u201cAs a child, it was my dream job and I just didn\u2019t know what else I would like to do for a career,\u201d he said. After submitting his application he said he went through thorough testing to see if he was capable of doing the job. \u201cI had to complete a phone interview, an aptitude test and a physical test. After completing all of that I had to go to Perth where I had an interview with an army officer, a psychologist. I proceeded on to do a final medical test and after passing that I pledged my allegiance and was ready to go,\u201d he said. Shortly after pledging he was sent to Kapooka, New South Wales for 80 days where he was put through the paces of Basic Soldier Training. \u201cIt\u2019s where they mould you to become a soldier. I found it a little hard to adjust to army life being from a small town and being on the other side of the country. It was also a little hard to fit in at first,\u201d Mr Williamson said. Shortly after his group of 30 were sent to do their Initial Employment Training for three months to become an infantryman at 5/7 Royal Australian Regiment, which is an infantry battalion in Darwin. \u201cIt was physically and mentally hard but it had to prepare you for anything. Out of the group of 30 we lost around six that just weren\u2019t cut out for it,\u201d Mr Williamson said. After completing his training he was placed in the 5/7 RAR and in December 2006 they broke and he was put in 5 RAR, which he was fortunate enough to deploy overseas with. The following year he deployed to Iraq as an infantryman gunner, mainly vehicle mount operations in a personal carrier Australian Light Armoured Vehicle. \u201cOur main role over there was the hearts and minds of the locals and secondary was to disrupt enemy freedom of movement,\u201d he said. Though it was meant to be a six-month deployment it was cut short for Mr Williamson. At the two month point, he was the rear gunner with his torso hanging out of an ASLAV when it rolled. \u201cI luckily only received minor injuries with a cracked shoulder blade and heavily bruised my face, on initial scans they thought I broke my shoulder blade so they sent me home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the hardest times in my career, not the injury but being sent home early and that everyone I knew was still over there. I felt alone. After three long months of recovery, I was almost back to normal.\u201d Two years later he deployed to East Timor for nine months as an infantryman gunner and rover driver, where their main rolls were peacekeeping and engaging and supporting the locals. \u201cWe would patrol out by foot or in vehicles to different villages to interact"}

Since then, Washington supplied at least $1.5 billion to related infrastructure programs. The money was intended to fund infrastructure improvements in the country to support the US counterinsurgency campaign.\nSeven projects have been slated for completion by mid-2013. Four of the five delayed projects involve building power lines; the fifth aims to construct provincial justice centers across the country.\nThe report heavily criticized a plan to use diesel generators to generate electricity for the country\u2019s second-largest city, Kandahar, as a stopgap until the US Agency for International Development and the US Army Corps of Engineers install a hydropower turbine at a dam in conflict-ridden Helmand Province.\nThe work is projected to cost US taxpayers roughly $220 million through 2013, and there are no guarantees the Taliban will not seize control of the dam following the planned US troop withdrawal.\nThe Inspector General also warns a $23 million road in Helmand Province could spark a violent public backlash, since the Afghan government has yet to compensate owners who had buildings demolished during construction.\nIn addition, the report reveals that four $300 million electricity projects do not have contractors, despite assertions from Washington that they will yield strong counterinsurgency benefits.\nThe document concludes that the failure of the US to deliver on these projects has produced an \u201cexpectations gap\u201d among the population that could impair stabilization efforts.\nIn response to the strong criticism from the Inspector General, the US Embassy in Kabul dismissed the concerns as \u201cspeculative,\u201d the Washington Post reports.\n\"Given the nature of what we're trying to do here, we don't expect to be going in one single, linear positive direction \u2026 It's more like going up and down and backward a few steps and then forward a few more\", the New York Times reports, quoting an anonymous US official in Kabul.\nBut critics of US policy in Afghanistan insist that funnelling money to Kabul will not make the war-torn country more secure.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no data that shows these major projects have changed the security environment in the country.

Here, the off-the-cuff expert offers wisdom on how to free associate your way to solid spontaneous storytelling.\nWhat we say matters a great deal, but so does what we don\u2019t say. There are times when you just can\u2019t afford to clam up when called upon to contribute. While it\u2019s impractical to be forever armed with go-to stories on every conceivable topic\u2014just in case your boss or a bridal party should parachute out of the sky, seeking your input\u2014there are ways to prepare for off-the-cuff storytelling.\nIf anyone knows the ins and outs of speaking extemporaneously, it\u2019s Matt Besser. Along with Amy Poehler and Adam McKay, Besser is one of the original members of Upright Citizens Brigade, the improv and sketch troupe that eventually launched a show on Comedy Central, several theaters and schools, and also the careers of everyone from Ed Helms to Aziz Ansari and Donald Glover. Besser also directed a movie recently, and he hosts a weekly improv podcast, called, simply, Improv4Humans.\nOne of the longest-running shows at the UCB theatre in New York and Los Angeles is called ASSSSCAT. Part of the show\u2019s charm is that it relies on guests to recite monologues, which the theatre\u2019s improvisers then parse through for details to use in their performance. The guest has no idea what topic he or she will be speaking about. As someone who has performed in and guided guests through literally thousands of such shows, though, Besser has rare insight into what can make or break an unprepared speech. Below are his tips for how to get through the high wire act of spontaneous storytelling, without letting the audience down.\nOften when people don\u2019t do so well in a monologue at UCB, it\u2019s because they\u2019re racking their brain so hard to be funny that they\u2019re just not honest and don\u2019t just tell a true story, which is what we want. A story is ultimately a memory. It\u2019s important when you\u2019re telling a story to think about why this memory is a memory. You don\u2019t remember everything in life, you just remember certain things\u2013so, why this one? Well, it\u2019s because it was an atypical day, for better or worse. Something happened which makes that day stick out. So, whatever it is that makes it a memory, that\u2019s what makes it interesting. That is ultimately the theme of the story.\nIt\u2019s important not to get too hung up on having a story that\u2019s exactly on what you\u2019re suggested to speak about. You can use it as inspiration or a launching point. I did my improv show earlier today and I asked for one-word suggestions from Twitter. So here\u2019s one that fits what I was just saying: Pumpernickel. So, have I eaten pumpernickel bread? Maybe. Do I have a story on it? Definitely not. But if I need to start talking, I can\u2019t just sit there and say \u201cPumpernickel\u2026 pumpernickel.\u201d I can\u2019t force myself to have a memory about pumpernickel if it doesn\u2019t occur to me right away. So I have to free associate.\nThe most simple way to go here is bread, but I should probably try to be more specific, like \u201cWhat kind of bread?\u201d How about fancy bread?

Environmentalists hail her steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, opposed by industry groups and congressional Republicans.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson announced Thursday that she's stepping down after a four-year tenure marked by her agency's first greenhouse gas regulations and repeated battles with industry groups and GOP lawmakers.\nJackson, the first African American to serve as EPA administrator, came into office with bold plans to address climate change but accomplished only part of her agenda, foiled by opposition on Capitol Hill and occasionally the White House.\nShe often faced harsh congressional grilling. Last year, the GOP chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, said she would need her own parking spot at the Capitol because he planned to summon her often for questioning.\nJackson, 50, a chemical engineer by training and a mom of two teenagers, offered no reason for her resignation other than saying she's ready for \"new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference.\" She said she was leaving the EPA \"confident the ship is sailing in the right direction.\"\nHer departure, slated to occur after President Obama's annual State of the Union address in January, comes amid other turnover that's common between presidential terms.

These jobs are grueling, non-stop,\" said David Goldston, director of government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.\n\"She's been an outspoken fighter for environmental protection,\" Goldston said, noting the EPA's signature finding that carbon dioxide and five other gases that contribute to climate change qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\nThat \"endangerment finding,\" which has withstood the industry's court challenges, enabled the EPA to set new emission standards for cars and light trucks. The standard requires new models to nearly double their required miles per gallon by 2025. In March, the EPA proposed emissions limits for new power plants, making it nearly impossible to build coal-fired ones.\nUnder her tenure, the EPA set the first standards for emitting mercury, arsenic and other toxins from power plants, and this month, it finalized tougher limits for emitting fine-particle soot from smokestacks, wood-burning stoves and diesel vehicles.\nThese rules won plaudits from environmentalists but rarely from industry. Howard Feldman of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry, said the soot standard could increase energy prices and decrease jobs. \"We fear this new rule may be just the beginning of a 'regulatory cliff,'\" he said.\nHouse Republicans, including Rep.

{"idx": "6842", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Departmentalization is an aspect of organizational design where a business divides its staff into smaller units based on tasks within the company. Most companies, including restaurants, are likely to use two or more types of departmentalization at the same time. Restaurants are often organized around the types of food served, the tasks handled by the staff and the chain of command in the company. Other departments may be developed if there are a add-on services such as banquet facilities and catering or if there are several stores within a geographic region.\nRegional grouping is likely to be used in a restaurant chain where more than one branch of the same chain exists in a region, city or county. For example, the 25 percent of McDonald\u2019s restaurants that are not franchises are managed by a hierarchy of staff, including area supervisors. Each area supervisor is responsible for the performance of a group of stores within a specific geographical area.\nFunctional departmentalization in a restaurant allows the separation of sales and marketing tasks from those jobs connected with operations. Sales would fall under the role of a server assisting customers and helping them select an enjoyable meal while operations in a restaurant centers on the preparation of food. In this scenario, management may have difficulty deciding where to include staff that makes and serves drinks at the restaurant\u2019s bar, because they are involved in both activities.\nDepartmentalization according to product type could work in various way depending on the size of the restaurant. Activities and costs related to food preparation and service might be separated from those that related to the preparation and serving of drinks. In large restaurants, the kitchen may be divided into preparation sections such as salads, grilling station, side dishes and desserts. In this type of departmentalization, the bar becomes a separate department from the dining area or kitchen, a logical method of categorization in this industry.\nChain of command departmentalization works when the restaurant is large enough to require more than one management division. For example, roles may be divided into front of house and back of house. The manager who oversees servers, food runners, bartenders and hostesses will be in charge of the front of the house. The back of house manager will oversee workers such as chefs, cooks, and dishwashers.\nIn some instances there may also be a General Manager or Owner who will oversee the entire operation and staff.\nCustomer departmentalization works by dividing the organization around the different types of customers. In a restaurant environment, this could take the form of individual customers versus catering for corporate clients and hosting group events. One group of staff may handle the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, while a separate group manages the catering arm of the company, whether on the premises or outside. Departmentalization like this would effectively also be functional and possibly chain-of-command departmentalization at the same time.\nDepending on the size of a restaurant, it may use two or more types of departmentalization. A chain may split its operation along the lines of both product and chain of command by having a food department and a beverage department, with food reporting to the chef while beverage reports to the licensee. A smaller restaurant may use functional departmentalization, such as kitchen operations versus customer service, and combine this with process departmentalization. This would result in the kitchen staff, already defined by function, being further divided into segments.\nSome kitchen staff would focus on actual cooking and food preparation while others would assist with more service related tasks like dressing salads and plating desserts for delivery to guests.\nSandilands, Tracey. \"What Are Types of Departmentalization That Would Be Used in a Restaurant?\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/two"}

So Bush\ufffds critics in this hemisphere find it fitting that he\ufffds now knee-deep in a policy mess over illegal Mexican immigration into the U.S., looking to Fox for any help he can provide. But when Bush, Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper meet today in Canc\ufffdn to discuss the continent\ufffds dysfunctional immigration situation, they might consider that one solution lies not so much in guest-worker programs or a 2,000-mile-long border fence, but in trade\u0097namely, a revision of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nPerhaps they should ask why NAFTA\u0097which took effect 12 years ago amid promises to raise the fortunes of Mexico\ufffds beleaguered workers\u0097hasn\ufffdt done more to reduce desperate labor migration over the U.S. border. That illegal flow, about a million migrants a year, is as heavy as ever. (Just ask CNN's Lou Dobbs, who\ufffds broadcasting live from Canc\ufffdn this week because he\ufffds so aggravated about it.) NAFTA has not been an altogether bad deal for Mexico; it has buoyed the economy and improved opportunities for workers in the more technologically advanced north. But it has only exacerbated their plight in the nation\ufffds south and midsection\u0097states like Oaxaca and Zacatecas that are hemorrhaging workers to California lettuce fields, North Carolina poultry plants and Chicago restaurants.\nThe big reason, say critics, is that NAFTA all but sold Mexico\ufffds campesinos up the Rio Grande by failing to challenge lavish U.S. and Canadian agricultural subsidies\u0097the kind that all too often shut Third World farmers out of First World markets. Moreover, free trade has also failed to generate enough U.S. and other foreign investment in new industries and small- and medium-size businesses\u0097and, as a result, hasn't created enough new Mexican jobs. Even when new jobs do appear, the nation\ufffds unforgiving low-wage business culture\u0097the dark shame of Mexico's political and economic leaders, which NAFTA was also supposed to reform\u0097makes sure that they still often pay in a day what similar work would pay in an hour in the U.S. Add the recent deluge of dirt-cheap Chinese imports into North America that are taking business previously provided by Mexico, and the urgency for Mexican workers to head north only heightens.\nIt's no wonder then that Andr\ufffds Manuel L\ufffdpez Obrador, the leftist former mayor of Mexico City whose platform focuses on the poor, is the heavy favorite to win Mexico\ufffds July 2 presidential election.

If that holds, up, the president is probably going to win narrowly.\nRight now, in two major polls, President Bush leads Sen. John Kerry outside the \u201cmargin of error\u201d among likely voters. In one of them, the Gallup released yesterday afternoon, the Bush and Kerry vote totals 97 percent.\nThis is a very significant fact, because the presidential vote between the two major candidates almost never adds up to 100 percent.

And this year Ralph Nader who will probably get 1 percent or so himself.\nThat leaves \u2013 get this \u2013 only 1 percent of the vote remaining undecided.\nUnder these conditions, using Gallup as the barometer, Bush will probably win. Why? Because his lead is outside the margin of error and more than a million Bush voters would have to switch over to Kerry to give the Massachusetts senator the victory.\nBut say the undecided number is really 2 percent, or even 4 percent. What happens then?\nThis bit of wisdom is based on a longterm trend in the Gallup poll. Since 1936, undecided voters in the last poll taken before a presidential election do seem to opt for the challenger in greater numbers.\nBut, as dalythoughts.com\u2019s Gerry Daly points out, the result changes significantly if you use the second-to-last Gallup as your reference point.\nOnly twice since 1936 have undecideds in the second-to-last Gallup poll broken for the challenger. And it was only significant once, in 1980, when the undecided swing to Ronald Reagan helped him win a landslide against incumbent Jimmy Carter.\nIn the other 10 presidential elections featuring incumbents in the past 68 years, the voters from the second-to-last Gallup either broke for the incumbent or broke evenly.\nthat to catch up to Bush \u2013 70 to 75 percent of the undecided voters at least.\nThat huge margin for Kerry just doesn\u2019t seem likely right now.\nAh, but what about all the excitement over the newly registered?\nthis year. Both parties have spent vast sums looking for these new voters and registering them, and there\u2019s reason to believe their efforts will basically cancel each other out.\nBut let\u2019s assign 55 percent of them to Kerry. That\u2019s 5.5 million voters. With those 5.5 million voters, surely then Kerry will win.\nUm, no, he won\u2019t. Because Bush will get 4.5 million new votes. This would make Kerry\u2019s margin among new voters only 1 million votes \u2013 in an electorate of 115 million. That\u2019s not even a single percentage point increase. Kerry can\u2019t win that way.\nNow here\u2019s why the tiny number of undecided voters may matter even less than these numbers indicate.\nYou\u2019re an undecided voter. Don\u2019t really feel hot either way. You get up next Tuesday, and you hear on the radio or see on TV that there\u2019s a record turnout \u2013 long lines at the polls. You may"}

Even after averaging 16.9 points and 10.3 rebounds per game as a freshman, there were enough questions about McCoy's pro potential to drop him out of the second round.\nUNLV struggled defensively with McCoy on the floor in 2017-18, and he did not display much of an outside shot during the season, attempting just nine 3-pointers and making three.

{"idx": "6861", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Looking at the morning paper last Monday gave me a start, and not just because color photos of a wild-eyed Hillary Clinton with a pasted on smile still shock. The Washington Post headline screamed that Hillary had won the Democratic nomination, with stories following on the \"historic\" achievement. What's this? I thought \u2013 did I sleep for three days? Is it Wednesday, with the results from the California primary already in?\nThe Post along with the rest of the mainstream media anointed Clinton the winner without giving poor Bernie Sanders a last-gasp West Coast chance. And, generally speaking, what critical analysis there was about Hillary's sudden historic victory assumed that it was created by unallocated superdelegates to pre-empt a possible Sanders victory in California. That is almost certainly true. The other thing Clinton and her supporters in the media want to do by anointing her as early as possible is to pre-empt Hillary's other nemesis, the FBI.\nThere was never much doubt that Hillary would win the nomination even if Sanders pulled out a victory in California. So whatever damage control the early victory announcement produced would have been cosmetic in any event. However, with respect to the FBI's ongoing investigation of Clinton's home-brewed email server, the stakes are far higher and the early claim of victory more significant. The FBI is investigating likely violations of federal laws governing official record-keeping, maintaining classified information, evidence-tampering, obstruction of justice, and possible pay-for-play bribery through the Clinton foundation. Prosecution of any one of these infractions could reroute Hillary's march to the Oval Office into a penitentiary.\nHillary knows that actual prosecution by the Obama administration's Justice Department is a very long shot, even assuming that the FBI refers charges. Nonetheless, the mere referral of charges by the FBI to Justice would damage her campaign and increase doubt among a voting public that already overwhelmingly regards her as dishonest.\nWhat FBI director James Comey intends is perhaps the greatest conundrum in Washington these days. Is he playing Hamlet to Hillary's Claudius, introspective, doubtful, and unwilling to strike the killing blow? Is he just being a careful apolitical policeman? Or is he a political hack who will do what's best for Jim Comey? Perhaps it's a bit of all three. Whatever the truth, it is in Hillary's best interest to discourage Comey as much as possible. Her early claim to be the Democrat nominee serves that purpose.\nIf Comey is an honest policeman, the best time for him to have acted was before Hillary claimed the nomination. Then he would only have been referring charges against another \u2013 albeit notorious \u2013 private citizen. After the nomination, Hillary becomes not only the standard bearer of one of America's two great political parties, but a \"historic\" figure as the first woman to do so. As such, it behooved both Hillary and her backers in the media to reach that point ASAP.\nAs far as Hillary, the mainstream media, and the Democratic Party are concerned, that has now happened, even if the convention is still many weeks away. As a political and media matter, an FBI referral at this point will be against not only the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, but also a historic figure, an affront to the American political system and women everywhere. Hillary is now well positioned to play the old Clinton game, one she perfected long ago in defense of her husband's transgressions: that of the \"vast right wing conspiracy\" that through a Republican FBI director would derail the first female nomine"}

The Keechi project, by RES Americas, will begin construction early in 2014.\nRob Bernard, Microsoft's chief environmental strategist, said power generated by the farm's 55 turbines would feed into the same electrical grid that supplies the company's data centre in San Antonio.\nThe windfarm will not supply all of the data centre's power \u2013 and Microsoft in line with other companies would not comment on overall electricity use at the facility.\nBut the company and analysts said Microsoft's decision to use its corporate muscle to push more renewable energy onto the grid represented an important step forward. Data centres are a large and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"We have been doing the renewable energy credits for a while,\" Bernard said. \"But here we are catalysing a project from the ground up.\"\nHe added: \"Without our capital we know this plant would not have been built.\"\nThe power deal helps close the gap between Microsoft and companies such as Google, which made earlier moves towards buying their electricity directly from windfarms, said Gary Cook, technology campaigner for Greenpeace.\n\"They haven't broken any new ground for the industry, but they have broken new ground for Microsoft,\" he said.\n\"If they are using the windfarm to increase the amount of renewable energy in the electricity supply chain that is a great investment and will continue to drive more renewable energy investment onto the grid if they continue down that path.\"\nSix big internet companies \u2013 Apple, Facebook, Google, Rackspace, Salesforce and Box \u2013 have committed to 100% renewable power for their data centres. Microsoft, though not among them, committed last year to be \"carbon neutral\", imposing its own internal carbon marketplace.\nThe company said proceeds from that carbon fee had helped to fund its purchase agreement with the Keechi project.\nIt said those economics made the Keechi deal more attractive than going through the conventional route of buying renewable energy credits.\n\"It's hard to buy green power at an attractive rate. It is pretty easy to go to your utility and pay a lot of money to get a stamp of greenness on your electricity bill,\" said Brian Janous, Microsoft's director of energy strategy. \"But when you are a very large consumer of energy you have the opportunity to sit face-to-face directly with the developer of a 110MW wind project.\"\nThe company also said it was preparing further announcements on its greening efforts in the weeks ahead."}

It\u2019s so easy that you can boil down an explanation to one word: freshmen. (You could also point to that brutal schedule.) Ditto for the hiccups at youth-dominated Kansas, which beat Duke early then lost to Villanova, Colorado and Florida.\nBut how do you explain a team like North Carolina, with its mix of youth and experience leading it to one of the most up-and-down beginnings in Tobacco Road memory? Lose to Belmont at home, then beat defending champ Louisville a week later. Lay an egg on the road against UAB, then blow top-ranked Michigan State out of the water three days later. Come out guns blazing in beating Kentucky but play without intensity in a loss to Texas.\nMy UNC theory went like this: As the Tar Heels awaited the results of a joint review by the university and the NCAA on the many travails of junior guard P.J. Hairston, this was a team without an alpha dog and therefore a team without an identity.\nThat limbo ended Friday, when the school announced it will not seek Hairston\u2019s reinstatement from the NCAA, thus ending his UNC basketball career.\n\u2022 New SI swimsuit cover sizzzzzzlin\u2019!\n\u2022 Why is the world so mad at Barbie?\n\u2022 Rihanna toying with NFL stud\u2019s heart?\n\"Unfortunately P.J. made a number of mistakes that placed his eligibility at risk, and the university\u2019s joint review with the NCAA made it clear that seeking reinstatement for P.J. would not be possible,\" UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement. \"The university thanks him for his contributions to Carolina basketball.\"\nThose mistakes? They form a laundry list. In May, he was cited for speeding. In June, he was pulled over and cited for possession of marijuana and driving without a license; those charges were dismissed the next month when Hairston completed a drug assessment. Perhaps the bigger problem in regard to eligibility was that at both traffic stops he was driving rental cars linked to or rented by a local party promoter who is a convicted felon. Then in July Hairston was suspended indefinitely by head coach Roy Williams after he was cited for speeding and careless and reckless driving, caught going 93 miles per hour in a 65-mile-per-hour zone. (He was driving his girlfriend\u2019s car.) Hairston has been back with the team at practice since September but had yet to play in a game this season.\nYou could call this a self-inflicted tragedy in this young man\u2019s life. After a breakout year in 2012-13, when he led Carolina in scoring and emerged as one of the nation\u2019s better 3-point shooters \u2013 his 89 threes were second in UNC history for one season \u2013 now he\u2019s on the outside looking in for the upcoming NBA draft.

His neighbors in the European Economic Community, long founded on borderless trade, also seem to be opting away from multilateral action as highlighted by German Chancellor Merkel's refusal to bailout Eastern Europe.\nA prescient article from VOX EU says isolationism however is not to blame for shrinking economies just yet. A contraction in supply chains and credit availability has occured and that has hit manufacturaing nodes on the Pacific Rim particularly hard, but no country has sworn off imports completely--despite rhetorical calls to \"buy American\" or French or Chinese. Still, it should be noted that what started as a financial crisis last year has expanded into a full-scale global trade crisis. The G 20's meeting in London this spring will have to grapple how to keep emerging economies afloat while successfully investing billions in stimulus plans at home.\nIf you have a global trade plan for the G 20 to consider, do upload it to your ideas page on Big Think."}

It has an eight-speed transmission to spread out that grunt (compared to the six-speed box in the petrol). And like all diesels, it is more fuel efficient.\nSpecifically, the diesel is a 2.2-litre with 197bhp and 440Nm of torque, versus the 2.4-litre normally aspirated petrol's 185bhp and 238Nm.\nOff the starting block, the diesel hits the century mark in 9.4 seconds, beating the petrol by one whole second. Top speed is 203kmh, versus the petrol's 195kmh.\nAnd the diesel has a stated fuel consumption of 7.6 litres/100km, considerably lower than the petrol's 9.8 litres.\nThis translates to bigger comfort zones in manoeuvres such as lane-changing, merging and overtaking. You need not leave as big a gap as you would with the petrol.\nAnd as with most diesels, the Hyundai's engine reaches its peak far earlier than the petrol unit.\nThat, however, is irrelevant when you have 440Nm of shove from just 1,750rpm.\nThe car goes from a trot to a full gallop more effortlessly than its petrol sibling.\nThere is downside to driving the diesel, though. Firstly, the diesel chatter comes through quite clearly. It is not painfully intrusive, but it is there, droning in the background.\nSecondly, the diesel takes a mite longer to wake up from its stop-start slumber.\nThis proves to be slightly unpleasant if and when the car decides to take a fuel-saving nap at a junction or at the lights. Which is rather frequent.\nBut this shortcoming can be dealt with easily - just deactivate the stop-start function with the touch of a button.\nThankfully, the car is fitted with a whole suite of other features which are more useful than stop-start.\nThese include memory seats, electronic parking brake with auto-hold function, a connected infotainment touchscreen, a 360-degree camera system (always nifty in a big car like an SUV), wireless smartphone charging and a multi-function steering wheel with easy-to-use cruise control. Strangely, navigation is not available.\nThere are other features which help you - and others - stay safe.\nLike in the petrol, the car has head-up display (unheard of in this price range) which incorporates visual blind-spot warnings. The rear doors will not open if the car's rear cross traffic alert detects an oncoming vehicle.\nAnd there is a sensor system which will trigger an alarm if you should walk away leaving a child or a pet locked in the car.\nThe Santa Fe serves well as a family carrier.

The Dominican Republic followed by the brands from Mexico in mid-December of last year.\n\u201cFor us it was one of the most important consumer points because of the representation Mexico has in the US Hispanic market,\u201d Taveras said.

But not everyone saw it that way.\nDavid, because for some reason he's still not over his beef with Jordan, had to stir the pot by expressing his interest in Jenna by bringing her a birthday cake.

But it does mean that you\u2019re right to question whether barefoot running is right for you.\nAdding to this body of knowledge is a study out of Brigham Young University that tracked the health of feet making the transition from running in shoes to minimalist footwear (Vibram Five Fingers).\nThirty-six experienced recreational runners had scans of their feet and lower limbs before and after the 10 week experiment that split the group into two; a control group that kept running in traditional footwear and the experimental group that slowly transitioned (one mile per week for three weeks) to Vibrams.\nThe first set of scans showed no difference between both sets of runners. The second scan however showed a greater incidence of injury in the feet of Vibram wearers than in the shod runners.\nThe authors went on to suggest that runners wishing to transition to minimalist shoes, do so over a time frame longer than 10 weeks and ease into the footwear slower than the guidelines recommended by Vibram footwear manufacturers. Good advice for anyone switching from traditional running shoes to any minimalist shoe on the market."}

The report shows that 27% of Facebook browsing is on the news feed and home page \u2014 4% of all time spent online in the US. 21% of time was spent on profiles, 17% on Photos, 10% on applications, and 25% on the rest of the site. Most engagement with branded content happens on the news feed, not Pages, yet the average brand in the top 100 Facebook Pages reaches only 16% of their fans per week if they post five days a week.\nThese stats should illuminate that brands should put more effort into optimizing their news feed posts than developing apps for their Pages if they want to reach the most people. The report is based on a two million person opt-in panel of web internet users that agreed to be monitored, so the sample size is ample though it might skew towards savvier, less skittish users.\nFacebook\u2019s Photos feature is often considered a core driver of time spent on Facebook. ComScore\u2019s stats showing more usage of the news feed than Photos don\u2019t necessarily disprove this, as time spent reading news feed stories and notifications generated by photo uploads and tags are counted towards the news feed\u2019s time. Facebook has yet to develop other features as popular as the news feed or Photos.\nSome might expect that applications and games would take up more than 10% of user time. In September 2010, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said over 200 million people, or roughly 40% of users were playing games on Facebook when the service had 500 million users, and that stat might still hold true. A few months prior, Playdom CEO cited undisclosed personal sources saying 40% of all time on Facebook was spent on games \u2014 a much higher percentage than comScore\u2019s figures. These new stats should serve as a reality check that brands shouldn\u2019t be too focused on building tab applications or marketing within social games.\nComScore\u2019s data supports a similar conclusion as findings by Facebook Page analytics tool provider PageLever, which showed that the average Facebook Page receives an average of just 7.49 news feed post impressions and only 3.19 unique Page views per day per 100 fans. Essentially, each post a Page publishes only reaches a small fraction of its total fans via the news feed, and an even smaller portion of its fans visit the Page itself.\nPages that want to increase the percentage of their fans which they reach with news feed posts should make sure to post every day. A study of the top 100 Pages showed that for each additional day per week that a Page posts, it reaches 2.5% more of its fan base. Those that post every day can reach as much of 22% of their fan base each week.\nA study of three popular brands on Facebook, Starbucks, Bing, and Southwest Airlines, showed that they saw 40 to 151 times more impressions in the news feed than on their Pages. While this study only had three data points, marketers should take note of the disproportionate amount of exposure that occurs in the news feed. This is partly because re-shares of news feed posts by a Page\u2019s fans help drive news feed exposure.\nComScore\u2019s white paper also stresses that a great deal of potential for exposure lies in the friends of a brand\u2019s current fans.

{"idx": "6906", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Richard Suttmeier's \"Buy and Trade\" approach is tailor-made for volatile markets.\nInvestors are often told that their best move is to implement a \"Buy and Hold\" strategy. With this mantra, investors are taught that the market will \"always\" go up over time and thus stock positions will increase in value given a long enough time horizon.\n\"Buy and Hold\" has maintained its influence because performance chasing -- also referred to as \"P/E multiple expansion\"-- is the fundamental form of technical momentum. Because of this flawed momentum play, equity money managers and individuals have been trapped in a strategy that buys high and sells low.\nOver the last decade, Richard Suttmeier developed a strategy he calls \"Buy and Trade\" that is tailor-made for volatile markets and allows investors to move with markets rather than lose their capital when the markets take a turn for the worse. With \"Buy and Trade,\" you make gains by capturing market volatility with a set of pre-determined price targets based on his proprietary market analytics.\nSuttmeier is not a technical analyst; he chuckles at the notion that a stock will move higher if it trades above a certain level or move lower if it trades below another level. Think about this for a moment: A buy-rated stock gets cheaper fundamentally on weakness and a sell-rated stock gets more overvalued on strength. The only reason to sell a long position is if it reaches your upside target or loses its buy rating. The only reason to cover a short is if it reaches your downside target or losses its sell rating. You thus want to add to long positions when they are down and add to short positions on strength.\nIt works like this: Suttmeier assumes that a stock's price is the most important element in stock selection and in stock trading. By analyzing the past nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes --under the assumption that nine years of data is enough to assume all possible bullish or bearish events -- we can calculate the most important \"action prices\" for any stock, commodity, currency, market index or U.S. Treasury yield.\nUsing this form of analysis since 1984, Suttmeier developed a trading system which utilizes \"value levels,\" \"risky levels\" and \"pivots.\" Once you know the critical price levels for a given stock, commodity, currency, market index or U.S. Treasury yield, you can use \"Good until Canceled\" (GTC) limit orders to buy weakness to a value level and sell strength to a risky level. In this manner, you are building positions at the right price levels no matter the overall market direction.\nWhen Suttmeier shows a Value Level near a low or a Risky Level near a high, it's time to \"Buy and Trade.\" Investors should always seek to capture the volatility in between these critical price levels and take advantage of trading ranges -- while all the while being cognizant of the trend for the stocks being traded.\nBy using Suttmeier's proprietary action prices, you can capture a portion of the volatility as stocks move up and down. When using Value Levels, Pivots, and Risky Levels, it does not matter why you wish to own or be short a specific stock or market. Once you select your trades, simply use weakness to a Value Level as an opportunity to increase a long or to become less short and use strength to a Risky Level to become less long or to increase a short.\nAnother key element of Suttmeier's strategy is a p"}

He also showed mastery of the subject matter, more than enough to keep the lawyers and witnesses on their toes.\nFor several weeks, U.S. District Judge William Alsup showed that he was the smartest person in the courtroom as high-priced lawyers for Google and Oracle pleaded their cases. On Thursday afternoon, he basically slammed the door in Oracle's face, explaining in a 41-page ruling that the 37 Java APIs used in Google's Android platform do not fall under U.S. copyright laws. The ruling on APIs followed a jury verdict on May 23 that absolved Google of violating two Oracle patents.\nOracle was asking for more than $1 billion in damages, but in the end the jury found that Google only guilty of copying nine lines of rangeCheck code in the Timsort.java file, which one expert witness said a high school kid could have written. At this point, Google is on the hook for just statutory damages, with a maximum of $150,000.\nMastery of the courtroom wasn't all that the 67-year-old Alsup brought to the trial. He also demonstrated mastery of the complicated subject matter, more than enough to keep the army of lawyers from both sides and the witnesses on their toes.\nOn many days, the San Francisco courtroom where he presided was more like a computer science classroom. Alsup acknowledged during the trial that he had learned about Java coding to better prepare for the case, and it showed. On a daily basis, he would deftly query the lawyers and expert witnesses on the structure, sequence, and organizations of APIs to assist the jury in understanding the key facets of the copyright phase of the trial.\nIn one episode, Oracle's star lawyer, David Boies, who bested Bill Gates in U.S. v. Microsoft case and represented Vice President Al Gore in Bush v. Gore in front of the Supreme Court, was arguing that Google copied the nine lines of rangeCheck code to accelerate development to gain faster entry into the mobile phone market.\nAlsup told Boies, \"I have done, and still do, a significant amount of programming in other languages. I've written blocks of code like rangeCheck a hundred times before. I could do it, you could do it. The idea that someone would copy that when they could do it themselves just as fast, it was an accident. There's no way you could say that was speeding them along to the marketplace. You're one of the best lawyers in America --how could you even make that kind of argument?\"\nOracle plans to appeal Alsup's ruling. The company faces an uphill battle given the judge's ruling is rich in context, with detailed deconstructions of the Java language and APIs, as well as the expected legal citations and examples. It will likely serve as a textbook for future cases involving intellectual property rights and computer programming languages."}

Any connection between that syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, and the deadliest K-12 school shooting in American history is unfounded, advocates and experts say. They worry that any perceived link between the shootings and Asperger's may unfairly stigmatize those who have the condition.\n\"The main message to get out to the community is that all kids with disabilities, even kids who are prone to demonstrate violent behavior, are not likely to demonstrate the level that was demonstrated\" in Newtown, said Kristine Melloy, the president of the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders, who also works in the St. Paul, Minn., public schools. \"That's a rare kind of behavior.\"\nEven if Mr. Lanza, who was 20, had ever been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, it is a developmental disorder present at birth, not a mental-health condition, which may emerge any time in life.\nConnecticut authorities have not confirmed that Mr. Lanza had Asperger's, although his brother and others close to the family have done so to a variety of news outlets.

The other main reason is that it's hard to track, control, and manage their own ads when they're dispersed across dozens of sites.\nFreeWheel says it has the answer, and some in the entertainment sector agree. About 15 media firms--including CBS, parent company of CNET News, and an undisclosed top film studio--have signed up to the service during the past six months, sources told CNET News. Joost is the only well-known customer that FreeWheel has publicly disclosed.\nA CBS spokesman declined to comment for this story.\nSo what does FreeWheel offer that scores of other companies in this space, including Videoegg and Panache, don't? According to an executive at one of CBS' competitors, who has seen a demonstration of FreeWheel's technology, the company makes it so much simpler for content owners to sell and manage their ads across numerous Web sites.\nDoug Knopper, one of the three co-founders and co-CEO, says the company's system, known as Monetization Rights Management (MRM), works with existing ad management systems. MRM automatically allocates ad inventory, keeps track of ad revenue, and accounts for revenue splits between Web sites and content owners.\nA TV network, for example, may have a different deal with each of the Web sites on its distribution network. FreeWheel automatically takes the terms for each deal and calculates where the money goes. The company's technology has emerged at a time when TV networks and film studios want to control the advertising around their content.\nBut how does this make DRM obsolete?\nUntil recently, Hollywood has relied on software that prevents consumers from copying movies and TV shows. FreeWheel says the better play is to syndicate all over the Web and allow users to watch on whatever site they want while selling ads on those sites--people are unlikely to steal if they can easily find content.\n\"There are three things that content owners want,\" Knopper said. \"They want control over who is allowed to sells ads in their content. The second part is management, keeping track of the restrictions and exclusivity arrangements. The third is an accounting function. To date there's been no technological solution to all three things.\"\nThe executive from the entertainment company that competes with CBS agrees. He says that plenty of FreeWheel's competitors offer some of what the company provides but not all. Another media-company executive who has seen FreeWheel says the company has the right pedigree and understands what media companies need.\nAll three of FreeWheel's founders, Knopper, John Heller and Diane Yu, come from DoubleClick, the stalwart Internet-advertising company."}

They are qualified to diagnose and treat all eye conditions and diseases and perform complex eye surgeries. Ophthalmologists should not be confused with optometrists, who are licensed to examine and diagnose vision problems, eye diseases and other conditions, as well as prescribe glasses, but can perform only minor surgical procedures, such as removing a foreign body from the eye.\nOphthalmology has many subspecialties including cornea and external disease, cataract and refractive surgery, glaucoma, uveitis and ocular immunology, vitreoretinal diseases, ophthalmic plastic surgery, pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology and ophthalmic pathology. Most general ophthalmologists spend four out of five workdays per week seeing patients in their office and the remaining day in surgery performing three or more procedures per day. According to a 2007 study by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, 83 percent of an ophthalmologist\u2019s income comes from his practice, while 3 percent comes from teaching and 2 percent comes from consulting. The AAO study also found that 36 percent of ophthalmologists have an equity interest in an ambulatory surgical center associated with their practice.\nAccording to the Health Care Group\u2019s 2009 Physician Starting Salary Survey, ophthalmologists in their first and second years of single specialty private practice earn between $80,000 and $200,000 a year. In 2008, the AAO surveyed ophthalmologists in their first five years of practice and found that 78 percent were still working at their first place of full-time employment, while 22 percent had changed jobs one or two times and only 4 percent changed jobs three or more times. Of those who stayed in their first position, 75 percent were extremely satisfied with their job, while only 12 percent of those who switched jobs were merely satisfied.\nThe Economic Research Institute\u2019s 2012 salary data show that some of the highest average annual salaries for ophthalmologists are in San Francisco, where the average is $341,314, and New York, where the average is $328,660.

Dr. Taub, now at the University of Alabama, is listed as an author of the latest study, which is being published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.\nMany of the animals involved in the case had nerves to various limbs severed one or two years before they were seized. The severing of nerves was for studies aimed at eventually aiding human victims of brain and spinal cord injuries.\nThe animals, 16 crab-eating macaques and one rhesus monkey, did not belong to the health institutes, but the agency assumed custody of them not long after they were seized. In 1986, the 15 animals surviving then were shipped to the Delta Regional Primate Research Center in Covington, La., a unit of Tulane University. Four of these animals, who had not been disabled, were later transferred to the San Diego Zoo. Two monkeys, including the uninjured rhesus monkey that was used as a control, survive.\nAnimal rights advocates spent a decade in state and Federal courts seeking custody of the remaining animals, an action that the health institutes resisted. The Government won court permission to put five animals to death last year and to conduct experiments on their brains at the same time.\nIn the years since the animals first became research subjects, other research has indicated that areas of the brain cut off from their normal activity might assume new functions, a phenomenon called neuroplasticity. Researchers have found that when the brain loses sensory input from a part of the body, there is tendency for nerve impulses from neighboring parts to encroach on the dormant area.\nBut this earlier work indicated only a small amount of movement of nerve impulses into the unused area, or about 1 to 2 millimeters."}

{"idx": "6927", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The first attempt to edit the genes of cells inside the human body is about to take place. The technique being trialled aims to cure haemophilia B, a clotting disorder that can result in spontaneous internal bleeding.\nThe trial was announced in Washington DC this week at the International Summit on Human Gene Editing. Much of the meeting will focus on a revolutionary genetic engineering technique called CRISPR \u2013 specifically its application to human beings.\nGene editing refers to the process of deleting, adding or altering DNA in precise spots in a genome. CRISPR is a cheap, easy and fairly precise way to do this, and has the potential to treat numerous diseases. It has not yet been tried in people but older, more expensive forms of gene editing have already been used in cases of leukaemia and HIV infection \u2013 although cells have been removed from the body first for their genes to be edited.\nThe forthcoming trial will use one of these older techniques, based on a DNA-cutting tool \u2013 called a zinc finger nuclease \u2013 that can be injected straight into the bloodstream to do its work.\nHaemophilia B is caused by a mutation on a gene that instructs the liver to produce a clotting protein called Factor IX. People with the mutation do not make enough Factor IX and have to avoid activities that may lead to cuts and physical trauma, including contact sports. Factor IX transfusions, done either regularly or intermittently, help manage the condition, but many people can have complications such as joint pain and are at an increased risk of other diseases.\nBut now it may be possible to insert a corrected version of the mutated gene into the genome, using zinc finger nucleases created by Michael Holmes and Thomas Wechsler at Sangamo, a biopharmaceutical company in Richmond, California. They have already used a harmless virus to deliver the nucleases to the livers of mice and primates with a missing Factor IX gene.\nThe researchers designed the tool to insert the Factor IX gene next to a promoter for a gene coding for albumin, a major constituent of blood. A promoter is a bit like a volume knob \u2013 it regulates the activity of nearby genes. Placing the Factor IX gene nearby means the liver starts producing lots of clotting protein.\nThe treated mice and primates started producing regular levels of Factor IX, which caused their blood to clot as normal. The team will now trial the technique in adults with haemophilia B. \u201cOur dream, once we do the adult trial, is to transition to paediatrics,\u201d says Fyodor Urnov, also at Sangamo.\nOne of the major concerns with all types of gene editing is off-target effects: the possibility that the DNA-cutting enzyme will make cuts in unwanted places. This week saw the publication of a technique for reducing off-target effects in CRISPR, developed by Feng Zhang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.aad5227).\nUrnov says Sangamo\u2019s DNA-cutting enzyme only has one off-target effect, and this is in a gene called Smchd1, which produces a protein that helps turn other genes on and off. Wechsler says they have done \u201ca whole bunch of assays\u201d in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s wishes, to prove that their procedure meets safety requirements.\nShould their approach prove effective, Urnov thinks they will be able to use it as a treatment for other conditions that involve a missing protein.

Owned by the University of California as part of their larger Natural Reserve System, the Scripps Coastal Reserve aims to provide a dedicated space for scientific research, education, and public service, contributing to stewardship and understanding of California\u2019s diverse ecosystems. The Biodiversity Trail offers an easy walk, with many signs posted along the trail informing visitors of the area\u2019s natural history, including plant and animal life and geology.\nThis route begins by walking through areas dominated by California sagebrush (Artemisia californica) and large stands of California bush sunflower (Encelia californica), which bloom in great abundance from January to March.

Kelp beds in the La Jolla Cove to the south provide habitat to many species of marine life and appear slick on the water\u2019s surface. Over 265 fish species have been documented in the cove, representing half of all marine fish species found in California. Looking down between the overlook and the Scripps Research Pier, an exposed rocky intertidal zone at Dike Rock can be seen when water is left behind in pools at low tide.\nContinuing along the trail, look inland to see an area under various stages of restoration. Over 80 percent of original coastal sage scrub was lost by 1980 to agriculture and urbanization, with remaining fragments facing pressure from invasion by nonnative plant species. Invasive plant species of particular concern include crystalline ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, originating from South Africa), recognized by water \u201cbubbles\u201d covering this prostrate red succulent.

There are all sorts of different challenges that a technology startup could tackle in this regard, not the least of which is the energy that is leaked throughout the electric grid during the power conversion process. That's exactly what California company Transphorm is trying to address with its approach to power conversion technologies.\nThe Santa Barbara-based company has come up with a new approach to the transistor; its technologies use gallium nitride semiconductor materials rather than the traditional sorts of silicon-based components that are included in various power conversion circuits. I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty, because I am not an electrical engineer but the overall aim is to make power conversion systems run cooler. Because they run cooler, Transphorm CEO Umesh Mishra said his company's technologies cause less energy to be wasted. That's important because Transphorm cites figures estimating that at least 12 percent of the energy generated in the United States alone is lost during the conversions that happen between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) systems.\nFor perspective, that is approximately the amount of energy that it would take 300 coal-fired power plants to produce.\n\"What Transphorm does is increase the efficiency of this conversion while simultaneously decreasing the size of the unit,\" Mishr said during my conversation with him in the fall of 2011.\nWith the focus on energy efficiency increasing, Transphorm is definitely a player to watch, if the amount of venture capital the company has raised is any indication.

He wanted to demonstrate his contention that rich individuals and powerful interest groups have the power to block policies favored by the majority of Americans.\nThe recent issue of gun control following the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting may offer an example.\nPresident Trump, who received some $30 million in campaign finance support from the National Rifle Association in the 2016 election, said in a meeting with lawmakers at the White House after the shooting that he supported a comprehensive gun control law and chided one of the senators who opposed one such idea that he was afraid of the NRA.\nThe NRA \u201chas power over you people,\u201d Trump said, adding that NRA had less power over him, perhaps because he spent way more on his own election campaign, some $66.1 million of his own money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nStill, a day later, after Trump met with the NRA, the White House backed away from the idea of a comprehensive bill and pledged to continue to support the Second Amendment. Yet polls show that gun control has widespread support in America.\nIn spite of the energy and power of the students marching for action on gun control, it remains to be seen whether the movement will gain enough strength to overcome the campaign spending leverage of the NRA.

I thought that myself about one passage in Ken Kalfus' brilliant new comedy of manners, \"A Disorder Peculiar to the Country,\" in which an estranged husband walks up to his wife in their contested Brooklyn Heights two-bedroom and tries (but fails) to set off a suicide bomb. Or at least that's what I thought until recently, when news came of an explosion that destroyed a Manhattan townhouse. When the building detonated, the first thing bystanders must have thought was: terrorists! Instead, the culprit was a man so infuriated about losing his beloved home in his divorce that he decided to blow it up, and himself along with it.\nMost likely, critics will say that \"A Disorder Peculiar to the Country\" is a novel that compares divorce, American-style, to geopolitics, 21st century-style, and that it shows how Sept. 11 has infected the very fabric of our personal lives. Almost, but not quite and not so conventional or narcissistic. Kalfus, an endlessly ingenious writer, is not trying to say something about divorce by likening it to the so-called clash of civilizations. Instead, he's showing us that the far-off national conflicts we find so baffling and complicated actually work a lot like a really bad divorce. Switching the polarity of the metaphor makes sense because, let's face it, most of us know a lot more about divorce than we do about the Middle East.\nJoyce and Marshall, the couple in question, have found themselves stumbling from the fairly amiable realization that their marriage has lost its savor to a hatred that has \"acquired the intensity of something historic, tribal and ethnic, and when they watched news on TV, reports from the Balkans or the West Bank, they would think, yes, yes, yes, that's how I feel about you.\" It's gotten so bad that when each one mistakenly thinks the other has been killed in the Sept. 11 attacks -- he worked at the World Trade Center; she almost boarded Flight 93 -- they secretly rejoice.\nHow these two came to detest each other so much is a bit of a mystery to both. Joyce muses that if someone asked her why she and Marshall divorced, she'd find it hard to respond: \"An answer would have required that she revive long-dead arguments and 'issues,' none of which seemed like just cause, or at least enough cause to justify their impoverishment and the intensely complicated arrangements they would now have to devise involving the kids.\" The resemblance between this situation and standoffs in certain hot sandy countries is acute. \"If you isolate each of our betrayals and self-indulgences,\" Marshall tells his lawyer, \"the mean things we've said to each other, the errors in judgment -- on their own, they're quite heinous. Yet neither of us did anything to the other that wasn't in the context of something else.\"\nAmong those betrayals are Joyce's telling an FBI agent on whom she has a crush that her husband might have sent an envelope of white powder to her office during the height of the anthrax scare.

Some minor adjustments are being evaluated by the services and will require slight modifications to the fleet at a later date, Bryant said.\nThe most striking problem was the close-combat version \u201cprovides less capability to engage threats with the (Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided) missiles\u201d over the Humvee.\nFor those reasons, testers at the time deemed the close-combat JLTV \u201cnot operationally effective,\u201d a term used to determine if the system can accomplish its intended mission, in as realistic an environment as possible.\n\u201cOperationally suitable\u201d means whether the system can be placed in the field, remain reliable and be sustained within the unit and support available.\nRodgers told reporters that working with the TOW system on the JLTV will require improved tactics, techniques and procedures by troops getting familiar with the vehicle.\nThe company also made changes to the storage and accessibility of missiles and added shielding to cables that allowed for better accessibility and a greater field of fire, Bryant said.

Finally, we will take a look at the story of a particular invention shaping the marine world today with far-reaching consequence for tomorrow.\nThere is a saying \u201cnecessity is the mother of inventions\u201d, yet defining the spark of an invention as a simple human or societal need doesn\u2019t fully describe what an invention is, or its place in humanity. When we consider today\u2019s boats, planes, trains, cars, phones etc. it seems obvious to consider our species modern existence is possible only because of inventions. Perhaps less obvious are how inventions in systems such as agriculture and aquaculture have shaped what we eat. Inventions in microscopes shaped our understanding of disease transmittal and therefore increased our longevity. Inventions in water transport from Greeco-Roman aquifers to modern sewer systems have influenced the development of communities into a world that now boasts 31 mega-cities, on a trajectory of 41 megacities by 2030, where a mega city has more than 10 million residents.\nMany times inventions can be conceived through the blending of necessity, expertise, and circumstances. Arctic ship developments and improved ballast water treatments could be considered examples of inventions created from cross-disciplinary thinking driven by new opportunities. Scrubbers and scrubber adaptations for shipping exhaust appear to be inventions driven by changing policy creating necessity. For this first article, let\u2019s dive into an exciting advancement seen in our marine seascape utilizing cross-disciplinary collaboration and new thinking to overcome an old problem.\n\u201cAt Rafnar, our favorite season in Iceland is winter, as it provides the best opportunities to test our craft in the conditions they are ideally suited for. Yesterday was a good day at the office when the Rafnar team took a Leiftur 1100 out for sea trials in significant wave heights of 2.5 meters and 10-13m/s wind speeds. As winter has only just arrived, more fun days out at sea are certainly still to come in steadily \u201cimproving\u201d conditions. \u2013\u201c Photo Credit Instagram rafnar_shipyard November 15,2017.\nCruising around and slamming against seas because of rough weather is not safe or enjoyable. Thankfully a solution is brought to life in the form of innovative boat hulls from an Icelandic company, Rafnar. Their disruptive technological breakthrough in boat hull design could change our entire seascape industry, with implications reaching from luxury boat markets to search and rescue vessels.\nOne might not normally want to go sailing in rough seas, but a Rafnar Hull cleaves through the water even in the roughest conditions. The boat is always planed, as you increase speed you have an impression that the keel is being sucked into the water resulting in a feeling that is both controlled and nimbly gliding. Bear in mind, this is through huge swells that normally would slam you into the ceiling of your cabin.\nRafnar\u2019s groundbreaking technology Rafnar Hull was invented by a broad thinking individual who founded Rafnar, \u00d6ssur Kristinsson.\n\u00d6ssur Kristinsson was already renowned for his revolutionary developments in prosthetic technology.

As Lori sees it, that taxpayer lifeline was a license to allow Chase to shaft its cardholders. The firm unilaterally has dumped a new fee on its cardholders and boosted minimum payments.\nLori asks that this tale omit her and her husband's surname. In 2003, the Peoria-area couple got a credit card through what was then Bank One. They were smitten by the company's offer: If you were to transfer an outstanding balance from another card, Bank One would guarantee a rate of 4.99 percent for the life of that balance. The only other customer obligation was a one-time $75 transfer fee.\nLori took the deal. The next year, BankOne became part of Chase. And the deal remained intact.\nChase recently sent out notices about changes for some customers: a new $10 monthly fee, plus a boost in the minimum monthly payment from 2 percent to 5 percent. Or, cardholders could opt for a boost in the overall fee from 4.99 to 7.99.\nThat's not much of a choice: Pay more or pay more.\nLori is taking the first route. It means $120 more a year in fees. Also, with a balance of $6,000, her $150 monthly payment has skyrocketed to $360.\nThat's no small potatoes. She and her husband can afford the hike now. But both work for a company that has seen layoffs. If either were to lose employment, that $200-plus a month would be crushing.\nChase did not return my call for comment. But a spokesperson recently told USA Today that the changes affect cardholders who had grabbed low promotional rates and had carried a \"large balance\" for more than two years. Further, the spokesperson pointed out that the changes affect only one-half of 1 percent of its accounts. Then again, that's 400,000 accounts - including Lori's.\nTo USA Today, the Chase mouthpiece called the firm a \"responsible, careful\" lender. It has to make changes due to market conditions, funding costs or borrower risk.\nThat last part really galls Lori. She and her husband have never missed a payment or even been late. They were playing by the rules, but Chase switched those rules.\nShe can't believe Chase is engaging in what she calls \"breach of contract.\" Others are thinking likewise: Class-action suits have been filed in California, New York and Ohio. The Ohio suit claims Chase has reneged on its agreement, committed fraud and violated the Truth in Lending Act.\nLori is glad to see the lawsuits pop up. Then again, years could pass before a settlement arises. Relief, if any, is likely far out of sight.\nMeantime, I can't see the long-view gain for Chase in goosing cardholders. Certainly, credit card companies face hard times as many customers default. But it's foolhardy to penalize good customers and make them carry deadbeats. Eventually, that tact"}

My first thought was it isn't a human being.\"\nThe van's driver, Larry Little, had to swerve to miss the object before realizing it was a person.\nLittle, Holloway and two others in the van testified Monday afternoon in Lamar County Circuit Court to what they saw that day in 2014 as the first witnesses in the second-degree murder trial of Carrie Lea Reynolds.\nReynolds is accused of running over 71-year-old William Foster. He died three days later from his injuries.\nThe men, which included David Campbell and Christopher Dickerson, said they did not see Foster get run over, but knew something wasn't quite right.\n\"I thought something blew out the back of the truck,\" Holloway said. \"When stopped, I saw a man in a fetal position laying on the road.\"\nHolloway and Campbell helped Foster get off the road. Foster told the men he was OK, but because he appeared injured, the guardsmen called 911 and waited with Foster.\nThe men had to call 911 more than once before an ambulance arrived. Police never arrived at the scene, the men told the jury of eight men and five women.\nFoster agreed to go to the hospital.\nLittle and Dickerson in the meantime tried to catch up with the truck, but it disappeared in the afternoon traffic, Dickerson said, so they went back to the scene to wait for police.\nAfter waiting what seemed to be a long time, the men called 911 again and said they would wait for them at Gander Mountain.\nThe men told police what they saw and gave their contact information before getting back on the road.\nThe jury heard two of the many 911 calls made that day, one in which Foster himself is heard saying, \"I don't need an ambulance, I just need a lift.\"\nFoster identified himself to the dispatcher and said Carrie Reynolds was driving his truck, which he also described.\nThe truck later was discovered at Microtel Inn and Suites just off Hardy Street. The jury saw surveillance footage of a woman pulling up in Foster's truck and getting into a car that had pulled up beside it. The woman left in the car.\nIt was unclear in the video whether the woman was Reynolds.\nHowever, Hattiesburg police Detective Gareth Wood testified that Foster's nephew John Floyd told the detective Reynolds called Foster's phone while Floyd was with him at the hospital.\nFloyd answered the phone, pretending to be Foster.

{"idx": "6971", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: If you are a soda drinker unable to decide between healthier homemade sodas and your favorite off-the-shelf Coke, the upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage maker might be your savior. While this is positive for consumers, the impact for sellers of soda-makers and sodas isn't straightforward.\nIn early February, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) announced that it entered into a 10-year agreement to collaborate with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (UNKNOWN:GMCR.DL) on the development of its global brand portfolio for use in Green Mountain's upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. Coca-Cola will also be taking a 10% stake in Green Mountain. This strategic partnership between Coca-Cola and Green Mountain will undoubtedly pose a threat to SodaStream (NASDAQ:SODA). But the winners and losers of this battle will be largely determined by the strategic actions of the various parties involved.\nOne of the key benefits of the strategic partnership is that Green Mountain will be able to work with Coca-Cola to enter Europe. While SodaStream derives close to half of its revenue and two-thirds of its operating profits from Western Europe, Green Mountain has a minimal presence in Europe, with a substantial portion of its sales generated from the U.S. and Canada.\nBased on SodaStream's internal estimates, its household penetration rates range from as high as 25% in Finland to 3.4% in Germany. SodaStream also sees growth potential in the U.K., where consumers favor flavored drinks; while Italy is also on the target list because of high consumption levels of sparkling water. Green Mountain won't want to miss out on all the action and growth opportunities in Europe.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the sales of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) are on an overall downward trend, those consumers who have remained soda drinkers, they have been incredibly loyal to their favorite brands. Coca-Cola's market share has been remarkably stable over the past decades; it was 36%, 40%, and 42% in 1977, 1986, and 2012, respectively.\nPrivate-label beverage company Cott had a market share below 5% in 2012, indicating that soda drinkers are extremely faithful to their loved brands and familiar taste. Similarly, it isn't possible to discount the contribution of Nestle's branding to the success of its Nespresso coffee makers. As a result, Green Mountain's Keurig Cold at-home beverage system offering Coca-Cola branded flavors will be a huge attraction for soda drinkers.\nIn the years to come, it is essentially a battle between Coca-Cola's brand loyalty and SodaStream's razor and razor profit model. However, SodaStream has an edge here.\nThere is a shift of bargaining power between buyer and seller before and after a purchase of a SodaStream soda maker. Prior to the purchase, a consumer can buy any beverage off the shelf or choose among the different soda machines on the market. However, when one decides to buy SodaStream's soda maker, he is locked into the seller's follow-on products and consumables, and bargaining power shifts to SodaStream. In contrast, while off-the-shelf sodas are habitual purchases, there are little switching costs.\nTherefore, SodaStream has to take advantage of the time between now and the introduction of the"}

This $3 million effort brought life teeming back to a wilted downtown, and, according to official estimates, inspired an an additional $30 million in both public and private improvements. Other communities have held Falmouth up as an example for nearly a decade as an enviable example of successful downtown renewal.\nPart of this major effort was the much-needed construction of a public restroom, a $200,000 facility that was well designed to fit in with the character of the downtown and was nestled quaintly in the corner of the parking lot behind a much-used greenspace called Margaret \"Peg\" Noonan Park. This facility not only eased the burden of providing comfort to visitors and residents from the area business owners, it sent a clear message to tourists and merchants alike that the town values its core commercial area and is serious about being a partner in service delivery.\nWhich is why the plight of an unidentified nonagenarian woman hustling door to door the morning of the annual Memorial Day Celebration to find such comfort is so troubling. As told to me, this well-dressed celebrant for the day's festivities arrived early, only to find the public loo not-so-public. She scampered around and finally - hopefully - found relief from a kind and understanding (and probably justifably frustrated) merchant. The facility was opened some time later - but too late for this un-served member of the public.\nWhile the rest rooms are generally well kept, the lack of any published schedule and erratic openings and closings can inspire emotions ranging from mild irritation to downright indignation.\nI understand the inherent difficulties and complexities of managing and cleaning multiple buildings with limited staff. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, though, there is no more important public facility in Falmouth than the downtown restrooms, save for maybe Old Silver Beach. Keeping this facility open and clean must be a top priority for the Facilities Maintenance Division who cleans it and the Selectmen who set the policy for it. The hours can be posted with a simple notice. The DPW has an in-house signmaker. Use it.\nI visited the facility today and found it open and ready for use. Good. Nowhere in sight was any note or placard telling me or anyone else when I could expect it to be open again. Not good. I casually polled a couple of merhcants to see if they were aware of the schedule for our #1 (and #2) public building on Main Street. The reactions were varied but the theme was the same: from the dismissive \"Hmphh!\" to the kind but aggravated \"they don't tell us,\" the mystery of when the public restrooms are public has not yet been solved.\nWhat may seem a trivial issue to the reader who reads this from the comfort of a 2 1/2 bath home, the reader enjoying these musings sitting on one of the many benches on Main Street reaping the benefits of the Falmouth Chamber's \"Unwired Village,\" may just get a taste of what it feels like to want when nature comes knockin' on the door and the Town of Falmouth has no answer.

{"idx": "6978", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Editor\u2019s Note: The following is a guest post from Jake VanderPlas, a data scientist who worked on the Graphic Science illustration in the October issue of Scientific American magazine.\nOne of the largest treasure troves of astronomical data comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), an ongoing scan of the firmament that began 15 years ago. Its catalogue covers 35 percent of the sky and contains multicolor observations of hundreds of millions of distinct galaxies, stars and quasars. If a person were to attempt to individually inspect each of these objects at a rate of one per second through the workday, it would be a full-time job lasting over 60 years!\nFortunately, such individual inspection is not how astronomers work. Instead, we use various specialized algorithms to automatically sift through and categorize this vast data set and dream up novel visualization schemes to make clear in a glance the relationships between thousands or millions of individual objects.\nThe SDSS data gives us much more than just the orbital dynamics. Multiband imaging gives us detailed measurements of the color of reflected sunlight off each of these asteroids. Just as on Earth our eyes can distinguish white quartz from dark basalt based on how they each reflect sunlight, the SDSS telescope can distinguish among different chemical compositions of asteroids based on how their surfaces reflect sunlight.\nWe can summarize this chemical information with two \u201ccolor\u201d measurements: color in the optical range and color in the near-infrared range. Combining this with the semimajor axis (a measure of the size of the orbit around the sun) and the inclination (a measure of how \u201ctilted\u201d the orbit is compared with Earth\u2019s orbital plane) gives us a four-dimensional data set: four properties of each asteroid that contain information about its orbit and chemical composition.\nWith this four-dimensional data set decided, we can now think about how to best visualize it. One-dimensional data fits on a number-line; two-dimensional data can be plotted on a flat page or screen; three-dimensional data can be conceived as a 3-D plot, perhaps rotating on a computer screen; but how do you effectively plot four-dimensional data?\nThis visualization is full of information. The left panel is known as a color-color diagram and distinguishes between broad classes of asteroid chemistries. The left-most clump in this panel is primarily carbonaceous (C-type) asteroids whereas the right-most clump is primarily silicaceous (S-type) asteroids. The faint downward extension of the right-most clump is V-type asteroids, known to be associated with the asteroid Vesta.\nThese are all interesting insights, but what we\u2019d really like is to see intuitively how the chemistry reflected in the left panel is related to the orbital dynamics reflected in the right panel. Such a four-dimensional relationship is very difficult to capture.\nPlotting all pairs of dimensions?\nThis plot conveys a lot of information, and there are some intriguing pieces. For example, in the panel comparing near-infrared color to orbital inclination (top row, second from the left) we see a distinct clump of data: These are points that are clustered both in color and inclination. Further investigation shows this clump reflects the Vesta family, a chemically similar group of asteroids that also shares the same orbital inclination. We\u2019ll return to these below.\nIn the left plot the colors of the points correspond to the optical color whereas in the right plot the colors correspond to the near-infrared color. With this enhancement, we\u2019re really getting somewhere:"}

The study argues that infertility treatment should become part of basic health services offered under national health insurance schemes.\nLaunched in Johannesburg on Wednesday, and published in The Lancet medical journal, the report outlines two years of global research into areas of reproductive health such as access to safe abortions, antenatal care and gender-based violence.\nThe 59-page study found that although many countries have focused on expanding access to, for instance, contraception and HIV treatment, infertility treatment is absent from most national agendas.\n\"Issues of infertility treatment have been ignored around sexual and reproductive health rights\", says Alex Ezah, executive director of Kenya's African Population and Health Research Center. Ezah was also a co-chair of the commission that compiled the new report.\n\"The treatment and therapy are very expensive. Only a few people, especially the rich, can afford it. If we can adopt a programme that can expand access, it can help bring the cost down and make it affordable for many more couples to access treatment,\" he says.\nDespite the fact that infertility issues can affect both men and women, women often shoulder the bulk of stigma or blame when a couple is unable to conceive. This is especially true in societies in which women's identities and positions are highly dependent on having children, the research argues.\nThe commission suggests that countries can combat this stigma through education.\n\"In many cultures, women are blamed for infertility when, in fact, as we know from research, it is quite often on the man's side.\n\"Greater understanding of the causes of infertility and better counselling is needed around these issues\", explains commission co-chair and Guttmacher Institute president Ann Starrs.\nWe speak to a young, black woman who is infertile about the stigma she faces in her community.\nNations can also begin to look at new, cheaper forms of infertility treatment being piloted around the world. In Belgium, researchers at The Walking Egg project are working to develop a cheaper test to diagnose infertility. The project is also looking into lower priced treatments.\nIn South Africa, Head of the Reproductive Medicine Unit at Stellenbosch University Thabo Matsaseng has pioneered new ways to offer in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to treat infertility at less than a quarter of what it would cost at most private clinics.\nWorking out of Tygerberg Hospital, his team has managed to bring the cost of IVF down to about R7 000, according to 2014 research published in the South African Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.\nAs part of IVF, women are given hormones to stimulate the release of multiple eggs from their ovaries. Doctors collect these eggs from the ovaries before placing them in a lab to be fertilised by sperm, explains the US research organisation the Mayo Clinic.\nMatsaseng and his team were able to cut costs by slashing clinic and administration fees, lowering the hormone doses needed to stimulate ovulation and removing eggs under local, instead of more expensive and complicated general anaesthetic, the study explains.\nThe Lancet study recommends that countries looking to move towards universal healthcare in"}
{"idx": "6983", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Hassan is best for N.H.\nOn Nov. 6, we encourage our readers to vote for Maggie Hassan for governor.\nOn virtually every important issue our state will face in the next two years, Maggie Hassan's views mirror those of the editorial board of the Portsmouth Herald, Exeter News-Letter and Hampton Union.\nWhile Ovide Lamontagne impressed our board as a good and decent man, we respectfully disagree with him on almost every major issue that will likely reach the governor's desk. The governor in New Hampshire exerts influence through the veto and the bully pulpit. During the last legislative session, Gov. John Lynch was able to stop some of the most radical and destructive pieces of legislation through veto threats and actual vetoes. As governor, Maggie Hassan would play a similar role, serving as a check against Republican legislative excesses.\nFor example, the New Hampshire House has made so-called Right To Work legislation its top legislative priority for the next session. Our editorial board has strongly opposed this attack on collective bargaining and governmental interference between businesses and their workers. We have stated repeatedly that there is simply no evidence that Right To Work is wanted by New Hampshire workers or businesses and that, on the whole, Right To Work states fare far worse than New Hampshire by virtually every measurable standard. We know that Hassan will veto this bill, should it reach her desk, and that the Legislature will not have the votes to override that veto.\nAnd, like her opponent, Hassan has vowed to veto a sales or income tax should either reach her desk (which they certainly won't in this next legislative session).\nWe agree with Hassan that New Hampshire should accept the substantial funding offered under Obamacare and extend health care to tens of thousands of our friends, family and neighbors who now are uninsured or underinsured. Refusing to take advantage of this opportunity is not simply immoral, it's fiscally irresponsible. When a hospital provides medical care in its emergency room to someone who has no insurance and cannot pay, the rest of us pay for it through higher-cost procedures and higher insurance premiums. It will be far less expensive to enroll the needy in Medicaid, pay up front and get someone in to see a primary-care physician before they are gravely ill, rather than providing services in the most costly facility of all \u2014 a hospital emergency room.\nWe expect that Hassan will use her bully pulpit to speak out against the state's proposed Voter ID law which, now that we have some clarity on the subject, is obviously aimed at disenfranchising students. She'll champion sane gun laws and oppose further attempts to undermine public education through voucher programs like the one that became law last year, which siphons dollars from public schools into private and parochial schools.\nWe disagree with both candidates' support for expanding gambling in New Hampshire, but we certainly agree with Hassan that if the state must have a casino it should be through a fair and open bidding process and not simply a giveaway to Rockingham Park, as Lamontagne proposes. If nothing else, this would allow the state to negotiate the best deal for taxpayers. Lamontagne's blind spot on the conflict of interest created by his advocating for Rockingham Park, a client of his law firm, is troubling.\nWhen she served as a local state senator, we got to know Hassan quite well and we therefore also know that she's going to face a steep learning curve as governor. On issues such as the LLC tax and campground tax she rushed forward without properly communicating the details of her plans"}

The B.C. government paid Retirement Concepts $86.5-million in the 2015-16 fiscal year, more than any other of the 130 similar providers.\nOn Tuesday, Anbang confirmed what Chinese media had been reporting for some time: that Anbang's chairman Wu Xiaohui has been detained by authorities and is \"unable to perform his duties\" with the company.\nMr. Wu was taken away for investigation, with regulators informing the company on Saturday, according to a Tuesday evening report in China's Caijing Media, which was deleted within hours.\nAfter \"assisting relevant investigations\" for some time, Mr. Wu disappeared near the end of last week, an unnamed source told the South China Morning Post, which is owned by tech tycoon Jack Ma's Alibaba Group.\nThe Anbang billionaire's arrest comes amid an anti-corruption campaign by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and in particular its high-flying insurers. Those companies' hunger for acquisitions had transformed them from \"strangers at the gate to barbarians, and finally, to industry thieves,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Liu Shiyu said in a pointed warning earlier this year.\nMr. Bains in Ottawa said he's worried by this development but doesn't see any need to revisit a controversial decision to allow Anbang to invest in a Canadian health-care provider.\n\"Obviously that is very concerning. There is no doubt about that,\" the Trudeau cabinet minister said.\n\"But, the decision we have made on Anbang \u2013 or any decision under the Investment Canada Act \u2013 follows a robust and thorough review process,\" he said.\nMr. Bains said Ottawa will nevertheless keep an eye on developments regarding Mr. Wu in China.\n\"Any relevant information going forward \u2013 we will keep that in mind,\" the Minister said.\nIn China, authorities have curtailed the insurance industry after local companies radically shifted their model in 2015, when a regulatory shift removed a cap on guaranteed returns, allowing insurers to fund acquisition sprees with short-term financial products.\n\"Anbang is just the most high-flying of these companies that are getting their wings clipped,\" said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nInsurance companies have also been caught in China's attempts to keep foreign currency from fleeing.

As recently as last year, the Austin area was still seeing new car dealerships opening up locally, such as the new Nissan dealership in Cedar Park.\nNADA chairman Mark Scarpelli said in a written statement that 16 million in U.S. sales would indicate an overall healthy market, given the post-peak period the industry is in.\n\"Automakers are continuing to meet that demand with a fantastic mix of vehicles that really do suit the needs, desires and budgets of our customers, so the inventories that we\u2019re carrying in our showrooms are aligning very well with what our customers are looking for,\" Scarpelli said. \"That\u2019s half the battle right there. So this is a very positive forecast.\""}

{"idx": "6995", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: How physics can explain why some countries are rich and others are poor.\nIf economics can tell us something useful about crime, marriage, or carpooling\u2014as I believe it can\u2014then other academic disciplines should have something to tell us about economies. Last month, Science published an example that may turn out to be important. Two physicists, Cesar Hidalgo and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, and two economists, Bailey Klinger and Ricardo Hausmann, have been drawing unusual pictures of economic \u201cspace\u201d that promise a deeper understanding of the biggest question in economics: why poor countries are poor.\nThat is an old and intuitive idea in economics, but as an informal argument it leaves a lot to be desired. For a start, while plausible, it might not be true. If it is true, it might be far more so for some kinds of economy than for others. And if there is to be a big push, in which direction should it go?\nTesting the idea took three steps. First, economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research broke down each country\u2019s exports into 775 distinct products. Next, Hausmann and Klinger used that data to measure how similar each product is to each other product. If every major apple exporter also exports pears, and every major pear exporter also exports apples, then the data are demonstrating apples and pears to be similar.\nPresumably, both economies would have fertile soil, agronomists, refrigerated packing plants, and ports. For the third step, Hausmann and Klinger called upon Hidalgo and Barab\u00e1si, who specialize in mapping and analyzing networks. The result was a map of the relationships between different products in an abstract economic space. (And look at more maps here.) Apples and pears are close together; oil production is a long way away from anything else.\nThe physicists\u2019 map shows each economy in this network of products, by highlighting the products each country exported. Over time, economies move across the product map as their export mix changes. Rich countries have larger, more diversified economies, and so produce lots of products\u2014especially products close to the densely connected heart of the network. East Asian economies look very different, with a big cluster around textiles and another around electronics manufacturing, and\u2014contrary to the hype\u2014not much activity in the products produced by rich countries. African countries tend to produce a few products with no great similarity to any others.\nThat could be a big problem. The network maps show that economies tend to develop through closely related products. A country such as Colombia makes products that are well connected on the network, and so there are plenty of opportunities for private firms to move in to, provided other parts of the business climate allow it. But many of South Africa\u2019s current exports\u2014diamonds, for example\u2014are not very similar to anything.\nIf the country is to develop new products, it will mean making a big leap. The data show that such leaps are unusual.\nNone of this is proof that other development prescriptions\u2014provide financing, fight corruption, cut red tape, and lower trade barriers\u2014are useless. Nor is it a green light for ham-fisted industrial policy. Klinger warns: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take the policy implication too far and start trying to pick and choose where to settle in the product space.\u201d But it is a big step forward. Policy-makers should take note, and economists, too."}

Acer failed to achieve its target of having tablets take 20 percent of its overall notebook sales. HP and ViewSonic also indicated slow sales. Some companies have delayed product launches for several months, and it has taken almost a year for HP and Toshiba to introduce their second-generation models.\n\"The price difference is huge compared with regular notebooks. That's why tablet PCs have been challenged in the market,\" said Zhou Shih-hsiung, an analyst with market researcher MIC.\nAcer sold 100,000 tablet PCs over the past year, amounting to only 5 percent of its overall notebook sales.\n\"The cost of a tablet PC is $200 (7,000 Taiwan dollars) more than its notebook counterpart. Of this difference, the hardware cost is only between $30 and $60. The majority of the difference comes from the OS license,\" said Wang. \"We have tried to negotiate the fee with Microsoft several times in vain. It's very regrettable.\"\nAnother Acer representative asked that Microsoft drop its universal one-price policy and offer pioneer tablet PC makers such as Acer a break until the product becomes more mainstream.\n\"I hope the people in Redmond can hear us,\" Wang said.\nEunice Chiu, Microsoft Taiwan general manager, asserted that the cost of the OS was justified by the value of the pen-based computing it offered consumers.\n\"The license fees cover only a fraction of the overall amount spent developing the product,\" Chiu said, adding that Microsoft was satisfied with the launch of tablet PCs so far.\n\"We had 21 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and original design manufacturer (ODM) partners in 2003, and this will increase to 34 in financial year 2004,\" said Chiu.\nNot all of the 21 partners put out their tablet PCs on time in 2003, however, with some delaying the product launch, according to Li Chi-chao, Microsoft's vice general manager for OEM business.\nJen Wei Hung and Joseph Chen of CNET Taiwan reported from Taipei."}
