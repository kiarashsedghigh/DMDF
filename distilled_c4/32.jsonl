The methodology is recognised as thorough and objective, setting the standard for defining great workplaces for business, academia and government use. All organizations that apply for a spot on this list undergo an assessment. As part of this assessment, the Institute studies an organization through two different lenses (see step 1 on the chart).\nFirstly, perceptions of the organizations\u2019 employees are assessed using the Great Place to Work Trust Index Model. We asked a representative sample of the organization\u2019s employees to share their feedback on various variables, which, in our research, define a great workplace from the employees\u2019 perspective.\nWhat makes an organization a great place to work? For more than 20 years, and now across more than 54 countries, Great Place to Work Institute has been asking millions of employees from different kinds of organizations this very question.

We also found that organizations that are successful at creating and sustaining a great workplace culture follow specific practices in nine key areas. These key areas are outlined in the Great Place to Work People Practice Framework. Great practices in these areas can help a firm achieve its objectives with employees who give their personal best and work as a team.

That being said, the project will be fascinating.\"\nThe reference to controversy likely refers to the increasing worries about the role Russia will play in the French election. While far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's opponents have criticised her for allegedly being the preferred candidate in Moscow's eyes, concerns that Russia will mimic the tactics the Obama administration said influenced the US elections last year are reportedly on the rise within France's intelligence community.\nRT's French operation currently employs just 15 people but it is understood to be close to filling the open vacancies and claims it has seen substantial growth in traffic.\n\"Over the last year, of RT\u2019s 6 different language sites, RT en Fran\u00e7ais has shown the most growth, with readership more than doubling,\" said a spokesperson for the organisation. \"A particularly pleasant surprise given that the website was far from the full version that we have in mind for the future.\"\nThe Kremlin-backed station also confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it is pressing ahead with plans to launch a fully-fledged \"RT en Fran\u00e7ais\" TV channel, to join its existing broadcasts in English, Spanish, and Arabic.\nHowever, contrary to previous reports, the channel says the French-language television version of RT will now only launch at the end of 2017 \u2013 well after the French presidential election.\nRT had initially planned to launch a French-language TV station in 2014, only for the plan to be delayed by the Russian economic crisis and the collapse in value of the ruble.\nInstead it launched a small French-language website in 2015, where recent headlines cover Donald Trump, the refugee crisis, and criticism of attempts to shut down fake news. Some Facebook posts on its French-language page include memes criticising Starbucks for hiring refugees rather than changing its European tax status, which adopt an unusual tone for a news organisation.\nRT's international broadcasts have been repeatedly criticised for its editorial line, particularly during the annexation of Crimea, when one reporter resigned on air in a high-profile departure. It has also repeatedly been criticised by Ofcom, the UK broadcast regulator for breaking broadcasting standards, while in November 2016 a European parliament resolution condemned RT as part of Russian \"information warfare\" \u2013 prompting Russian president Vladimir Putin to congratulate the channel's journalists for their work.\nMeanwhile, some of the channel's own UK staff have raised concerns with BuzzFeed News about an apparent shift towards right-wing anti-migrant coverage and leaked screengrabs of Islamophobic images posted by one of its senior staff members.\nHowever, the channel has proved adept at turning criticism into proof of its supposedly anti-mainstream stance, such as when NatWest threatened to shut down its UK bank accounts, which RT blamed on UK government interference"}

{"idx": "32010", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: When we ran a story a while back about the cars of North Korea, one photo in particular caught my eye. In that photo was a green 1974 Volvo 144, which made me wonder if it was part of those 1000 legendary stolen Volvos I'd heard rumors about. It was, because those rumors are true.\nIt's around the 40th anniversary of one of the greatest state-sponsored mass carjackings in history, a fact that Newsweek commemorated with an article last week. That article stated that the total amount owed for those thousand Volvos is now up to \u20ac300 million ($393 million US), or if you prefer Swedish Krona, a nice cool three billion or so. It's a lot of cash for a bunch of used Volvos, and I don't think anyone in Sweden really thinks they're ever going to see any of it.\nThe story goes like this: back in the late 60s/early 70s, North Korea seemed to be making remarkable economic growth and had a lot of potential mineral wealth opportunities. In Sweden, an unusual alliance of socialist groups who wanted the Marxist state recognized and capitalists who wanted to recognize a lot of cash from mining agreed that it would be a great idea to start doing some business with North Korea.\nVolvo was one of the first to take advantage of this incredible opportunity, shipping 1000 Volvo 144s to the Hermit Kingdom, along with, presumably, a bill which then-leader Kim Il-Sung promptly got a crack team of highly trained ignorers to forget about.\nIncredibly, a large number (maybe nearly all?) of those Volvos are still around. Most seem to be in service as taxis around Pyongyang, and it's amazing just how often they pop up in photos and videos of the strangely-staged-feeling capitol.\nMost also appear to be in really great condition, which isn't that surprising since cars of any sort are quite valuable in the country. The Newsweek article suggests that if you sold all the cars at their current market value of about $2600, North Korea would only be able to pay back 0.6% of their current debt. I actually don't think this is a reasonable calculation, since the cars are in generally really good shape and their status as one of the \"North Korean\" batch of Volvos should drive the price up. I bet they could get about $5000 per car, meaning they could cover well over 1% of that debt. I'm a glass half-full kind of guy.\nI don't think Volvo's ever going to get their money back, but I think if they're smart, they'll use these circumstances for PR and advertising purposes. They need to convince Pyongyang that they'll quit sending those annoying twice-yearly bill notices (and probably stop calling North Korea's landline every week or so) in exchange for access into the country to film some commercials and other advertisements.\nCars that run for 40 years in an environment like North Korea, with bad roads, no real service network, and in hard-wearing jobs like taxis are certainly great cars to feature in ads showing how tough and well you company builds cars. Modern Volvo could use a little bit of the Old Volvo's rugged workhorse charm and personality, and these 1000 political prisoners are just the ticket.\nMaybe even a special run of 1000 green \"Pyongyang Edition\" S60s?"}

Suniva, based in the United States, and SolarWorld, whose parent is in Germany, said their tariff petition would lead to more jobs in solar industry in the United States. According to an economic analysis done by Mayer Brown, a law firm representing the two companies, a tariff on solar cell imports could generate as many as 144,300 new jobs.\nIn April, Suniva, a Chinese-owned, Atlanta-based company, filed for bankruptcy.\nAbigail Ross Hopper, the president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the trade commission's decision was balanced as \"in no case\" did it recommend anything \"close to what the petitioners asked for.\" That said, Hopper, who led the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in the Obama administration, said she was encouraged that commissioners were considering steps apart from tariffs.\nTom Werner, the CEO of SunPower, said when stiff tariffs were placed on steel, the result was heavy job and wage losses for U.S. workers.\n\"Ultimately, the tariffs were removed early, after less than two years,\" he said in a statement. \"History must be a guide for us now.\"\nThe European Union in 2013 imposed a duty of 67.9 percent to Chinese solar panel exporters who didn't cooperate with an investigation into allegations the panels were sold to European countries at below market cost."}

Just as expected, the same thing has happened for Android O. It comes with some neat new changes to icons, notifications, battery life and much more. Read on for the current changelog, what\u2019s new and how to get it right now.\nAfter rumors earlier this week Google has made it official. Android O is here, albeit a very early preview that isn\u2019t for daily use. We know the next version of Android will be called Android O at first, then later get a name. Google names each version in alphabetical order and after tasty treats. Like Android 4.4 KitKat, Android 5.0 Lollipop, Marshmallow, and now Android 7.0 Nougat.\nNext is Android O, and some Google employees have even started teasing it will be called Oreo. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. That isn\u2019t important though. It\u2019s the changes, improvements and new features most will likely appreciate. I\u2019m looking forward to Android 9.0 Pistachio, or Peanut Brittle.\nFirst things first, when can you get Android O? Well, right now apparently. As long as you have the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Google Pixel, Pixel XL or Pixel C tablet. Older devices are no longer allowed in the beta. As usual Google is allowing developers or those daring enough to try, the option to get it today. Simply click below to get started.\nGoogle notes (more so than usual) that this is an extremely early first version preview, and not stable enough for daily use. There are bugs, issues, and battery life could be worse. Even though the final version of Android O will severely improve battery life with a new restrictive app mode.\nThose with eligible devices can download the factory images and flash the Android O Developer Preview starting today. However, it is not a part of the current Android Beta program, so over the air updates won\u2019t be possible. At least not yet. Meaning anyone interested will need to completely wipe out their device, and start fresh with O.\nConsidering this is a very early developer preview, and not anywhere near the final release, nothing is final. Similar to 2016 with Android N things are subject to change, evolve, or be removed completely by the time it\u2019s actually released to the public.\nThat being said, here are some of the changes we\u2019re seeing already.\nBackground Limits: A power saving feature in addition to \u201cDoze\u201d that will restrict app battery usage while in the background based on priority.

So Barron's takes a look at how four firms that are executing unique and successful strategies.\nSkilled, active managers generally are backed by strong firms that provide them with research teams, technology, financial backing and a supportive culture. But their strategies for success vary. Some only invest in a few of their very best bets. Others prefer to involve themselves with the management of the companies in which they invest.\nThere are managers that take creative approaches to data-crunching, providing them with new perspectives on the market. And others thrive by constantly questioning and defending their choices.\nIn the end, the fund managers who succeed are those that can produce consistent results. In the article, Barron's examines four successful strategies and managers that exemplify each approach.\nRob Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates, is the \"Number Cruncher.\" Laura Geritz, who manages international funds at Wasatch Advisors, is the \"Globe-Trotter.\" Matt Logan of Harris Associates enthusiastically plays the \"Devil's Advocate.\" Eddie Yoon, the \"Specialist,\" heads the health care sector research team at Fidelity Investments.\nThe article also includes a list of things fund managers never want to see in the leaders who run the companies they invest in, like fancy cars with vanity plates or collections of pictures with famous people.\nAndrew Bary's \"How to Get a Piece of Icahn's Action\" examines the 20 percent annual gains that activist investor Carl Icahn's namesake conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ: IEP), has delivered for the past decade. Icahn is \"still cagey after all these years,\" says the article.\nIn \"Deal of the Century?\" Andrew Bary suggests that Verizon Wireless could be worth $300 billion. Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) may sell its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) this year, and Vodafone shares could rise more than 20 percent.\n\"Poised to Achieve Air Supremacy\" by Lawrence C. Strauss says that, though United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) costly purchase of Goodrich may have worried investors, the aerospace company's shares now appear to be poised to fly as much as 18 percent higher.\nWhat comes next at Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) after the recent management turmoil? \"What Occidental Petroleum Is Really Worth\" by Leslie P. Norton suggests that one possibility may be a shareholder-friendly breakup of the company.\nIn David Englander's \"Climbing Up the Mountain,\" the focus is on shares of mining company Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF).

Compatible with Android and iOS devices. iPhone version includes mounting clip.\nFrequent software crashes. Precludes use of most protective cases.\nThe Lensbaby Creative Mobile Kit ($89.95) is the company's second crack at making an add-on lens kit for smartphones. It's a little more expensive than the LM-10 Sweet Spot Lens that we reviewed earlier this year, but the add-on lenses are smaller, and don't cause magnetic interference when paired with the iPhone 6 Plus. Each lens is a lot of fun in its own way, but the app needs some work. Frequent crashes when saving pictures\u2014which causes images to be lost forever\u2014put a damper on this kit, but thankfully you don't have to use Lensbaby's software at all.\nIf you have an iPhone 5 or newer, you can buy the Creative Mobile Kit along with a small plastic clip that fits snugly around your phone's camera. If you use an older iPhone or an Android phone, you'll need to stick the included metal ring (backed with adhesive) to your phone. When using the clip, take care not to slide the lens in all the way\u2014that actually makes it a bit off center, and you'll get darkened corners at one side of your image. The actual center point is just a little shy of being fully clipped on.\nEach of the included lenses\u2014the LM-20 Sweet Spot and the LM-30 Reflective Circle\u2014has a magnetic mounting ring incorporated into its design. When I used the LM-10 Sweet Spot lens with my iPhone 6 Plus (which mounts in a similar fashion) I had issues with the optical stabilization system suddenly shaking about. That issue didn't pop up with the LM-20 or the LM-30, even when I tried to reproduce the phenomenon. I'd say that Lensbaby has fixed this issue, so iPhone 6 Plus owners can give this kit a look. It's possible that the magnet is not quite as strong, as both lenses are noticeably squatter than the LM-10.\nIn addition to the lenses, a kickstand is included. It's a fine add-on that allows you to set your phone down on a table to FaceTime or Skype using the front camera, and it's able to be used in conjunction with either of the add-on lenses. I rarely used it, though, because as soon as I was done capturing a Lensbaby shot I put my phone back in its protective case\u2014the nature of the add-on clip precludes you from using it with most protective cases. I would have preferred if Lensbaby had released its own protective case, with an integrated mount, like the one used by the iPro lens system.\nThe LM-20 replicates the look of classic Lensbaby optics. It captures images with a sharp center point of focus\u2014the Sweet Spot\u2014surrounded by blur. That's the same thing that the LM-10 does, but the LM-20 has a larger area of focus. It's an effect that goes a long way to set your images apart from the typical smartphone shot.\nThe second lens, the LM-30 Reflective Circle, captures images that are sharp in the center and surrounded by reflections.

The mid-January reading is substantially higher than the 9.1% of January 2011.\nUnderemployment, a measure that combines the percentage of workers who are unemployed with the percentage working part time but wanting full-time work, is 18.1% in mid-January. This is a slight improvement from the 18.3% of December and down from the 19.0% of a year ago.\nThe U.S. government's January unemployment rate that it will report in early February will be based on mid-month conditions. Therefore, Gallup's mid-month unemployment reading, based on data collected through the 15th of the month, normally provides a good estimate of the government's unadjusted unemployment rate for the month. Because of employer layoffs after the holidays, unadjusted unemployment rates normally increase at this time of year, and the government seasonally adjusts for these layoffs. So it seems likely that the government will report another decline in its seasonally adjusted U.S. unemployment rate for January.\nHowever, the government is revising its methodology beginning with the January 2012 report. As a result, the government notes, \"household survey data for January 2012 will not be directly comparable with that for December 2011 or earlier periods.\" In turn, this makes estimating the government's unemployment rate for January even more difficult than usual.\nRegardless of what the government reports, Gallup's unemployment and underemployment measures show modest improvement so far in January, and that is particularly positive news for job conditions at this time of year because the early part of the year is usually slow for hiring. This is good news for the overall U.S. economy. It is also a plus for the president's re-election efforts.\nOn the other hand, Gallup's underemployment measure also shows the percentage of Americans working part time but wanting full-time work is much higher than it was a year ago. If events in Europe or elsewhere force companies to pull back on hiring in the months ahead, many of these workers could quickly end up adding to the rolls of the unemployed.\nGallup's monitoring of the unemployment situation suggests cautious optimism, with a more positive outlook than was the case just a few months ago.\nEditor's note: Beginning in January 2012, Gallup is reporting full-month unemployment and underemployment results instead of 30-day rolling averages as in the past. Mid-month estimates will continue to be reported on the basis of a 30-day rolling average. No changes or adjustments have been made to the Gallup unemployment and underemployment data themselves.\nGallup classifies American workers as underemployed if they are either unemployed or working part time but wanting full-time work.

He knew as long as he stayed plugged into that source, and never took it for granted or tried to fake it, that he could not only maintain but prosper. Asked for the secret of his onstage joy, that infectious spark which has been igniting reverent rock and roll fires for decades, he said it was all about truth. Faking it, in rock & roll, is simply not an option. Not for Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, anyway.\nThat love for all aspects of his work, from the songwriting through the record-making to live performances and touring, sustained him over the decades, and never was removed from his work. Not once did he allow himself to become disengaged for long. Plugged directly into the original juice of rock and which flowed through Elvis into The Beatles, The Byrds, The Stones and the other bands that electrified his youth, Tom never abandoned that authentic passion. His music was based on that simple, visceral equation of electric guitars, bass, drums and keys united in song, always playing together in a deep pocket as only a solid unit can. Even in the studio, he knew the key to capturing the essence of rock and roll was when the band played together. Sure, he could overdub parts and add a lot afterwards. But it all started with the band playing it live, just as the Beatles always did, creating an energy that cannot be created in any other way.\nEven among legendary songwriters, his extraordinary instinct for writing songs which appealed to a vast swath of humanity was exceptional. His popularity expanded incrementally over the years, and by the time of \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d and other hits from Full Moon Fever, he crossed over all demographics to appeal to everyone from young kids to old timers in a way few rock artists have done since The Beatles. Back when music acts were divided up into those with youth appeal who went on MTV, and those on VH1 who skewed older, Tom & The Heartbreakers were on both.\nMore than anything, he was never phony. He knew rock and roll was about real musicians playing together, and whether live or in the studio, and recognized that the energy of live performance was the fuel for his rocket ship. To the very end, his final show of his final tour, September 25, 2017 (preserved here in these photos), he remained dynamically and directly connected to the source. After having completed a \u201creally long tour,\u201d as he put it, that started in April of this year, he seemed happier than I\u2019ve ever seen him. He was home again, in his element, at the historic Hollywood Bowl on the same stage where his beloved Beatles performed, and at the immense helm of a cherished band of world-class musicians. All was right with the world. Though word circulated that this could be his final tour, Tom looked so happy and sounded so strong that no one believed for a second he was ready to stop. Never did the idea occur that this was to be his last show ever.\nStill it doesn\u2019t seem possible. Tom was such a force of nature, and such a positive one, that the thought of a world without him simply seems wrong. How is it possible that Bob Dylan is still alive and kicking, while Tom \u2013 his little brother in the Wilburys \u2013 is already gone?

But this is the picture painted by Among Wolves, a gracefully photographed first film by Shawn Convey, whose subjects have found unlikely ways to heal in the shadow of wartime. The unshowy but welcome documentary, after a well-received festival run, will take a short victory lap theatrically before its impending video release.\nBranco \u201cLija\u201d Lijovic, who sometimes looks like a Balkan Shea Whigham, was a leader in the paramilitary groups that defended Livno during the war of the early 1990s. Now he is president of the Wolves Moto Club, which looks from afar like any gang of exhaust-belching toughs you might meet at Altamont.

More than once, Lija reflects on the differences between his generation and younger ones, which \"are not even similar to us.\" In general, young people are fleeing the area, which has no factories and is seeing regular school closures. As we see during a something-for-everybody bike rally/festival, townfolk appreciate the excitement the Moto Club brings to the area.\nBut excitement isn't what Lija and many of his cohort are after. The president claims that without the group's charitable focus, he'd see no reason to participate. We watch them stage a blood drive and help distribute donated medical gear; at a small school, they do heavy electrical work for nuns who praise their feel for communal values.\nMore than anything, we watch them with horses. The Wolves have taken responsibility for a wild herd that roams what used to be the war's front lines \u2014 mine fields and areas that these men remember well. For some time after the war, Lija says, he preferred being in these hills to being in town: Here, nobody expected him to talk about anything.\nThe doc mostly addresses trauma and healing from afar, referring to combat experience without dwelling on it, never saying much about what difficulties men then faced in peacetime. Lija does note that the charitable work his comrades do is not any kind of atonement; he doesn't feel guilty for protecting his village. But being responsible for fixing things and helping the poor is clearly doing something for his soul. As we spend long scenes watching the horses play and graze with him, some of that psychic soothing may rub off on the viewer, as well."}

The Report however also seemingly contradicts itself in parts. This brief will focus on the points raised by the Report which were not in the series of wealth tax briefs the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) published in April.\nThe interest earned on South Africa's cash and savings is often below inflation and a wealth tax will worsen the real1 shrinkage on these.\nMost retired citizens live on savings and a further depression on returns from a wealth tax will no doubt do substantial damage to savings incentives - dragging down further the country's already poor savings rate. Another three difficulties here arise. First, a wealth tax would be contradictory to savings incentives, such as retirement savings benefits and tax free savings accounts. Second, a wealth tax would be even further hindered if retirement savings are excluded. At around 2.2 trillion Rand3 these funds make up almost a quarter of the country's total wealth holdings at 9.5 trillion Rand4. Third, acceleration in the depletion of retirement savings, compounded by the fact that people are living longer, will cause retirees to become reliant on the state and others.\nIf wealthy nations are not able to raise sufficient revenue from wealth tax to make it viable, can South Africa? Crucially, when compared to wealthy nations, the wealth to income ratio is lower in South Africa (240 percent versus 400 to 700 percent)5, which leads to lower potential wealth tax revenue in South Africa compared with income tax. And because one of the major reasons wealthy nations abandoned the wealth tax was because of the low revenue it generated, it is difficult to imagine how South Africa could make it worthwhile.\nA wealth tax will hinder wealth accumulation by making the cost of holding large categories of wealth higher than the expected benefit. This will incentivise local investments and savings to be moved abroad and increase South Africa's dependency on foreign capital. Not mentioned in the Report are the potentially devastating consequences that could come from this. In order to attract foreign investors, the government will have to offer more foreign currency denominated bonds. The interest payments on these bonds will be vulnerable to exchange rate movements, and a higher foreign to local currency government bonds ratio will also add downside pressure to South Africa's sovereign credit rating.\nA ratings downgrade, should it occur, will result in capital outflows which will further weaken the Rand, increasing the foreign bonds interest cost and also imported inflation. These factors all show how a wealth tax which results in a drop in investment and savings can lead to negative results for the government's interest expenditure, the exchange rate and the economy - all of which would likely exacerbate one another in a negative feedback loop.\nIn the Report's opening paragraphs it is stressed that a wealth tax is not the most viable instrument to address inequality.6 It however goes on to say that a wealth tax offers support in the redistribution agenda,7 and that wealth must be a legitimate tax base given the high levels of inequality.8 It is then left up to the reader to try and reconcile these contradictory positions. The Report says that improved accounting for assets and interstate cooperation need to be addressed before a wealth tax can become viable.\nThe Report notes that taxes on savings and investments have generally increased since the introduction of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in 2001, but also how they have also decreased for retirement funds; CGT exempt since 2001, Retirement Fund Tax withdrawn in 2007, retirement fund death benefits"}

Other evidence that could implicate Yang includes a blacklist of judges drawn up by court officials, as well as a document produced by law firm Kim & Chang detailing Yang\u2019s discussions with the firm\u2019s lawyer, who represented South Korean plaintiffs seeking compensation from Japanese companies that forced them into labor before and during World War II.\nYang, who headed the country\u2019s top court from 2011 to September 2017, faces 40 charges including abuse of power, leaking of state secrets and dereliction of duty.\nProsecutors suspect Yang of using trials as bargaining chips to win support from the Park administration to establish a separate court of appeals. He is accused of pressuring judges in charge of politically significant trials to deliver verdicts in the Park administration\u2019s favor and of penalizing judges who opposed Yang\u2019s management of the court.\nOne of the high-profile cases in which Yang is suspected of interfering involved Koreans forced to work for Japanese companies during Japan\u2019s 1910-45 occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Yang is suspected of having intentionally delayed the deliberation of a lawsuit filed by the victims, mindful of the Park administration\u2019s wishes to mend ties with Japan.\nA decision about the arrest warrant is likely to be made as early as Tuesday."}

The forum has now grown into a network of 1,300 parents from across the country.\nThey share their stories with each other, lend their shoulders to each other in need, and get suggestions and advice from one another in the interest of their children.\nBefore joining the forum, \u201cevery one of us used to think, \u2018I am the only mother or parent who has a child like this\u2019,\u201d said Dipa, vice-principal of the training centre.\nThe forum arranges counselling of parents and helps build awareness through rallies and participation in national and international conferences.\nIt works at the policy level as well. Registered with the social welfare ministry, the parents\u2019 forum had submitted recommendations to the government, trying to address the rights of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).\nMany of the recommendations were implemented under the disabled persons rights and protection act 2013: people with disabilities can now have bank accounts and spots allocated in mainstream schools, campaigns are run in various radio and TV channels to make people aware of their rights.\nThe forum\u2019s achievements have so far lit up the treacherous path of the journey that the parents make with children with autism, cerebral palsy, down syndrome, and intellectual and neurological disabilities. This is what Danny wanted to do.\nA two-and-a-half-year-old son diagnosed with severe form of autism was what motivated her to find a way to improve the lives of such children.

Those deemed unsafe will be closed, officials say.\nIt will likely be at least a week before transportation officials in the Carolinas know exactly how badly Florence has damaged roads and bridges. But based on past storms, the repairs will likely take months and cost tens of millions of dollars.\nAs of Friday, more than 840 roads in the Carolinas were still closed, including 169 in South Carolina and 656 in North Carolina. Among them are stretches of Interstate 40. Sections of Interstate 95 in Dillon and Florence counties opened in both directions Friday afternoon.\nMore road closures could occur as rivers crest in coming days.

Or that scientists from Loughborough helped design the Jabulani football? Or that our Deputy Prime Minister is the son of a Dutchwoman, and married to a Spaniard?\"\nThe Final Game as Beauty and the Beast \"Holland are the blunt instrument of soccer villainy,\" declares Alan Black perplexingly at The Huffington Post, basing the proclamation mostly on the historical Dutch connection to Calvinism and midfielder Wesley Bneijder's \"scary sneer.\" By contrast, \"Spain is the oil painting of the Finals.\"\nHistorically, Holland's the Beauty Slate's Brian Phillips admits to an attachment to Holland, \"soccer's most gorgeous losers .. they became the icons of soccer romantics who would rather see teams play beautifully and lose than win and be boring.\" It's a case of the famous Dutch \"total football\" approach\u2014\"fluid position-switching, with players moving into open spaces and the whole formation adjusting on the fly\"\u2014against Spain's \"tiki-taka soccer--inexorable passing, patient build-up play, constant pressing on defense.\" The problem, though, is that the Dutch don't actually play \"total football\" anymore, having \"gradually phased [it] out ... in favor of a more prgamatic, and rougher, style of play.\" Now they just want to win.

Integrative medicine includes a comprehensive approach to veterinary medicine that complements conventional diagnostic and treatment modalities to optimize clinical outcome. Treatments the service offers include acupuncture and other methods of pain management, palliative care, and physical rehabilitation (which can include rehabilitation following surgery, paralysis rehabilitation, weight loss, and canine athlete injury rehabilitation).\nThe integrative medicine team works closely with other services in the UC Davis veterinary hospital to identify multidisciplinary treatment opportunities to provide optimal patient outcomes.\nPatients of the Integrative Medicine Service are treated in a 1,000-square-foot open treatment area that resembles a gym and two private treatment rooms. The Service\u2019s state-of-the-art equipment includes electric high/low treatment tables, two underwater treadmills, two land-based treadmill, therapeutic exercise equipment, ramp and stairs, and equipment to fabricate thermoplastic orthotics.\nYour initial visit to the Integrative Medicine Service will include a functional evaluation of your animal and its needs, as well as the design of a plan of care to restore, maintain, or enhance its physical fitness and optimize function after injury, surgery, or disability. During the initial visit, an evaluation will be completed and goals for the patient will be addressed and identified. Based on these goals, a treatment plan will be established for the patient. Time permitting, some treatment may be started with the initial evaluation.\nThis dynamic process is modified with progress, subsequent injury, or other factors that may arise. Clients are an important part of the rehabilitation process and recovery. Treatment frequency and duration varies depending on the individual patient, the cause of disability, and limitations of the caretaker. Physical fitness and activity are important for animals throughout their life spans.\nMany different types of patients benefit from treatment with the Service, including a dog recovering from a cranial cruciate ligament tear, an overweight pet, or an older animal that is becoming weak and having trouble rising. Other examples include rehabilitation after an animal has been in a trauma, such as hit by a car or animals that are born with deformities. Physical rehabilitation therapy can also benefit animals as a preconditioning for surgery, as a preventive to help protect and minimize laxity in joints, or for conditioning for athletic events or work.\nAcupuncture is offered to dogs, cats and exotic animal patients. It is provided as an adjunctive procedure to both hospitalized patients and outpatients. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine and can be readily integrated into conventional treatment modalities to optimize clinical outcomes. To learn more about acupuncture, please see the Frequently Asked Questions section.\nBeyond acupuncture offerings, the pain management program incorporates both traditional medications and complementary modalities, such as cold laser, to find the best pain therapy for an individual patient. Pain control is essential for a patient\u2019s ability to heal and overall quality of life. Therapy is aimed at not only acute pain during hospitalization, but also focusing on chronic pain management at home.\nThe palliative care program focuses on patients with serious illness ranging from internal medicine, neurologic, and surgical disease to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation. Modalities are used to help support the body and treat the symptoms of the diseases or treatments, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and insomnia.

Its appearance indicates that it was not violently torn off from the aircraft's main body...it does seem that it got detached pretty nicely at its edges,\" he said.\nNoting the recent crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, he added: \"If MH370 had crashed with a really hard impact, we would have seen small pieces of debris floating on the sea immediately after that.\n\"Furthermore, the flaperon that was recovered wouldn't have been in one piece...we would have only seen bits and pieces of it.\"\nIn the fatal Alps crash, masterminded by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, none of the debris was larger than 1ft in length, due to the hard impact.\nRescue teams scouring the Indian Ocean earlier claimed to have found two box-like shapes that \"strongly indicated aircraft debris\".\nSonar images taken of the area showed square objects, which were deemed to be 'Category 3' - considered most likely to be plane wreckage.\nHowever, officials with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have now ruled out a link, saying they have a \"low probability of being significant to the search\".\nDespite the latest setback in the international hunt for clues to the plane's whereabouts, Mr Rahman claimed it was possible that MH370 may have been submerged \"deep inside the ocean for quite some time\" before the flaperon became detached.\nHe said: \"Similarly, other parts would also become detached and float with the help of the strong water current, before being washed up on the shores of islands like Reunion.\"\nMr Rahman used the example of the US Airways plane which safely landed on the Hudson River in New York in 2009 as further proof that the missing jet could have made a soft-ditch landing on water.\nHe also added further weight to the theory that more debris could be washed up on Reunion.\n\"One cannot underestimate the power of the ocean current,\" he said.\n\"Going by how the earth rotates, it's highly possible that the piece of debris could have floated because the ocean current can be really powerful.\""}

While the weather has forced the Opportunity rover to bunker down and suspend all scientific activities, several other spacecraft are taking the opportunity to study the storm.\n\"This is the ideal storm for Mars science,\" Jim Watzin, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters, said in a news release. \"We have a historic number of spacecraft operating at the Red Planet. Each offers a unique look at how dust storms form and behave -- knowledge that will be essential for future robotic and human missions.\"\nDust storms are a well known phenomenon on Mars, but they are infrequent. The last Martian dust storm occurred in 2007. The storms can develop seemingly overnight and last weeks, or even months.\nDuring the southern hemisphere's summer, Martian dust rises higher into the atmosphere as it's heated. The updrafts of dust can trigger more winds, triggering a feedback loop that fuels the birth of a dust storm.\nThe current dust storm, which is still growing, currently covers 14 million square miles of the Martian surface, nearly 25 percent of the planet.\nScientists gauge the strength of a dust storm with the unit tau, a measurement of the atmosphere's opacity. In 2007, Opportunity weathered a large dust storm with a tau of 5.5. As of Sunday morning, the current dust storm boasted a tau of 10.8.\nNow, the tau near the Curiosity rover is rising, too.\nBecause dust storms can alter the Martian landscape, shaping the surface's rocks and sediment, understanding the storms' dynamics is essential to understanding the Red Planet's geological history.\nNASA's two orbiters, the 2001 Mars Odyssey and MAVEN, can help scientists observe the storms growth and movements from above, as well as measure the levels of dust in the atmosphere. The Curiosity Rover, which is currently collecting rock samples on Mount Sharp, can measure temperatures in the lower atmosphere, as well as the storm's tau.\nIn addition to measuring the storms size and opacity, like NASA's other spacecraft, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, or MRO, can measure wind speed.\nScientists at NASA hope to combine the observations from their entire Martian fleet to build more accurate dust storm models -- models that in the future could help them forecast dust storms."}

The case was one of a number of disputes working their way up to the Supreme Court over the legality of state-imposed restrictions involving abortion.\nThree conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - dissented from the decision by the nine-member conservative-majority court, saying it should have heard the appeals by the states.\nAt least four justices must vote to grant review for the court to hear an appeal. Along with the four liberal justices, Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts - the court\u2019s two other conservative justices - opposed taking up the matter.\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s affiliates in Louisiana do not perform abortions, but some in Kansas do. Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for low-income Americans, pays for abortions only in limited circumstances such as when a woman\u2019s life is in danger.\nIt marked the first-known vote by Kavanaugh in a case since he joined the court in October after a fierce confirmation fight in the Senate. Kavanaugh was named by Trump to replace the retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sided with the court\u2019s liberals on social issues like abortion.\nSome Kavanaugh opponents feared he would back legal efforts to overturn or further restrict the legal right to abortion.\nThomas suggested the justices who rejected the appeals put politics over the law.\n\u201cSo what explains the court\u2019s refusal to do its job here?

Planned Parenthood denied the allegations and called the videos heavily edited and misleading.\nThe organization\u2019s affiliates in each state, as well as several patients, sued in federal court to maintain the funding.\n\u201cWe regret today\u2019s decision from the U.S. Supreme Court announcing that it fell one vote short of taking our case against Planned Parenthood,\u201d Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer, a Republican, said in a statement.\nLegal battles over other laws from Republican-led states could reach the court in the next year or two. Some seek to ban abortions in early pregnancy, including Iowa\u2019s prohibition after a fetal heartbeat is detected. Others impose difficult-to-meet regulations on abortion providers such as having formal ties, called admitting privileges, at a local hospital.\nThe cases from Kansas and Louisiana did not challenge the constitutionality of abortion itself.\nMany social and religious conservatives in the United States have argued against government funding of Planned Parenthood, and Republican politicians have made efforts at the state and federal level to eliminate public funding for abortion services."}

Thus, instead of having standardized tests in reading, writing, math in grades 3-8 and 10, and science in grades 5, 8 and 10, our children will now endure standardized tests in every grade and every subject, from kindergarten art to high school gym.\nIs this the direction in which we, parents, want our schools to go? With the standardized tests we have now, our children's education is being narrowed. All over this state, art, music, social studies and foreign language courses are being squeezed out to prep for CMTs and CAPTs.\nNot only is our curriculum being narrowed, but so is the way our children learn. They are being trained how to give canned answers to prepackaged questions, rather than learning how to think for themselves. Both teachers and students are increasingly suffering through mind-numbing scripted lessons.\nStudents, especially those in the neediest districts, are being denied the opportunity for a rich and varied education because of the pressure put upon districts to increase test scores in just a few subjects. Imagine what will happen when high-stakes tests are implemented in every subject. Instead of a piece of clay or a paintbrush, a 6-year-old will now be handed a worksheet. Far-fetched? It is already happening in Colorado.\nIt makes me wonder what policy makers want from public schools. Part of the push for more tests stems from the new Common Core Standards -- touted as the answer to our achievement failures. Yet countries with national standards fare no better in educational achievement than those without. Every state has consistent standards, but achievement varies widely. And the Common Core Standards themselves have been found to be in the \"mediocre\" range when compared to existing state standards across the country.\nIf new standards will do nothing to improve learning, why were they pushed so aggressively? The comments of Joanne Weiss, chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, are telling. She wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the Common Core \"radically alters the market ... Previously, these markets operated on a state-by-state basis, and often on a district-by-district basis. But the adoption of common standards and shared assessments means that education entrepreneurs will enjoy national markets where the best products can be taken to scale.\"\nOur children as a market for the testing and textbook industry.\nHow far we have strayed from the true purpose of public education.

Which might explain why Trevor Brandon feels so at home there.\nA microbiologist, Brandon began making cheese on the Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne, as a hobby. Friends were so impressed that they persuaded him to give up his day job, and he set about constructing the little factory that occupies several rooms of the stylish b & b, Red Hill Retreat, (see right) run by his wife, Jan.\nHe nurtures his cheeses like a mother duck with her brood, lovingly peeling them from their wrappers as he sits down with visitors, apologising that he sometimes finds it hard to talk about them because he salivates so much. He spends hours pondering their names (\"Misty Valley\", \"Somers Soft\", \"Gunnamatta Gold\"), and he likes to warm the smellier ones in his pockets as he works. \"Good cheese never goes off,\" he says. \"It just gets better.\"\nDuring a tour of the premises, he opened a door to a room full of gleaming new machinery. I told him it looked like an expensive piece of kit. \"Yeah,\" he said, giving the tangle of shining chrome a proud look. \"Cheesemakers don't buy fast cars; they buy slow pasteurisers.\"\nThe Mornington Peninsula is one of several regions of Victoria that is beginning to challenge the more established wine-growing areas of Australia - and even Europe - as a destination for gourmets. About an hour's drive from Melbourne, the peninsula juts into the sea in the shape of a raised foot. Its coastline - running from Frankston, through Rosebud, Rye and Sorrento to the tips of its toes at Portsea - is mainly long sandy beaches, populated in summer by holidaymakers keen to have a good time at the restaurants, clubs and bars that line the coast roads and the high streets of its one-storey towns. Round the corner to the south, the seas of the Bass Strait crash in surfable waves all the way to Hastings.\nIt seems that no-one - apart from sheep- and cattle-farmers - thought much of the gentle green hills until the wine-makers arrived in the early 1980s. In 1982 there were just six vineyards on the entire peninsula; now there are more than 90, with new growers starting all the time.\nAlong with the vineyards have come lavender farms, olive groves and fruit farms, and a new inland tourist industry geared towards those looking for fine food and wine and a little luxury to enjoy them in.\nWe arrived at Mornington from Gippsland, a region to the east that has recently launched its own signposted \"Gourmet-Deli Trail\", a bucolic drive through rolling countryside punctuated by stops at smokehouses, fruit farms, cheeseries and vineyards.

A complex patchwork of financial instruments and devices are used by the country\u2019s less fortunate not just to get by but also to save.\nIn-depth tracking of household cash flows, or financial diaries, of 67 Soweto households conducted by the Bankable Frontier Associates, a global strategy consultancy, over nine months showed that emerging consumers, most living below the international guideline poverty threshold of $2 a day, used a mix of formal and informal devices to suit their needs.\nAlthough almost all respondents hid money in several places around the house, 76% also had bank accounts, more than 50% belonged to a burial society, 30% had a funeral plan and less than 50% belonged to some kind of stokvel.\nOf the three common types of savings identified in emerging markets by the Gateway Financial Innovations for Savings project, savings clubs such as stokvels are extremely popular in the developing world, particularly in Kenya and South Africa.\nIt is estimated some R44.6-billion per year is stashed away in South Africa\u2019s stokvels \u2014 even though the return is low, or often nonexistent, it is favoured as a way to put a little bit of money away each month.\nDaryl Collins, director of Bankable Frontier, the organisation managing the project, said that it was how the poor preferred to save: the first financial service they required was not credit but simply a place to keep their money.\nCollins said it was common practice, especially for these kinds of households, to save despite most of their expenditure going to food and transport.\nBankable Frontier is currently \u00adcarrying out financial diary exercises in India, Mexico, Kenya and the United States.\n\u201cAcross cultures and countries \u2014 you\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Collins said.\nThe inverse was true for many other emerging market consumers, she said. Audrey Mothupi, head of inclusive banking at Standard Bank South Africa, said the findings surprised the bank itself, which commissioned the study.\nShe said many surveys showed that the majority of respondents said they didn\u2019t save but, when spending time in the households and documenting their financial behaviour in a detailed manner, it was clear there was conscious financial management.\nMothupi said banks had to look at offerings that mimicked existing consumer financial behaviour.\nThe bank\u2019s low-end offering, known as the Access Account, was aimed at achieving this. First and foremost, monthly fees had to be eliminated.\nThe product also had to be a one-stop solution \u2014 where consumers could save and transact, and also access credit if they wanted to.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking to make money first. It is about getting money in accounts and out from under mattresses,\u201d Collins said, although she acknowledged the money would help to swell a bank\u2019s deposit base.\n\u201cAt home, people are doing what we have designed the product to be,\u201d Mothupi said.\nFor example, a seven-day cooling-off period was designed to mimic the function of a money guard in a community \u2014 someone who would keep money on your behalf and not hand it over to you in times of difficulty.\nTrust was an issue, Collins said, but the smaller financial institutions were not in fact better at serving the poor, from whom they made their money.\nShe said large commercial banks had a role to play and could serve communities better, particularly with services to complement existing financial management behaviour."}

And so I promised my beloved Israel, and myself, that I would soon return; that the move to New Jersey was a temporary one.\nAs time went by, English was no longer a barrier and I was so accustomed to the American culture that going back and visiting Israel made me view Israeli culture in a whole new light \u2014 and not always a very flattering one.\nYet, in my heart, I still felt guilty to be happy here, comfortable in my new home.

I accepted that I had made the reverse commute, going against the \u201caccepted\u201d direction of diaspora Jew making aliyah.\nAnd yet, I wasn\u2019t less Jewish.\nIn the years I have lived here, I have shifted away from being a completely secular Israeli Jew to being much more observant. Moving away from Israel may have distanced me from the land, but has brought new meaning into my heart about being Jewish. I was finally able to admit that I was happy, and I had made a real Jewish home even outside Israel.\nUnlike my younger self, growing up in Israel surrounded by other Jews, my children are very aware they are a minority. Often they are the only Jewish kids in their class. But that has not prevented them from developing a Jewish identity that is just as strong as mine.\nThey feel proud of their heritage and are connected to the Jewish community here and in Israel. They may not breathe the air of Israel, or be surrounded by our ancestors\u2019 language, but they don\u2019t lag behind their Israeli counterparts in feeling Jewish or in having a sense of belonging to their community.\nIt is not just my own children who grow up here with the experience of being a minority \u2014 it is our collective children, the next generation of American Jews.\nIt has become an important part of my life to create a space for our kids to feel that same connection, that same feeling of belonging that I felt growing up \u2014 a feeling of deep care and a sense of a family and home within our community.\nToday I am the director of education at Congregation B\u2019nai Tikvah, a beautiful and inviting Reform congregation in the hills of Walnut Creek.

Like I'm buying strawberries, I'm buying blueberries, I buy maple syrup, I buy plums, I buy rhubarb \u2014 15,000 pounds of rhubarb alone,\" he said.\n\"And the people I buy from, they buy from me.\"\nThe province's distilling industry is still tiny, but the government sees its enormous potential.\nIn 2014, regulations governing distillers were changed to reduce the markup on Nova Scotia craft-made spirits. The markup is now around 40 to 60 per cent, instead of the 160 per cent it is for large liquor companies.\nThat keeps the prices of local craft spirits down, and helps boost sales.\nSteinhart sees it as a circle.\n\"Money goes around. It comes in here, I spend it locally and it comes back here,\" he said.\n\"It doesn't go out of country.

Getting up in front of people and performing came really naturally to me.\nRhett now gets to show off his performing skills headlining shows in arenas. But it took awhile for him to get there.\nDropping out of college to pursue a music career at 20, Rhett wrote songs for the likes of Jason Aldean (\u201cI AIn\u2019t Ready to Quit\u201d and \u201c!984\u201d), Florida Georgia Line (\u201cRound Here\u201d) and Lee Brice (\u201cParking Lot Party\u201d).\nBy Sept 2013, the Billboard magazine country airplay chart had five songs in the top 10 written by Rhett and/or Akins, including \u201cIt Goes Like This,\u201d the title cut of Rhett\u2019s debut album and his first No. 1 hit.\nThat success put Rhett on the road, playing clubs and jumping on bigger tours as a support. While his songs were on the radio, both by him and other artists, he was plugging away, building his career.\nFor Rhett, the jump came with \u201cTangled Up,\u201d his 2015 album, and its song \u201cDie a Happy Man,\u201d which spent two months on top of the country charts starting in December 2015.\n\u201cDie a Happy Man\u201d changed more than Rhett\u2019s career. It, he said, made him a better, more honest songwriter.\nThe success of \u201cDie a Happy Man\u201d and \u201cTangled Up\u201d put the pressure on Rhett for its follow up, as he was constantly touring. He met the challenge of creating \u201cLife Changes,\u201d the chart-topping album he released last year, by writing on the road, bringing out co-writers to collaborate for a few days at a time to write between shows.\nThe writing sessions worked. \u201cLife Changes\u201d has so far produced three No. 1 Country Airplay singles \u2014 \u201cCraving You,\u201d \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d \u201cMarry Me\u201d and the title track, which just ascended to the top slot on \u201cBillboard\u201d magazine\u2019s Country Airplay chart.\nRhett\u2019s home life is flourishing as well. He and his wife, and childhood sweetheart, Lauren, now have two little girls, 2-year-old Willa and Ada, who was born in August 2017.

The Los Angeles-based group is about two-thirds of the way through a 40-city tour promoting their latest album, 'Dancing on the Gallows,' and generally bringing a good night's entertainment to fans across the country.\nFor a newcomer buying a ticket for the first time, the stage set up might seem a bit strange. Instrument-wise, Rose's Pawn Shop resembles a bluegrass band, with banjo, fiddle, upright bass and guitar, except that right in the middle of those acoustic pieces sits a set of drums. While that is the first indication that this band might be a little different from the everyday traveling show, things really start to get interesting once the five-piece band arrive on-stage.\nRose's Pawn Shop treated the audience to songs from their debut album, 'The Arsonist,' as well as tunes from the new project. They kicked the evening off with 'Lone Rider,' a tune that starts out rather deceivingly with a lonesome fiddle introduction. It doesn't take the audience long to snap to attention once the rest of the band kicks into what becomes a rollicking number that sets the tone for the evening.\nLead vocalist Paul Givant is the band's emissary to the audience, as he talks about new tunes and chats at various intervals throughout the evening. The band is a tight unit, with each member contributing equal parts harmony, musicianship and stage presence as they played through their eleven-song set.\n\"Thank you for coming out tonight,\" Paul told an audience that was already up and dancing by their second song. \"It's good to be back in Nashville; this is one of our favorite cities to visit.\"\nPaul introduced their next song as a good \"Monday night party tune\" before the band launched into 'Funeral Pyre.' Don't let the title fool you; the fast tempo combined with lyrics like \"...Twenty dollars to my name right now and that's just enough ... calling up my good time friends, you and I will meet them in the street, take my cares and set them all afire, burn them up in a funeral pyre...\" is indeed a good way to lose the Monday night blues!\nPaul described the band's first song from the new disc, 'Pine Box,' as a song about the unusual things they see in their journey around the country and the interesting places they end up sleeping. The song turns out to be more about the lonely times of missing the partner left behind while the band follows their dream. The second offering from the new project, 'Danger Behind The Wheel,' also comes with a brief introduction. \"This one is about a bad dating choice I made, with a girl with crazy eyes,\" Paul explains.\nPaul is the main songwriter, and his lyrics hearken back to the standards of Hank Williams and Bill Monroe, as he writes about rural earthy topics to which the everyday man and woman can relate.

He led the Royal Philharmonic when Boston Ballet played the London Coliseum in 2013 and the Boston Ballet Orchestra for the company\u2019s dates last year at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center.\nBut he got his ballet start, he says, in 1979 with \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d Graham heard him conducting the Juilliard orchestra and signed him up, and when he was conducting for her company at the Metropolitan Opera House, Balanchine came backstage and asked him to conduct New York City Ballet\u2019s \u201cNutcracker.\u201d Even after he became resident conductor at the Joffrey Ballet, in 1982, he continued to conduct NYCB\u2019s \u201cNutcracker,\u201d since the Joffrey didn\u2019t have a holiday show.\nNow, of course, the Boston Ballet Orchestra performs \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d in a reconfigured Opera House pit, one that accommodates 46 musicians for the holiday classic."}

Ironically, among them was the German writer Uwe von Seltmann, the grandson of a Nazi SS man, who lives in Krakow and recently wrote a book with his Polish wife, whose grandfather was murdered in Auschwitz.\nThe incident was reported to the police, picked up by the local \u2014 and international \u2014 media, and spread like wildfire on Facebook.\nBut was it \u201creally\u201d anti-Semitism, or more a case of ugly words unleashed in an angry confrontation that got out of hand?\nDisturbing as it was, it was clearly not a pre-meditated attack on Jews. Nor did it approach the scale of recent anti-Semitic incidents in other countries, where Jews have been deliberately targeted, physically attacked \u2014 or killed, as in Toulouse, France, last March.\nWhen considering anti-Semitism, though, do such diversities matter?\n\u201cEven the simple expression of anti-Semitic views in public discourse can have a corrosive effect over time and may lead to very real security concerns,\u201d Rabbi Andrew Baker, the American Jewish Committee\u2019s director of international Jewish relations, told me.\nSeveral particular factors made the Moment incident the talk of Jewish Krakow for days. For one thing, it occurred at a time and place that many found inconceivable.\nKazimierz, the Jewish quarter, thrives on a lively and multifaceted interaction between Jews and non-Jews \u2013 everything from tourism, study programs, cultural events and religious observance.\nThe would-be cafe patrons at Moment had just attended the annual Jewish Culture Festival\u2018s exhilarating open-air \u201cShalom\u201d concert, a seven-hour love-fest that saw 15,000 people of all ages, religions and ethnic backgrounds dancing and cheering to Jewish music in the Jewish quarter\u2019s main square.\nWhat\u2019s more, Moment cafe had been known as a venue particularly open to Jews and other minorities, including gays.\n\u201cI go there a lot, and I have never detected even a whiff of anti-Semitic or prejudiced behavior, nor has anyone I\u2019ve been there with,\u201d Jonathan Ornstein, the executive director of the Krakow JCC, told me.\nAt the same time, from the other direction, a Facebook group calling for a boycott of the \u201canti-Semitic Moment Cafe\u201d amassed more than 320 members and also"}
{"idx": "32097", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Gas prices are up. Will they ever come down?\nThe price at the pump is up again, equaling the peak prices of 1980 reached in the wake of two Arab oil embargoes.\nBut back then prices subsided over the next 20 years and in 1999 they actually fell below pre-embargo levels. So will oil prices come back down? The answer is: maybe not. The forces that drove prices down between 1980 and 2000 have changed and may not again work in our favor.\nPerhaps the main reason prices returned to normal following the 1980 spike was that the law of supply and demand stepped in. New supply outside the reach of the OPEC oil cartel came to market, notably in the North Sea and Alaska. And users of oil found ways to do more with less. One measure of this is oil intensity \u2013 the amount of energy required to produce a dollar of economic output. In the United States, our intensity of oil use has dropped by nearly half since 1973, and other developed countries have performed as well or better. Inevitably, the combination of more supply and less demand resulted in lower prices.\nGreed was the second major force contributing to the drop in oil prices. Oil producing countries in the Middle East rely heavily on their oil income. Whether that income is used to enrich tyrants or benefit citizens, national leaders of petroleum-rich countries have every incentive to keep the oil flowing. And the oil has continued to flow, even though the Middle East is a cauldron of political turmoil. OPEC tried to keep prices up by limiting production, but between 1980 and 2000 many OPEC members produced more oil than the targets set by the cartel. Why? They needed the money. As a result, the cartel didn\u2019t work very well and prices dropped.\nFinally, and importantly, crude oil markets functioned during this period as good commodity markets should. They responded to changes in supply and demand with exquisite flexibility. Even if there was a supply hiccup somewhere in the system, the market adjusted almost instantly to cover the shortfall. That flexibility, incidentally, is why it has been impossible to embargo oil shipments to any one country.\nRapidly developing countries like China are creating an enormous demand for oil. In the short term, this demand will certainly drive prices higher. Longer term, it\u2019s not clear that demand in these countries will be as sensitive to price as it was among industrialized nations a couple of decades ago. Energy is essential to economic growth, and the desire to grow may simply swamp any inclination to reduce demand in a serious way among developing countries.\nNew supply is harder to come by. There are new oil fields being discovered, but they tend to be in difficult-to-reach and sensitive locations \u2013 miles deep in the ocean or high above the Arctic Circle. That makes them expensive and environmentally challenging to develop.\nWhile greed surely remains strong among governing elites in oil-producing countries \u2013 tyrannical or democratic \u2013 new players who may not mind shutting down production have entered the picture. Most important are terrorists who would cheerfully blow up an oil field if it serves their purposes. Because of these and other non-state actors, the chances of a supply disruption are higher now than they\u2019ve been for a long time. A recent study by the Energy Modeling Forum concluded that there is a 50-50 chance of a significant supply disruption in the next 10 years.\nMarkets are showing signs of increasing rigidity. China and other countries are signing up oil supplies for direct delivery from producing countries"}

We at RCPU have always referred to RCPU as a newsletter, in part because it is an actual e-mail newsletter for subscribers (and was before it was ever a blog) and in part because, for us, the word \"blog\" doesn't carry a lot of credibility. Blogs are like opinions (which are like...something else): Everybody has one, or so it seems.\nThis week, though, RCPU was definitely more blog than newsletter. We took a blog entry from Microsoft (via an entry from one of our sister sites) and misinterpreted what it was saying, thereby making more of a story than what was really there. In this case, the story was Ray Ozzie's apparent exit from Azure development at Microsoft. Well, Ozzie's role in Azure hasn't changed. If you want more detail, read on.\nSo, we were surprised to read that Microsoft, in consolidating its Azure operations with Bob Muglia's Server and Tools business, appeared to be taking Ray Ozzie off of Azure, which was a major project for him and of which he has become, to some extent, the public face of late. In our defense, Microsoft's own blog entry on the reorg wasn't crystal clear.\n\"In short, as chief software architect at Microsoft, Ray is responsible for oversight of the company's technical strategy and product architecture. Ray's role isn't affected by this change. Ray will continue to be very involved with Windows Azure; however, as Microsoft prepares to begin billing customers for the service in February, it makes sense that Windows Azure would move from an advanced development project under Ray's oversight into a mainstream business in a product group at the company (with full marketing, sales, etc., support).\"\nSo, there you go. The key phrase is that second sentence: \"Ray's role isn't affected by this change.\" Instead of being an earthquake, this is just a typical Microsoft reorg, one that moves Azure from a development stage (under Ozzie's oversight) to a business stage (under Muglia's). It makes total sense and really isn't such a big deal at all -- and it doesn't mean that Microsoft has booted Ozzie from the Azure world. We're sorry that we jumped the gun on this one, and we're glad that Microsoft set us straight. We seek above all else to be accurate and fair.\nOf course, none of that explains what's happening with Live Mesh, which seems to have just disappeared into Azure, but that's another blog -- sorry, newsletter -- entry for another time."}

The judge had strongly hinted at a hearing last month that she was inclined to side with the state over the inmate, Vernon Madison.\nLawyers from the Alabama Attorney General's Office introduced the notes of the lead prosecutor, John Cherry, and called him as a witness at the hearing in federal court. DuBose noted that Cherry now serves as the criminal division chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Mobile.\n\"As such, the undersigned has had the opportunity to not only judge his credibility in this proceeding, but has had over 13 years to judge the veracity and credibility of John Cherry,\" she wrote. \"It is the opinion of this court, after considering the written notes and testimony of John Cherry, that the prosecutor's explanations for striking the jurors are credible, valid and race-neutral.\"\nAngela Setzer, an attorney with the Montgomery-based Equal Justice Initiative, could not be reached for comment.\nOriginally, DuBose had rejected Madison's constitutional challenge without a hearing. But the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Madison's lawyers had met their burden of demonstrating the appearance of racial bias in the jury selection at Madison's trial. The court sent the case back to DuBose with instructions to determine if the state could show non-discriminatory reasons for its choices and if those reasons were legitimate or merely a pretext for excluding black jurors.\nAccording to the testimony, Cherry used six of his 18 discretionary jury strikes to remove black members of the panel. The defense used all 18 of its strikes to remove whites. The end result was a jury of six whites and six blacks, with the two alternates also evenly split.\nCherry cited three reasons for excluding the black jurors. One had a job in the mental health field, and one was married to a man who worked at Searcy Hospital in Mount Vernon. Cherry testified that he believed they might be more sympathetic to Madison's mental health defense.\nThree of the potential jurors knew defense witnesses or Madison, himself.\nAnd one of the jurors expressed his belief that prosecutors in a death penalty trial should have to prove their case beyond all doubt, rather than the legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.\nDuBose found that each of these reasons was constitutionally permissible.\nIt is not clear what legal step Madison's lawyers might now take. He already has made numerous challenges to his conviction. The 1994 trial was his third. State appellate courts twice had sent the case back to Mobile County, once for a violation based on race-based jury selection and once based on improper testimony for an expert witness for the prosecution. He is one of Alabama's longest-serving death row inmates.\nMadison was in his mid-30s in 1985 when he fatally shot police Officer Julius Schulte, who was responding to a domestic disturbance call, according to law enforcement authorities.

Justin Chase faces charges of third-degree assault, harassment in Nov. 2016 incident.\nThis week, a six-member jury with one alternate will decide whether Loveland police Sgt. Justin Chase is guilty of misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault and harassment.\nThey'll ponder whether injuries to Timothy Jarrett's face were caused by excessive force or could have been self-inflicted in an incident Nov. 5, 2016, when he was being arrested by police.\nChase pleaded not guilty in June to the charges, and his trial began Tuesday.\nThe Larimer County District Attorney's Office, at the request of the Loveland Police Department, investigated the allegations of excessive force and presented the results to a grand jury, which indicted Chase on the charges.\nNot only is the convening of a grand jury in Larimer County rare, but so are criminal charges against a police officer for an on-duty incident involving use of force. The Loveland city attorney's office doesn't keep records of criminal cases against police officers, but according to the Loveland Police Department Professional Standards Unit, Chase is the only officer from that city in at least a decade to be criminally charged for an on-duty incident involving use of force.\nThe jury of six women and one man, along with defense attorneys and prosecutors, watched dashboard camera footage and listened to audio from Chase and Jarrett's interaction at McKee Medical Center following Jarrett's arrest.\nJarrett also testified Tuesday afternoon.\nIn prosecutors' opening arguments, Joanne Morando focused on the \"extra strikes\" that she said Chase gave to Jarrett when he was in the police patrol vehicle and allegations that Chase slammed Jarrett's head into the glass partition in the SUV.\nAnd those strikes or shoves, she said, occurred while Jarrett was restrained in his seat.\n\"When Sgt. Justin Chase gave Mr. Jarrett extra strikes, he needed eight stitches,\" she said.\nBut criminal defense attorney Patrick Welsh told jurors they would hear conflicting evidence in the testimony throughout the trial.\n\"What you won't see is clear, concise evidence ... that (Justin Chase) grabbed Timothy Jarrett in the back of the head and slammed him three times,\" Welsh said.\nWelsh acknowledged that Chase admitted to striking Jarrett one extra time but not three and not in the way prosecutors presented the evidence.\nThere's no debate surrounding the details that led to Jarrett's contact with police before his arrest \u2014 he admitted to violating a protection order against his then-girlfriend, getting into an argument with her at Sports Station, a bar and grill at 409 N. Railroad Ave.\nLoveland police contacted Jarrett at his parents' home in Loveland in the 800 block of North Taylor Avenue later that night. After officers noticed Jarrett smelled like he had been drinking \u2014 an alleged violation of a court order \u2014 they informed him he was under arrest.\nBut after that is where the disagreement about what happened begins.\nJarrett said in his testimony that he denied drinking that night and when officers kept pushing him about it, he said he told them \"sarcastically\" that he had been drinking.\nWhen officers attempted to arrest Jarrett, defense attorneys said, Jarrett became so uncooperative and violent that they had to call for backup. They also said Jarrett pushed Chase into a tree and struck him in the chest as well as kicked another officer in the groin.\nOfficer Matt Sychla responded to the home with Chase that night.\nTh"}

{"idx": "32113", "prompt": "Continue the following text: By David Loy - posted Thursday, 16 September 2004 Sign Up for free e-mail updates!\nThe Lord of the Rings as a modern Buddhist myth?\nMiddle-earth is derived from Nordic and Germanic sagas, and is built on a quite unBuddhist dualism between unredeemable evil (Sauron and Saruman) and uncompromising goodness (Gandalf, Frodo etc.). The only good orc is a dead orc.\nAnd yet - despite its European origins - The Lord of the Rings resonates with Buddhist concerns and perspectives. Evil, for example, is much more nuanced than appears at first glance. Sauron is not intrinsically evil: he too was corrupted, long ago, by his craving for the Ring. And a repeated act of compassion is crucial to the plot.\nMore fundamentally, The Lord of the Rings can serve as a Buddhist fable because it is about a spiritual quest. Frodo leaves home not to slay a dragon or win a chest of jewels, but to let go of something. His renunciation of the Ring is not done for any selfish purpose, not even to gain enlightenment, but it nonetheless transforms him spiritually. The quest is to save the world, which makes him a bodhisattva. Frodo\u2019s journey also implies something important about how to understand the \u201cBuddhist Way\u201d today.\nFrodo does not have his adventures because he wants to have them. He embarks on the quest because it cannot be evaded. The Ring must be destroyed and he is the best one to carry it. There is nothing he hopes to gain from the journey. By the end, he and Sam expect to be destroyed soon after the Ring is cast into the Fire and that almost happens. Their total renunciation is a powerful metaphor. They let go of all personal ambition, although not the ambition to do what is necessary to help others.\nFrodo\u2019s quest is not an attempt to transcend Middle-earth, by realising some higher reality. He is simply responding to its needs, which because of historical circumstances (the growing power of Sauron) have become critical, as they have also become for us today, on our beleaguered earth. The larger world has begun to impinge on his (and our) shire. If Frodo were to decline the task and hide at home, he would not escape the dangers that threaten. Is our situation today any different?\nSo is Frodo\u2019s journey a spiritual quest, or a struggle to help the world? In The Lord of the Rings they are the same thing. Frodo \u201creal-ises\u201d (makes real) his own non-duality with the world by doing everything he can to help it. And by doing what he can to transform it, Frodo transforms himself. That is how his selflessness is developed. Frodo does not change because he destroys the Ring. He changes because of his tireless efforts to destroy the Ring. His early adventures on the road to Rivendell test and toughen him, giving him courage to be the Ringbearer. His own strength of will and heart grows from these encounters, teaching him self-reliance and developing into his unassuming heroic stature.\nGandalf cannot accompany Frodo and Sam all the way. The plot requires him to fall away, so that they can grow into the role they need to play. Gandalf sacrifices himself defending his colleagues and disappears to undergo his own psychic death and resurrection. Appropriately, that occurs deep in the mines of Moria. Is the same true for our"}

Elena, meanwhile, knew she had confusing feelings to reconcile and Damon was elated when Elena revealed he was the reason for the breakup. But the two didn't jump each other's bones right away. First, they had to attend to the matter of awakened hunter Jeremy wanting to kill Elena.

He's one of about 276,000 people who are similarly gaga over that car.\n\u201cI will need help in figuring out how to wait the two years until it is delivered,\u201d Scott emailed to me, adding a perhaps unnecessary :). Scott sees the Tesla Model 3 as an entry-level luxury car, on par with the BMW 3-Series. The 215-mile range makes it feasible transportation for long-distance ski trips.\nScott raves, \u201cAt $35,000, the Tesla 3 is a great deal. If the incentives are in place \u2014 which is why I rushed to the mall to make a deposit, so I\u2019ll be near the front of the line \u2014 it\u2019s a downright steal at $24,500.\u201d That\u2019s the federal income tax credit plus the state rebate at work.\nI find Tesla mania fascinating, and it proves that the company \u2014 without advertising \u2014 has succeeded in creating a highly desirable brand. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a favorite against a car, on the market first, with almost identical stats \u2014 the Chevrolet Bolt. You know how people want a Mercedes-Benz more than they want a similarly equipped Hyundai, and are willing to pay extra for the prestige of the three-pointed star? Bingo.\nWhile Americans of all ages are feeling optimistic about their finances, millennials are the most comfortable with their savings, debt, net worth and overall financial health.\nAll of this suggests that Chevy might have done well to create a new division \u2014 like BMW\u2019s i \u2014 to sell its electric cars. Hyundai did just that for luxury cars, with the upmarket Genesis, a big hit at the New York Auto Show. And it also introduced the green Ioniq line (three new cars, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric) at the same venue. Not quite a new brand, but a separate identity.\nPrius has some luster as a name, as do the Japanese luxury divisions\u2014Infiniti, Acura and Lexus.

A lot of people won\u2019t want to wait for the Tesla. But the pull of the Model 3 is strong. And that gets us back to those millennials, not to mention the $30-$49,000 income folks definitely planning to buy a car in the next year. They really, really want Teslas, too, and now there\u2019s one they might \u2014 stretch, stretch \u2014 actually afford.

Marketers will be able to target ads to the service\u2019s 300 million users by interest, age, gender and other factors, just as they can on Facebook.\nInstagram will also begin testing a type of ad that allows viewers to click on a link to buy a product or install an app that is advertised.\nThe commercialization of Instagram, while sure to disappoint some users, was probably inevitable. Major social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest have committed to keep their services free to users, and they have turned to advertising to pay the bills.\nInstagram offered its first ads in November 2013, but since it has been subsidized by Facebook, it has had time to develop an ad strategy.\nThe advertising expansion has long been anticipated by marketers and investors, who see big money for Facebook and the brands in ads shown to Instagram\u2019s users \u2014 a generally young, passionate group who share, like, click and comment on posts at a much higher rate than users of other services, including Facebook.\nOne Wall Street firm, RBC Capital Markets, has estimated that Instagram ads could bring in $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion in additional revenue to Facebook this year alone, depending on how quickly its new ad offerings are introduced.\nConsumer brands and retailers have been particularly eager for an easy way to lead people who, for instance, like an Instagram photo of a pair of ballet flats, to a place where they could buy the shoes.\nRight now, that experience is clumsy, especially on mobile phones, when users are forced to cut and paste a link into their browsers or search for the shoes on a retailer\u2019s site.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun as a user and hard to track as a brand,\u201d said Kfir Gavrieli, chief executive and co-founder of Tieks, a Los Angeles maker of foldable ballet flats that sells its wares entirely online. Mr. Gavrieli, whose company has about 400,000 Instagram followers, was briefed by Facebook on the coming changes and said he was eager to try the company\u2019s new targeting and click-to-buy options.\nNevertheless, increased advertising could also turn off Instagram users.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met him on the tarmac, along with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians and the archbishop of Athens, who is the head of the Church of Greece.\nThe three Christian leaders, officially divided over a 1,000-year schism, will spend nearly an hour Saturday greeting some 250 refugees stuck on Lesbos. They will lunch with eight of them to hear their stories of fleeing war, conflict and poverty and their hopes for a better life in Europe. And then they will pray together, tossing a floral wreath into the sea in memory of those who didn't make it.\nThe five-hour visit is meant to highlight the plight of refugees, thank the Greek people who have welcomed them in, and to show a united Christian response to the humanitarian crisis unfolding.\nAlso ahead of the visit, municipal crews scrubbed the walls of Mytilene after graffiti reading \"Papa Don't Preach\" was sprayed in black at several points on the seafront in Mytilene. A handful of senior Orthodox clergy in Greece have been highly critical of Francis' trip, though the protests are nothing compared to the protests that greeted St. John Paul II's visit in 2001.\nThe wreath-tossing ceremony scheduled for later Saturday is a gesture Francis first made when he visited the Italian island of Lampedusa in the summer of 2013, his first trip outside Rome as pope, after a dozen migrants died trying to reach the southern tip of Europe. He made a similar gesture more recently at the U.S.-Mexican border, laying a bouquet of flowers next to a large crucifix at the Ciudad Juarez border crossing in memory of migrants who died trying to reach the U.S.\nThe Vatican insists Saturday's visit is purely humanitarian and religious in nature, not political or a \"direct\" criticism of the EU plan.\nBut spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters that Francis' position on Europe's \"moral obligation\" to welcome refugees is well-known, and that the EU-Turkey deportation deal certainly has \"consequences on the situation of the people involved.\"\nThe Vatican official in charge of migrants, Cardinal Antonio Maria Veglio, was even more explicit, saying the EU-Turkey plan essentially treats migrants as merchandise that can be traded back and forth and doesn't recognize their inherent dignity as human beings.\nAside from the inherently political nature of the trip, it also has a significant religious dimension.\nLombardi said the ecumenical significance of a meeting between Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and the head of the Church of Greece, Athens Archbishop Ieronymos II was \"obvious.\" He credited Greece's politicians with their willingness to let the religious leaders take center stage as an \"appreciated\" gesture of discretion."}
{"idx": "32132", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There are lots of reasons to be excited for the upcoming Captain Marvel, but one of the subjects that has gotten a lot of focus -- other than Captain Marvel punching an old lady -- is the Skrulls. The shape-shifting aliens will be making their MCU debut in the movie as the antagonist, with Captain Marvel stuck in the middle of their war with the Kree. Since the news of the Skrulls' involvement first dropped, people began theorizing that other MCU characters would be revealed to be shape-shifters all along. As cool as those theories are, that comes with a massive problem because it makes significant character development potentially pointless.\nA little extra context is in order. The Skrull were first introduced in 1962 and have primarily been enemies of the Fantastic Four, though they have troubled other heroes as well. Their main power is the ability to shape-shift, but they later learn how to genetically alter their warriors to have the same abilities as Earth's heroes. Perhaps their most prominent story is Secret Invasion, in which it's revealed that the Skrull have replaced several significant figures on Earth in a long-term plan to take over the planet. The heroes already didn't trust each other because of Civil War, so a complication of this scale wasn't helping matters. It was a vast comics event that crossed over dozens of different series, and it would make for a fascinating movie arc.\nBut that doesn't mean it can be entirely translated from page to screen. The main problem with these Skrull theories in regards to the movies is that you can't replace a main character like Iron Man for the long term because that means that anything you watched them do during that time has no meaning.\nSo let's lay out a hypothetical situation. It's revealed in an upcoming Avengers movie that Black Panther was replaced, and it's actually Skrull Panther that we've been following since the end of, let's say, Avengers 4. In this scenario, that means that we've likely gotten Black Panther 2 and seen T'Challa overcome some obstacle and go through some character development. At the time of watching this movie, we don't know he's a Skrull. However, Avengers 5 drops the bomb, and it's a huge twist. Maybe it's executed well in the movie, but it doesn't change the fact that whatever happened in Black Panther 2 doesn't matter now because T'Challa didn't go through that experience. That retroactively damages the sequel.\nWhat I just laid out is a pretty specific situation, but if people want main characters to be Skrulled, then there are limited options. That's not to say that there aren't ways to get it to work. For example, they could tease during Black Panther 2's end credit scene that T'Challa gets switched out with a Skrull, and then hint that something is up with him during the lead into Avengers 5. That keeps what happens in the sequel meaningful while keeping the Skrull twist intact. It's called having your cake and eating it too.\nIt's also important to remember that during the Secret Invasion storyline, there weren't any big name superheroes who were replaced. The biggest were Hank Pym, Spider-Woman, and Jarvis the Butler, while others like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine were left untouched. I would imagine that bigger names weren't revealed to be Skrulls for the same reason I listed above: it would just make everything that happened"}

Bush in the early 1990s.\nIf confirmed, Barr would take over supervision of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which has shadowed Trump\u2019s tenure.\nBarr has criticized the inquiry, echoing some of Trump\u2019s complaints. He has suggested, for example, that it is partisan in nature because some of the prosecutors under Robert S. Mueller III, a Republican, had contributed to Democrats\u2019 campaigns.\nAt the same time, however, some who worked with Barr said they were relieved by the choice, noting that he had deep ties to federal prosecutors and law enforcement, including Mueller, who headed the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division in Barr\u2019s previous stint as attorney general.\nFormer FBI Director James B. Comey, whom Trump fired, also praised Barr.\n\u201cI like and respect Bill Barr. I know he\u2019s an institutionalist who cares deeply about the integrity of the Justice Department,\u201d Comey told reporters Friday.\nTrump also said he will nominate Heather Nauert, a former Fox News anchor who has been State Department spokeswoman since April 2017, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. The president will downgrade the position to a sub-Cabinet post, according to a White House official, reversing Trump\u2019s previous upgrade of the job.\nThe choices marked the start of an expected series of high-level staff changes as Trump seeks to recover from last month\u2019s bruising midterm election, which saw heavy Republican losses in the House and in state elections, and prepares for his 2020 reelection race.\nAmong those reportedly on the exit ramp is John F. Kelly, Trump\u2019s chief of staff. The president privately indicated this week that he plans to pick Nick Ayers, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, to replace the retired Marine four-star general.\nTrump also is expected to name Gen. Mark A. Milley, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran with combat commands, to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after Gen. Joseph Dunford, who will complete his term next fall. Trump indicated that he would make the announcement at the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia on Saturday.\nThe announcements came on a day on which Trump prominently aired grievances with Mueller and with his former secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.\nLater in the day, he called Tillerson \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d and \u201clazy as hell.\u201d Before he became the nation\u2019s top diplomat, Tillerson was chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp.\nIf confirmed, Barr, 68, would replace Jeff Sessions, who was ousted as attorney general a day after the Nov. 6 election, and Matthew Whitaker, who has been acting attorney general since then.\nBarr served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under Bush, who died last Friday.

Why Is Jim Dobson Pretending Not To Understand Barack Obama?\nDr. Jim Dobson is a likeable man of wit and intelligence whom I have long admired for his support for the family.\nRecently, however, he\u2014and his national political director, Tom Minnery\u2014undertook on Dobson\u2019s nationally syndicated radio program to engage in a hypercritical distortion of an influential and powerful presentation on faith (a \u201cCall to Renewal\u201d) by Sen. Obama in 2006.\nThe radio criticism of Obama has a number of facets to it: Dr. Dobson apparently believes the United States is a Christian nation rather than a nation of many faiths. Historically and today, there are indeed more Christians in America than believers from other faith traditions, but what follows from this? Sen. Obama would suggest respect and appreciation for the influence of Christianity while also appreciating that there are people of other faiths, and of no faith, who are not to be treated as second-class citizens. Surely Dr. Dobson agrees, right? So what\u2019s the point?\nSen. Obama also quoted a number of Old and New Testament passages, including some dietary laws that governed the Israelites (like not eating shellfish) to make the obvious point that even if one strictly followed this dietary restriction as a matter of faith in one\u2019s own life, it could not simply be codified to bind people of other faith traditions\u2014at least not without majority approval and a lot of angry shellfish eaters.\nDr. Dobson thinks this mocks the Bible, but it is merely underscoring that we have an obligation in the public square to speak in universal or accessible terms.\nObama also said Jesus\u2019 Sermon on the Mount is \u201ca passage that is so radical that it\u2019s doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application.\u201d OK, I guess we could ask whether or not Jesus would think the purveyors of preemptive war to be \u201cpeacemakers,\u201d but again Dr. Dobson\u2019s point is more than a little obscure. And to assert that Obama \u201cis dragging biblical understanding through the gutter,\u201d more than a little absurd.\nDr. Dobson also attacks Obama for his support for abortion rights. Like Dobson, I disagree with Sen. Obama here as well. But Dobson has mischaracterized the senator\u2019s view. Obama believes the woman herself must decide the abortion question. The senator acknowledges the decision to be a \u201cprofoundly moral one\u201d and one he would advise a mother to make in favor of life and only after talking with her clergyman. In a meeting with me and other faith leaders a week or so ago, the senator reiterated that he is not \u201cpro-abortion,\u201d and that he wants to \u201cdiscourage\u201d the practice by encouraging personal responsibility as well as enhancing adoption and comprehensive education that would reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.\nCould the senator do more? Sure, and he is open to reasoned argument. Dr. Dobson should make one. The senator\u2019s point: All of us as we speak across religious lines need arguments beyond what we accept as doctrinal teaching in our particular faith tradition. How Dr. Dobson misinterprets this to suggest that either Dobson or my religious view would be excluded from the public debate or that \u201cwe have no right to fight for what we believe\u201d is a mystery.\nThere is nothing in Sen. Obama\u2019s speech to suggest any denigration of faith generally, Christianity specifically, or Dr. Dobson personally. Far from it.

If hot caramel touches the skin, it can leave a nasty burn.\nThe Govatos, who grew up in the candy business, have time-honored skills. With almost military precision, they dip and spin whole apples spiked with wooden sticks into hot, tawny candy and let them cool on a marble-covered table.\nRichard is in charge of the plain apples, while Nick rolls his batch into a container filled with chopped Brazil nuts.\n\"People have asked for other fixings, like chocolate drizzles and dipping them into M&Ms,\" says Nick, shaking his head.\n\"Other guys do that.

I store them in the laundry room off the kitchen, and when I open the pantry door, the odor always makes my nose twitch, however much I anticipate it.\nThe herbs themselves are an interesting assortment of twigs; flat, brown things; a rind of something. One time I thought I saw the dried carapace of a bug. They are mushroom-like in color, uniformly brown and beige. Their smell is at once sweet and musty, and lingering, like something dead. I've often described them as \"road kill in a bag.\"\nWe get the herbs from our Chinese doctor, Joy Jin, a tiny, middle-aged woman who speaks passable English and, like all Chinese doctors, is prone to blunt pronouncements that somehow don't offend. When I first began brewing the teas in the hope of stopping some of my daughter's seizures, I was worried that I might do her some sort of harm. Dr. Jin assured me that the teas were \"dangerous for you, not for Sophie.\"\nThis was in keeping with a friend's experience with a different Chinese doctor. That wise woman had continuously admonished my friend against an earlier brain surgery done on her own epileptic infant daughter. \"Why you cut open her brain? That's terrible,\" she said, every time my friend brought her daughter for a visit.\nThe surgery had been unsuccessful, and my friend regretted it to a sickening degree. However, the criticism was so blunt and honest that it was hysterical to us.\nNeurologists, on the other hand, have great difficulty voicing their opinions, especially when they don't know what in the world is going on with their patients' brains. That had been our experience, anyway.\nI dutifully reported to Sophie's neurologist that I was taking her to a Chinese doctor and giving her herbal teas. Dr. T., a comfortingly disheveled doctor whom I had chosen to follow my daughter's progress after a long string of arrogant, best-in-the-field physicians, commented in her gentle British accent, \"Well, they couldn't possibly be any more dangerous than the stuff we've been forcing down her throat for six years.\"\nChinese herbs are brewed twice. The first time, I open the bag into a nonmetallic pot and cover the mixture with water. Dust and pollen-like fragments float to the surface; I push them down with a wooden spoon and turn on the gas.\nWhen the water begins to boil, I turn down the heat, and they simmer for 45 minutes. During this time, the odor is so intense that I usually open the windows and, weather permitting, the doors. It always crosses my mind that a neighbor or passerby, assailed by an almost visible smell, will think I'm making some sort of drug.\nAfter trying more than 15 anti-epileptic drugs with no success, Sophie continues to endure multiple seizures a day. Yet I have still felt compelled to defend to my friends and family the unorthodox treatment I'm now pursuing. It's simpler to justify the hideous side effects of the accepted protocol than the benefits of the unproved.\nThe reverence with which I prepare this tea is such that I use the same pot, the same strainer, the same bowl and the same pitcher.

{"idx": "32155", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: There is nothing more important than participating in the largest demonstration of social change in our lives.\nOne of the biggest myths about the Occupy Colleges movement, similar to misconceptions about Occupy Wall Street, is that there is a lack of focus. Occupy Colleges originated in the same way as its \u201cmother\u201d movement\u2014spur of the moment, without a strong idea of what the future would look like, but with a sustained focus on problems that specifically affect colleges and universities across the nation, student debt being the most obvious example.\nIn an attempt to gain both focus and traction, Occupy Colleges is staging National Solidarity Teach-ins on November 2nd and 3rd. The purpose in holding these teach-ins is to educate interested university community members about Occupy Wall Street, cultivate new ideas and possible solutions and ways to contribute, and effectively participate in steering the course of the largest social movement our generation has yet to see.\nThe Occupy Colleges website provides resources for students to make organizing teach-ins not too arduous a task. In addition to helpful guides, here are some other details to keep in mind when aiming to conduct the most effective teach-in possible.\nKeep it local. While it\u2019s important to address Occupy Wall Street on a broad scale and within an international context, it would be problematic for colleges to ignore local concerns occurring in their own backyards. Giving your teach-in a local perspective is necessary in order to create an inclusionary social movement. Colleges and universities, especially private institutions, often attain reputations for being \u201civory towers on the hill\u201d and separating themselves from local off-campus communities. Working together with the local city or town that your college is geographically situated in is integral to the teach-in and the Occupy movement in general.\nAddress \u2018the right\u2019 issues. Each campus is unique in its current struggles and the issues that face the surrounding local community. Seek out a representative from the local movement who can most accurately speak to these issues at the teach-in, but also remember to present the unified issues that Occupy Colleges and Occupy Wall Street stand for on a national level \u2014 higher taxes on the \"one percent,\" the closing of corporate tax loopholes, student debt forgiveness, a more regulated financial services industry and a forthright, well-funded effort to put people back to work.\nReserve an appropriate space on campus. Students are more likely to attend the teach-in if it\u2019s physically accessible to them. It\u2019s also important to reinforce one of the founding ideas behind Occupy Colleges: university students are capable of bringing the Occupy movement to their own schools, even if it\u2019s not feasible to attend a protest in one of the big cities in which the movement has taken root. The room\u2019s general set up is also an important component to consider\u2014allow for sufficient space and seating, and try to find a comfortable environment.\nAcknowledge your social location. Coming to terms with our own sites of privilege and oppression in relation to the other unique experiences of Occupy Colleges, Occupy Wall Street and teach-in participants is necessary when attempting to organize a cohesive and balanced social movement. In an effort to avoid further oppression and the perpetuation of privilege within the Occupy movement, it\u2019s not only essential to include a variety of perspectives in the teach-in but also for each student to be aware of their own intersections of race, class, gender-identity, sexual-identity, etc. when organizing ideas and discussion topics.\nRecruit informed, involved, and"}

She had no womb, but still had ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nOver the years, her mother had mentioned the possibility that she could act as a surrogate, but it wasn\u2019t until Smith got married in 2016 that it became a serious prospect.\nMiles lost 84 pounds to get down to a healthy weight for the pregnancy, according to Wales Online, and moved over a hundred miles from her home in south Wales to be near her daughter.\nShe gave birth by caesarian section on Jan. 16 to Evie, who weighed 7lb 7oz, reported the BBC.\nA 55-year-old woman has acted as a surrogate for her daughter and given birth to her child.\nPregnancies after the age of 35 carry an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia, a condition that can be potentially fatal for the mother or unborn baby.\nBut Miles brushed away those concerns.\nSmith said that when scans revealed she had no womb it turned her world upside down.\n\u201cI was heartbroken at the idea that I wouldn\u2019t carry my own child.

I knew that she meant one day she\u2019d carry my child for me.\n\u201cOver the years she mentioned it in passing but we never really made a firm plan.\nHowever, Smith was worried about using a surrogate. According to UK law, regardless of the babies genetic mother, the surrogate and her husband get automatic parental rights.\n\u201cThat felt like a huge risk,\u201d she said.\nSome surrogates naturally develop a very strong maternal attachment to the newborn they have carried for 9 months, but Miles said that she only feels like a proud grandmother.\nIVF surrogacy has been around for only about 40 years, spinning off various legal paradoxes and challenges as it opens up the world of surrogacy to more people and creates new potential conflicts between different kinds of parents.\nFor example, a surrogate mother from Texas called for a change in the law after the biological parents of the baby she carried told her to abort their baby\u2014which she refused to do.\nStephanie Levesque, who has been a surrogate mother three times, gave birth to a baby just days before Christmas on Dec. 21, 2017, at the Medical City Women\u2019s Hospital in Dallas.\nDoctors had told her weeks prior that the child suffered from a severe heart defect, prompting the biological parents to demand that she abort the child due to the risk. Levesque said it ran counter to her beliefs and refused to go through with it.\nLevesque said the confrontation with the parents caused her to reach out to lawmakers to revise surrogacy laws in the state.

Usually, its melody is played in call-and-response: the horns play a line, the piano or guitar replies with a specific riff, repeat. And when the Miles Davis Quintet of the late 1960s first added \"Gingerbread Boy\" to its songbook, it came out more-or-less typically: Miles (trumpet) and Wayne Shorter (sax) would play the melody, Herbie Hancock responded on piano, and Ron Carter (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) laid down a spirited yet straightforward swing groove.\nBut history remembers this particular Miles band as state-of-the-art, and it earned that reputation by pushing at every boundary it could find. There's evidence of that on a new box set gathering Miles Davis' appearances at the Newport Jazz Festival (and Newport-branded events) called Miles Davis At Newport 1955-1975: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4. Many of these recordings are previously unreleased (at least officially), including recordings from the summers of 1966 and 1967. The '66 version catches the band having recently added it to the repertoire (see above). But when the quintet returned to Newport in July '67, it launched into \"Gingerbread Boy\" at a breakneck pace. Gone is Herbie's \"duh duh-duht duhhh, duht duht\" comping in favor of an extended drum fill; gone is the tail of the melody in the turnaround; gone is bassist Ron Carter in the opening salvo almost entirely. It's a different animal, with new handlers.\nAs the band launches into its solos, it only grows hungrier and more aggressive. The blues form begins to fracture at the edges of bar lines, the harmonies grow more tense and unresolved, and Tony Williams drives like a man possessed, swerving for whatever accent or displacement he felt necessary, safety be damned. Everyone pauses to catch their collective breath between solos. Then everyone starts playing chicken anew, daring each other to get ever weirder.\nAround this time, this quintet was making studio recordings of some fascinating original compositions from all its members, including some which are still played today. But live, it's as if Miles wanted to suggest ideas that both the bandstand and the audience could take hold of \u2014 something like \"let's play a funky little blues\" \u2014 and subvert it. It became a vehicle for high-risk collective experimentation, with requisite mess and collateral damage, and maybe a little immortality in the process."}

It taught me more about English, and it gave me friendships and connections and respect I never could have otherwise received. Just as learning Portuguese, Pirah\u00e3, and smatterings of other Amazonian languages continued to transform me during my entire life.\nNow, after spending most of my adult life in higher education, researching languages, cultures, and cognition, I have become more convinced than ever that nothing teaches us about the world and how to think more effectively better than learning new languages. That is why I advocate for fluency in foreign languages. But for this to happen, language-learning needs to make a comeback as a requirement of both primary and secondary education in the United States. Learning another language benefits each learner in at least three ways \u2014 pragmatically, neurologically, and culturally.\nPragmatically, consider the benefits of language-learning for the businessperson working alongside speakers of other languages. Although it might be tempting to use English as a lingua franca in new business situations, the investment of learning the language of your colleagues and customers tells them: \"I respect you.\" It can transform colleagues and customers into friends. Think about it \u2014 you appreciate the effort of someone who has learned to speak your language. Their communication in the language of your home helps you to relate better to them, to see them as less \"other.\" In fact, some people feel threatened just hearing a foreign language. Languages have power. Why not partake in that power instead of fearing it?\nNo matter what you do for a living, language-learning brings practical advantages. Whether you work in a restaurant or are a scholar or a tourist or just a stay-at-home Joe, fluency in other languages is a gift that will keep on giving for the rest of your life. You will understand the world better \u2014 imagine being able to watch soccer in Spanish or Italian as well as in English! That alone is a pretty good return. But as we are going to learn directly, beyond the practical benefits, language will expand your knowledge and your very intelligence. If you learn a language in your 20s, you'll reap benefits for 50 to 60 years, ceteris paribus (all things being equal, for those who didn't study Latin). Say it takes you two years of hard work and constant practice to learn a language. To maintain it will require, let's say, about one hour a week of conversation or foreign-language television. Yet it will benefit you for the rest of your life. If it takes two years to learn another language, and you have the benefit of that language for the rest of an average lifespan, that is roughly a 900 percent return on investment. Not bad at all.\nJohn borrowed $10,000 from the bank of Mom and Dad to pay down his college loan.\nThis phrase means \"go upriver\" in Pirah\u00e3.

They use absolute directions, not relative directions as, say, the average American does when he says \"turn left\" (vs. the absolute direction, \"turn north\").

For instance, they didn\u2019t provide detailed information on things such as sources of income and charitable contributions.\nMoreover, it\u2019s impossible to know what might be in a return unless you see the return.\nIt's also worth noting that while some nominees have released numerous years of returns \u2013 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole provided 30 years\u2019 worth \u2013 others have not. In 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan released only one return and in 2012, Republican Mitt Romney released two.\nIn the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has released returns from 2000 through 2015.\nAs for Trump, he has said he hasn\u2019t released his taxes because he is being audited. When he claimed he \"released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. \u2026 You don't learn much in a tax return,\" PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was False.\nTrump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. But experts say tax returns would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his assets.\nBaldwin says that except for Trump, \"every other major party nominee\" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns.\nShe\u2019s almost right. During that period, the only major-party presidential nominee who didn\u2019t release returns was Ford, the Republican nominee in 1976"}

While he declared success, the Pentagon said the pummeling of three chemical-related facilities left enough others intact to enable the Assad government to use banned weapons against civilians if it chooses.\nHis choice of words recalled a similar claim associated with former president George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that would tie down U.S. forces for years.\nHaley said the three U.S. goals for accomplishing its mission are making sure chemical weapons are not used in a way that could harm U.S. national interests, defeating Daesh and having a good vantage point to watch what Iran is doing.\nRussia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.\nRussia and Iran called the use of force by the United States and its French and British allies a \u201cmilitary crime\u201d and \u201cact of aggression.\u201d The UN Security Council rejected a Russian resolution calling for condemnation of the \u201caggression\u201d by the three Western allies.\nThe strikes \u201csuccessfully hit every target,\u201d said Dana W. White, the chief Pentagon spokesperson. The military said there were three targets: the Barzah chemical weapons research and development site in the Damascus area, a chemical weapons storage facility near Homs and a chemical weapons \u201cbunker\u201d a few miles from the second target.\nAlthough officials said the singular target was Assad\u2019s chemical weapons capability, his air force, including helicopters he allegedly has used to drop chemical weapons on civilians, were spared. In a U.S. military action a year ago in response to a sarin gas attack, missiles took out nearly 20 per cent of the Syrian air force, the Pentagon said.\nThat did not mean military strikes would continue. In fact, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said no additional attacks were planned.\nHaley appeared on Fox News Sunday and CBS\u2019 Face the Nation."}

As the Highlanders get ready to begin Big West Conference play, the biggest question is how much better?\nUCR, which finished 9-15 in conference last season with a young and inconsistent squad, has more depth than last season and definitely more experience, coach Doug Smith said, noting both traits are crucial if the team expects to be competitive in the tough conference.\nThe Highlanders, 10-9 so far this season, open conference play on Thursday with the start of a three-game series against UC Irvine (16-5).\nThat one year of experience is expected to pay dividends as the group of newcomers enters its second season. Most of the first 19 games were spent trying to find the right pieces and mixing and matching players to their specific roles. The everyday lineup has been pared down some, but multiple players are able to play multiple positions, which gives Smith and the coaching staff more options.\nOne player who\u2019s taken advantage of those options is Clayton Prestridge. The senior had a solid season a year ago, but is off to an even better start this time around. He\u2019s leading the team in hitting at .342 and has 16 RBI. He\u2019s started all 19 games, playing first base, catcher or left field.\n\u201cKnowing what to expect this year from the pitchers and how they\u2019re going to pitch me has made me a smarter hitter,\u201d Prestridge said.\nUCR is fourth in the Big West in hitting with a .278 average and is scoring 6.6 runs per game. The Highlanders averaged less than 4.3 runs last season.\nFrank has also seen improvement after his role was changed. The right-hander started 14 games last season but was moved to closer this season. In a team-high nine appearances this season, Frank is 3-0 with a 0.55 earned run average and three saves.\nFrank worked on improving his slider and has shown better command. Overall, the bullpen has been a bright spot for UCR.\nAs for the pieces finally fitting together, there\u2019s not much time to wait for the young lineup to gel."}

The hare falls asleep and the slow and steady tortoise passes the hare to win the race. Slow and steady wins the race.\nThe point of this story is to teach perseverance and to stop the urge to sprint and expend too much energy at once. Also, the hare is arrogant and thinks he has the race and takes a break early. Obviously terrible qualities!\nDoes Slow and Steady Win?\nBut sometimes it\u2019s best to have chapters of sprinting and chapters of pausing. Sometimes it\u2019s working 60+ hours per week to launch a dream business. You keep a full time job, but you\u2019re building your dream. Sometimes it\u2019s phases of parenting. Or when you\u2019re a sandwich parent that is taking care of parents and kids. The reality is, life isn\u2019t really a marathon where we never stop. Instead, it\u2019s a bunch of sprints and rests.\nWhen I think about slowing down, I think about stopping and sitting on a hill. The sun is rising (I\u2019m like how the heck did I get up this early, obviously this IS a dream!) and crisp air hits my meditative yoga pose.\nThe reality is, I\u2019m probably never going to meditate on a mountain at sunrise. Even when I was hiking through Nepal, the crisp air never called me as strong as the warm sleeping bag.\nIn our heads, we equate slowing down with stopping. Yes, it can be that. It can be that we just need to unplug and go on vacation. But a vacation is hard to sustain. When I talk about slowing down, I\u2019m talking about reducing, eliminating and stopping.\nWe may need to reduce what we we do and how we do it. This might be that we intentionally check email less. Also, we might eliminate tasks that are just filling space and taking away from a healthier and happier life. This change could be that we outsource our laundry or stop doing the tasks in our businesses that we dread.\nBut there is a time for stopping. It\u2019s not usually three weeks in Nepal, but the principle is the same. Throughout history, every major religion and social movement has encouraged fasting, sabbath or boundaries.\nWhen we don\u2019t have a specific focus in our life, it\u2019s easy to live in a responsive and reactive manner, instead of a planned growth approach.\nWe have to get to that email, that soccer practice, that homemade meal or that family obligation.\nEver notice how your best ideas come when you\u2019re in the shower, working out or about to fall asleep? When our brains aren\u2019t focused on work, they tend to sort through all the ideas. Then, when we least expect it, they pop up.\nThere\u2019s a natural cycle of slowing down, sparks and creation. The problem is, most of our entrepreneur minds have trouble slowing down.

When this happens, sparks of creativity start to fly.

{"idx": "32193", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A study by the Department of Health showed diagnoses of glioblastoma from 2008 to 2017 weren't substantially different from those the decade prior.\nFORT PIERCE \u2014 State health officials studying glioblastoma diagnoses in the Fort Pierce area through 2017 found no significant increases in the cancer.\nResidents in and near the city have voiced concerns about the number of glioblastoma cases reported, particularly in the 34982 ZIP code, which goes from Virginia Avenue south to Southeast Walton Road along U.S. 1, extending west to South 25th Street.\nGlioblastoma is a form of cancer that can occur in the brain or spinal cord. Residents in Fort Pierce believe there could be a cancer cluster there.\nThe Department of Health reviewed a pair of 10-year periods, 1998 to 2007 and 2008 to 2017, in three ZIP codes in the Fort Pierce area. The report focuses on men, who have a greater risk for glioblastoma than women.\nThe first decade showed 28 men were diagnosed vs. 30 in the latter. The 2010 census reported a 2.6 percent increase in Fort Pierce's population from the year 2000 to 2010.\nIn the 34982 ZIP code, six men were diagnosed from 2008 through 2017, compared with seven in the previous studied decade.\n\"There were no statistically significant differences in the number of observed cases than expected cases,\" the Department of Health said.\nThe department derives an expected rate based on the population of the study area and the statewide rate for the cancer in question. For the 34982 ZIP code, six men being diagnosed with the disease was the precise expected amount for the area, according to the report.\nState health officials also disputed any connection of the illnesses to the Florida Power & Light Co.'s St. Lucie Nuclear Plant, located on South Hutchinson Island. The plant could not be a contaminant of the mainland water supply because it is on the barrier island and is downstream of the county's groundwater, the report said.\nResidents in the area have wanted authorities to perform a water study to determine whether there is an environmental cause for recent glioblastoma cases from the past couple of years.\nResident Stephanie Cunningham, who runs a support group for survivors of glioblastoma and other brain cancers, said she'll continue to lobby for a water study.\nHealth officials said they will monitor cancer reports in the area. The Department of Health uses the Florida Cancer Data System to gather information on cancer cases. For the study completed in February, the department also worked with hospitals across the Treasure Coast to ensure all cancers related to the brain and central nervous system were included.\nThis isn't the first time St. Lucie County has had concerns about a cancer cluster. When eight children were diagnosed with neuroblastomain the 1980s and early '90s, the state paid $195,000 for testing dirt and water at 44 sites in 1997 and 1998.\nNo environmental links to cancer were found.\nWant to keep up with the latest on this topic?

But consumers should not act as if rates will never go up. Some may want to review terms for adjustable rate mortgages and credit cards.\nSome ARMs can adjust rates once a year; others twice a year.\nSome variable rate credit cards will have slightly higher monthly payments, once rates go up.\nThe Fed is expected to move gradually, giving consumers time to shore up their finances.\nFor many consumers, it's easy to hit the snooze button when it comes to talk about the Federal Reserve possibly raising short-term rates by a 0.25% in mid-December. Who cares?\nToo often, we heard dire warnings that the Fed would be driving up rates in 2015 or 2016 and then the Fed didn't budge. We had only one small rate hike in December 2015.\nBut consumers would be wise to prepare for the day, maybe as soon as early 2017, when higher rates cut into monthly budgets \u2014 especially for those who have an adjustable rate mortgage or a variable rate credit card.\nOn a $200,000 adjustable rate mortgage, a quarter point rate hike could easily add roughly $30 to the monthly payment. And the payments would climb further should the Fed move to raise rates again.\nMany consumers have fixed rate mortgages these days. The adjustable rate mortgage market isn't huge. But if you're the homeowner ultimately facing paying an extra $60 or $90 a month over time, a couple of rate hikes would whack your wallet and, maybe, influence where you go out on date nights or how much extra cash you have to pay off student loans.\n\"Consumers are certainly exposed to a rate hike,\" said Nidhi Verma, TransUnion's senior director of research and consulting.\nHow vulnerable someone's pocketbook is, though, depends considerably on how much of their debt is tied to adjustable rate products \u2014 including adjustable rate mortgages, variable rate credit cards, home equity line of credit or other variable rate loans, according to research by TransUnion.\nTransUnion found that up to 68% of credit-active consumers \u2014 or up to 92 million consumers \u2014 would experience some level of monthly payment shock as the direct result of an interest rate hike.\nConsumers who pay their credit card balances in full each month wouldn't be impacted; the same's true for consumers with some credit cards that have already hit the interest rate caps, Verma said.\nThe average hit of a 0.25% rate hike amounts to about $6.45 a month, if you spread all the borrowing on the variable rate products, based on TransUnion's study. It looks pretty small. But the real cost to individuals will depend heavily on their own types of loans and how much they've borrowed.\nTransUnion's research indicated that about 9.3 million people are on the financial edge and would not be able to absorb the increase in monthly payments that would follow a quarter-point rate hike.\nGiven that the Fed is expected to move gradually, though, some consumers would have more of an opportunity to make some adjustments to prepare for a rate hike and deal with the payment shock.\nTwo key strategies: Pay down that credit card debt \u2014 and refinance that adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate, if you're planning to stay in the home for the next several years.\nIf"}

{"idx": "32208", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Were the Taliban behind the actions of a rogue Afghan army soldier who allegedly killed three British servicemen overnight while they slept? The militants claimed that the episode, which included a shooting and a grenade assault, was a premeditated attack, part of a new strategy to push back against coalition forces spread out in record numbers across southern Afghanistan's battle zones. Although the inside-job claim remains unconfirmed, the killings cast a shadow on the quality and reliability of Afghan security forces deployed in a hostile region where they are being groomed to take the reins of their country's security and wean themselves from dependence on Western troops.\nThe assault took place at a British military outpost in Nahr-e-Saraj district, a Taliban stronghold near the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. A senior Afghan National Army (ANA) officer identified the gunman as Talib Hussein, 23, a member of the ethnic Hazara minority from Ghazni province who had served for less than a year, mainly in remote swaths of Helmand province, far from home. After killing a major in his bed, the suspect fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the base's command center, killing a British lieutenant and Nepalese Gurkha and injuring four others, before he managed to flee outside the wire. A manhunt has ensued even as the Taliban assert he is now with them in a \"safe place.\"\nIt's a strange sequence of events, given how brutally the Hazara were persecuted under a Pashtun-dominated former Taliban regime that massacred thousands. Today, Hazara Taliban are all but unheard of because of the history of bad blood and differences of orthodoxy: Hazaras are Shi'ite Muslims, considered heretics by the rigidly Sunni Taliban hard-liners. To explain the anomaly, General Ghulam Farook Parwani, the deputy corps commander for the ANA's southern forces, alleged that Hussein was a habitual hashish smoker \u0097 a widespread phenomenon within the ranks. Even if that's true, however, it hardly provides a clear motive for the deadly outburst.\nThis is not the first time Afghan security forces in Helmand have turned against their foreign partners. In November, five British soldiers were gunned down by an Afghan policeman they were training in Nad-e-Ali district. There were reports the policeman might have lashed out after being repeatedly insulted. But while these cases are isolated, they are sure to amplify existing anxieties felt by NATO military planners over the status of Afghan security forces, which are expected to shoulder greater responsibility when foreign troops eventually start to withdraw. The Afghan army is held in higher regard than the national police force, which is widely deplored as corrupt and erratic when put to the test. Still, billions in American taxpayer dollars appear to have yielded less-than-stellar results.\nThe Afghan forces' shortcomings were cast in sharp relief in February when U.S. Marines launched an offensive to clear the Taliban out of Marjah, the opium-poppy-trafficking area in central Helmand. Despite a game fighting spirit exhibited by many of the Afghan troops involved, U.S. officers grew more and more frustrated with the ANA's inability to follow complex orders and coordinate attacks against a determined foe.

The Postal Service paid $1.3 billion in benefits to employees injured on the job in 2013 -- a 35 percent increase from 2008 -- while it decreased its workforce by 26 percent in the same period. The agency maintains a $15.9 billion workers\u2019 compensation liability.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation costs have grown as USPS has fewer light-duty positions available for injured employees coming back to work, employs an older workforce and endured cost-of-living adjustments. The Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, originally enacted in 1916, has amplified these problems, according the IG. The auditors said the law prevents the Postal Service from adopting many of the best practice cost control measures used by state governments and private companies.\nThe IG said USPS would see significant savings if it were permitted to implement a time limit for benefits or a maximum total amount of compensation an employee injured on the job could collect. FECA places no restrictions on when benefits should cut off. More than 10,000 postal employees collecting FECA benefits are currently older than 55, nearly 2,000 are older than 70 and two employees are more than 100 years old.\nFederal employees hurt on the job now receive 66 2/3 percent of their basic salary tax-free, designed to approximately replicate their entire post-tax salary. That figure is bumped to 75 percent if the employee has dependents. Related medical expenses are also covered.\nA Senate committee has cleared a postal reform bill that includes a measure to overhaul FECA for all federal agencies. The new plan would trim the benefit to 50 percent of an employee\u2019s salary, once that employee is eligible for retirement. Additional compensation for dependents would no longer be provided. The IG said several states do not provide extra benefits for employees with dependents.\nThe Postal Service would also benefit if Congress lifted the prohibition on reaching a one-time settlement agreement with injured employees, rather than requiring periodic payments, the IG said. The payment would create closure for the workers, the IG said, and encourage them to return to work more quickly.\nAdditional reforms should include limiting physicians to those selected by the Postal Service, expanded use of vocational and rehabilitation programs, and a requirement to use generic drugs, the IG said. The auditors pointed to the private sector\u2019s loaning of recovering employees to charities and the maintenance of a database of light-duty jobs as examples of practices USPS should consider implementing.\nThe IG acknowledged it would be difficult to bring about any of the recommended changes, but called on postal management to lobby for change."}

He advanced the idea of introvert and extrovert personalities and the power of the unconscious.\nCarl Jung was born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland. Jung believed in the \u201ccomplex,\u201d or emotionally charged associations. He collaborated with Sigmund Freud, but disagreed with him about the sexual basis of neuroses. Jung founded analytical psychology, advancing the idea of introvert and extrovert personalities, archetypes and the power of the unconscious. Jung published numerous works during his lifetime, and his ideas have had reverberations traveling beyond the field of psychiatry, extending into art, literature and religion as well. He died in 1961.\nSwiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung was born July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland. The only son of a Protestant clergyman, Jung was a quiet, observant child who packed a certain loneliness in his single-child status. However, perhaps as a result of that isolation, he spent hours observing the roles of the adults around him, something that no doubt shaped his later career and work.\nJung&apos;s childhood was further influenced by the complexities of his parents. His father, Paul, developed a failing belief in the power of religion as he grew older. Jung&apos;s mother, Emilie, was haunted by mental illness and, when her boy was just three, left the family to live temporarily in a psychiatric hospital.\nAs was the case with his father and many other male relatives, it was expected that Jung would enter the clergy. Instead, Jung, who began reading philosophy extensively in his teens, bucked tradition and attended the University of Basel. There, he was exposed to numerous fields of study, including biology, paleontology, religion and archaeology, before finally settling on medicine.\nJung graduated the University of Basel in 1900 and obtained his M.D. two years later from the University of Zurich.\nWhile attending the University of Zurich, Jung worked on the staff at Burgholzli Asylum, where he came under the guidance of Eugene Bleuler, a pioneering psychologist who laid the groundwork for what is now considered classical studies of mental illness.\nAt the hospital, Jung observed how different words elicited emotional responses from patients, which he believed represented subconscious associations around immoral or sexual content. These observations led the way for Jung to develop the term \"complex\" to describe the conditions.\nJung&apos;s growing reputation as a psychologist and his work dealing with the subconscious eventually led him to the ideas of Sigmund Freud and, later, to the man himself.\nOver a five-year period beginning in 1907, the two men worked closely together, and Jung was widely believed to be the one who would continue the work of the elder Freud. However, viewpoints and temperament ended their collaboration and, eventually their friendship. In particular, Jung challenged Freud&apos;s beliefs around sexuality as the foundation of neurosis. He also disagreed with Freud&apos;s methods, asserting that the elder psychologist&apos;s work was too one-sided.\nThe final break came in 1912 when Jung published Psychology of the Unconscious. In it, Jung examined the unconscious mind and tried to understand the symbolic meaning of its contents. In the process, the work also took head-on a number of Freud&apos;s theories.\nBut breaking with Freud had consequences for Jung.

He picked up the ball and threw it high over Joe Mauer\u2019s head at first base, sailing it into the camera well.

It\u2019s money the South West Local Health Integration Network confirmed in April, executive director Alex Hector said in an interview.\nProvincial governments changed in June and the funding survived a review, he said.\nIt\u2019s for a satellite hospice of Residential Hospice Grey Bruce, which operates the eight-bed Chapman House and which will run a six-bed satellite hospice somewhere in southern Bruce County, Hector said.\nThough the initial plan was to renovate space for four beds in Hanover hospital by this coming April as a temporary hospice location, that was rejected. The money would be better spent on the permanent location, new-build or renovation, Hector said.\nHe estimated it would take about 36 months for a new hospice to open. They\u2019re very close to picking a location, he said.\nGovernment Services Minister Bill Walker, who represents Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound, and Education Minister Lisa Thompson, MPP for Huron-Bruce, attended the hospice to take questions and pose for pictures.\nThey praised the collaboration among a committee of people in Brockton, South Bruce and Hanover and with Residential Hospice Grey Bruce, and applauded the volunteer efforts to address a gap in hospice service in the southern parts of Grey-Bruce.\n\u201cPeople in health care don\u2019t really care about provincial boundaries, they don\u2019t really care about LHIN boundaries, they don\u2019t care about riding boundaries and they certainly don\u2019t care about municipal boundaries,\u201d Walker said.\nThompson said the hospice will help serve an area which includes Chesley, Mildmay, Teeswater (where she\u2019s from), and Lucknow.\nSatellite hospice committee member Maurice Donnelly thanked Thompson and Walker for confirming their government\u2019s commitment to the project, which will still rely heavily on ongoing donations to build and operate.\nHector said the funding includes $100,000 per bed in ongoing, annual operating funding to pay for nursing care. Operating costs including utilities and other support staff must be covered by fundraising.\nHospice revenues for fiscal year 2018-19 are forecast to come 48 per cent from public donations and 52 per cent from ministry funding.\nFunding announced Wednesday included $1.2-million in one-time funding \u2014 $200,000 per bed for six beds \u2013 toward capital costs. That capital funding wasn\u2019t available to Chapman House. That $5-million facility opened in 2017, much of it built thanks to generous contractors.\nHow much the satellite hospice will cost to build isn\u2019t know yet, Hector said. It will be smaller than Chapman House because administration offices in Owen Sound will serve the satellite hospice.\nIt will include a seventh, transitional room for incoming residents, just as Chapman House is funded for eight beds but it has a ninth room for resident transitions.\nHospice board chair Paul Rowcliffe noted Chapman House already serves all of Grey-Bruce.

Based in Denmark, Pandora was founded in 1982 and has annual sales of about $3.5 billion.

The junior who started 11 games last season remained on the field when the play ended as members of the team\u2019s training and medical staff attended to him a few steps from the sideline.\nAiken had to be helped off the field and to the bench while walking limp. Moments later, Coach Ken Niumatalolo came to the bench and stood beside Aiken as he received additional examination and had his knee iced and wrapped.\nIt was unclear how long Aiken would be out of the lineup, which is also without its other starting wide receiver, Brandon Turner. The senior is out until at least Aug. 20 after failing the academy\u2019s physical readiness test in July and a subsequent makeup test required to clear all Navy football players to practice.\nLast season Aiken was the second-leading receiver on Navy with 13 receptions for 201 yards and two touchdowns. He also returned 10 punts for 50 yards after taking over at that position midway through the season.\nWith Aiken watching most of the scrimmage from the sideline, Navy used a wide receiver rotation of senior John O\u2019Boyle and Jonathan Gazaille, and juniors Shawn Lynch and Casey Bolena on the first team.\nLynch began his college football career as a wide receiver but moved to safety last season before switching again this season. O\u2019Boyle, Gazaille and Bolena, meantime, have combined for five career receptions.\nAiken \u201cis one of our best players,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cHe\u2019s our starting wideout. He\u2019s our punt returner. He\u2019s worked hard. Hopefully it\u2019s not too bad. We\u2019ve got three weeks [until the season opener against Notre Dame in Dublin], and we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ve got to get a report\u201d from the team doctor.\nThere were some encouraging signs offensively despite Aiken\u2019s injury, most notably from the fullbacks. Sophomore starter Noah Copeland had a 53-yard run late in the scrimmage, and soon after senior backup Prentice Christian (DeMatha) scored on a 52-yard run, the most memorable play of the afternoon. Copeland ran for 68 yards on seven carries, and Christian had 110 on 10.\nCopeland secured the starting job after standing out in spring practice, and he got limited work on Saturday so the coaching staff could evaluate reserves, including sophomores Quinton Singleton and Maika Polamalu.\nOther significant positional decisions to be addressed are backup quarterback and place kicker, where Niumatalolo had five players attempt field goals on Saturday. None made a strong case to become the clear No. 1, although junior Brynmor Hughes was the only one to make a kick when all tried from 47 yards.\nHughes, junior Stephen Picchini and freshmen David Reisner, Nick Sloan and Austin Grebe (North Stafford) combined to go 4 for 15 from 31 yards and beyond.\nFreshman Keenan Reynolds and sophomore John Hendrick are competing at backup quarterback, but Jasper indicated neither has separated himself behind starter Trey Miller."}

Andrew Odland and the Afghan police officer were standing just inches apart, looking in the same direction. But what they were seeing was completely different.\nDavid Axe spent six weeks in Afghanistan, on the war's dangerous and largely forgotten eastern front.\nA brief, contentious patrol in eastern Afghanistan's Baraki Barak district on March 27 highlighted an important technological gap between U.S. forces and their Afghan partners that will only grow more noticeable as the Americans hand off responsibility to Afghan troops.\nThe major difference between Odland's vision and the Afghan officer's that chilly night in Baraki Barak, a key agricultural district 50 miles south of Kabul, was a 13.5-ounce device mounted to the American sergeant's helmet and those of his platoon.\nThe PVS-14 night observation device \u2013 or \"nods,\" as soldiers call it \u2013 translates invisible light waves from across the spectrum to a single, visible wavelength. In other words, it sees in the dark, casting even the inkiest night into a palette of greens.\nWith a barrage of 1,300 improvised explosive devices per month, Afghan insurgents have managed to impede coalition operations practically to the point of stalemate.\nBut insurgents prefer daylight, mostly leaving the night to tech-savvy U.S. forces. Afghans are \"solar-powered,\" U.S. Army Capt. Paul Shepard explained, half-jokingly.\nNods and other sensors mean the Americans own the night. And as long as they patrol under the direction of U.S. troops, Afghan forces at least \"rent\" the advantage of darkness.\nBut as the low-tech Afghan soldiers and police begin the slow process of taking over responsibility for security starting this summer, they'll do so with serious limitations compared to the Americans and other foreign troops they'll lead during the transition period.\nThe fallout from this sort of mismatch was evident in Baraki Barak that night.\nThe patrol got off on the wrong foot and never corrected its step. As planned, Odland's platoon showed up at the Afghan police station attached to the district's main U.S. Army outpost, just after nightfall. But the local Afghan cops slated to join the Americans were nowhere to be found.\nIt took some serious cajoling on Odland's part to roust a squad of policemen from the warmth and light of their shacks. They stumbled into the dark with little but their windbreakers and AK-47s. Some weren't even wearing body armor.\nThough Afghan troops often travel light, on this night, the contrast with the decked-out Americans was particularly stark. Because they could see in the dark, Odland's soldiers didn't worry about being perfectly quiet. Even if the bad guys heard them coming, they'd never see them coming \u2013 and the Americans would see everything with perfect clarity.\nSo, the U.S. troops brought along a small but noisy John Deere six-wheeler to haul extra equipment.\nLike his men, the leader of the Afghan cops \u2013 a wiry, bearded officer \u2013 had nothing but his natural night vision to help him navigate the streets of Baraki Barak, growing darker by the second as the glow from solar-powered street lamps faded to a dull crimson. To his limited senses, the growl of the John Deere's motor was like a beacon announcing the patrol's presence to the town's Taliban fighters. The officer was irritated from"}

Qualcomm has tuned DSPs in its upcoming Snapdragon 835 to process speech or images at higher speeds, so A.I. tasks are carried out faster.\nGoogle has an ambitious plan to apply machine learning through its entire business. The Google Assistant -- which is also in Android Wear 2.0 -- is a visible A.I. across smartphones, TVs, and other consumer devices. The search company has TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning framework, and has its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit."}

Even back to his days on NBC's Saturday Night Live we all went nuts for the guy. That's why it's so surprising to learn he apparently had a terrible audition for the late night sketch comedy show. Read on to see what Ferrell had to say about his self-proclaimed moment of failure.\nWhen I had to audition, I had no idea that Darrell Hammond was simultaneously auditioning. One of the most talented impressionists who will go down in history of that show. I thought they had to have someone do Bill Clinton. So I did Bill Clinton doing an ad for a Snickers bar. It was, \"Hi, I'm Bill Clinton!\" It was just a gravely voice. Awful. It was terrible.\nNot only is it interesting to learn Ferrell wiffed during his SNL audition, it's also quite funny to hear it was a Bill Clinton impression that (in his mind) was to blame\u2014due to the fact he later came to embody George W. Bush in an ongoing impression that was nothing short of brilliant. It's also cool to hear Ferrell give a shout out to Hammond in his interview with HuffPo, as all of us who watched SNL during those days knows he gave a spot-on rendition of Clinton. With the amount of experience Hammond has built up embodying the former president, I'm pretty sure his impression would be pretty difficult to beat... even by someone as hilarious and talented as Ferrell. Regardless, Ferrell's impression discussed above (different from the footage that is available) would certainly be worth checking out.\nSaturday Night Live has been instrumental in bridging the gap between comedy and politics. Over the years, there have been a number of top-tier impressions brought to the screen by SNL vets. Some of the more notable renditions that come to mind are Dan Aykroyd as Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, Chevy Chase as Gerald Ford, Phil Hartman as Ronald Reagan, Dana Carvey as George H.W. Bush, Fred Armisen and Jay Pharoah as Barack Obama and of course Ferrell as Bush Jr. and Hammond as Clinton. While Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani never held office, Amy Pohler, Tina Fey and Taran Killam all, respectively, offered up hilarious and noteworthy impressions of the three political figures. Here's a great moment, thanks to Funny Or Die, that brought many of the above-mentioned actors together onscreen in a hilarious presidential mashup.\nWill Ferrell and co-star Kevin Hart, who recently delivered an epic lip sync battle with Jimmy Fallon, can be seen together in their upcoming movie Get Hard, which hits theaters March 27, 2015."}

Online, our chuckles are, more than anything else, affirmations. They are acknowledgements of the hilarity of our conversation partners. And they can, in that, be incredibly nuanced. Earlier this year, Buzzfeed published a tongue-in-cheek list: a guide to the 42 ways to laugh online.\nPart of this variety comes from that fact that our representations of laugher evolved from the descriptive\u2014LOL, LMAO, ROFL\u2014to the more immediate. Now, instead of simply informing our conversation partners that we are laughing, we represent that laughter directory, with hahas and hehes and hehs (and also hahahahas and BWAAAAAhahahas and all the rest).

Lel (and variations including lal) resulted from the use of random vowels substituted in place of the 'o' in LOL. These vowels were used in an attempt to be different...

Tolkien\u2019s early works\u2014\u201cThe Silmarillion\u201d and \u201cThe Children of H\u00farin,\u201d published only after his death\u2014are devoid of Hobbits and humors and pipe-smoking wizards; they really are like Ossian, and as dull as dishwater in consequence. Even if, as Johnson thought, a child could have written Ossian, children were never meant to read it. There\u2019s no bright foreground to the story.\nTo see the road not taken, one need only think of that parallel fantasy masterpiece, written in exactly the same decades, and on a similar scale, by a similarly eccentric Englishman: T. H. White\u2019s four-volume retelling of the story of King Arthur and his court, \u201cThe Once and Future King.\u201d White, too, modernizes and sweetens his epic story, but he more overtly moralizes it, and he makes it emotionally ambiguous as well: What is right? Who gets to decide? Does duty come before passion? White worries about ambiguity and halftones: the impotence of the idealist King; the beauty and doom of the adulterous lovers; the capacity of good law to make bad judgments\u2014it is Arthur, not Mordred, who has to sentence Guenevere to death. Where White\u2019s literary task was to study the fate of epic ideals in a recognizably real world, Tolkien\u2019s was to find a way to create the illusion of the real world in an idealized epic one. But though \u201cThe Once and Future King\u201d inspired the musical \u201cCamelot,\u201d our new Arthurian romances are likely to be given a Tolkienesque treatment, focussing on clashes between armies, not within souls.\nIf Tolkien was, as Ricks insists, in any sense our Ossian, then perhaps Christopher Paolini is our Chatterton\u2014the early Romantics\u2019 \u201cmarvellous boy,\u201d who, inspired by Ossian, made up his own set of pseudo-medieval poems, attributing them to a poet named Rowley, and claiming that his father found them in a chest.

At the same time, it still ran a parallel system which had been in place since decades. Today, many EU laws have been transposed into Maltese law and have become integrated into business and civic life.\nBut whilst that transition was taking place, it fell into a kind of law of convenience, to decide on whether the new regulations would apply or the old ones. There was an overlap and some decisions were left to the discretion of the agency involved, or so it seemed.\nThe same is happening today, where health, safety and security in Malta and Gozo is concerned. On the one hand, we have the tolerance to immigration on large scale and the complications, benefits and changes that this brings with it and on the other hand, we have a parochial mentality, still adjusting to more congested urban and cosmopolitan landscapes, presenting all their challenges. The conflict needs to be made clear urgently and the necessary measures, law enforcement and criminal agencies put in place before we face complete decay.\nThe areas currently under the spot-light of safety and security are so many that a Board should immediately be set up to come up with the right response and action plan and method to implement it and fund it and bring it in line with modern realities. Demographics need to be studied in detail and sustainability of each town to provide the right conditions for the safety of citizens should be the subject of indepth study.\nCouncils are just like a thin film of fat over a cold soup.

There is even the telephone number of the owner printed over the side of the van.\nWe know we have a very high number of different nationalities that have come to Malta, all trying to find affordable living or bringing their special talents with them and finding a hospitable environment for their varied activities. This is more than a reality. It is transcending the norm in the way that only Malta can afford to those intent on developing their illicit business and market here.\nA symbol of the ineptitude and decline around us is that omnipresent graffiti scribbling on the walls and buildings, everywhere, all over the island, in even the most inaccessible spots.

But I digress.\nHOOPSWORLD has learned that there have been preliminary discussions between the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets that would involve sending Andrew Bynum to the Rockets, Howard to the Lakers and a number of first-round picks, prospects and significant cap relief to the Magic.\nThe benefits of this trade for all involved are obvious.\nOrlando management, who is wary of bringing in Bynum because they\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll leave them a la Dwight in a year, would get the security and comfort that comes with picks and cap relief.\nHouston management, who has long desired to bring in a quality big man, would get Bynum (who reportedly wouldn\u2019t be averse to signing an extension with them).\nAnd L.A. management, who is confident that they could get Dwight to re-up despite his hesitation right now, would get a legitimate, real superstar who could give Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash their best possible shot at winning a championship next year.\nThe one lingering question when folks read over that proposal, however, was why the Rockets would go for Bynum. Sure, it sort of makes sense if he publicly agreed to sign an extension with Houston upon arrival \u2013 but he won\u2019t do that. No matter whether he stays with the Lakers or goes elsewhere, he\u2019s going wait until he can maximize his money before inking any sort of deal. So, really, the Rockets would face the same sort of uncertainty bringing in Bynum that they would face if they just rolled the dice on Howard himself.\nSources told ESPN.com that the Rockets are discussing a multitude of trade scenarios with the Magic, offering to serve both as the team that would acquire Howard in a direct trade between the clubs and also as a third team that would participate in a trade that lands Howard with the Lakers and brings All-Star center Andrew Bynum to Houston.\nThe fact of the matter is, if the Rockets are going to gamble on a rental \u2013 it makes far more sense to do so on Howard than on Bynum. This was true from the very beginning, and it remains just as true now.\nBarring an agreement from Bynum to re-up immediately (which won\u2019t happen), it just doesn\u2019t make sense for Houston to help create a monster in L.A. -- all the while taking a huge gamble on an injury-prone, relatively unproven big man coming off his first All-Star starting gig -- when they could just do a direct trade with Orlando.\nThe Lakers need Houston in this deal; Houston doesn&apos;t need the Lakers.\nThis is a very fluid situation.

{"idx": "32266", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Here's how to solve tech problems without breaking a sweat or hurting feelings.\nThere are two types of tech support professionals. There's the one who, responding to a call for help, brusquely shoves the individual aside, fixes the issue, then leaves without saying a word. Or there's the type who takes time and understands that computers are something the client simply doesn't get.\nIf you're new to tech support work -- even just for friends and family -- you'll probably start out as the latter but turn into the former after just a few weeks. However, here are some tips for avoiding conflict and perhaps being a little more human when dealing with problems.\nThe best way of avoiding clashing with clients while fixing their computer is to get rid of them -- not in a Dexter-like way, but by suggesting they do something else and therefore don't watch what you're doing. It's doubtful that a garage mechanic could work efficiently if you stood over his shoulder and asked him what he was doing, and it's no different for tech support staff.\nFew people need an excuse to take a break so it's doubtful you'll meet with any resistance. When they come back, be sure to tell them what the issue was. If you have to leave a note because they disappear for a long time, be sure to add your phone number and/or email address so they can get in contact should they have any questions. It's unlikely they'll need to but that personal touch can make all the difference.\nI once worked in tech support and drove 100 miles to a client who claimed the sound system on his computer had blown up. He edited videos professionally so couldn't work until I'd fixed it. When I got there, I found he had somehow muted his volume control. The red X covered the speaker icon in his system tray and was as obvious as daylight, yet he hadn't spotted it.\nWhat did I do: Hit him over the head for being so stupid? Suggest he plant some trees to make up for the carbon footprint I'd run up rushing to his premises?\nOf course not. Without admitting responsibility (of course), I consoled him on the fact his computer had effectively been broken for a few days. Then I took five minutes to explain the audio control panel. I'm not sure he understood, but it certainly made me feel it was less of a wasted journey.\nMeatier computer problems provide more of a challenge to tech support staff, but every problem has the same impact for the client.\nTech support people not only know a lot about computers, but also tend to be highly intelligent people. These are qualities not commonly found in the general population. Therefore, when fixing a computer with somebody who wants to know what you're doing, it can be easy to leave him or her behind in the rush to get the problem sorted out. They will undoubtedly feel frustration as you race through the explanation of the technical settings you're adjusting.\nThe solution is to slow down. It might feel as if the job is taking longer than it should but in reality it'll only be a few minutes. Should something complicated arise that's too difficult to explain, say that you're about to do something that only needs to be done once and they need not pay attention.\nThe average office worker spends maybe six or seven hours a day caressing their computer. It's one of the hugely personal objects in their lives. They don't care about it as much as they care about their pet dog, but there's still a bond. Home PCs are even more personally regarded.\nWhen you leap in and rough up their workspace in order to quickly"}

In point of fact, I testified at several hearings that sought to understand the challenges that the creation of the DHS created for the effective enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws.\nIn my testimony I clearly articulated my concerns about the myriad issues created when the DHS was established and the former INS was dismantled.\nThe first two Subcommittee hearings of the year examined in detail how the immigration enforcement agencies have inadequate resources and too few personnel to carry out their mission. The witnesses mentioned the lack of uniforms, badges, detention space, and the inevitable low morale of frontline agents who are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of incoming illegal aliens. If this were not enough, these ''immigration enforcement'' agencies also face internal confusion resulting from dual or multiple missions in which immigration has all too often taken a back seat. Sadly, contrary to Congress' expectations, immigration enforcement has not been the primary focus of either of these agencies, and that is the subject of today's hearing.\nThe Homeland Security Act, enacted in November 2002, split the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, into separate immigration service and enforcement agencies, both within the Department of Homeland Security. This split had been pursued by Chairman Sensenbrenner based on testimony and evidence that the dual missions of INS had resulted in poor performance.\nThere was a constant tug-of-war between providing good service to law-abiding aliens and enforcing the law against law-breakers. The plain language of the Homeland Security Act, Title D, creates a ''Bureau of Border Security,'' and specifically transfers all immigration enforcement functions of INS into it. Yet when it came down to actually creating the two: new agencies, the Administration veered off course. Although the service functions of INS were transferred to USCIS, the enforcement side of INS was split in two, what is now Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to handle interior enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to guard our borders.\nICE was given all Customs agents, investigators, intelligence and analysis-from the Treasury Department, as well as the Federal Protective Service to guard Federal buildings, and the Federal Air Marshals to protect our airplanes, and finally the INS investigators.\nCBP was given all Treasury Customs inspectors at the ports-of-entry, Agriculture Inspector from the Department Of Agriculture, and INS inspectors.\nAt no time during the reorganization planning was it anticipated by the Committee that an immigration enforcement agency would share its role with other enforcement functions, such as enforcement of our customs laws. This simply results in the creation of dual or multiple missions that the act sought to avoid in the first place.\nFailure to adhere to the statutory framework established by HSA has produced immigration enforcement incoherence that undermines the immigration enforcement mission central to DHS"}

Social platforms, he argued, should give users the option to not publicly show their follower count or the level of engagement \u2014 likes, retweets, faves \u2014 on their content.\nAre there merits to metrics? Sure. Of course. Follower and like counts can help approximate credibility: The accounts that many Twitter users deem worth following are more likely to be credible. But there are many exceptions to that rule \u2014 super-viral accounts with millions of followers and crap content. And most of us aren\u2019t boasting follower counts in the millions and retweet counts in the hundreds of thousands anyway. Instead, we play a calculation game, tweeting for our small audiences and watching \u2014 and hoping \u2014 our various numbers go up. And when you really stop to think about that \u2026 it\u2019s a weird, potentially damaging, way to live.\nLast year, Facebook\u2019s founding president, Sean Parker, talked about building the platform in the early days to be a \u201ca social-validation feedback loop \u2026 exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology\u201d engineered to \u201cconsume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible.\u201d He noted that Instagram\u2019s Kevin Systrom employed that strategy in building that platform. Twitter, while not mentioned by Parker, clearly operates on a similar system.\nthis is lovely. Ben from Snapchat text my wife this.\nSnapchat\u2019s struggles to keep users engaged have been well-documented, so it\u2019s entirely possible, and very likely, that this model, freeing as it might be, just isn\u2019t sustainable. Plus, I\u2019m not going to wall myself off in a metricless tower if everybody else I\u2019m interacting with isn\u2019t up there with me. Still \u2026 it\u2019s nice to imagine a world where we all don\u2019t have them. (At the very least, it offers a bit of a reality check about what fuels our online sharing behaviors.) Where you post a tweet purely because you thought you had something funny to say. Or share an article because you were genuinely interested in the content and not just what kind of person sharing that particular article labels you as. Or Instagram a picture purely because it was a photo that brought you joy. Maybe a friend tells you IRL they liked your photo. Maybe they don\u2019t. And you don\u2019t care one way or the other.\nThank you for reading.

The local film festival that merges film with the arts, put on by the Houston Cinema Arts Society, offers up a host of selections this year, each representing a genre of art (see a theme here?).\nInterested in a movie about opera? Maria by Callas, the new documentary on opera-singing great Maria Callas, will screen at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston on Saturday, November 10. Are you bookish about authors? The fest will screen Lethem, a documentary on acclaimed author Jonathan Lethem, at MFAH on Sunday, November 11. Lethem himself will be there, as he'll also be in town to read from his latest book, The Feral Detective, at Cullen Performance Hall on Monday, November 12. Are you feeling peckish for a film on culinary arts? Look for Chef Flynn, a doc on teenage chef Flynn McGarry, at Rice Media Center on Friday, November 9.\nBut this festival isn't just made up of docs on fascinating artists. Many artists will be around taking part in several, fascinating events. Things kick off Thursday, November 8 at noon at Rice Media Center with Queerskins: a love story, a virtual reality experience from Illya Szilak and Cyril Tsiboulski which positions visitors, wearing Oculus headsets, in the backseat of a car where two grieving parents take them on a journey of their son's life.\nAcademy Award-nominated, Houston-born filmmaker Richard Linklater, who kicked off the first HCAF with a screening of his film Me and Orson Welles, will discuss the music of his films Dazed and Confused and Everybody Wants Some! with rapper Bun B at White Oak Music Hall on Friday, November 9. Alex Cox, the British filmmaker behind the cult films Repo Man and Sid and Nancy, will introduce the late Dennis Hopper's long-lost, 1971 film The Last Movie at Rice Media Center on Monday. Composer/musicians Donald Sosin and Alicia Svigals will provide the music for a screening of the 1923 silent film The Ancient Law (Das Alte Gesetz) on Sunday, November 11.\nThe fest will end on Monday night at the Aurora Picture Show, where returning, experimental-film artists Brent Green and Vanessa Renwick will do some audio-visual wizardry with their films.\nHCAF will also show some highly anticipated films from visionary filmmakers that may possibly get some Oscar nods soon, including Steve McQueen's Widows, Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, and UH graduate Julian Schnabel's At Eternity's Gate.\nBut this festival is also a bittersweet one, as this will be the final one for longtime artistic director Richard Herskowitz. He will step down to focus on continuing his work as executive and artistic director of the Ashland Independent Film Festival in Oregon, where he also lives.\nWhile he has fond memories of bringing people like Robert Redford, Tilda Swinton, and even '90s hip hop duo Kid 'N Play (who showed up one year for a screening of House Party) to the HCAF, he's most proud of how the festival has became a yearly compendium of ambitious, experimental filmmaking, with various venues and organizations gladly coming onboard to help showcase the visual artistry.\n\"These are people who are like"}

Mr. Simonson testified that he had been criticized as being too lenient in sentencing two black men for assaulting white woman.\nMr. Franklin, in his closing arguments, denied that he killed the couple or that he was in Wisconsin at the time of the slayings.\nHe previously said he lied in the confession to get out of a Federal prison in Illinois and into Wisconsin.\n''I did not kill Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwenn,'' he said. ''I did not come to Wisconsin to kill Judge Archie Simonson.'' He said he was not in Wisconsin at the time of the incident.\nA life sentence is ''the next best thing to being dead,'' Mr. Franklin told the jurors.

{"idx": "32277", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In this interview, the Chinese dissident discusses human rights, Internet censorship, and what the international community can do to help individual freedom in China.\nOSLO, Norway -- Chinese leader Xi Jinping has coined a new slogan, urging the country's increasingly wealthy population to pursue \"the Chinese dream.\" But many dissidents there see the country's free-speech situation as more of a nightmare.\nChinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng believes the situation for activists in China has only worsened since Xi has taken charge. Speaking with reporters on Monday at the Oslo Freedom Forum in Norway, he said international governments should step up pressure on Chinese leaders if they hope to encourage true change in China.\nA blind, self-taught lawyer, Chen made international headlines last year when he escaped from years of house arrest and sought asylum in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Since then, his family has been targeted through what appear to be revenge attacks. Meanwhile, Chen has continued his fight for openness and justice in China from his new home in the U.S., where he is a visiting scholar at New York University School of Law and is authoring a memoir scheduled for release this fall.\nI understand your family is still being harassed -- how does that affect your work?\nThe persecution has never stopped. They punctured the tires of [family members'] cars. They've thrown bricks and rocks through their windows. My nephew was put in jail. The phone line was cut at my mothers' house. Perhaps the reason is that this is the one-year anniversary since I escaped from China. Perhaps people went crazy over this. I think they also see that I'm making a lot of talks, I say things they hate to hear.\nIt does not affect me. It strengthens my will to disclose the very evil and authoritarian nature of the Chinese regime. It makes me more determined to fight for human rights.\nHow should other countries react toward countries like China to strengthen the fight of activists like yourself?\nI think international society should make it clear their attitude and abide by their principles to support human rights in China and not to cave in because of the economic benefits of doing business in China. China is now in the process of transformation, and it is just beginning. Those in power in China understand that, and some of the people in China at the grassroots level know this too. However, it remains very much unknown to the international society. I think they should also approach civil society groups in China and walk side-by-side with them.\nCan you be just as effective an activist outside of China as inside?\nI'm probably more effective outside of China, but the nature of the work here is different. There is work needed to be done inside of China, but also work that needs to be done outside of China -- such as promoting civil rights, democracy, and justice.\nDo you think that the change in leadership has caused any increased openness in China?\nDefinitely not. I think it's actually going backward. For example, the government recently announced the \"7 no\" policy -- seven topics that aren't supposed to be mentioned by schools or party committees.\nWhat are some the advantages -- and limitations -- of Weibo and other online platforms for increasing conversation among dissidents in China?\nIt's a very common platform accessed by all -- it is very fast paced and has a lot of agility. Even though there are a lot of people censoring it, a lot of the information they want to censor has already been forwarded among the netizens. They can never get full control of the information.\nOf course, there are some limitations. For example, the"}
{"idx": "32278", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Tuesday evening, Finavera Wind Energy (TSXV:FVR, OTC:FNVRF) announced the ratification of the sale of its Tumbler Ridge and Meikle wind energy projects to Pattern Energy with 99.63% of votes cast in favor (a 2/3 majority was needed).\nThe result should have surprised no one, given that the sale was essential to Finavera's liquidity and ability to fund its operations. After shareholder, stock exchange, and regulatory approval, Pattern will forgive C$9.3 million of Finavera's debt. Shareholder approval is now complete, exchange approval is expected this week, and regulatory approval should be complete by early September. (See below.) Pattern is also providing a credit facility which will allow Finavera to continue its operations.\nThe company's board of directors was also approved, although not with the same 99%+ of the votes. Roughly a quarter of the votes for Finavera's four directors were withheld. According to Finavera's CEO Jason Bak in an interview, a large block of the votes withheld from the directors were because one larger shareholder and creditor, Sprott Power Corp. (TSX:SPZ, OTC:STWPF) was registering its disapproval that it was not going to have a $900K loan repaid sooner. That loan and Sprott's 2 million share stake in Finavera arose last year, when Sprott was considering doing a deal with Finavera, but instead ended up buying assets from Shear Wind, Inc..\nGoing forward, there are a number of milestones needed to complete the Pattern transaction and to realize the value of Finavera's stake in the Cloosh Wind Project in Ireland. If both are completed, most likely in mid to late 2014, I calculate that Finavera will have between 32 and 44 cents of net cash on hand. Bak promises a shareholder vote as to the use of this cash: should it be returned to shareholders as a dividend, or used to invest a new opportunity. The timing of the vote will depend on when Finavera is able to present shareholders with a specific investment opportunity, and will likely precede the completion of the Pattern asset sale.\nNext day or two: Approval of the purchase by the Toronto Venture Exchange. This should be completed in the next day or so.\nJuly: Finavera will submit Miekle into the environmental review process. Tumbler Ridge already has all necessary approvals.\nLate August/ Early September: Approval by BC Hydro. BC Hydro needs to update the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Miekle and Tumbler Ridge projects to reflect the new owner. With the business-friendly Liberals returned to power in British Columbia, Bak expects this process to go smoothly. The defeated NDP had favored the utility to develop its own projects, rather than buying power from independent producers like Pattern. At this point, Pattern will pay Finavera C$9.3 million which the latter will use to repay a similar amount of debt to Pattern. For simplicity, I've also been referring to this as loan forgiveness.\nH2 2013: Shareholder vote on use of net proceeds from Cloosh and Pattern transaction. Dividend or pursue a new opportunities? If the vote is to pursue new opportunities, the goal will be to build Finavera's assets and eventually qualify for listing on a much more liquid exchange than the Toronto Venture.\nQ4 2013"}

It&apos;s a generational change much like the NBA undertook when Adam Silver, then 51, replaced 71-year-old David Stern as commissioner in February. And like Silver, Manfred was his boss&apos;s pick.\nManfred beat out Boston Red Sox Chairman Tom Werner in the first contested vote for a new commissioner in 46 years. The third candidate, MLB Executive Vice President of Business Tim Brosnan, withdrew just before the start of balloting.\nSelig has led baseball since September 1992, first as chairman of the sport&apos;s executive council following Fay Vincent&apos;s forced resignation and as commissioner since July 1998. After announcing his intention to retire many times only to change his mind, he said last September that he really, truly planned to depart in January 2015.\nOne baseball executive who attended the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the 4 1/2-hour session were not to be divulged, said Manfred was elected on approximately the sixth ballot. The initial vote was 20-10 for Manfred, three short of the required three-quarters majority.\nHis total increased to 21 on the second and 22 on the third. While teams put written ballots into envelopes, keeping their choices secret, from team official speeches it was evident that Tampa Bay&apos;s Stuart Sternberg and Milwaukee&apos;s Mark Attanasio likely switched, the person said.\nManfred&apos;s total dropped to 20, then increased back to 22 before a dinner break. He got the needed 23rd vote on the next, apparently from Washington. Owners then made the final vote unanimous. The person said it appeared Arizona, Boston, the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati, the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland and Toronto had been the final holdouts.\n\"What I said to the owners when I came down after the vote is that I didn&apos;t really want to even think about who was on what side of what issue at points in the process,\" Manfred said, \"and that my commitment to the owners was that I would work extremely hard day in and day out to convince all 30 of them that they had made a great decision today.\"\nWhite Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Toronto president Paul Beeston spoke out strongly against Manfred, the person said. Angels owner Arte Moreno joined Reinsdorf in leading Werner&apos;s support.\n\"While Rob may not have been my initial choice for commissioner, the conclusion of a very good process was to name Rob as the person best positioned to help baseball endure and grow even stronger for the next generation of fans,\" Reinsdorf said in a statement. \"Today&apos;s decision was reached by 30 owners voting separately but speaking, in the end, with one voice.\"\nWerner, who made his career as a television executive, was preferred by those who wanted an owner to follow"}

Now, it's being used online.\nFederal prosecutors have secured an unusually stiff sentence against a low-level identity thief by invoking the same law used to target bosses of the Gambino crime family and Los Angeles street gangs.\nOn Thursday, David Ray Camez, 22, was sentenced to serve 20 years in prison and pay $20 million in restitution for his participation in carder.su, a website that allowed people to collaborate on crimes involving identity theft, computer malware, and other types of online graft. He was already serving a seven-year sentence for the same acts when he and 38 others were charged in a 2012 indictment. The indictment alleged violations of the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which allows for harsh criminal and civil penalties for acts that are part of an ongoing criminal enterprise.\nUnder RICO, it didn't matter that Camez's conduct was an infinitesimal small part of the illegal acts carried out on carder.su; or that he was just 17 or 18-years-old when he was caught purchasing or possessing counterfeit drivers licenses, credit and gift cards, and equipment for manufacturing counterfeit cards. During sentencing, prosecutors provided evidence establishing the site, with an estimated 5,500 members as of 2011, was responsible for losses totaling $50 million. Feds also established that carder.su was a criminal enterprise engaged in large-scale trafficking of compromised credit cards and identities. The showings were some of the many factors under RICO that allowed for increased penalties for Camez, who went by the online aliases \"Bad Man\" and \"doctorsex.\"\nFor years, carder.su had been one of the more brazen examples of the lawlessness and impunity that remain the norm for some heavily populated corners of the Internet. Hosted in the former Soviet Union, it was frequented by \"carders\" who traffic compromised payment cards and counterfeit identifications and people who engage in money laundering, narcotics trafficking, and malware-based crime. Among other things, carder.su operated a forum that allowed members to buy and sell illicitly obtained data and share tips of their trade. A second forum allowed trusted members to vet the reliability and trustworthiness of newcomers. Account holders played various roles, including moderators, reviewers, vendors, and general members.\nThe site was shut down in 2012. Last month, key carder.su member Cameron Harrison agreed to plead guilty to federal racketeering charges. He will face similarly stiff penalties when he is sentenced in the same Nevada federal court as Camez. In all, 55 defendants in four different indictments have been charged with offenses associated with carder.su. Prosecutors have already secured 14 guilty pleas, and at least two defendants are schedule for trial in June. If the Camez sentence is any indication, they can expect to spend years in prison and the rest of their remaining days devoting a sizable portion of their livelihoods to paying restitution.\nSo this guy gets 20 years and a 20 million fine against him, yet the banks that bilked billions from the public and caused the world wide recession gets...nadda.\nAs punishment, HSBC was assessed a fine of 1.9 billion \u2014 about four weeks\u2019 worth of its pre-tax profits"}

For example, Cohen noted that in 2003-2004, the government spent $587 million on fire suppression to protect structures, \u201cwhich was more than the structures were worth.\u201d The logic of that approach was not left hanging.\nCohen works out of Missoula, Mont., at the USFS Fire Sciences lab. He helped write an extensive report after the 1999 blowdown in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for the U.S. Forest Service.\nMuch of Cohen\u2019s work is on \u201chome ignitability.\u201d Fire management has focused on controlling the blaze, rather than the compatibility of the structures to fire, he said. Fire-resistant building materials are one example of compatibility.\nCohen and Pyne, who is a professor at Arizona State, agree on the danger of cedar roofing shingles, which are now relatively uncommon in Minnesota but still in regular use in the West.\nOne factor that stands out in wildland-urban-interface fire research is how often a home is set ablaze not by wooden shingles but by a stray broom under the deck, dry pine needles in the gutter, or plastic patio furniture cushions catching fire. \u201cA home commonly burns after the main fire has passed by,\u201d Cohen said.\nCohen promotes a prevention idea called the \u201chome ignition zone.\u201d He wants homeowners who live in wildfire-prone areas to carefully tend a 100-foot circle around their dwellings. This does not mean stripping all the vegetation down to the dirt and raking it like a baseball infield. But spaces in the coniferous canopy near a building will slow or divert a crown fire; brush, grasses, dead juniper, cedar and other dry vegetation should be kept away from a structure. \u201cRake the needles off the deck and from around the house,\u201d he said.\nAnd he hates balsam fir, America\u2019s favorite Christmas tree but one that \u201cburns like mad.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of balsam fir in northern Minnesota, he said, much of it planted by cabin owners too close to their dwellings. Aspen and birch have more fire resistance.\nA sprinkler system often works, he said, but someone needs to be there to turn it on.\nWhich brought us to the issue of mandatory evacuation. Cohen and Pyne have strong feelings about that, too. \u201cI can defend my house with a bazooka and an M-16, but not a garden hose and a rake?\u201d Pyne asked.\nOne idea, now being tested in Australia, is called fighting the fire from the inside out.

The general trend in midterm elections is that voters\u2019 decisions, for both the House and the Senate, increasingly correspond with their attitudes about the president. But the 2018 results raised that long-term trajectory to a new peak.\nIn the midterms of 2006, 2010, and 2014, between 84 and 87 percent of voters who approved of the president\u2019s job performance voted for his party\u2019s candidate in their local House race, according to exit polls. Last week, 88 percent of Trump approvers said they backed Republicans for the House, according to results from the Edison Research exit poll, which was conducted for the National Election Pool and published on the CNN website.\nLikewise, in those previous three midterm exit polls, between 82 and 84 percent of voters who disapproved of the president voted against his party\u2019s candidates for the House. But on Tuesday, that number soared: Fully 90 percent of Trump disapprovers said they voted for Democrats for the lower chamber. That was the worst performance for the president\u2019s party among disapproving voters since Ronald Reagan in 1982.\nRead: Trump is about to get a rude awakening.\nPolitical strategists in both parties generally consider it easier for senators to establish an independent identity from the president. But attitudes about Trump were a powerful force in those races, too. Exit polls were conducted for 21 Senate contests in which a Republican faced a Democrat. Democrats won at least 90 percent of voters who disapproved of Trump in 15 of those 21 contests, and up to 89 percent in five more. Scandal-tarred New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez was the only Democratic candidate to win a smaller share of voters who disapproved of Trump, at 79 percent.\nMeanwhile, Republicans carried at least 90 percent of Trump approvers in seven of the 21 Senate races, and between 80 and 89 percent in 13 others. Joe Manchin in West Virginia was the only Democrat to hold his Republican opponent to less than 80 percent of Trump supporters.\nThe power of these relationships shaped the outcome in both chambers. In total, the tightened connection between votes for Congress and attitudes about Trump was a negative for Republicans because significantly more voters disapproved of him (54 percent) than approved (45 percent) in the national House exit poll.\nThat support also powered the Republican Senate victories in the preponderantly white and blue-collar heartland states of Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. Huge margins among working-class whites also keyed the apparent GOP wins in the Florida and Georgia governor\u2019s races, and in Florida\u2019s close Senate race. The biggest exceptions to this pattern were two folksy Democrats, Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana, and the populist Sherrod Brown in Ohio, who each won in predominantly blue-collar states where a majority of voters said they approved of Trump\u2019s performance.\nOn the other side of the ledger, almost exactly three-fifths of whites with a four-year-college degree or more disapproved of Trump, as did just over 70 percent of nonwhites.

Certain trophies, in accordance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), will be considered \"on a case-by-case basis,\" according to a March 1 document that was released, but not publicized, by the Interior Department.\nBut the guidelines for such a case-by-case judgment aren't specified in the document. In 2014, President Obama banned the import of sport-hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe. However, in November 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it would begin issuing permits for these previously banned trophies. Soon after the announcement, President Trump said he would \"Put big game trophy decision on hold\" in a tweet.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke responded with a tweet that said that both he and President Trump believe \"conservation & healthy herds are critical.\"\nAt the time, Mr. Trump also publicly expressed his opposition to the idea of importing big-game trophies, tweeting, \"Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.\"\nTwo of the president's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are avid big-game hunters. In 2012, after Cher retweeted a Gothamist gallery showing \"Donald Trump's sons are awesome at killing elephants and other wildlife,\" Mr. Trump tweeted, \"Old story, one of which I publicly disapproved. My sons love hunting, I don't.\"\nA month after the November series of decisions, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a Safari Club International and National Rifle Association (NRA) lawsuit that the original Obama administration ban was brought about unlawfully. The Fish and Wildlife Service cited this ruling in its new memo, which addresses not only elephant trophies, but also lions and bonteboks from South Africa.\nDespite the president's earlier opposition, the department decided to move forward with allowing some big-game sport-hunted trophies from some African countries into the United States."}

It surpassed the value of gold at its peak before crashing down to $500. Today it flutters between $380 and $682 on different exchanges.\nWe watched breathlessly as early Bitcoin owners became millionaires and authorities seized millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins from the the Web\u2019s notorious black market, the Silk Road. We witnessed efforts to uncover the identity of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and we listened to luminaries in finance and economics heatedly debate Bitcoin\u2019s future.\nMillions of people followed the saga, but far fewer chose to buy Bitcoin themselves amidst all the uncertainty and volatility.\nNow Bitcoin is emerging out of its angsty adolescence into a more mature, adult, stable form. The Bitcoin ecosystem is growing more robust and legitimate, and the movement\u2019s evangelists are pushing hard for mainstream adoption \u2014 to turn Bitcoin into a currency rather than an asset or a financial lark and make the most of its unique capabilities.\nFor those of you who spent last year curious but wary about Bitcoin, here is a guide to everything you need to know.\nWe will take you through what Bitcoins are, how they are created, where to buy and sell them, how to store them safely, and where you can spend them.\nTo put it very, very simply, Bitcoin is the Internet\u2019s version of money.\nBitcoin is at its core a cryptographic protocol, which is why it is also referred to as a \u201ccrypto-currency.\u201d The protocol creates unique pieces of digital property that can be transferred from one person to another. The protocol also makes it impossible to double-spend a Bitcoin, meaning you can\u2019t spend the same Bitcoin twice.\nBitcoins are generated by using an open-source computer program to solve complex math problems in a process known as mining (more on that shortly). Each Bitcoin is defined by a public address and a private key, which are long strings of numbers and letters that give each a specific identity. This means that Bitcoin is not only a token of value but also a method for transferring that value.\nIn addition to having a unique digital fingerprint, Bitcoins are also characterized by their position in a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. Buying a Bitcoin can be thought of as buying a spot in the blockchain, which then records your purchase publicly and permanently.\nThe blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of computers around the world. This decentralization means no one entity, such as a government, controls it. Transactions happen digitally from person to person, without middlemen such as banks or clearinghouses. The public Bitcoin network is the official record for all of these transactions. You can also transfer Bitcoin in person (more about this below).\nThe direct approach significantly reduces the fees involved with transferring traditional money and makes it much easier and faster to send and receive money across the globe. Bitcoin gives an efficiency increase relative to banking transactions comparable to the efficiency of email versus physical email.\nPeople primarily buy and sell Bitcoins through online exchanges. The public address and private keys are both required to trade, sell, and spend Bitcoin.\nSince transactions are done using the public keys, the identities of the buyers and sellers are veiled to each other and to the public, even though the transaction is recorded publicly.\nPeople often say Bitcoin is anonymous"}

If you want to join this \u2018mini boom\u2019, you\u2019ll need a specialist buy-to-let loan.\nMost landlords take an interest-only loan because repayments are lower, and they don\u2019t need to have the capital paid off at the end of the term because the property can just be sold.\nOne of the best deals is with the Mortgage Works at 2.74 per cent fixed for two years. It has a 3.5 per cent fee and you must have a 35 per cent deposit. Interest-only payments are \u00a3343 on a \u00a3150,000 loan.\nClydesdale offers 4.49 per cent on a two-year fix for a 20 per cent deposit with a \u00a31,999 fee - on a capital and repayment basis.

They also examine how much of your mortgage your rent would cover at a higher rate - even as much as 7 per cent.\nBecoming a landlord is not just about getting the mortgage. There are practical issues, too, such as finding tenants, managing the property and preparing for periods when no rent is coming in.\nA letting agent can market the property or manage it. This means creating contracts for tenants, collecting rents and taking deposit payments, as well as calling out tradesmen if there is a problem.\nTypically, they charge 10 per cent to 17 per cent of the rent. Try to find a firm that has signed up to the charter with trade body the Association of Residential Letting Agents.\nA cheaper option is to turn to local authority schemes which find homes for families on local housing lists. These will guarantee you rent and will take care of managing the property. They will pay for any repairs once the tenancy is over.\nThe catch is you hand over the property to the council and have no control over who the tenants are. Rent may also be lower than the market rate.\nLenders are also increasingly cautious about handing out mortgages to landlords with tenants on benefits.

Yet with no decision expected from the U.S. Department of Justice on whether it will give its approval for the merger to go ahead, investors can't afford to lose sight of the insurer's fundamentals.\nComing into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report, Anthem investors were prepared to see declines in earnings from year-ago levels despite modest revenue growth, and that's largely consistent with what Anthem's results final results were.\nLet's take a closer look at how Anthem did during the quarter and what investors should expect for the rest of 2016 and beyond.\nAnthem's third-quarter financial results were mixed in the eyes of most investors. Operating revenue climbed 7% to $21.2 billion, outpacing the $20.8 billion consensus forecast among those following the stock. However, net income fell 6% to $617.8 million, and after taking account of certain extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $2.45 per share were down about 10% from year-ago levels and were $0.02 per share less than shareholders had expected.\nTaking a closer look at Anthem's results, the biggest issue that the insurer faced was a substantial rise in its benefit expenses. Anthem spent $16.92 billion on benefit payouts during the quarter, up 9.4% from year-ago levels and outpacing the rate of growth in overall revenue. That sent the company's benefit expense ratio, or expenses as a percentage of premiums, up by almost 2 full percentage points to 85.5%. Anthem said that poor medical cost experience in the Medicaid business, especially in the state of Iowa, exacerbated what is already traditionally a higher-cost segment. Also, unfavorable loss experience in the individual segment was only partially offset by lower cost experience in the local group segment.\nYet Anthem's overall enrollment figures continued to climb. Overall, Anthem counted 39.9 million members at the end of the quarter, up by 1.2 million since this time last year. Medicaid enrollment was the biggest gainer, climbing 554,000, but substantial gains in national corporate customer counts amounted to nearly 530,000. Smaller gains in local group and individual coverage also added to Anthem's enrollment totals. Financially, the government business saw greater revenue gains than the commercial and specialty segment, but operating gains climbed in the commercial business even as they slid by nearly a quarter on the government side of Anthem's business.\nCEO Joseph Swedish was happy with how Anthem performed. \"Our third quarter results reflected our focus on improving affordability for our members and capitalizing on growth opportunities across our businesses,\" Swedish said. \"The strong membership growth across the majority of our lines of business this year is further testament to the value proposition we bring to the marketplace.\"\nCan Anthem help its earnings bounce back?\nOne concern that investors should keep in mind is that medical cost inflation continues to outpace the overall rate of rising prices in the economy by a substantial margin. Anthem said that it believes that medical cost trends in its local group segment should come in between 7% and 7.5% for the full 2016 year, which is quite high in a 2% inflation environment for the broader economy"}

He did not say how the officers were poisoned. The police officer was captured as he fled, but the cook escaped and remains at large, Zirak added.\nThe gunmen escaped by motorcycle with weapons and ammunition, the governor&apos;s statement said.\nA recent upsurge in the number of insider attacks on coalition troops by Afghan soldiers or police \u2014 or insurgents disguised in their uniforms \u2014 has further undermined public support for the war in the West. So far this year, at least 52 foreign troops \u2014 about half of them Americans \u2014 have been killed in insider attacks.\nMeanwhile, a Taliban attack elsewhere in Helmand killed two district community council members, while Taliban-fired rocket-propelled grenades destroyed a warehouse full of food destined for the main U.S. base in Afghanistan.\nInsurgents ambushed the council members while they were driving to a tribal meeting in the volatile Sangin district, the governor&apos;s office said in its statement.\nThe attack against the council members is a reminder of the other worrying trend in insurgent tactics this year \u2014 a shift toward more targeted killings of those affiliated with the government. The United Nations has recorded a sharp increase in such killings in the first six months of 2012 as compared with the same period of 2011.\nThe jump in insider attacks and assassinations are throwing doubt on the capability of the Afghan government and security forces to take over as international troops reduce their presence. The U.S. has pulled back the \"surge\" troops President Barack Obama sent soon after he took office, and other members of the international coalition have already started drawing down their forces ahead of a planned handover to the Afghans in 2014.\nBut Kabul&apos;s Western allies also are trying to assure the Afghans that they are not deserting them, and several countries have reached agreements with Afghanistan pledging at least financial assistance past 2014.\nFrance, for one, recently signed a treaty with Afghanistan pledging such help, a deal that French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters in Kabul on Saturday \"symbolizes our friendship, our cooperation.\"\nHe noted that France is committing funds at a time when its budget is strained and said that while the remaining forces will not be fighting, they will be an essential part of a smooth transition to Afghan control.\nAbout 2,000 French troops are departing by the end of this year, which will leave about 1,400 to help with training Afghan security forces and logistics.\nIn Saturday&apos;s warehouse attack, insurgents fired rocket-propelled grenades at a compound used by military contractor Supreme Group to store food and other supplies destined for B"}

The image of Harlon Block is at the far right, planting the flag into Mount Suribachi.\nJoe Dowd: When you take a knee, remember Harlon Block, U.S.M.C.\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of Harlon Block, but you know him.\nHe was born in 1924 in rural Texas. His father was a World War I veteran. Across the Great Depression his father, a dairy farmer, supported a wife and six kids in the vast Rio Grande Valley. In high school, Harlon Block was outgoing and athletic, a football player who led the Weslaco Panthers to a conference title as war raged across the world.\nFootball is a kids\u2019 game, but war requires men. World War II had ensnarled America in a struggle on two fronts. As 1943 dawned, Block and seven of his high school teammates decided the times demanded a greater fight. In February that year they traveled to San Antonio and enlisted together in the U.S. Marine Corps.\nTeenagers: They think they\u2019ll live forever.\nCpl. Haron Block, U.S. Marines, taken in 1943.\nTwo years later, Block was a corporal assigned to E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment as they landed on the southern end of a Japanese island called Iwo Jima. The Marines\u2019 objective was to take the crest of a dormant volcano named Mount Suribachi. It was a cratered colossus rising from the sea, carved into a web of tunnels, caves and pill boxes, and defended by fierce Japanese soldiers willing to fight to the death.\nSecond Battalion had to take it from them.\nOn Feb. 23, a 40-man patrol was ordered to seize the crest and run up the American flag. There was a brief firefight; Old Glory was raised to signal the capture of the hilltop.\nYou wouldn\u2019t know it, but this was the day Harlon Block became immortal.\nThe first flag wasn\u2019t big enough to see from the north side of Mount Suribachi. The Marines needed to raise a bigger one. U.S. Marines are like that.\nIt fell to Block and five comrades to raise the colors for the second time. The moment was captured by an Associated Press photographer named Joe Rosenthal, perhaps the most iconic image ever taken in warfare.\nThe bigger flag was raised, but fierce fighting continued for weeks. On March 1, Harlon Block was killed by an enemy mortar shell. He was 20. His body was returned to Texas.\nThe battle for Iwo Jima claimed the lives of 6,800 Americans. Another 19,000 were wounded. The island, in bombing range of Tokyo, wasn\u2019t secured until the end of that month.\nThe nation Harlon Block fought and died for is now a house divided.

The institute believed the report \u201cdamaged the country\u2019s image abroad\u201d.\nThe study\u2019s authors disagreed, saying that after seven years\u2019 work they found the population to be \u201csuperstitious and prejudiced\u201d. In this instance, perhaps wisely, New Scientist declined to take sides.\nWe had fewer reservations in 2001.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s both mystifying and disappointing that the state Board of Teaching can\u2019t seem to get its act together when it comes to processing applications for some teacher licenses.\nTwice in the last several months, the agency was reprimanded by courts for failing to follow state rules on alternative licensure. Last December, Ramsey County District Judge Shawn Bartsh said the board broke the law when it failed to operate the portfolio method of granting licenses.\nThen early this month, Bartsh found the agency in contempt of her previous court order \u201cfor failing to let a plaintiff submit an application for an alternative teacher licensing program and not responding\u201d to her. \u201cThis Court\u2019s patience is at an end,\u201d the July contempt order said.\nCitizens who care about education should be at wit\u2019s end, too. In addition to defiantly breaking the alternative licensure law, now the agency\u2019s foot-dragging has come at a price. As a result of the contempt order, the Board of Teaching has to pay a teacher candidate plaintiff $7,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs.\nThis series of unnecessary events began in spring 2015, when a group of educators sued the board, arguing that the agency arbitrarily denied licenses to qualified teachers \u2014 mostly from out of state.\nLater that year, Bartsh ruled that the board violated state law when it stopped accepting licensing applications by portfolio in 2012. The portfolio process looks at experience and training in making licensing decisions. It is one of several ways prospective educators can be certified outside of the state\u2019s traditional licensing requirements.\nIn addition to twice being ordered by the court to comply, the agency and the Minnesota Department of Education were sharply criticized in March by the state Office of the Legislative Auditor. The two state agencies have overlapping responsibilities for licensing; the board is supposed to set standards for candidates, while the department issues licenses.\nThe auditor found that the licensing process is confusing and overly complex, and it recommended that the function be handled by one agency. And in some cases, the auditor said, the licensure appeal process is inconsistent with state law.\nFixing Minnesota\u2019s broken licensing process \u2014 including facilitating alternative licensure \u2014 is critical because the state faces shortages of teachers in coming years. The current system is seen as a barrier to recruiting and hiring educators, so legislators recently set up a task force to recommend systemic changes.\nIn the meantime, though, the agency must follow the law. It shouldn\u2019t take another court reprimand \u2014 and more fines \u2014 for the agency to do to its work."}

Yet it\u2019s Rabe who leaves a lasting impression. Bringing illuminating insights to the headstrong heiress Portia, the young actress is the production\u2019s real treasure.\nUnder Daniel Sullivan\u2019s direction, \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d is fast-paced, engaging, accessible. But by moving indoors, it\u2019s also acquired a darker hue.\nThe somber moments feel even more claustrophobic and gloomy because the Broadhurst\u2019s stage is much smaller than the one in the park \u2014 Mark Wendland\u2019s wrought-iron set has even acquired a sinister edge, like a cage.\nYet Pacino has gone bigger, unnecessarily turning up the volume since the summer, and losing subtlety in the process.\nLooking bedraggled, his shirt half hanging from his shapeless pants, Shylock makes a pitiful figure next to the Christian establishment, haughty tormentors in crisply pressed suits and spotless spats. That Shylock would channel his humiliation and disappointment into vengeful rage is understandable, if not excusable. But does it need to be so obvious?\nTypical is Shylock\u2019s famous \u201cIf you prick us, do we not bleed?\u201d speech, which Pacino starts in soft-spoken pain before switching to a saliva-projecting bellow.

With more than a million views on YouTube, the video soon spurred demand for a product they had not even launched. Now, a few weeks into the launch, vadas have already become the Bengaluru company\u2019s fastest selling item.\nAvailable currently only in 8,500 stores of their total network of 20,000 stores, ID Fresh is now betting big on its vada maker. With the promise of \"perfectly shaped vadas with a hole in the middle,\" the company has filed patents for the vada maker \u2013 which has a unique nozzle design \u2013 in India and 140 other countries under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).\n\u201cWe expected to do Rs 10 crore in vadas this year, but the demand has far exceeded our expectation. The idea took three years to develop. We first tried making vadas with modified pet plastic bottles like how roadside sellers make jalebis, but that didn't work as the vadas would come out in wonky shapes. We then tried a squeeze pouch like you have for jams, again it did not work. Then we finally came up with the umbrella nozzle for creating the round fluffy sphere with a cutter to ensure even sizes and a hole,\u201d Musthafa told TOI. It allows users to squeeze vadas directly into hot oil and avoid the messy, time-consuming process of shaping them by hand.\nID Fresh expects to end this fiscal with Rs 286 crore in turnover, up from Rs 182 crore in 2017-18. The company expects this to rise to Rs 350-400 crore in 2019-20, with Rs 100 crore of that from vadas alone.\nMusthafa started the venture in 2008 with four of his cousins. They began with idli and dosa batter, with a big focus on hygiene, good quality, and ensuring no preservatives and chemicals. Since then they have launched ready-to-eat parota and chapati, paneer, curd, and ragi batter, the last a push towards healthier options. In 2014, ID Fresh received Rs 35 crore in funding from Helion Venture Partners, and last year PremjiInvest invested $25 million (Rs 172 crore) for a 25% stake in the company.\nMusthafa admits they don\u2019t get everything right. Their tomato and coriander chutney bombed in the market.\n\u201cWhen you go to a hotel you pay Rs 35-40 for a plate of idlis. But do you pay for the chutney or sambar separately? No. It gets factored into the cost. So when we tried to sell our chutneys, serving four, at Rs 25, we found there were no takers in the market. The Indian consumer is used to getting his chutney free of cost \u2013 a decades old mindset that we couldn't change,\u201d Musthafa says.\nWhen ID Fresh commissioned a survey of more than 1,000 households in Bengaluru, it found that traditionalists still preferred to grind their own batter. \u201cSo, this vada is a way for us to enter households that never buy our batter.

Here\u2019s our snapshot of the service\u2019s incoming titles, both in kiosks and on demand\u2014you\u2019ll find the complete list down below.\nOne of Redbox\u2019s first and foremost January additions comes to us, like so many worthwhile films do nowadays, from the indie film wizards at A24: mid90s, the debut feature from actor-turned-writer-director Jonah Hill. The drama \u201cfollows Stevie, a 13-year-old in \u201890s-era L.A. who spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop,\u201d per A24\u2019s synopsis, starring Sunny Suljic as Stevie, Lucas Hedges as his older brother Ian and Katherine Waterston as his mother, Dabney. Paste gave the film a mixed review, noting that \u201cwhere Hill\u2019s characters fill every frame with warmth and empathy, the world they inhabit is as contrived as a memory one trusts too much,\u201d but those who share Hill\u2019s nostalgia will likely find mid90s worth watching when it hits kiosks on Jan. 8, 2019. Coming to Redbox a week later is Halloween (2018), the David Gordon Green-directed sequel to the 1978 horror classic of the same name. Scripted by Gordon Green, Jeff Fradley and Danny McBride, the film features Jamie Lee Curtis reprising the iconic role of Laurie Strode, taking on the seemingly superhuman masked slasher Michael Myers on the film\u2019s eponymous holiday. Halloween, too, Paste had a mixed opinion on, with our review deeming it \u201can intensely frustrating experience, buoyed by solid action and well-crafted scares, but simultaneously damned by an incredibly clunky script and appalling lack of focus.\u201d But if that doesn\u2019t scare you off, you can celebrate Halloween at your own risk starting on Jan. 15 via Redbox kiosks and VOD.\nMoving past January\u2019s halfway point, we encounter what may be Redbox\u2019s best January film addition: Whiplash and La La Land director Damien Chazelle\u2019s First Man, starring Ryan Gosling as lunar-landing pioneer Neil Armstrong.

Paste praised First Man to the skies in our review, writing that it \u201ccelebrates humanity by focusing intensely on it, in all its glories and failings,\u201d so don\u2019t miss this acclaimed space-race drama when it hits Redbox kiosks on Jan. 22"}

Its coolest feature: A thin-as-paper case that doubles as a touch-sensitive keyboard.\nA week later, Google launched its own tablet, the Nexus 7, as well as the Nexus Q media player. The Nexus 7 tablet may not get many \"oohs\" or \"ahhs,\" but it comes with almost all of the iPad's high-end features for less than half the cost.\nMicrosoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) and Google's (GOOG, Fortune 500) newfound love affair with hardware doesn't end there.\nAt a recent trip to Microsoft Research Laboratory in the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, the company showed CNNMoney several whiz-bang, early-concept hardware creations.\nResearchers there are working on wild inventions such as a wearable projector that allows you to access your smartphone screen on your hand, a mechanical butterfly that flaps its wings and changes color depending on your mood, and a robot proxy that attends meetings in your place.\nMicrosoft is also developing its popular Kinect gaming accessory to work with tools beyond just the Xbox.\nGoogle too is developing some very futuristic hardware. The company showed off its cyborg-like Project Glass glasses at its I/O developers conference last week in a stunt straight out of an action movie. Google announced Wednesday that the glasses will be available for testing next year, and they will likely go on sale in 2014.\nThe search giant has also famously developed an autonomous car, building add-ons for a Toyota (TM) Prius that allow it to drive itself. But not all of Google's hardware is so far-off in the future: Google also continues to design Nexus-branded smartphones as well as Chromebook laptops, and it recently completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility.\nSoftware is still clearly the bread and butter of both Microsoft and Google. Windows and Office are by far Microsoft's biggest profit generators, and search represents more than 95% of Google's sales. So why this obsession with hardware?\nWell, there is that rag-tag Cupertino, Calif., based company you might have heard of. Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) has built itself into the most successful technology company in the world by designing gorgeous hardware and integrating it flawlessly with its own software.\nMicrosoft and Google have historically preferred the \"open\" model: building software and licensing it to hardware makers. It has worked very well for both, as Windows runs more than 90% of PCs and Android runs more than half of all smartphones.\nBut open has its drawbacks. Hardware makers' margins are notoriously razor-thin, so innovative design sometimes takes a back seat to functionality. Hiccups when integrating the software aren't unusual either.\nMicrosoft CEO Steve Ballmer hinted at the company's Apple envy during the Surface announcement: \"We believe that any intersection between human and machine can be made better when all aspects, hardware and software, are working together,\" he said.\nBut for all their success in computers and phones, neither Microsoft nor Google have made the"}

The number of June CFA hopefuls had increased annually since 2005 and reached a record 149,954 candidates last year.\nFewer investment professionals are taking the exam as firms cut costs and jobs to boost shareholder returns. Morgan Stanley said in January it would eliminate 1,700 investment-banking positions and defer all bonuses for top earners. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s staff has declined by 3,400 positions over the last two years to 32,000 at the end of the first quarter.\n\"If you're an analyst, you're in that part of the industry that is shrinking,\" Richard Bove, a bank analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets LLC, said in an interview. Fewer CFA exam applicants is \"a cyclical phenomenon, it doesn't reflect any fundamental changes. I would assume in future years, as markets go up the number of CFAs taking the exam will go up.\"\nSteve Horan, a spokesman for the not-for-profit institute, said that the decrease in enrollment is the \"cumulative effect of a shrinking industry.\" He said the CFA expects the number to grow long-term.\nApplicants take the test in hopes the CFA certificate will help them stand out in a competitive hiring environment. Goldman Sachs hired 350 summer analysts in its investment-banking division this year out of 17,000 applicants, President Gary Cohn said May 30.\nCandidates are required to have at least four year's experience in the investment industry and spend an average of 300 hours preparing for each of the three six-hour tests, the institute said. Thirty-seven percent of applicants passed the Level I exam in December, down from 38 percent when the test was given in June 2012 and a year earlier in December 2011. Historically, more than half of all test takers fail.\nEach exam includes a section on ethics. John Rogers, president of the CFA Institute, has pushed to improve the industry's standing amid declining confidence stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"The candidates who will take the CFA exams this weekend are already committed to raising the professional standards of all participants in this industry, and to rebuild public trust,\" Rogers said in the release.\nThe total number of candidates who registered to sit for the exam this fiscal year, including both the June and December sessions, also fell. Total enrollment decreased to 210,000 from 219,642 last year. The most candidates for the June exam, 63,104, are from Asia, according to the statement."}

But while they come down hard on Mylan, they allow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to skate by almost scotch-free when the FDA is as much \u2013 if not more- to blame.\nMylan\u2019s near monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector has allowed you to increase prices well beyond those that are justified by any increase in the cost of manufacturing EpiPen.\nYour company has responded to concern about the high cost of the EpiPen by arguing that its three EpiPen accessibility programs ensure consumer access to the product, despite the high cost.\nYour discount programs, however, represent a well-defined industry tactic to keep costs high through a complex shell game.\nThey contend that Mylan\u2019s discount programs still leave insurance companies, government, and employers bearing \u201cthe burden of these excessive prices\u201d because higher costs are passed on to consumers through higher premiums.\nIsn\u2019t this the kettle calling the pot black? This sounds a lot like what happened because of ObamaCare.\nWhere is their ire though for the reasons Mylan developed a monopoly that allows it to charge what it does? As we reported, Mylan worked with Congress and the Obama Administration to create a program to channel EpiPen in schools and the incentives for only using EpiPens there. The demand and supply for EpiPens starts and ends with government working with big business (i.e. cronyism).\nAnd where is their ire against the FDA\u2019s slowness to approve alternatives? A few of their Republican colleagues in House sent a letter to the FDA asking where in the application process competitors to EpiPen are and whether they would be prioritized.\nCongress knows quite well that the delays in getting alternatives approved is why there is no competition to keep prices from rising and to even drive them lower.\nApparently, some 4,036 generic drug applications are waiting for the FDA to approve them. The median approval time is 47 months! Four years a lot of time for a family to struggle with buying a pricey medication that lacks a generic version and sadly, more than enough time for a patient to expire as they await a more reasonably priced medicine to help their condition.\nIn addition, the inability for international drug options limits competition. The European Medicines Agency (aka Europe\u2019s FDA) is able to approve generic drugs in about a year on average. They have generic alternatives to the EpiPen for $34-$67. Why can\u2019t we gain access to them?\nIndeed, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association and its European equivalent, Medicines for Europe, have proposed a \u201csingle development pathway\u201d under which approval in one jurisdiction would automatically confer approval in the other.\nThe FDA has long insisted, for safety reasons, that it approve all drugs regardless of whether they have been approved overseas. But if the FDA was once a better regulator than its overseas peers, it isn\u2019t now. Ken Kaitin, a professor of medicine at Tufts University who has studied drug regulation around the world, says there is \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d the U.S. drug supply is safer than in Britain, Canada or Europe.\nThus, the FDA wouldn\u2019t be compromising safety by harmonizing its approvals with foreign regulators. Indeed, by making more drugs available at lower cost, it could ultimately make Americans healthier.\nAs the initial anger subsides, reason and common sense are"}

The move won't end the county's crisis shortage of inpatient care, observers say.\nA Ventura psychiatric hospital closed by the Thomas Fire opened 28 more beds Monday afternoon in a move observers say will address but not come close to ending a crisis-level need for in-patient psych care in Ventura County.\nBefore flames raced across Ventura County in a December 2017 fire that was then the state's largest ever wildfire, Vista del Mar Hospital operated 87 psychiatric beds. As many as 34 beds were available for adolescents 12 and older \u2014 the only such beds in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\nThe fire destroyed two of the hospital's five buildings and triggered a last-minute evacuation of staff and 67 patients. The closure of the entire campus exacerbated an already severe shortage for psychiatric beds in Ventura County with only one other available hospital, a 30-bed unit at Ventura County Medical Center that accepts only adult patients.\nSome adolescent patients with psychiatric needs have received care at a county crisis stabilization unit and a related short-term care unit. Others were transported to facilities outside of Ventura County or stayed in emergency rooms until beds were found.\n\"We may have to be searching throughout Southern California and sometimes throughout the state,\" said Steve Elson, CEO of Casa Pacifica Centers for Children and Families, which offers residential programs but not hospital care for youths. He said kids younger than 12 were hit harder because of the lack of in-patient programs aimed at them.\nIn the fire's aftermath, Vista del Mar staff immediately launched efforts to reopen beds in the buildings that escaped severe fire damage, projecting some beds could be available within six months. But the flames unearthed a Pandora's box of needs, many involving identifying and replacing a myriad of damaged water pipes.\n\"We had a best-case scenario and a worst-case scenario,\" said Jenifer Nyhuis, CEO of Vista del Mar, noting the latter situation is the one that emerged.\nHospital leaders opened 27 beds in October and focused on building up a staff that was laid off after the fire. As of Monday, the nursing staff was at 80 people and the total staff at 150. About one-third of the workers were employed at Vista del Mar before the hire.\nThe hiring boost enabled the opening of a second patient building at 1 p.m. Monday, bringing total beds at the hospital to 55. The care includes 12 beds designated for veterans or people currently in the military. All of the 28 beds available Monday are targeted for adults but allowed other beds to be opened for youths.\nAcross the hospital, the capacity for adolescents rises from 10 patients to 17.\n\"It's an impact,\" said Nyhuis, noting the new beds more than double the hospital's capacity. \"Is it enough? No.\"\nPlans to rebuild the entire hospital continue with leaders hoping to expand care to 120 beds. That construction project is in the design stage and even on an expedited track won't be finished until 2021 at the earliest.\nObservers say the beds opened Monday will make a difference.\n\"The fact that there's going to be a reopening is news to my ears,\" said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer of a Ventura County Medical Center that hopes to expand its psychiatric hospital from 30 to 42 beds. \""}

Yet there is a smaller, less colorful species of butterfly that also occurs here, and although it doesn\u2019t make the epic flights like its cousin, it has its own identity.\nThe butterfly simply known as the Queen (Danaus gilippus) occurs throughout the western half of the United States, but it frequents the southern areas of this range more consistently, including West Texas. From here it inhabits the appropriate habitat through the western half of Mexico as well.\nThe Queen, while not as showy as its close relative the Monarch, has its own distinctive beauty. The upper wings are dark orange and are bordered in black. There are numerous small white spots randomly situated inside of this black border, as well as along the rear edges of the orange-colored wings. Each side of the orange abdomen may or may not be adorned with two black spots on the upper wings.\nThe head and thorax are black, and the head is littered with small white spots, while the thorax has a centered thin white line. As this butterfly lands, the wings are clasped together to reveal even more coloration as the orange color is separated by black lines that trace the veins of the wings. This species is not only a duller version of the Monarch, it is also smaller, as adult butterflies reach a maximum wingspan of barely 2 1/4 inches.\nThis type of butterfly is an almost plant-specific feeder, feeding on the flowers of most milkweed species. It utilizes an appendage known as a proboscis to feed on these items. The proboscis is long and almost threadlike, and in times of non-use is curled up under the head of the butterfly.\nThe Queen, like other butterfly species, undergoes a four-stage life cycle that can be described as nothing short of miraculous. They begin life as an egg, which hatches after a few short days. Upon hatching, the larvae are known as caterpillars, and at this stage, the growth rate is highly accelerated. Caterpillars can eat twice their body weight in a single day and, as such, grow quickly. As they grow, they literally grow out of their skins, and they shed their outer layer of skin up to five times (known as molting) before they enter the next stage of their life cycle.\nAfter the caterpillar finds a spot in which it feels is secure, it will pupate as it forms a protective shell about it known as a chrysalis. The chrysalis version of the Queen is pale green with large golden spots and is impressively beautiful. Inside this shell, the larvae changes into a butterfly. After about a week, the adult emerges from this shell with its wings intact, although they are crumpled into small balls on the sides of the body. The butterfly will then pump a clear fluid into the veins of its wings, causing them to expand much the same way a stick can reinforce a kite.\nUpon reaching maturity, the Queen will immediately begin searching for food, water and a mate. After mating, the males will continue their search for other receptive females, while the females will begin to look for a site suitable to lay eggs so a brand new life cycle can begin.\nLike its close relative the Monarch, the Queen is a poisonous species of butterfly, said to be quite bitter and distaste"}

Block, Micaela Diamond and cast in \"The Cher Show\" on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre.\nIf you\u2019re doing an authorized and approved biography of the living Cher, a stricture which inevitably leads you toward a hagiography, shyness morphing into the eternal human quest for immortality is not a bad organizing principle, and it will probably be enough for her fans to have a good time. For all the obvious flaws of \u201cThe Cher Show,\u201d it\u2019s an honest, self-deprecating effort, given the givens. Vastly different and greatly improved from its Chicago tryout, which was framed around a phony TV show about Cher, the final Broadway version of the show has Block\u2019s Cher striding to center stage and proceeding to tell Cher\u2019s story strictly on Cher\u2019s terms.\nMost jukebox shows look for ways to introduce musical variety. Not \u201cThe Cher Show,\u201d which features a trifecta of Chers. The hugely talented Micaela Diamond plays the young Cher (or Babe) and Teal Wicks (Lady) essays the early-career diva. Both give the spotlight to Block (her third is called Star, lest you were wondering), but the women don\u2019t follow chronological rules. Often, they all show up at once, Star offering a mature woman\u2019s advice to Babe, say, or Babe telling Star to find her youthful vitality.\nVocally, all three are very much within the Cher palette, which means you have to like the Cher sound to be happy in this show, but, then again, you knew that when you read the title. While Wicks struggles not to be stuck being the bologna in the Cher sandwich, Diamond (a real find) has the advantage of youthful talent and Block commands the stage in a way that is so close to her subject as to be almost creepy.\nCher is no Carole King, of course. Her persona is cool to the touch and that is what the show captures. The warmer colors of the evening come from Jarrod Spector, who is both funny and charming as Sonny, even though the script treats the late congressman harshly, and from the terrific Emily Skinner, who plays Cher\u2019s highly sympathetic mother, Georgia Holt, a kind of proto-Cher in this telling. Cher\u2019s other main loves, Gregg Allman (Matthew Hydzik) and Rob Camilletti (Michael Campayno) are there too, but kissed off. In the show\u2019s telling, they\u2019re nice guys who cannot go the Cher distance.\nCher never married Bob Mackie, who is both the costume designer of \u201cThe Cher Show\u201d and a character therein, but he\u2019s the spouse of her skin here. Mackie\u2019s custom creations are paraded throughout the evening in the most entertaining fashion, giving the show an atypical glamour and level of spectacle that exceeds most of its competition.\nAside from the clothes, though, \u201cThe Cher Show\u201d mostly stays within the lanes of the jukebox musical and cannot avoid many of its tropes. Since Cher mostly narrates \u201cThe Cher Show\u201d and there\u2019s a lot of life to depict, that leads you to some forced scenes where characters introduce themselves as part of their dialog (\u201cI\u2019m not wrong, I\u2019m Robert Altman\u201d). And the show still runs into systemic problems in the crucial heart of Act 2 when Cher inconveniently turns to acting in straight plays and movies, neither of which lend themselves easily to this kind of musical: Elice tries to get around"}

It expects to hear this fall if it has won the highly competitive INFRA grant.\nMembers of the Conservative Caucus, Sen. Bill Eigel, R-St. Charles, and Sen.

Smith has made,\u201d Eigel said.\n\u201cUntil this idea of a \u2018trigger,\u2019 we were incurring debt for the chance (of an INFRA grant award), and remember 49 other states are applying for this grant,\u201d Onder said.\nDuring the filibuster, Eigel, citing a passage in the state constitution, questioned whether legislators could issue bonds of more than $1 million without a constitutional amendment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible we have a little bit of flexibility but...this may be a resolution I\u2019m never be able to vote yes on, along these concerns,\u201d Eigel said Wednesday.\nEigel said he met with Parson Wednesday.

The new schedule would have cut the interest by $75 million.\nPrior to that proposal Tuesday, Schatz said he expected \u201chealthy discussion\u201d on the floor that would allow for negotiations off the floor. What ensued was a 10-hour filibuster.\nDemocrats were quick to point out the chamber had come to a halt twice in one week because of intraparty fights.\n\u201cUnder the control of the Republicans, you all can\u2019t seem to get it together,\u201d Sen.

{"idx": "32351", "prompt": "Continue the following text: An expert explains how the agency may be trying to resurrect her emails.\nLast week, Hillary Clinton finally apologized for using a private email server when she was secretary of state. That server is now in the hands of the FBI, but it took a while to get there. In December, the Clinton camp provided 30,000 or so work-related emails to the State Department after it deleted more than 31,000 emails from the server that it considered personal. In March, while declining to give a congressional committee access to the server, Clinton\u2019s lawyer David Kendall said the emails stored on it had been permanently erased, or \u201cwiped.\u201d But weeks ago, with the email controversy showing no signs of subsiding, Clinton handed over the server to the FBI. The Washington Post reported Saturday that Platte River Networks, the Denver-based company that has managed Clinton\u2019s email system since 2013, had no record of the server being \u201cwiped.\u201d So this could mean the FBI will be able to recover emails that the Clinton crew deleted\u2014and that the bureau will be able to review all the emails and documents on the server to determine if materials, possibly including classified information, were handled properly.\nThe FBI now has Clinton\u2019s email server. What are they doing with it? \u201cWhen handling any piece of any digital evidence, the first thing is to make what\u2019s called a \u2018forensic image copy\u2019 of it, an exact working duplicate, so you\u2019re not messing with the original,\u201d Berryhill says. Once the copy is made, an analyst can quickly determine if there\u2019s any recoverable material by looking at the computer data, which is built on a system of ones and zeros. If a preliminary look reveals nothing other than a trillion zeros, an investigator can quickly conclude there is no data to resurrect. Berryhill notes it should only take a couple of minutes to figure out if there is recoverable information on the server or if the server was purposefully wiped out.\nConsider what happens to emails. After you email a document, the recipient can do several things once they open it: print the document, forward it to somebody else, save it to the documents folder on the computer, or delete it. As the sender, you can do the same things. Consequently, traces of the document\u2014or even all of it\u2014can remain on the email server, in the documents folder, in the printer\u2019s temporary cache file, or in the sent email folder. \u201cSo it gets pretty complicated for people when they start trying to selectively wipe things,\u201d Berryhill says.\nBerryhill says he has been able to recover material that was deleted years earlier and, on the other hand, has been unable to access files that were on a computer that very morning. An investigator is most likely to recover material when the server is not heavily used and has a large hard drive. With a heavily used machine that has a very full hard drive, material will get lost and be overwritten much more quickly, and the chances of recovering it are less likely.\nAdditionally, investigators could find an address book or contact list, and the header information attached to each email, which would include significant data, such as the sender, recipient, the time, and the date. \u201cYou could find evidence of attachments by name, and, depending on what you recover, you maybe be able to recover the attachments too,\u201d Berryhill notes, adding that certain types of attachments\u2014pictures, for example\u2014are easier to recover. A crucial variable is whether the server was configured to have redundant drives. (In case one drive failed, others would still function.) Then pieces of these files could exist in many different places."}

{"idx": "32371", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Stephen Harper chose the Calgary Stampede (now Rachel Notley country) to launch the theme of the now full-blown election campaign. Harper proclaimed he was confident that \"this October Canadians will choose security over risk.\" Let's hope so. The question is, of course, what kind of security and risk are we talking about? Political language is never simple or straightforward. It is subject to sophisticated manipulation by professional wordsmiths and public relations experts. The choice of what language to use is subject to hundreds of hours of deliberation and enormous resources because if you get it right, you usually win. If you get it wrong, well, it's a lot harder. Getting it right means no one even suspects you of manipulating them.\nExperts in the art of issue framing will tell you that those who frame an issue first have a huge advantage because they force their opponents to reframe it -- in other words, get you to take the time to reconsider what the words actually mean. Maybe that is why neither the Liberals nor the NDP have taken the trouble to challenge Harper's framing of the security issue as exclusively a foreign policy and military issue: security against terrorism.\nThat's unfortunate because not only is Harper vulnerable on his own limited anti-terror grounds, he is extremely vulnerable when it comes to the kind of security that actually affects millions of Canadians. When it comes to economic and social security, the vast majority of Canadians haven't been this insecure since the Great Depression.\nIt's not as if we don't know the numbers -- 60 per cent of Canadians just two weeks away from financial crisis if they lose their job; record-high personal indebtedness; real wages virtually flat for the past 25 years; a terrible work-life balance situation for most working people (and getting worse); labour standard protections that now exist only on paper; the second-highest percentage of low-paying jobs in the OECD; young people forced into working for nothing on phony apprenticeships; levels of economic (both income and wealth) inequality not seen since 1928. Throw in the diminishing \"social wage\" (medicare, education, home care, child care, etc.) and the situation is truly grim.\nMost of these insecurity statistics are rooted either directly or indirectly in 25 years of deliberate government policy designed by and for corporations. Governments have gradually jettisoned their responsibility for economic security, slowly but surely handing this critical feature of every Canadian's life over to the \"market\" for determination. Economic policy has been surgically excised from government responsibility to citizens and is now in the singular category of \"facilitating investment\" -- a euphemism for clearing the way for corporations to engage in whatever activity enhances their bottom line.\nFrom corporate rights agreements (which constitutionalize corporate power), to the decades-old \"independence\" of the Bank of Canada (independent of democracy); from irresponsibly low corporate income tax rates to punitively low social assistance; from EI that only 30 per cent ever qualify for to taxes grossly skewed in favour of the wealthy and a Charter of Rights and Freedoms that has bestowed citizenship status on the most powerful and ruthless economic entities on the planet, Canadian governments have abandoned their citizens to the vagaries of an increasingly unregulated capitalism. This is not even a complete list but it demonstrates just how corporate globalization and its promoters like Stephen Harper have created the greatest insecurity for Canadians virtually in living memory.\nThe brilliance of the project hiving economic security off from democratic governance is that it has been so gradual and systematic that we"}

Insults were exchanged, then threats, then fisticuffs, probably instigated by the group of Lazio fans. Sandri, meanwhile, was still asleep in the back of the car; the Laziali rejoined him and set off. As the driver turned on to the motorway he caught a glimpse of a man standing on a raised mound, arms outstretched before him, a pistol in his hands. Seconds later, two shots were heard. Only as the car pulled away did the group realise that Sandri had been shot in the neck through the rear window: he died before they reached the next emergency exit. Luigi Spaccarotella, the highway patrol officer who opened fire, initially claimed to have fired a \u201cwarning shot in the air\u201d, but ballistics evidence and eyewitness accounts have disproved this. At present, he is to be charged with non-premeditated murder.\nConfused and contradictory reports of Sandri\u2019s death spread rapidly. Ultras across Italy initially heard only that the police had killed an ultra at a service station. The widespread expectation was that the day\u2019s games would be cancelled, just as had happened in February when a police inspector, Filippo Raciti, was killed during rioting in Catania. Instead the chief of police, Antonio Manganelli, rejecting this precedent and hoping to avoid this very comparison, ordered that all games be played with just a ten-minute delay as a mark of respect. Only Inter v Lazio was postponed, at the request of the Lazio players.\nThe consequences were dire, with violence directed against the police breaking out across the country. Ultras \u2013 like many other groups in Italian society \u2013 are notorious for their hatred of the police even at the best of times. In Milan, ultras of several teams united to march through the city bearing a banner proclaiming: \u201cFor Raciti you stopped the league, but the death of a fan doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The worst violence was in the capital, where furious Lazio hooligans were joined by their Roma counterparts in a co\u2011ordinated riot that lasted for hours. Despite a belated decision to call off Roma\u2019s home game, a mob of up to a thousand people besieged police stations before attacking the headquarters of CONI, the governing body for all sports in Italy. An incendiary device was thrown into the building, windows were smashed, vehicles and dustbins were overturned and set on fire. The area around the Stadio Olimpico resembled a war zone: streets littered with rubble and broken glass, wrenched-up road signs and assorted impromptu weaponry.\nFollowing the universal condemnation of this unprecedented outbreak of hooliganism, some encouraging action has been taken by the authorities. Multiple arrests have followed in Milan, Bergamo and Rome, where two men have been charged with incitement to violence against the state under new anti-terror legislation. As so often, there may be a political element. There are indications that the Rome riots may have been organised or directed by members of neo-fascist party Forza Nuova \u2013 who were also implicated in February\u2019s rioting in Catania. Of course, Italy\u2019s violent curve are by no means the exclusive province of the extreme right: Atalanta\u2019s ultras, who committed some of the day\u2019s worst violence, have traditionally come from the left.\nThough there has not been the blanket ban on away travel some feared, more string"}

They were firing rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft guns and motors.\nRomesha moved uncovered under intense enemy fire multiple times to muster reinforcements and fire on attackers.\nHe took out an enemy machine gun team and, while engaging a second, was wounded by shrapnel when a generator he was using for cover was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade.\nHe fought on undeterred, exposing himself to \u201cheavy enemy fire\u201d while moving \u201cconfidently about the battlefield.

His extraordinary efforts gave Bravo Troop the opportunity to regroup, reorganize and prepare for the counterattack that allowed the troop to account for its personnel and secure Combat Outpost Keating,\u201d according to the award citation.\nAccording to the book, \u201cThe Outpost\u201d by Jake Tapper, which examines the events leading up to and on the deadly day, Romesha exhibited intense courage and determination as the outnumbered U.S. troops and Afghan allies battled an enemy force numbering in the hundreds.\nHis parents, according to the book \u201chad hoped he would follow his father into the church leadership, and Romesha had in fact gone to seminary for four years during high school \u2014 from five till seven every morning \u2014 but ultimately it just wasn\u2019t for him.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even go on a mission, a regular rite for young Mormon men.

Evers was up for reelection and he faced a determined challenge from Republican state Representative Don Pridemore, a steady supporter of Walker\u2019s legislative agenda. The governor did not make an endorsement in the nonpartisan race and that miffed Pridemore, one of the most conservative members of the legislature. But the challenger's campaign was cheered on by the Republican Assembly Speaker, conservative radio hosts and activists.\nA well-regarded and easy-going figure, Evers could easily have mounted a cautious campaign for the statewide post.\nInstead, he campaigned across the state prior to Wisconsin\u2019s April 2 statewide election with a message that Walker\u2019s voucher scheme posed a threat to public education.\nVoters responded by giving Evers a 61-39 victory statewide.\nLisa Subeck, the executive director of the progressive grassroots group United Wisconsin argued that the election results should cause the governor to rethink.\nThe governor may not waver.

And that price often comes with hidden costs, according to experts who help students evaluate loans.\n\"You shouldn't borrow more for your education than your first year's salary,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert and writer at the website Private Student Loans Guru.\nFollowing that rule enables borrowers to pay their debt back in 10 years. Taking on more loans often entails a longer repayment horizon, and financial struggles, Kantrowitz said.\nThere are some indications that students are getting the message. More than half of incoming college students indicated they had \"some concern\" about paying for college, while 13.3 percent indicated they had major concerns, according to a Cooperative Institute Research Program survey released earlier this year.\nHere are some tips for making sure your college won't leave you underwater financially after graduation.\nProspective students should use the net price in their offer to evaluate how much it will cost to attend a school, according to Kantrowitz. That net price is calculated by subtracting all financial aid, grants and scholarships to determine what you will pay from savings, income and loans to attend the school.\n\"The net price correlates very well with debt at graduation,\" Kantrowitz said.\nSome financial aid award letters can blur the distinction between grants and loans. Watch for abbreviations like \"L\" or \"LN\" or terse terms such as \"federal Stafford\" that do not obviously indicate which parts are loans.\nThe opaqueness has led some families to think they have a free ride from a college when in reality they have a six-figure combination of expenses and debt, according to Kantrowitz.\n\"The disclosures are not clear,\" he said.\nFederal loans typically offer the best terms, but are often capped at relatively low amounts, said Adam S. Minsky, an attorney specializing in helping student loan borrowers.\nPrivate loans or Parent Plus loans have more strings attached. Private loans frequently have interest rates that are high and variable. They often require a parent to co-sign the loan and offer very little flexibility if there's a hardship.\nParent Plus loans require a parent to take on the debt burden. Though these loans are governed by federal law, they typically have higher interest rates than other federal loans, Minsky said. Parent Plus loans also have less flexibility in repayment, such as no income-driven repayment plan, and cannot be transferred to the child.\n\"There's a lot of dangers there,\" Minsky said.\nBorrowers also need to be wary of schools that are front-loading grants, according to Kantrowitz. As college costs go up following freshman year and grants remain unchanged, the student will be borrowing more.\nStudents can check on a school's grant records at CollegeNavigator.gov under the financial aid tab. If the average grant amount goes down from freshmen to other undergraduates or the percentage receiving grants goes down, that's a sign you will pay more in subsequent years, Kant"}

She was attacked, too. Blood oozed out of the friend\u2019s forehead.\nWhen the friend called the cops, her husband fled the scene.\nSimpson stuffed a few things into her children\u2019s book bags and along with her three children, the oldest of whom was 15, and without knowing where else to turn, headed straight to the local social security offices.\nSimpson was eventually directed to the Pace Women\u2019s Justice Center, a nonprofit which provides legal and educational services for victims of domestic violence and elder abuse in Westchester and Putnam counties. The attorneys at the center helped her obtain a restraining order against her former husband and provided her with legal representation in her divorce in 2016.\nOn June 29, the center, located at Pace University\u2019s law school campus in White Plains with satellite offices at the family courts in Yonkers and White Plains, will officially inaugurate a walk-in legal clinic in a newly renovated 4,000-square-foot space across from its old offices.\nTwo years ago, the center won a $100,000 grant from Impact100 Westchester \u2014 the local chapter of a national women's organzation that makes grants through collective funding \u2014 to renovate the center's cramped basement space in the old administrative building, also known as Gail\u2019s House.\nAs plans were being made for renovations, Pace University decided to make an investment in the clinic.\nThe university donated $1 million to fully renovate a former student center building on its campus, outfitting the space with private meeting rooms, a conference center, and a kid-friendly waiting area.\nThe renovations will allow an additional 500 victims to be served at the facility, she said.\nThe changes in immigration policies over the last year have made the need for the center even more urgent.\nWhile calls to the center\u2019s legal helpline went up by 5 percent to 2,518, from 2016 to 2017, the number of clients in its courthouse walk-in offices went down by 10 percent during the same period, said Kanusher.\nKanusher believes it is partly due to the fear undocumented immigrants have of possible sweeps by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe center was opened in 1991 and now has 25 employees, 18 of whom are attorneys.

{"idx": "32384", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Whether or not to vaccinate your child has become an emotional topic over the past several years. Media reports that vaccinations are dangerous are widespread, and it's difficult to sort through the vast amount of information out there and figure out what's truth and what's fiction. Furthermore, it can be daunting when you arrive at the doctor's office and find out that your baby needs five shots for her routine checkup.\nI approach the topic of vaccines as a scientist: How do they work, are they effective, are they safe and how do we know?\nChildren are born with a full immune system. When an unknown bacteria or virus is discovered by the immune system, the body produces antibodies to help protect against future invasions by the same invader. The human body is capable of making thousands of antibodies. Vaccines are dead or greatly weakened parts of viruses or bacteria. When your child gets a vaccine, the body makes antibodies, so that if your child is exposed to the virus or bacteria at a later date, the body can fight it before getting sick. Through vaccines, your child becomes protected from the disease without ever getting the illness.\nVaccines are clearly effective. They have saved the lives of millions of children around the world. Because of vaccinations, we rarely see polio, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps and even chicken pox in children anymore. Rates of hospitalization in children have dropped dramatically in the past 20 years because of the use of vaccines. That being said, they are not always 100 percent effective in every child. Many vaccines require two to three rounds before they protect your child from disease. Usually, though, if your child does get sick, it's a less serious version of the disease. We see this with the chicken pox and zoster vaccines.\nThe most common question I get from parents is, \"Are vaccines safe?\" In general, vaccines are extremely safe. Vaccines undergo testing for 10 years or more before they are made public. Once in use, vaccines are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness. However, like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. The most common side effects are fever or soreness at the sight of the shot. Severe reactions are possible, but are very uncommon.\nSome families worry that vaccines containing mercury and thimerosal can cause autism. Research to prove or disprove a possible relationship between thimerosal and autism is ongoing. However, to date, no scientific linkage has been established. In fact, the original suggestion of autism-associated vaccination came from scientist Andrew Wakefield, whose study of 12 children has been invalidated and disproved by the scientific community. Unfortunately, it started a frenzy of media activity that has placed doubt in the public's mind about the safety of vaccination.\nOthers might worry that giving too many vaccines might overwhelm the immune system. However, the infant immune system can respond to many antigens simultaneously. Several studies have validated this claim, and it's even safe to give vaccines with a concurrent mild illness.\nWhen families come to me with concerns about vaccinations, I try to identify what bothers them the most. Many times, education and answering questions about fears help to alleviate anxiety. Sometimes at a parent's request we will provide alternate schedules to break up the shots. However, this is not necessary, and can lead to increased number of shots and doctor visits.\nIn 2008, Idaho had the lowest vaccination rate in the country at 60 percent. Over the past few years, the state"}

Those Elker teams were a combined 3-16.

The ECC win was No. 500 for Ridgway, a milestone which had been reached by only 55 schools in Pennsylvania.\nPreparing for the Elker offense has been like looking in a mirror, according to Evanko. While Curwensville relies on seniors Nick Sipes, District 9\\\u2019s top rusher with 190 carries for 1,165 yards and 18 touchdowns, and Shawn Sopic, who has completed 25 of 54 passes for 500 yards and three TDs and run 58 times for 443 yards and four scores, Ridgway counts on juniors Jerico Weitzel, fifth in District 9 with 878 yards and 10 touchdowns on 138 carries and an additional 165 yards on 16 pass receptions, and Nick Dickant, who has connected on 27 of 58 passes for 346 yards and three TDs and run for 172 yards and three scores.

If that isn't you, then these will be major SPOILERS. Do yourself a favor and come back after you've seen the movie.\nAvengers: Infinity War was everything that we expected it to be and more. It was a movie on an epic scale that has shaken the Marvel Cinematic Universe to its core. As such, we have a lot of questions.\nOdds are we'll be asking questions about Avengers: Infinity War until Avengers 4 comes out a year from now, but until then, here are the biggest questions that we have about the latest entry in the MCU.\nAt the end of Thor: Ragnarok we see Thor, Hulk, Loki, Heimdall and Valkyrie along with the rest of the Asgardians on board a ship when, in that film's post-credits sequence, they are approached by another large spacecraft. In the opening moments of Avengers: Infinity War it is confirmed that the ship belongs to Thanos. All of the previously named characters appear in the scene, with one exception. Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is nowhere to be found. We don't see her fighting but we also never see her body. Is she alive? We know that Thanos left half the Asgardians alive, but if she isn't dead, why didn't she fight?\nThere were a lot of questions about Hawkeye going into Avengers: Infinity War. As it turns out, those questions were quite warranted, as Clint Barton never appeared on screen in the movie. We're told in the movie that he, like Ant-Man Scott Lang, is under house arrest, but are we really to expect that Clint sat on the sidelines? We were told he'd retired in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but that didn't stop him then, so why did it now? It's a safe bet that Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is still alive, as removing him off-screen seems unlikely, especially since every other member of the core team from The Avengers survived. What does the future have in store for our favorite archer?\nThe Incredible Hulk tries to do his thing at the beginning of the film and he goes toe-to-toe with Thanos (Josh Brolin). Surprisingly, however, he gets beat, and hard. After Thor: Ragnarok, when Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) was afraid he may never be able to change back the next time he became the Hulk, now he finds himself unable to change into the big green guy at all. Is the Hulk really just feeling a lack of confidence following his defeat or is there more going on as to why he refuses to emerge? The Avengers will almost certainly need the big guy in Avengers 4, so what will it take to get him back?\nWhy Did Strange Give Up The Time Stone?\nWhen trying to come with their plan to stop Thanos, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) specifically tells Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) that if it comes to a choice between saving the life of him, or Spider-Man (Tom Holland), or protecting the Time Stone, he won't hesitate to save the stone. However, when the time comes, Strange gives up the Time Stone to save Iron Man. This move is especially damning considering Thanos uses the Time Stone to obtain the final stone he needs, the Mind Stone, making it seem like the worst possible move. Sure"}

Combining surveys of state real estate commissions and other key people in the business with a close analysis of case law and recently enacted statutes, the document identifies potential pitfalls that can ensnare anyone.\nProperty condition disclosures, for example, are a significant source of disputes, particularly when the house involved is either a foreclosure being resold by the bank or a short sale in which the seller owes more than the place is worth.\nDisclosure problems involving underwater owners were deemed the most significant of all legal issues discussed in the 63-page report. Two-thirds of the respondents expect the level of disputes to rise, if only because short sales are not expected to go away any time soon.\nOften, according to the report, the upside-down seller \"sees no benefit\" in giving up any information about the property. And sometimes, because the short-sale process takes so long, the property's condition changes while the contract is pending.\nLenders are blamed for much of the tumult because, as one respondent put it, \"they are unresponsive and do not approve transactions in a timely manner.\"\nBut real estate agents take it on the chin too. Said another respondent: \"Too many agents are dabbling in short sales without training and are not properly advising sellers of options and recommending legal counsel.\"\nThe message here: Sellers should work only with agents who are experienced and trained in handling short sales. So should buyers, because other respondents say many uninformed agents tend to give advice outside the scope of their expertise.\nThe situation is much the same when the house is a foreclosure and the seller is the bank. Nearly half the respondents said \"real estate owned\" (bank-owned) properties are already the basis of a significant number of disputes, and almost two-thirds think disputes over REOs is likely to increase over the next two years.\nGenerally, banks believe they have no duty to disclose anything about the property. As far as they are concerned, an REO is sold as is. Often, they do little or nothing to prevent damage to houses during the long, drawn-out repossession process.\nBut an Idaho respondent said: \"Although folks understand the 'as is' clause, when the property is bank-owned, buyers and agents still expect banks to fix issues that are a threat to health and safety. Banks are not [doing that], and ugly battles ensue.\"\nEven when the house is not a short sale or foreclosure, property condition disclosure is a big bugaboo: Nearly 95% of the respondents say the issue is the basis of either a moderate or high number of legal disputes.\nEspecially bothersome are structural defects discovered after the deal is done.

{"idx": "32419", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: One of the key benefits Norwich Research Park offers is the enormous opportunity for collaboration. With 12,000 people, including 3,000 scientists and clinicians, we have a community of communities that is working together to solve some of the world's biggest problems in agriculture, food and health through ground-breaking research.\nNorwich Research Park is truly unique in the UK in being the home to so many different highly-regarded organisations: a university, a university hospital and four world-leading research institutes alongside more than 80 businesses. There's also an abundance of land to continue building a truly significant location to host the world's best life sciences, research and tech organisations.\nBuilding on existing research strengths, Norwich Research Park will become a global centre, attracting the best minds and making it easier for people with different specialisms to work together for the benefit of humanity.\nFor instance, a project delivered by researchers from the Earlham Institute, John Innes Centre, and University of East Anglia (UEA) will ultimately help to feed the world. It has developed a new system called CropSight that uses near real-time environmental and crop growth monitoring data to improve crop performance.\nCapturing data like this (known as Big Data) presents a major challenge for plant scientists trying to understand the dynamics between crop performance, genotypes and environmental factors and for agronomists and farmers monitoring crops in fluctuating agricultural conditions.\nCropSight uses smart devices located in fields that are linked to computers in a lab to help them to understand the best times for planting, fertilising, watering and harvesting. With all three partners being based on Norwich Research Park it was much easier and quicker for them to progress their developments as all the expertise was located in the same place.\nAnother good example of collaboration is a project that is being funded by Big C cancer charity, which is based at Norwich Research Park. Big C is funding research to find a way to help prevent breast cancer. It is being delivered jointly by the John Innes Centre, Quadram Institute and the UEA's Norwich Medical School.\nScientists at the Quadram Institute have been looking at the role that microbes which reside in our digestive systems have on the development of breast cancer. To complement this work, The John Innes Centre has generated a suite of experimental tomato strains, enriched to produce specific molecules that are thought to be responsible for the health promoting properties of certain plants and the things we produce from them like red berries, red wine and soy. Diets based on these enriched tomato lines have been shown to influence the gut microbiota ecosystem and reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.\nA third example of collaborative success is the work being done by scientists at the newly-opened Quadram Institute in partnership with the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital to help people stay healthier as they live longer.\nThe brand new building brings together clinicians from the Gastroenterology Department at the hospital with scientists from Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) to study the relationship between food science, gut biology and health. They are supported by state-of-the-art technologies including one of the largest endoscopy units in Europe that will make Norwich a hub for gut health and nutrition. This new facility gives us a massive opportunity to lead the way in how clinicians, scientists and patients can work together to solve some of society's most pressing health problems.\nThese are just three of the incredible collaborations designed, to change lives, that are happening now at Norwich Research Park. We have a fantastic opportunity to create a place where collaborative working delivers solutions to"}

On November 10, she wrote a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter endorsing Eshoo and urging Democrats to back her for the job.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Dave Weigel, his Democratic sources say that the vote was heavily influenced by a scolding Pelosi received from Comedy Central host Jon Stewart on Tuesday night. \u201cOn Tuesday night\u2019s episode of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart devoted five minutes to an attack on Pelosi, titled \u201cPetty Woman,\u201d ending by muttering that it might be time for her to go,\u201d Weigel reported.\nRepublicans, we were told, are controlled by what is said on a cable news network.

He concluded that affluent middle class growth was modest and only slightly ahead of population growth.\nThe World Bank defines a middle class consumer as earning between $2 and $13 (United States dollars) per day, while the African Development Bank has an upper limit of $20 per day.\nThese organisations calculate that there are about 300-million middle class Africans. But the size of South Africa\u2019s middle class and its performance cannot be compared either to the rest of the continent or to international data for other developing markets.\nSouth Africa\u2019s figures are distorted particularly by the practice of adding the top earners \u2014 the upper class for most of the world \u2014 into the middle class category. About 3% of the population, the wealthiest population sector has enjoyed the biggest growth in earnings since 1994 and so grossly distorts the progress of our middle class.\nTherefore, BEE statistics could reflect a disproportionate influence by the black diamonds, obscuring the role played in South Africa by rising crime and corruption.\nEY (formerly Ernst & Young) and other reputable companies have pointed out that about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s African middle class earn only between $2 to $4 per day, way"}

China sees the company as a pivotal driver of its ambitions for global technological leadership. Increasingly, much of the rest of the world sees it as a potential conduit for espionage and sabotage.\nThe Canadian government said Wednesday that it had detained Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Saturday in Vancouver, while she was transferring flights. The United States is seeking Meng\u2019s extradition but has not said what prompted the arrest.\nAt a daily news briefing Thursday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said it had asked U.S. and Canadian officials to give a reason for the detention and to immediately release Meng.\nIn response, Huawei focused its business efforts elsewhere. Its success in wealthy places such as Europe has helped it become the largest maker of telecommunications equipment, as well as the No. 2 smartphone brand. Of the more than $90 billion (U.S.) in revenue it earned last year, more than a quarter came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nIn April, the Commerce Department banned ZTE from using components made in the United States after saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The move was effectively a death sentence because ZTE relied heavily on American microchips and other technology.\nIn building its case against ZTE, the U.S. government began investigating Huawei as well.\nWhen the Commerce Department first announced its findings against ZTE in 2016, it released an internal ZTE document illustrating best practices for evading U.S. sanctions.\nThe probe widened this year when the Treasury and Commerce Departments asked the Justice Department to investigate Huawei for possible sanctions violations. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York took on the case.\nEventually, the Trump administration decided to ease its punishment of ZTE, in an effort to cool tensions with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, before a historic North Korea meeting.\nBut the power that Washington wielded over the fates of Chinese tech companies had been made very clear to people on both sides of the Pacific. In October, the Commerce Department imposed export controls on Fujian Jinhua, a state-backed semiconductor company that has been accused of stealing American chip designs.\nOne crucial difference is that Huawei, unlike ZTE, does not depend extensively on outside vendors such as Qualcomm for the main microchips in its smartphones. Around two-thirds of the handsets that Huawei sells contain chips made in-house, said Sean Kao, a hardware analyst at the research firm IDC.\nStill, American firms supply other kinds of chips in Huawei\u2019s gear as well as optical equipment for its fibre cable networks and other specialized parts."}

Doctors may no longer be advised to avoid diagnoses of depression after the death of a loved one, and Asperger's syndrome may be folded into the spectrum of autism.\nThis weekend, 20 people from around the country will meet in a nondescript hotel room in Arlington, Va., and take a vote. A passing stranger who stumbled on this group wouldn't see much of anything, just a bunch of graying academic types sitting around a table.\nBut millions of people will be touched by that vote because the graying academic types are voting to approve the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \u2014 the bible of psychiatry.\nThe DSM, published by the American Psychiatric Association, is an enormous tome that defines every mental disorder. And in defining every mental disorder, it helps determine many other things, such as how struggling children are treated in school.\nIf the disruptive behavior of a child is seen as a disorder \u2014 like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism \u2014 schools will help with subsidized services. If not? Well, then the schools often see the child as just trouble, and the child will be penalized.\nSo it's no surprise that there's lots of controversy every time the DSM is revised, with people arguing that the new definitions are too narrow or too broad. And the DSM-5 is no exception \u2014 it's considered the single most controversial DSM of them all.\nSo what are the likely changes? How have the many controversies been decided?\nThe APA refuses to say anything about what's in and what's out, and they've also told people associated with the DSM-5 that they shouldn't speak specifically, so it's very hard to know. But some of the changes that were published last year on the APA website (they've since been removed) are likely.\nAsperger's Syndrome may be eliminated: Asperger's Syndrome is currently a popular diagnosis, but soon it may not be used by mental health professionals to identify people with mild autism. Instead, there will be a spectrum of autism, and people who would once have been diagnosed with Asperger's will instead be diagnosed as mildly autistic.\nMany people with Asperger's syndrome opposed this change. \"People with Asperger's preferred that identity, as opposed to being seen as part of autism spectrum. I think that's been part of the complaint,\" says Roger Peele, secretary of the APA.\nThere will likely be a new childhood disorder called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: The people in charge of childhood disorders proposed this diagnosis because they felt very strongly that too many children were being categorized as having bipolar disorder and then prescribed anti-psychotic drugs.\nThe hope is that psychiatrists will use this new diagnosis for kids, instead of bipolar disorder, and not prescribe as many drugs. Critics say it's not clear that the change will work out, and that the history of mental health is littered with good intentions like this gone terribly wrong. But the hope is that it will shut down the rise of bipolar diagnoses in children.\nThere will be a new way to think about sadness in the wake of the death of a loved one: In the last DSM (DSM-4), psychiatrists were warned away from diagnosing major depression in people who"}

The research was done by Africa Tech Week, Topco Research, xTech.Institute and ExO Works.\nThe researchers say the ExQ ranking is the leading framework that \"indicates an organisation's ability to grow exponentially, and adapt and scale with the agility required to thrive in a new era of accelerating, or exponential, technologies\".\nThe ExQ is the measurement of growth potential that was developed as part of \"Exponential Organisations\", a best-seller book by Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest and Michael Malone.\n\"Of course, there are a number of factors that impact the rise and fall of company share price and value, but the ExQ gives a clear indication of a company's ability and readiness to adapt to the exponential changes taking place in the world today, and to seize the associated opportunities. Think of it as a growth-potential measurement,\" explains Willem van der Post of xTech.Institute.\nIn 2015, an ExQ ranking was performed on the Fortune 100 companies. In the three-and-a-half years since the original scoring, the companies in the top 10 grew by an average of 53% and those in the bottom 10 by just 2%, underlining the importance of understanding a company's ExQ, researchers say.\nThe results of the JSE ExQ survey were announced at Africa Tech Week.\nThe study gave each JSE top 40 company an ExQ score which was \"researched through company analysis, limited staff and employee interviews, press releases and the information available in the public domain\". An ExQ score above 65 is considered 'exponential organisation', as an international benchmark.\nSouth African insurer Discovery was the only company to score in the Exponential Organisation range with a score of 68. This made it the number one JSE top 40 company in terms of exponentiality.\nLocal telcos Vodacom and MTN came in second and third place, with scores of 63 and 60 respectively. Internet and media group Naspers and retailer Woolworths were tied in fourth place, with a score of 58.\n\"Although only one JSE company scored in the Exponential Organisation range, we are excited by South African companies' potential to adopt the attributes shared by the world's most exponential organisations in order to drive performance,\" says Emilie Sydney-Smith, CEO of ExO Works.\nThe results, however, showed the South African market lags behind global top performing companies, and the mining and real estate sectors are lagging behind the rest of the South African business sectors.

It happens because of inertia; either not knowing about soon-to-impact change forces and therefore not doing anything about it, or knowing but being unable to react appropriately to it,\" says Van der Post.\n\"Exponential transformation is about so much more than just digital transformation.

The top priority is breaking the pattern with a winning record in October.\nWho\u2019s the No. 1 Goalie?\nIs it Steve Mason or Michal Neuvirth? Although Mason will start the season as the No. 1 goalie, backup Michal Neuvirth proved last year he is also more than capable of handling role. It should be interesting to see which netminder ends the season as the Flyers No. 1 goalie.\nShayne Gostisbehere was the first of many heralded prospects to get the call up to Flyers last year, posted historic numbers and was a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the league\u2019s top rookie. Ivan Provorov and Travis Konecny, both 19 years old and 2015 first round draft picks, made the Flyers out of training camp and hope to continue what Gostisbehere started.\nDon\u2019t be shocked if defensemen Sam Morin and Travis Sanheim, each first round picks in 2013 and \u201914, respectively, are next to get their shot with the Flyers. They are starting the season with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, but one or both might end up in Philly full-time before the year is over.\nAfter posting 17 goals, including five game-winners in overtime, and 29 assists for 46 points in 64 games, \u201cGhost\u201d hopes to avoid the proverbial sophomore slump.

Without both units in the top half in the league, they will struggle to make a second straight postseason appearance.\nSo, are they headed back? As long as they remain relatively healthy, particularly in goal, the Flyers have the talent on defense and offense to contend for a playoff spot, but it will likely go down to the wire again whether or not they get in."}

Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and durable development require a satisfactory level of security and tackling issues such as unemployment, corruption, and armed violence.\nSince 2001 many reconstruction and assistance efforts have been conducted in Afghanistan but their real impact is limited by the security context and corruption. Foreign material and financial assistance have been hamstrung by embezzlement and misappropriation.\nMany examples can be easily found in Kabul and across the country. In Kabul\u2019s Parwan-e-seh district, the main road was in bad shape and looked as if it had been built during the 1970s or the 1980s. According to some local residents, the road had been built during the 2000s and the main cause of its deplorable condition was corruption. The pavement was only 9 cm-thick, although its design thickness was 18 cm and its maintenance was almost nonexistent.\nIn many rural areas, although schools were built with the financial support of foreign countries, NGOs or organizations, funds have disappeared, leaving schools often unfinished or badly constructed. with furniture, windows, heating systems, decent toilets or electricity missing.\nNATO-led International Security Assistance Force Provincial Reconstruction Teams after 2001, did great work but that ended with the withdrawal of ISAF troops. The action of the teams sparked debate and was criticized by some NGOs as it could create confusion in the minds of local populations about the nature of humanitarian assistance, as well as the role of foreign armed forces and foreign NGOs.\nMany foreign or local NGOs operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan have reported that after the elimination of Osama bin Laden by a team of US Navy SEALs in Abbottabad in May 2011, they faced more difficulty in carrying out their operations. That is because one of the methods used by the CIA to identify Osama bin Laden took the form of a fake vaccination program conducted in Abbottabad, which seriously undermined the trust of local populations towards NGOs, and especially foreign aid workers.\nThe current security context is critical. The Taliban controls 44 percent to 61 percent of Afghan districts and the Islamic State is conducting terrorist attacks. The current negotiations are an important step but their outcome will not bring a stable and immediate peace. Only a fraction of the Taliban has endorsed this process and agrees to participate to it as the whole Taliban movement remains divided. Some factions want full withdrawal of foreign troops and of all foreign presence, as well as the resignation of the current Afghan government. This precondition can\u2019t be satisfied as it would put the current Afghan government at risk and trigger a new phase of conflict.\nSuch possibility would not create a proper context for reconstruction. Moreover, since the fall of its Syrian and Iraqi Caliphate, the Islamic State has found new momentum in Afghanistan and some Taliban factions have pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, while others refuse to do so and are engaged in fierce competition with ISIS.\nIn this regard, reconstruction and development will depend on the context created by the peace deal and a satisfactory agreement for all parties, which is far from being easy. All parties have ties to foreign and neighboring countries. That means that foreign powers and neighboring countries should reassess their agendas and interests. They should also find common interests and a joint approach, at least with regard to the reconstruction.\nSecurity conditions and corruption are also closely tied to social and economic problems affecting rural areas"}

Publication bans are usually in place on evidence presented at preliminary hearings \u2014 which are held to determine if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial \u2014 but no ban was requested at this one.\nHauk owned the Saskatchewan Compassion Club, Britnell was an employee and Hagel was a volunteer.

Both officers also said they were unaware of any public complaints made to police about the dispensary.\nPolice were investigating marijuana trafficking and no simple possession charges were laid, the Crown clarified during cross-examination.

Don\u2019t forget that many herbs can be used as ornamentals in the landscape, too.\nMany people are already growing blueberries, figs, grapes, loquats and many types of citrus in their yards. But there are also several tropical fruits that can be grown here, such as Abiu, Sugar Apple, Canistel, Guava and Black Sapote.\nFor anyone interested in growing some of these tropical delights, check out our website at http://fruitscapes.ifas.ufl.edu/ for a complete list of fruit crops. For now, here is some information on a few of the tropical fruits you can choose from.\nBananas are a true tropical favorite and perhaps the best known of the tropical fruits. There are many different cultivars that are available with a wide variation in fruit type and quality. Bananas are not cold tolerant, so for those that live in colder areas, be sure and choose a cultivar that can produce fruit in nine months or so. Often, even if the plant gets hit by a freeze, it will re-grow from the roots, so rarely are plants totally killed by a freeze. If you don\u2019t choose a fast-maturing variety, you may not get many bananas produced. Some of the longer-maturing varieties are better suited for Merritt Island, the beaches and South Florida. Banana plants grow rapidly during the warm and wet summer months. Because they reproduce from underground rhizomes, a single plant can quickly spread out, producing multiple trunks in a matter of a few months. Fruits develop in clusters on the end of flower stalks, usually within one to two years. Shortly after producing the fruit, the stem dies. Bananas do best in full sun and moist, well-drained soil. Though they will tolerate partial shade, the growth and fruit production will be diminished.\nIf you grow Jackfruit, you will certainly get your neighbors\u2019 attention. This tree, which grows 30 to 40 feet tall, produces a fruit that can weight up to 60 pounds! There are a few cultivars that produce smaller fruits that only weigh 3 to 10 pounds.\nThe outside of the fruit is rough and thick but the inside contains a pulp that is sweet and aromatic. The pulp color can vary from amber to yellow to dark yellow or orange. The time it takes from flowering to a mature fruit ranges from 150 to 180 days.\nFor optimum fruit production, trees should be watered during prolonged dry spells.\nToday is the day the big Annual Fruit Tree Sale by the Brevard Rare Fruit Council! The sale runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Melbourne Auditorium located at 625 E. Hibiscus Blvd. They will be selling about 60 different types of deciduous, subtropical and tropical fruits.

Set against the sweeping vistas of Wyoming and Texas, the film tells the story of two young men \u2013 a ranch-hand and a rodeo cowboy \u2013 who meet in the summer of 1963, and unexpectedly forge a lifelong connection, one whose complications, joys and tragedies provide a testament to the endurance and power of love. Early one morning in Signal, Wyoming, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet while lining up for employment with local rancher Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). The world which Ennis and Jack have been born into is at once changing rapidly and yet scarcely evolving. Both young men seem certain of their set places in the heartland \u2013 obtaining steady work, marrying and raising a family \u2013 and yet hunger for something beyond what they can articulate. When Aguirre dispatches them to work as sheepherders up on the majestic Brokeback Mountain, they gravitate towards camaraderie and then a deeper intimacy. At summer's end, the two must come down from Brokeback and part ways. Remaining in Wyoming, Ennis weds his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), with whom he will have two daughters as he ekes out a living. Jack, in Texas, catches the eye of a rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Their courtship and marriage result in a son, as well as jobs in her father's business. Four years pass. One day, Alma brings Ennis a postcard from Jack, who is en route to visit Wyoming. Ennis waits expectantly for his friend, and when Jack at last arrives, in just one moment it is clear that the passage of time has only strengthened the men's attachment. In the years that follow, Ennis and Jack struggle to keep their secret bond alive. They meet up several times annually. Even when they are apart, they face the eternal questions of fidelity, commitment and trust. Ultimately, the one constant in their lives is a force of nature \u2013 love."}

The RLD chief said the election guarantee sought by the governor for the two leaders, Tara Chand Shastri and Khalid Chaudhury, before oath was irrelevant. He said even if there was vacancy in the House, it was not necessary that they would have won the election to continue as ministers.\nHe said Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had sent the names to the governor and the issue was still pending there. Singh said the RLD was not in the picture. New names could be considered only after the present issue was settled, Singh said adding there was no resentment in the RLD over the names of Shastri and Khalid. However, Singh refused to comment on the chief minister\u2019s statement that Rajeswar was a Congress agent.\nReferring to electoral alliance for assembly election, Singh said the party had so far not taken any decision on the issue. Reiterating that the issue would be decided only after consulting workers, Singh said the alliance would be on issues like reorganization of state, policy on farmers\u2019 land acquisition and problem of rural areas.\nHe said people wanted development, which was not possible without further division of the state. He said there should also be change in the cooperative laws to help farmers. He said the poll pact issue would now be taken up after the civic election. Singh said the party had decided to go it alone in the civic election. The RLD has fielded six mayoral candidates."}

But as a lawyer practicing in southwest Minnesota, he did think his experiences could bring a good perspective to the job.\nThis week, Bush will be retiring after 12 years on the judicial bench. He says it\u2019s been both a challenging and a rewarding experience.\n\u201cFor the most part, it\u2019s certainly been a positive experience. It\u2019s been a learning experience,\u201d Bush said.\nBush has been a lifelong resident of southwest Minnesota.\n\u201cI grew up with a Russell address,\u201d he said, and graduated from Russell High School. He attended Macalester College in St. Paul, but he came back to southwest Minnesota, graduating from what is now Southwest Minnesota State University in 1973.\nBush went on to graduate from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1976. After graduation, he became an attorney in the law office of David Watson in Tyler. In 1979, he started his own business as an attorney.\nIt wasn\u2019t until he had been a lawyer for 25 years that Bush applied to be a judge.\n\u201cI recall I had some folks suggest I consider that,\u201d he said. He talked it over with the staff at his law office before deciding to apply.\nThe process to apply to be a judge involves interviews with a screening committee and with the Minnesota governor, Bush said. It was a long process for him, but in 2002 Bush was appointed to be a judge by Gov. Jesse Ventura.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty humbling experience,\u201d he said of being sworn in.\nIn his years as a judge, Bush said he\u2019s seen and learned a lot.\nIn court, Bush said, you often see people in difficult situations. \u201cYou have to be patient and tolerant, and try to be calm. It\u2019s important to be pleasant.\u201d People in court \u2014 especially those representing themselves \u2014 usually have enough to deal with without a judge being rude, he said.\nIn his time as a judge, Bush said, \u201cWe had some significant cases, but the truth is they\u2019re all significant,\u201d especially to the people involved.\nFraga was initially convicted of murder in 2009, but the discovery of new evidence overturned his conviction, and he was granted a new trial. Fraga\u2019s second conviction, in 2013, was vacated after a successful appeal citing juror bias. The third trial got a change of venue from Nobles County to Lyon County.\nAt the end of the third trial, Fraga was convicted of five counts of murder, and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\nBut Bush has also heard many cases that are less high-profile, from traffic offenses to civil and family court cases. Adoptions are a positive experience to preside over, he said.\nBush has also been part of Lyon County\u2019s drug court program, which started in 2009. Drug court offers an alternative to prison for qualifying drug offenders, and focuses more on drug treatment and rehabilitation.\nIt takes a lot of people to make a courtroom run, and Bush said he\u2019s glad to have worked with everyone at the Lyon County District Court.\n\u201cI have enjoyed the opportunity of working with good staff here in the Court Administrator\u2019s office, and I have an excellent court reporter,\u201d he said.\nBush said his official last day as a judge will be Friday, but he will be continuing to work while a judge is appointed to replace him.\nIn May, Gov.

Host Don Lemon brought on recently victorious Senator Tim Scott (R \u2013 S.C.) to congratulate him on his win and discuss a few of the issues Scott will be focusing on in the upcoming term. But he also took the conversation down a couple of rabbit holes, first trying to get Scott to comment on why the NAACP had failed to call and congratulate either him or Representative-elect Mia Love (R \u2013 Utah 4) following the election.

It\u2019s top-down patriotism, a prescriptive ritual that relies less on heart and more on automation\u2014and that\u2019s by design.\nFirst thing\u2019s first, there were once two pledges of allegiance. The original was a simple one-liner penned in 1887 by veteran-turned-teacher George Balch: \u201cWe give our heads and hearts to God and our country; one country, one language, one flag.\u201d Like many of his era, Balch worried patriotism was waning, and he hoped his ode would help indoctrinate both children and immigrants with love of country. But though his pledge had national recognition for a while\u2014the Daughters of the Revolution were hot on it for decades\u2014it was eventually eclipsed by the one we all know so well, the pledge penned by Francis Bellamy, in 1892.\nFrancis Bellamy shouldn\u2019t be confused with Edward Bellamy, socialist author of the seminal utopian tome Looking Backward. That\u2019s Francis\u2019 older cousin, but the younger Bellamy was just as left-leaning, a stance that cost him his job as a Baptist preacher but earned him the respect of Daniel Ford, Boston-based publisher of the popular magazine The Youth\u2019s Companion. Like Balch, Ford believed children should be taught love of \u2018Merica right alongside reading, writing and \u2018rithmatic, and in 1888 he embarked on a four-year mission to spread the American flag to schools and homes across the land, using his magazine as the media for a patriotic message.\nThese flags weren\u2019t free, of course. They cost $10 (which comes to $250 in 2017 dollars), and within four years Ford and his team had sold 26,000, raking in $260,000 in the process (which comes to $6.5 million in 2017 dollars), largely from public school students who pooled their money. Ford knew there was even more room for manufactured patriotism and profit, especially with the forthcoming 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019 \u201cdiscovery\u201d of America. So, with that in mind, he tasked Bellamy with writing a new and improved pledge.\nThough \u201cunder God\u201d was dressed up as a non-secular homage to Lincoln\u2019s use of the phrase in the Gettysburg address\u2014\u201cThese dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom\u201d\u2014it was the result of years\u2019 worth of religious lobbying, which found a sympathetic ear in a recent Presbyterian convert, President Dwight Eisenhower. (The freshly \u201csaved\u201d Ike also made \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d our national motto two years later, in 1956.) No one noted in 1954 that Lincoln\u2019s usage of \u201cunder God\u201d was more akin to \u201cGod willing,\u201d a fact Geoffrey Nunberg noted in 2004. Not that too many would have cared, anyway."}

Previously the company maintained that it was merely a provider of equipment allowing its users to receive over-the-air broadcast transmissions on digital devices. But after the high court likened the service to a cable company, Aereo decided to move completely in that direction by calling itself one.\nSection 111 of the Copyright Act established a compulsory licensing system under which cable systems may make secondary transmissions of copyrighted works.\nOther digital TV upstarts like Ivi and FilmOn have previously attempted to wrap themselves in the Section 111 banner, but in August 2012, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that \"Congress has not codified a statutory provision for Internet retransmissions.\"\nAereo's interpreted the Supreme Court's decision to mean that the Ivi precedent had been overruled, but the Copyright Office points to the Ivi ruling's holding that Section 111 is meant to encompass \"localized retransmission services\" that are \"regulated as cable systems by the FCC.\"\n\"We do not see anything in the Supreme Court's recent decision ... that would alter this conclusion,\" writes Copyright Office general counsel Jacqueline Charlesworth.\nAs a result, the $5,310.74 that Aereo attempted to tender as its royalty and filing fees won't be processed.

The roughly 33 per cent increase stands in contrast to Toronto, which saw sales drop by about 285 per cent in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017.\nDriving growth in Calgary is affordability.\nOn a cost per square foot basis, the report found in Calgary a new townhouse\u2019s ask price was $275 whereas in Vancouver the cost per square foot was $575, and Toronto is was $400.

Over the past decade, they\u2019ve bought and sold tens of thousands of oil leases in the Permian Basin, making deals blessed with a handshake in diners, on the hoods of trucks and in bars such as this.\nThe co-CEOs of Double Eagle Energy III Holdings LLC may be the most prolific, and richest, Texas dealmakers you\u2019ve never heard of. At just 36 years old, they\u2019ve personally made at least $500 million combined, according to an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, based on typical deals in the sector. They declined comment on their wealth.\nThe oil industry has produced many billion-dollar fortunes, from H.L. Hunt, who rose to fame in the 1930s, to Harold Hamm, who led the innovations in shale that began in the 2000s. But while most were made from striking oil, the new game in town is land. Sellers and Campbell began as land men, specialists in buying and quickly selling drilling rights, which, in Texas, are all privately owned.\nPecos, Texas is one of the cities in the Permian Basin that has felt the biggest economic growth due to the increase energy and oil business.\nThey\u2019re not alone. Dozens of young entrepreneurs, mostly in their 30s, are running private-equity-backed companies in the frenzied boom in West Texas and New Mexico that may each be worth billions of dollars.\nWhether they realize that kind of cash will depend, of course, on the vagaries of the shale industry, where consistent profits remain elusive. Rising costs and pipeline shortages have put the breaks on growth this year. And like any property boom, an early entry can make a career while being late can break one. Many of the young men admire the late Aubrey McClendon, the founder of Chesapeake Energy Corp., who became a billionaire leasing land for natural gas drilling in the 2000s. But he\u2019s a cautionary tale: He was ousted after he had borrowed heavily betting on rising gas prices that never came.\nThe young upstarts are unperturbed by all that.

That ratio climbed to 14.5% in the 1990s and, then, soared to an average of 21.1% in the first decade of this century, before peaking at 24.7% in 2011-12.\nThe above surge was largely due to globalisation and liberalisation.\nIn short, the 20 years after 1991 can be called the golden age of Indian capitalism.\nThis fairy-tale story, sadly, ended after 2011-12. Like all good things, it probably had to. Gross fixed capital formation in the private sector, as already alluded to, peaked at 27% in 2011-12. Subsequently, however, it fell steadily to touch 21.1-21.4% in 2015-16 and 2016-17. And most strikingly, there has been no recovery even with a supposedly pro-business \u201cminimum government, maximum governance\u201d regime of prime minister Narendra Modi taking over the reins in New Delhi after May 2014.\nBut the current decade\u2019s story isn\u2019t just of an investment slowdown.

Equally significant is the destruction of capital that has taken place. This capital was basically created during the previous boom period, on the back of excessive risk taking and piling up of debts by corporates.\nIn November 2012, the Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse estimated the aggregate debt of a sample of 3,700 listed companies at $401.2 billion or nearly Rs21.8 lakh crore.

Millions around the country and the world want to take a stand. We have built solidarity meetings in a number of cities, raised money and sent representatives to Standing Rock. But now is the time for escalating solidarity protests around the country.\nLast week a police force backed by corporate paramilitary agents and armored vehicles moved against indigenous people and other activists courageously protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. Activists were beaten, maced, pepper-sprayed, shot with rubber bullets and threatened with automatic weapons. At a time when scientists say that even the Paris Climate Accord is woefully inadequate to keep the warming of the planet to under 2 degrees Celsius, this struggle highlights the need to escalate our fight against climate change and link it to a struggle against a system that not only destroys our environment, but also rests on the oppression of native people, people of color, and the exploitation of workers.\nThe 1,134-mile pipeline would transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago. Central to this struggle is the decision to route the pipeline upstream of the Missouri River, the major water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. With over 2,000 pipeline ruptures and spills in the last ten years, there is very real fear of major pollution with detrimental effects on health for Standing Rock Sioux tribal members, as well as the millions of people who rely on the river for drinking water. The decision to re-route the pipeline away from a white neighborhood further North when they protested it, and the brutal attacks on the encampments, demonstrate the racist character of this whole project and the state forces promoting it.\n350.org co-founder Bill McKibben has stated that the encampment on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where representatives of more than 200 tribes have come together, as \u201cthe most dramatic show of force of this environmental movement\u201d. This show of strength by the tribes follows the recent \u201cIdle No More\u201d indigenous movement in Canada, which won victories against pipelines and helped to inspire the successful West Coast struggle to block six coal export terminals. The issue of preserving land and water is central to indigenous peoples, having been brutally driven off their original tribal lands by US authorities in the past.\nRepublicans are funded to the hilt by oil money. But so are the Democrats, and it was the Obama administration which oversaw the largest increase in oil extraction in a generation and whose State Department pushed fracking globally.

This radical change kept the game moving, since the lack of real estate meant tighter quarters and more contact. But it also altered the game in a way that might turn off experienced players.\nI'm a fighting game nut, so Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was high on my list of games to see at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Once I started playing, the controls were not what I expected.\nOn the one hand, they're simpler than ever before, with three attack buttons (no longer separated into punches or kicks) and a single \"air combo\" button for knocking opponents skyward. If that isn't accessible enough for you, a new \"simple mode\" control style lets players execute advanced moves without the need for complicated joystick and button commands.\nWhile playing Marvel vs. Capcom 3, I kept thinking of the old Capcom fighting games and continually confused myself by pressing the wrong buttons at the wrong times. I can see the virtues of the new control scheme, but it's not going to come easy to veterans used to six separate attack buttons.\nI still have mixed feelings about the new art style. Capcom's previous Marvel games featured wonderful 2-D sprites. Marvel vs. Capcom 3 follows Street Fighter 4's design with 3-D models that look like cartoons. While I miss the hand-drawn animation of the past, the new look allows for impressive special effects.\nFor example, while playing as Dormammu I used a super attack that grabbed my opponent and pulled him into the ground. Suddenly he was floating inside a red orb, and the camera pulled back to reveal that orb clenched between my fingers. I crushed the orb and knocked him out. Those sort of sweeping changes in perspective and scale would be impossible with 2-D sprites.\nThe game's full roster of characters has yet to be revealed, but here in Tokyo there were 18 to choose from, including Dormammu and Viewtiful Joe, announced last month.

The potential of a hefty payday combined with a flexible schedule is certainly enticing -- and if you're a people person, you'll never feel more at home.\nBut don't be fooled by glitzy reality shows about Realtors selling giant houses and making easy millions. Real estate agents are essentially self-employed, and often put in a ton of work and training (not to mention their own money) to succeed. Combine the cost of classes, exams, business cards and advertising and new agents can easily spend up to $2,000 in just their first year.\nStill, in an industry teeming with potential, those who enter it are excited to learn the tricks of the trade.

Yet when you look closer, each aspiring agent's path is different -- not just because of people's personal paths, but because of where they chose to become an agent.\nAfter all, the specific details within the requirements for getting into real estate vary from state to state. A real estate agent from New York can talk all about how they got to where they are, but an agent from Nebraska took a different path.\nYou'll often need to take several different courses before taking your licensing exam. You'll almost certainly be paying at least $200 or more for these classes regardless of your location, and that's on the low end. For example, Brightwood College offers classes in Georgia starting at $299, while the New York Real Estate Institute (NYREI) offers salesperson-licensing courses for $395.\nYou can take your classes at real estate institutes or certain colleges, and there are also plenty of online options that can fit into a busy schedule. Just remember to get your transcripts and a certificate that confirms completion of the courses after you're done. You'll need these for your license application.\nIn addition to your required coursework, many institutions also offer exam-prep courses. They're not mandatory, but many applicants enroll in one or more to feel comfortable when taking the licensing exam.\nOnce you've completed coursework, you're ready to apply for your real estate license and take the required test. Expect to pay more than $300 for your license application, exam, background checks and the license itself (assuming that you pass the test).\nHow likely is it that you'll pass on the first try? According to the Texas Real Estate Commission's information on Provider Exam Passage Rates, 57.4% of applicants who took the Texas test between February 2016 and February 2018 passed.

A tribute.\nIn the early days of October news came from Vietnam of the death of General Vo Nguyen Giap, at the age of 102. Second in reverence only to Ho Chi Minh, General Giap came to symbolise the success of what has come to be more recently defined as asymmetrical warfare. At the outset of the modern Vietnam independence struggle, the Viet Minh numbered in the hundreds and increased from small-scale guerrilla units to more conventional large-scale battle formations, defeating in turn the French colonial occupation forces and the mighty United States (US) and its neocolonial puppets.\nGiap, like many other revolutionary leaders, came from a comfortable landowning family. His father, functioning as a low-level bureaucrat under French colonial administration, was imprisoned in 1919 for nationalist agitation, where he died as did his sister. He attended the same Lyc\u00e9e as Ho Chi Minh, and Ngo Dinh Diem, the latter going on to become president of South Vietnam until he lost US support and was assassinated in 1963. Giap was expelled from the Lyc\u00e9e for nationalist agitation, followed by his arrest in 1930, spending a bit more than a year in prison. He took a BA in Law at the University of Hanoi, but failed the certificate exam due to his time-consuming political activity. His inability to practise law led him to a position as a history teacher, where he became familiar with Napoleon and T E Lawrence. He later came to be known by his adversaries as the \u201cRed Napoleon\u201d.\nPrior to leaving for China in 1940 he founded a socialist youth newspaper. He returned to the Viet Bac, the northern six provinces of Vietnam inhabited mostly by minority people, in 1942. When I visited that area in 1973 the commanding generals all expressed pride in it being a secure area whenever the Viet Minh needed an impenetrable refuge. (On the lighter side one of them leaned over at dinner and asked if I wanted the address in Hanoi of Ho Chi Minh\u2019s girlfriend, who was still alive. He was kicked under the table by one of his comrades.) While Giap no doubt gained from his experience in observing the development of the Chinese revolution on the ground, the adversarial challenges he was to face, on any scale, were, no doubt, significantly greater than that faced by Mao. This is no diminution of the latter.\nOn Christmas day of 1944 Giap was charged with the first military assault on a Vichy French outpost, which he captured. Four months later the Viet Minh force numbered 5,000. Two hundred of them were selected for training and arming by the US special forces in the attempt to drive out the Japanese forces who controlled the country with the cooperation of Vichy France. In August 1945 Giap led his forces into Hanoi, tactically retreating back to the Viet Bac the following year when French forces reoccupied the country. It took another eight years of guerrilla level fighting before the decisive battle of Dien Bien Phu took place. The French fortified the outpost hoping to sever Viet Minh supply lines,"}

Customers will need additional equipment to use the new feature.\nThe cable company will provide interested subscribers with the necessary adapter box, video camera, and special remote needed to connect to the service. It will also integrate Skype functionality into its Xfinity mobile app and will enable switching from one platform to another.\nLike the caller ID functionality supported for traditional phone calls, Skype calls will also appear in a similar manner. The service's instant messaging feature will also work when used with the special remote, which will include an integrated QWERTY keyboard.\nSkype and Comcast aim to begin trials for the service in the coming months, although they did not specify how the tests will run. Comcast did say that further details on the offering will be announced later this year, however.\nWhile Comcast's offering still suffers from the downfall of other current on-TV video calling services--the need for additional hardware--it does have one thing going for it: the cable provider's wide reach. Comcast had nearly 23 million subscribers at the end of last year, nearly double that of its closest competitor.\nOther video calling services simply do not have this reach. Take, for example, Cisco's recently announced product dubbed 'Umi.' That is a completely standalone service, and cost $599 for the set top box alone and an additional $24.99 monthly for service when it was introduced in October.\nUmi's failure to generate buzz forced Cisco to cut the price of both the equipment and service for Umi in March, and Cisco may now abandon the idea of consumer video conferencing altogether. As you can see, getting your product out in front of many people--and for a decent price--is pretty important.\nDepending on how Comcast markets it, the Skype integration could become quite popular. Obviously, making it cheap enough--or heck, even free--could go a long way toward enticing consumers to give it a try."}

This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities.\nThe fair housing group alleged that the woman, who lived at the property for more than 15 years, was discriminated against through retaliation due to the presence of her assistance animal. The allegations say the landlords issued false accusations that the animal was disruptive, that it bit maintenance workers and that it was not a service animal under California law.\nUltimately, the woman\u2019s Housing Assistance Program voucher was cancelled, forcing her to find housing elsewhere.\nA subsequent HUD investigation corroborated the woman\u2019s need for the dog and discovered written discriminatory statements made by the property managers.

And nowhere is that window more crucial than in prison, where books aren\u2019t just reading materials but insight on the outside world, and instruments of rehabilitation and education.\nUnfortunately, during this summer, someone used prison-bound books for something else, converting them into banned contraband. Several state prison staffers became ill from contact with book pages that had been soaked with a synthetic cannabanoid known as K2. To prevent that form of drug smuggling into prisons, Corrections Secretary John Wetzel announced in September that inmate\u2019s families and support groups, such as Pittsburgh\u2019s Book \u2018Em and others, no longer would be allowed to ship books to inmates. Instead, inmates would be limited to volumes in existing prison libraries and to ebooks, which was problematic because many inmates and their families could not afford the necessary electronic devices.\nThe ban produced a flood of letters, petitions and protests to Wetzel, Gov. Tom Wolf and state legislators. And to their great credit, they listened and came up with a compromise.\nNow, families, friends and support groups will be able to send books and magazines to specific prisoners through a central prison clearing site in Bellefonte, Centre County. The books will be screened for drugs and then delivered. Newspapers may be sent directly to inmates where they are incarcerated, and will be screened there.\nThe compromise is a smart one that serves prison safety while recognizing the high value of reading materials in fostering literacy, rehabilitation, education and inmate contact with the world outside their walls.

The Vikings get a tough customer to start the season as they open Friday at No. 2-ranked Adrian College.\nWhile the competition is tough, the Vikings have a few weapons of their own.\n\"The NCHA is the most entertaining conference in the nation because anyone can win every single night,\" said Lawrence coach Mike Szkodzinski, who has led his team to the playoffs in 11 of his 12 seasons. \"St. Norbert and Adrian have done that more consistently than most over the past few years, but we feel like we match up with anyone in the conference. We will battle every single night with pride and passion and let the results take care of themselves.\"\nThe Vikings lost All-American forward Lane King to graduation, and he's playing professionally with the Peoria Rivermen of the Southern Professional Hockey League. Lawrence's attack will be led by senior forward Josh Koepplinger, who poured in a team-high 17 goals to go with 13 assists for 30 points a season ago.\n\"Josh Koepplinger is poised to have a big year,\" Szkodzinski said. \"He has the size and offensive instincts to take another step. We seem to be deep up front and should be able to get contributions from several other players, including newcomers Taylor Urch and Charles Stewart, along with Vincent Dekumbis.\"\nLawrence returns a host of forwards, led by senior Nick Felan, who had six goals and 12 assists for 18 points while playing in only 21 games due to injury. Zach Briscoe (4-4-8), Jake Drinkard (4-3-7) and Matt Beranek (2-4-6) are also part of that group.\n\"We most definitely need some of our returning players to take the next step in their game,\" Szkodzinski said. \"Matt Beranek and Zach Briscoe are two guys we expect to contribute more on the scoresheet this year. We also feel like Jake Drinkard can be a force if he continues to use his size and strength around the net. Stewart and Urch have impressed us so far with their offensive zone instincts, but we will have to see how they handle the physicality of the NCHA.\"\nThe defense will again be centered around junior goaltender Evan Cline, who collected nine wins and a shutout a season ago.

{"idx": "32521", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Kingbirds are medium-sized flycatchers of semi-open and open country. The Western Kingbird breeds in Eastern Washington but a few always appear in Western Washington in spring. There have been a couple of sightings of this flycatcher around the Edmonds Marsh over the years. In recent years, a pair actually nested for several seasons on a utility pole near Lake Tye in Monroe.\nThe Western Kingbird is an insectivore, feeding mainly on wasps, bees, beetles and grasshoppers. It will also forage on flies, true bugs, caterpillars and moths. It eats small numbers of berries and fruits. It forages by watching from a perch and then flying out to snap up insects in its bill. It will catch insects in mid-air but will also hover and then drop to the ground to catch them.\nThe Western Kingbird can be found in open country, farms, along roadsides and in towns. It avoids true desert although it will inhabit semi-desert scrub. It looks for trees for its nest but will also nest on artificial structures. The male defends his territory by singing an extended dawn song, starting at the first hint of daylight. In courtship, he performs a flight display that includes rapidly flying up and down in vertical zigzags, while giving rapid sputtering calls.\nThe nest site is variable but it is usually in the vertical fork or on a horizontal limb of a tree. The Western Kingbird will also build its nest on a utility pole, on a building ledge or tower, in an empty shed, and even on a cliff ledge. It has been known to use the abandoned nest of another bird. The nest is a cup of grass, plant fibers, weeds and twigs. It is lined with finer materials such as feathers and plant down. The female incubates her three to five eggs for about two and a half weeks. Both adults feed the nestlings. The young leave the nest about 16-17 days after hatching.\nMost species of kingbirds have a hidden patch of colorful feathers on top of the head. During aggressive encounters with other species of birds, a kingbird may raise this crown, adding to its \u201ckingly\u201d aura. The oldest Western Kingbird of record was a male, at least six years and 11 months of age when found in South Dakota. There are several collective nouns for the various kingbird species, including coronation, court, and tyranny. Tyranny comes from the genus Tyrannus, the genus to which all kingbirds belong.\nOf the seven species of kingbirds that breed in the U.S., the Western Kingbird is largely a breeder of the western states. Most of the population winters from southern Mexico to Central America. A small population winters in southern Florida. The species often migrates in small flocks.\nThe Western Kingbird is common and its population remained stable between 1966 and 2014, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The breeding population is estimated at 22 million with 91 percent spending part of the year in the U.S., 49 percent in Mexico, and 5 percent breeding in Canada. The Western Kingbird seems to benefit from some human activities and has expanded its range since the late 1800s. The species spread eastward across the prairies as people planted trees. It also expanded across Texas as people cleared forests and installed utility poles and wires. The Western Kingbird is vulnerable to pesticides since it nests near cultivated crops and hunts for insects in farm fields."}

The aides presented him with a report alleging that officials in the State Department were deliberately preventing efforts by their own government to save Jews trapped in Europe.\nThe three \u2013 Josiah DuBois, Randolph Paul and John Pehle \u2013 all non-Jews, demanded that their boss take up their findings with the president.\nMorgenthau was the only Jewish member of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s cabinet, and he was also a close friend of the president. He was reluctant to jeopardize his relationship with his boss, and he was sensitive to the possibility of being accused of representing \u201cJewish interests\u201d over those of the United States, which had just entered its third year in World War II.\nBut the charges summarized in the 18-page report, which had been written by the 30-year-old DuBois, special assistant to Secretary Morgenthau, infuriated him to the point of taking action.\nThree days later, a Sunday, Morgenthau met with the president. He presented the findings, and at the same time offered FDR a way to refute the claim that his administration was anti-Jewish.\nSix days later, Roosevelt announced the establishment of the War Refugee Board, which during the final year of the war was instrumental in saving the lives of an estimated 220,000 people, most of them Jews.\nThe DuBois report enumerates a long list of charges against the State Department, and singles out then-Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long for having gone to great lengths to withhold information about the extent of the Nazi genocide of the Jews from the government, for acting to foil a variety of rescue efforts, and even for taking measures to prevent the U.S. from accepting even the small number of refugees for whom a quota existed during the most critical years of the Holocaust.\nThe most prominent example of negligence related to a 1943 plan raised by the World Jewish Congress for the ransom of some 70,000 Romanian and French Jews.\nBecause it was wartime, any transfer of money from the U.S. to enemy territory required approval from both the Treasury and State departments. Randolph Paul in the Treasury\u2019s foreign funds control unit had signed off on the transaction, and the paperwork was sent along to State, where it just sat. That's when DuBois learned about it.\nDuBois spent his Christmas Day writing up his memorandum, which he titled \u201cReport to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of the Jews.\u201d Its bottom line was that State Department officials, led by Breckinridge Long, \u201chave been guilty not only of gross procrastination and willful failure to act, but even of willful attempts to prevent action from being taken to rescue Jews from Hitler.\nMorgenthau was energized by the report, and acceded to his young aides' demand that he take the case to the president. Morgenthau, presidential historian Michael Beschloss has written, underwent a \u201ctransformation,\" and it constituted \"the supreme moment of his career. If going to Roosevelt made the President think of him as a special petitioner for his fellow Jews, so it would have to be. If his boldness jeop"}

A survey of crime laboratories found 80 percent of them to be understaffed.\nA new federal agency is needed to regulate these laboratories, standardize forensic techniques and pay for research, according to the report, which was financed by Congress in 2005.\nThe study recommends that an agency, to be called the National Institute of Forensic Science, be created and be independent of the Justice Department, which has traditionally been the nation\u2019s primary forensics research agency. Crime laboratories should be managed separately from police departments to ensure that their findings are protected from bias, the report said.\n\u201cThe potential for conflicts of interest between the needs of law enforcement and the broader needs of forensic science are too great,\u201d the authors wrote.\nThe report, the product of a two-year review by the academy, an independent body, is not legally binding. But legislators from both parties have already committed to holding hearings on the study, and officials from all the federal law enforcement agencies are reviewing the document in anticipation of possible policy changes.\n\u201cI am troubled by the report\u2019s general finding that far too many forensic disciplines lack the standards necessary to ensure their scientific reliability in court,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\nSenator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he was also troubled by the findings.\nThe report calls into question the scientific merit of virtually every commonly used forensic method, including analysis of fingerprints, hair, fibers, blood spatters, ballistics and arson. Only DNA, which the panel said had benefited from rigorous scientific scrutiny and peer review outside of the forensics discipline, escaped significant criticism.\n\u201cThe fact is that many forensic tests, such as those used to infer the source of tooth marks and bite marks, have never been exposed to stringent scientific scrutiny,\u201d the report said. The report highlights crime laboratory scandals involving hundreds of tainted cases handled by police agencies in Michigan, Texas and West Virginia, and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. At least 10 wrongly convicted men have been exonerated as a result of those laboratory investigations, and the cases of hundreds of other people convicted with the help of those facilities are under review.\nThe panel also found that most of the nation is served by death investigation offices that lack accreditation.

The plaintiffs\u2019 central claim was that these surveillance programs targeted these groups on the basis of religion and national origin rather than actual criminal motive.\nOn Feb. 20, the suit was dismissed as a result of Martini\u2019s decision that the Associated Press was more at fault for releasing accounts of the prejudiced programs than the NYPD was for executing them. He stated that because he could see no evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 having suffered injury before the release of the documents, essentially it was the AP\u2019s fault for causing the plaintiffs\u2019 discontent.\nI mean, come on guys, you know what they say\u2014always shoot the messenger.\nChristopher Brauchli of the Huffington Post said it best in his assessment of the precedent set by the verdict: \u201cthe case of Hassan v. City of New York stands for the proposition that what you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d It stands also for the permissibility of submitting certain groups to increased scrutiny on the basis of the same speculation that would stand as insufficient evidence when attributed to other groups.\nDespite the findings of scholars such as Charles Kurzman, who stated in his report \u201cMuslim-American Terrorism in 2013\u201d that Muslim-American terrorism since 9/11 has been responsible for a mere 37 out of over 190,000 total murders that took place during that time, the stigma assigned to Americans who practice Islam has remained pervasive enough that even today, verdicts such as Martini\u2019s are widely accepted by society. If events such as the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996 or the 1994 bombing of Planned Parenthood in Brookline, Mass., are any indication, it seems doubtful that an attack of a comparable magnitude to 9/11, if carried out by extreme factions of the Christian Right, would result in such an enduring prejudice against Christian Americans as a whole, much less mass surveillance of their institutions.\nWhile American government and society are quick to label such Christian radicals as the exception rather than the norm, they are infinitely more inclined to translate instances of Muslim extremism to broad generalizations about the religion in its entirety. This is a tragic testament to the secularism that we as a nation so pride ourselves on but that in practice never truly proves itself valid; for instance, a set of Christian values has been an unspoken prerequisite for the election of almost every U.S. president to date. That certain religious practices deviating from the Christian norm instill such heightened suspicion in a supposedly secular government is a troubling paradox indeed.\nAnother particularly interesting aspect of this pervasive Islamophobia is the role the U.S. plays\u2013but would like to pretend it does not\u2013in perpetuating Islamic extremism on a global scale. It is a persistent contradiction that has characterized U.S. interventionist policies throughout recent history. In the 1980s, the U"}

Her dad hilariously \u201ctrained\u201d her in a spoof video for Vanity Fair leading up to the big event. The Beat Shazam DJ was a senior at the University of Southern California \u2014 where she studied public relations \u2014 at the time.\nHer first film role is in her father\u2019s directorial debut.\nCorinne will appear alongside heavy hitters including Robert Downey Jr. and Eva Longoria in All-Star Weekend \u2014 the first film 50-year-old Jamie directed \u2014 when it is released later this year. The actress got her other major acting credit in a 2016 episode of MTV\u2019s short-lived but beloved series Sweet/Vicious.\nWhen she\u2019s not forwarding her career, Corinne spends time giving back. She worked with the National Alliance on Mental Illness to eradicate stigma surrounding mental health issues, and the United Nations Foundation\u2019s Girl Up! campaign to promote gender equality. She also participated in March for Our Lives after losing her aunt to gun violence nine years earlier.\nShe empowers others through her website.\nNot only does Corinne write about topics ranging from wellness to travel on her lifestyle site Foxxtales, she also gives female artisans a platform to sell their creations.

UNHCR has also expressed concern about the expulsion of scores of Iranian refugees in southern Iraq.\nAccording to recent reports from the Iraqi capital, some 1,000 Palestinians have been evicted from their homes since the end of the war. Some of them are camping in disused schools and other abandoned buildings, as well as on plots of open land in Baghdad.\nOn Friday, a three-truck UNHCR convoy crossed from Jordan into Iraq with emergency supplies for up to 2,000 people, including 400 tents, 1,200 mattresses and 2,000 blankets as well as stoves, jerry cans and soap. The convoy is due to arrive in Baghdad later the same day, when the Palestinian Red Crescent will help distribute the aid materials to the homeless Palestinians.\nUNHCR fears that more of the estimated 60-90,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq could lose their homes. The agency noted that other landlords may reclaim property they were forced to rent out for minuscule sums \u2013 sometimes as little as $1 per month \u2013 to the Ba'ath government on behalf of the refugees. Since the fall of the regime, these landlords have stopped receiving their rent.\n\"We're concerned that what we're hearing about evictions may be the start of a backlash,\" said UNHCR's Chief of Mission for Iraq, Daniel Bellamy. \"None of this is the Palestinians' fault, but if the perception is that they were beneficiaries of the former government, then they may suffer as a result.\"\nMany of the Palestinian refugees in Iraq have been there since 1948, or are the descendants of those who came in the wake of the first Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Others were displaced more recently, for example from Kuwait following the 1991 Gulf War. Most of the Palestinians in Iraq live in Baghdad, although there are also small communities located elsewhere in the country who may be facing similar problems.\nUnlike Palestinian refugees in the Occupied Territories or in the countries sharing a border with Israel, who fall under the mandate of UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), Palestinians in Iraq come under UNHCR's mandate. But until the recent regime change, the refugee agency's assistance to them was largely limited to legal assistance, including the provision of documents. The state provided them with material assistance (including housing and food), medical care and education, under the provisions of Iraq's 1971 National Refugee Act.\nThis assistance \u2013 however basic \u2013 may have led to resentment among Iraqi citizens who felt that the Palestinians were getting more government assistance than they were. Concerned that these refugees may become collateral victims of the regime change, UNHCR's Bellamy said, \"This is one reason why we want to get back in to Baghdad as soon as the security situation allows.\"\nPalestinian refugees are not the only ones targeted. On Wednesday, a UNHCR team in Basra, southern Iraq, found several Iranian refugee families living in a disused transit centre at the edge of town. The refugees said they had been expelled from their homes in Dujaila \u2013 a refugee"}

The eight new plants are part of FPL's larger plan to add more than 10 million solar panels from 2016 to 2023, one of the largest solar expansions ever in the eastern United States.\n\"We're investing nearly $1 billion to grow solar in Florida this year alone, and we're building each of these new solar power plants cost-effectively,\" said FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy as he toured the construction site of the future FPL Barefoot Bay Solar Energy Center in Brevard County with community leaders today. \"Together, these eight new plants are projected to generate an estimated net lifetime savings of more than $100 million for our customers \u2013 over and above the cost of construction. Our continued commitment to rapidly expand solar energy while keeping customer bills low demonstrates that it is, in fact, possible to be both clean and affordable.\"\n\"FPL's clean energy infrastructure investments continue to pay off for Floridians and give our state's economy a competitive advantage,\" said Vicki Northrup, an economic development consultant in Brevard County. \"Residents and businesses served by FPL are enjoying cleaner and cleaner energy while continuing to pay significantly less for power than the national average.\"\nEach of the eight new solar plants will be capable of generating 74.5 megawatts of zero-emissions energy when the sun is shining for a combined total of nearly 600 megawatts.\nFlorida ranks ninth in the nation for solar resource \u2013 the strength of the sun's rays \u2013 making it a great place for solar. One of the cleanest electric utilities in the nation, FPL projects that solar will outpace coal and oil combined as a percentage of the company's energy mix by the year 2020.\nFrom 2016 to 2023, FPL plans to add more than 2,300 new megawatts of solar, including the approximately 225 megawatts completed in 2016 and the nearly 600 megawatts currently under construction \u2013 totaling more than 10 million solar panels in all.\nFPL has been studying and operating solar in Florida for more than three decades. In 1984, FPL commissioned its first universal solar installation, a 10-kilowatt PV facility in Miami that helped the company's employees gain experience with the then-emerging technology. Over the years, FPL has continued to test and operate a wide variety of solar technologies.\nIn 2009, the company built the 25-megawatt FPL DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, which was the largest solar PV power plant ever built in the U.S. at the time. In 2016, FPL became the first company to build solar cost-effectively in Florida, leveraging its purchasing power and sites with key advantages to complete three 74.5-megawatt universal solar power plants that are projected to result in net customer savings over their operational lifetimes.\nIn addition to the above, FPL has installed small-scale"}

Since UNIFIL was established in 1978, 257 soldiers, officers, and civil members of the force have been killed, with almost no success at all,\" he said.\n\"What are [the UNIFIL soldiers] going to do in the event of a confrontation with Israeli soldiers? Nothing, we will get out of their way,\" he said. \"And Hezbollah are not chopped liver either.\"\nThe general said: \"The following questions remain unanswered. When and at whom can I shoot? In such missions, more often than not you have to shoot first and ask questions later. And so far, UNIFIL troops can only shoot in legitimate defense. But then, it is usually too late.\"\nAlain Pellegrini, the French general commanding UNIFIL, has described the situation in Lebanon after the cease-fire agreed two weeks ago as \"extremely fragile.\"\nIn an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Pellegrini said, \"I see the general situation with enormous apprehension. The war can start again for no reason at all.\"\nPellegrini pointed out that Hezbollah has not been disarmed. \"Everybody is keeping his weapons, for the time being they are just not using them.\"\nFrance, together with the U.S. government, co-authored the resolution to strengthen UNIFIL, but the French government at first only offered to increase its military contingent in UNIFIL to 400 from 200, instead of the 5,000 expected.\nAt a meeting in Brussels Aug. 25, European Union members agreed to reinforce UNIFIL with up to 7,000 soldiers. It earlier had a strength of 2,000. The United Nations has approved increasing its numbers to 15,000.\nIn addition to 2,000 French soldiers, the force will be complemented by up to 3,000 Italian, 1,200 Spanish, and 1,200 German troops.\nMilitary experts say the French reluctance to participate in UNIFIL arose from past experience, particularly the killing of 58 French soldiers in Lebanon Oct. 23, 1983, in an attack for which Hezbollah was blamed.\n\"The French army never forgot those killings,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charillon, head of the French Center for Military Social Research told IPS. \"Soldiers participating in the UNIFIL mission at the time came back traumatized.\"\nFrench soldiers have had other disastrous experiences in UN missions. More than 80 French soldiers died in the course of a UN peacekeeping mission in former Yugoslavia.\n\"This UNIFIL mission will be as difficult as those assignments,\" Charillon said. \"You have to send experienced personnel to Lebanon. But the French army has its limits, it is not a superpower\u2019s army.\"\nBruno Tertrais, researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies, a Paris-based military think tank, also expressed misgivings."}

A documentary about a Haitian radio host (The Agronomist)! A portrait of Jimmy Carter on book tour (Man From Plains)! A Neil Young concert film (Neil Young: Heart of Gold)! And while Demme\u2019s recent remakes of old spy thrillers (The Truth About Charlie, The Manchurian Candidate) have been muddled flops, that doesn\u2019t seem to trouble the director one bit\u2014he just trains his ever-curious camera on what\u2019s next.\nDemme is so hip at this point he can comfortably return to being square. Not that the man who made Stop Making Sense was ever all that square, but Demme did make his name with small, intimate dramas about friendship and loneliness and the inexorable pull of family ties (Melvin & Howard, Something Wild). With Rachel Getting Married (Sony Pictures Classics), the story of an addict who\u2019s released from rehab to attend her sister\u2019s wedding, he returns to that rich subject matter. But Demme\u2019s gaze has changed in the intervening years. Something Wild was a paean to forward motion, the road-trip romance par excellence. Rachel Getting Married is about a different kind of journey\u2014the backward time-travel that happens, willy-nilly, whenever you visit home.\nThe title is a kind of joke, given that its maddening antiheroine, Kym (Anne Hathaway), spends the movie frantically diverting her family\u2019s attention from the fact that Rachel (Rosemarie Dewitt) is, in fact, getting married. Kym, a charismatic black-clad waif in the Edie Sedgwick mold, is a master at shifting the focus back to her own long-running personal drama of drug use and self-destruction. Years before, she was responsible for a terrible accident while high; in the decade or so since, she\u2019s cycled in and out of various high-end rehabs and seen her nurturing noodge of a father (Bill Irwin) divorce her loving but distant mother (Debra Winger). While Kym\u2019s life has been stuck, Rachel\u2019s has taken off: She\u2019s earning a psychology degree and is about to marry an adoring African-American musician named Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe). When Kym arrives at their parents\u2019 sprawling Connecticut compound, her first move is to usurp the maid-of-honor title from Rachel\u2019s best friend (Anisa George); her second is to attend a local 12-step meeting and sleep with the cutest guy there, who also happens to be Sidney\u2019s best man.\nSo you think you know what kind of movie you\u2019re in for: an intelligent middlebrow psychodrama about sororal competition. (You may even think you just saw it last year; Noah Baumbach\u2019s Margot at the Wedding had a remarkably similar setup.) But from Rachel\u2019s first vertiginous moment, the script by Jenny Lumet (Sidney\u2019s daughter, a first-time screenwriter) begins swooping and diving into unexpected places, as does the D.V. camera hand-held by Declan Quinn.

But some say it\u2019s a big step in the wrong direction.\nThe proposal comes months after Republican Brian Kemp, then the secretary of state, defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in the governor\u2019s race. The election drew national attention and shook voter confidence after it was marred by issues including long voter lines, reports of malfunctioning voting machines and high rates of rejected absentee ballots.\nThe bill\u2019s Senate sponsor, Republican Sen. William Ligon of Brunswick, said the proposed machines are superior to hand-marked ballots because they \u201cleave absolutely no room for doubt of voter intent, since voters make a clear choice with the touch of a button.\u201d He said \u201cstray or accidental marks\u201d on hand-marked ballots could cause a ballot to be invalidated.\nBut Democratic Sen. Elena Parent of Atlanta pushed back on that assertion, saying scanning technology had improved to where that\u2019s no longer an issue.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a ballot marking device, it puts the onus on the voter to understand how it works and ensure that it correctly recorded their intent, which is just not the case with a hand-marked paper ballot,\u201d Parent said. She said a hand-marked ballot is the best record of voter intent.\nThe proposal passed the state House last month, largely along partisan lines, with Republicans in support. That\u2019s similar to the Senate\u2019s 35-to-21 vote Wednesday. It now goes back to the House to consider some slight changes made by the Senate.\nOne of the biggest points of contention is the lack of financial information offered in support of the bill. Bond funding, or borrowing, totaling $150 million has been included in the 2020 budget proposal, but the bill does not include a fiscal note \u2014 a report on the bill\u2019s estimated financial impact.\n\u201cWe are totally disregarding state law and Senate rules as far as the need for a fiscal note, there is no doubt,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson, a Democrat from Stone Mountain. Henson moved to have the bill ruled \u201cout of order\u201d because it lacked a fiscal note, but was overruled by Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.\nThose alleged problems surfaced when Kemp was Georgia\u2019s chief election official, supervising the election in which he was running for governor.\nThe wide-ranging legislation would also tweak Georgia\u2019s strict standard for verifying voter registrations and clarify when polling places can be closed or moved, measures proposed earlier by Democrats.\nLawmakers hope to have some new machines in place in time for testing during municipal elections in November 2019, before having them installed statewide for use in the November 2020 presidential election, which also includes a U.S. Senate race and all of Georgia\u2019s U.S. House seats."}

Radojevic had played a total of 19 minutes over four games in a club league in Yugoslavia two years ago. He was paid $13,000 and used the money to help support his family. His father, a retired security guard, was ill at the time and eventually died of cancer. One NBA scout familiar with European ball said that club teams paying players who play college ball in the U.S. is a common practice.\nThe club team mailed a copy of his contract to the NCAA and the NCAA hit Radojevic with the harshest of penalties, taking away his eligibility. They could have given him a 10-game suspension and found a way for him to pay back the money. Instead they threw the book at him. Now, a young man from a foreign land who played in front of 900 people at games last season will be thrown into the NBA culture two years too soon. Welcome to America, kid.\nRadojevic, 22, has twice worked out for the Knicks. He could be plucked before the Knicks get the chance to draft him or they may decide they have more pressing needs, like point guard to take care of tomorrow.

More than 700,000 people are employed in the trade and logistics sector.\nHowever, the city\u2019s importance as a shipping hub has diminished in past decades with the construction of ports and airports across China\u2019s Guangdong province.\nThe deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries (FHKI), Daniel Yip, said for the 32,000 active Hong Kong-invested factories operating in the Pearl River Delta, the trade war was forcing many firms to consider uprooting to other countries in the region, or to forge new markets.\n\u201cFor any factories, they will need to make medium-term strategy decisions like relocating, or changing their market strategy. So the mentality of many factories is that this is a medium to long term turning point,\u201d Yip told Reuters.\nYau said the trade war would merely accelerate a trend of factories, especially those involved in low-end manufacturing, shifting from China due to higher operating costs.\nThe 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) was now Hong Kong\u2019s second-largest trading partner, he added.\n\u201cThey create a very strong demand for say, not just trade in goods, but also trade in services,\u201d Yau said."}

{"idx": "32569", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Georgia followed Florida's example in forcing safety-net recipients to get drug tests, despite the fact that neither law is likely to stand up in court. Why? Because actual policymaking was never the point.\nIn April, Georgia\u2019s governor signed a law to require all applicants to the state\u2019s cash assistance program to take a drug test. The law was part of a torrent of similar bills that flooded the country in the last two years, as conservative state legislators elected in 2010 sought to fasten drug testing requirements to safety-net programs. Most of the bills did not become law, but Georgia went all the way and the bill was set to take effect on July 1.\nAround that day, local press began reporting that welfare applicants had to undergo tests. But on July 3, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s office belatedly announced that the law would not go immediately into effect.\nRather, the state will await a decision by a federal court of appeals, which has before it a challenge to a nearly identical 2011 Florida law that is blocked pending the court\u2019s ruling.\nCivil liberties advocates say the governor\u2019s decision is a smart one, considering the state would certainly be sued just like Florida, incurring an expensive legal fight it\u2019s likely to loose. The 11th Circuit is expected to strike down the Florida law on privacy grounds.\nYet Florida\u2019s legal battle was already well underway when the Georgia legislature passed its own controversial law and when the governor signed it. Which begs the question: Why go through all of that only to acknowledge the legal dispute in the final hour before the law\u2019s onset? Because Georgia\u2019s drug testing law\u2013like the proposals elsewhere\u2013never had anything to do with making actual public policy.\nGeorgia advocates and a well-positioned staffer within the of state Department Health and Human Services, the agency tasked with implementing the testing program, all insist that the law was never intended as meaningful policy. Rather, it was purely cynical politics\u2013an effort by Tea Party Republicans to demonize the poor as unworthy of help, atrophy the cash assistance rolls and generally undercut safety net programs in the public discourse.\n\u201cEveryone working at the Department [of Health and Human Services] knew it was complete hogwash,\u201d an agency staffer who was part of a team analyzing the bill told Colorlines.com.\nThe staffer insisted on anonymity for fear of reprisal.\nProponents of the drug testing bills say the laws are intended to save states money and prevent welfare abuse. But the agency staffer, who was involved with measureing the costs associated with the program, disagreed.\nIndeed, the example of Florida shows that the testing law cost more money than it saved.\nFlorida state data showed that after reimbursing the 97.4 percent of TANF applicants who tested clean in the short period the law was in effect, before it was blocked in court, the state paid out $45,780 more than it would have had the program never been implemented.\nFacing a near certain loss in the courts and evidence that the bills don\u2019t save states money, there are few remaining justifications for the law\u2013beyond serving as a vehicle for smearing poor people and the safety-net program that helps them.\nThey can, however, also serve the purpose of creating chaos for people seeking help from the safety net.\nDespite the Florida law\u2019s counterproductive results, its supporters celebrated, saying the bill had the effect of pushing some people off the rolls, either because they failed tests or decided not to apply at all."}

It is also important to note that Western officials are much more pro-European than the Eastern ones. How did this happen?\nThe gap between the Western and Eastern Europe is rooted in history. It has political and economical levels and there are also divergent mentalities and attitudes to the integration process in Europe which is nowadays represented by the European Union.\nFrom a political perspective we still can\u2019t forget more than 40 years of life behind the Iron Curtain. Life in totalitarian regimes marked our people whereas Western Europe developed its democratic spirit.\nThe other thing is that borders of Central and Eastern European countries were closed during the regime. Locals lived in a bubble and they weren\u2019t meeting people with different religions or colours. Nowadays it\u2019s reflected in the approach of Visegrad group towards immigration.\nHow much do Eastern Europeans differ from Westerners?\nEastern Europeans don\u2019t believe in any institutions including the EU. We don\u2019t have any experience with establishing democratic institutions and that\u2019s why it is often said in the Czech Republic that \u201cBrussels again came up with something.\u201d Czechs, Poles and Hungarians are just convinced that the EU is ruled by elites with no connection to their countries. But people from Western Europe know that if a decision is made and is not good for national interest of their country, it was perhaps badly negotiated by politicians, who were elected by them as their representatives in Brussels.\nIs it possible to overcome this mistrust of Eastern Europeans?\nIt needs some time. There has to be a generational renewal in politics, research and media. The new generation has to take the lead.\nThe problem is that the EU is often demonized by Eastern people. Of course negative stories are more read than others but this alarmism is common not only for journalists but also for experts and politicians. That\u2019s worse because if a well-known person says something, lay people think it must be true because that politician or expert has to understand EU matters very well.\nWestern Europeans are sometimes influenced by negative propaganda too, but their political elites are more responsible. It is true that populism is getting stronger there but parties with a democratic program still cope with that. It is evident from the results of the elections in France, Netherlands and also Finland or Austria.\nAnd what about the economic gap between Eastern and Western European states? Could we expect such a slow progress for the East?\nWe have to bear in mind that history plays a big role also at the economic level of East-West division. During the interwar period, Central and Eastern Europe weren\u2019t really developed except Czechoslovakia. Even Austria had much weaker economy, but its willingness to catch up with Germany and Switzerland lead to success. Now the Czech Republic looks up to Austria.\nIn the 1990s Western countries showed a lot of solidarity with the Eastern countries ruled by totalitarian regimes. But now it seems that their solidarity ran out. It is time for us to become self-sufficient.\nWe admire the economies of Austria and Germany but on the other hand we can see some protectionist measures such as a minimum wage for foreign workers or debates on posted workers.

After an awkward silence--I thought I had inadvertently misspoken--one nurse replied, \"Nobody really asks us that.\"\nAs designer/researchers at Mayo Clinic's Center for Innovation (CFI), we provide a forum and voice for collaboration and participatory creation. Being embedded designers affords incredible access to patients and providers. For one \"deep-dive\" activity, designers interviewed over 30 patients in the patient cafeteria. We can shadow providers to glimpse into their day-in-the-life. We are able to understand first-hand what happens during a patient examination. I will always remember one of my first patient exam observations when a physician told a ninety-seven-year-old woman that she had a polyp in her colon. I remember how her two granddaughters, who had accompanied her, reacted with the possibility of their grandmother having cancer. I remember how the grandmother used humor to mask her fear while asking a myriad of questions about the future, and how the physician gently touched her hand and said, \"we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\"\nAlthough rich and necessary information, user-centered research is not always welcomed or easy to corral in spite of being embedded in the institution. In wanting shiny new products and services, we move too quickly. This is a story about the lessons learned when we set aside our assumptions and slow down to listen and understand the needs of people.\nCASE STUDY 1 Looking Inward And Outward: Designing An EMR For Small Family Medicine Practices The Center for Innovation was formed two years ago with the mission to transform the way health care is delivered. It is a multidisciplinary department of design researchers, project managers, administrators, physicians, business analysts, and quality, financial and IT consultants who work with both internal departments and external partners. Initiatives range from creating a culture of innovation within Mayo Clinic, to developing frameworks for future health and wellness services, to redesigning care team structures and prototyping new products.\nWhen an external software company needed help in designing an electronic medical record (EMR) system for small family medicine practices, they approached the CFI. They had a prototype in progress and wanted our feedback. We proposed a brief pause in the production in order for us to understand the complexities of how an EMR would function, look, and feel.\nAs per the national government mandate that all family medicine practices must be on an electronic system by 2012, we had to create a system that complied with the functionality guidelines; however, we also wanted to design a system that complimented the practice. One of the main advantages to an electronic system is the ability to access and sort patient information. In the paper system, information is limited to whoever has the chart readily in-hand in the format at-hand. Another advantage to an EMR is the ability to communicate among the health \"ecosystem\" of pharmacies, laboratories, imaging facilities, and other providers, whereas the paper system required extra steps such as a phone call or fax for communication. Our concepts were about designing technology that enhanced what already works, not hinder it.\nWe were granted six weeks to conduct design research in order to identify the challenges and possibilities, anxiety and excitement, advantages and pitfalls of being on an electronic system. It was also important to understand the relationship and idiosyncrasies within small practices--defined as having less than ten practicing physicians--in order to provide context for an EMR system.\nOur primary"}

People assume that because a provider\u2019s name appears on television advertisements and billboards around the country they must offer excellent products. Similarly, savers tend to think that if a company has been in the market for ages it is a rock-solid place to invest their hard-earned cash.\nI often speak to clients who are hesitant about investing with 10X, not because of the fees are high or the track record is poor, but because the brand hasn't been around for 100 years. Investors are happy to pay the industry average of 3 percent of the value of their total savings in fees every year (when they could be paying less than 1%) because they are sold on a brand. So strong is the belief in big brands that many people never even take the time to scrutinize the product they are buying.\nSouth Africans find themselves in a retirement crisis, where only 6 percent can expect to retire comfortably. For many years most have blindly trusted advisors and the companies that pay them. The time has come to change how we choose retirement annuities. It doesn't matter if a company has been around for many years, or that they have the biggest buildings in South Africa, or even that all your friends invest with them.

That\u2019s what the message is going to be. We get a chance to get better. That\u2019s what these kids earned.\"\nJorgensen said his team's approach hasn't changed since the Week 1 victory over Kimberly 31-28 on Jared Scheberl's 26-yard field goal as time expired.\n\"I mean, we prepare for each team the same. Each game,\" Jorgensen said. \"I understand this game has great meaning, but game-by-game, every game has meaning. If you put an emphasis more on one game than another, then the kids feel that too.\"\nKimberly enters the game off a 38-20 win over previously undefeated Bay Port. The Papermakers have tremendous balance, with a three-headed rushing attack of Will Fischer, Caleb Frazer and Alec Martzahl to go along with a passing attack led by Cody Staerkel, who has thrown for 2,512 yards, 27 touchdowns and only three interceptions.\n\"We know they're going to get some plays,\" Jorgensen said. \"They have so much skill. We have to limit the number of big plays. But we know they're going to get a few, so we have to tackle really well. As in any playoff game, like with the Sun Prairie game, we won the turnover battle. Kimberly, when they beat Bay Port, won the turnover battle. You can't give good offenses extra possessions.\n\"From our standpoint, we have to play to our strength, which is being able to control the ball on the ground and using that as our best defense at times. We can't allow them to have additional possessions. Their passing game right now is very potent, along with a formidable run game.\"\nFond du Lac counters with an offense that has put up incredible numbers on the ground: 4,251 yards rushing and 58 touchdowns. Eben Sauer leads the team's rushing attack with 1,595 yards on 159 carries (10.0 average) and 16 touchdowns. Senior quarterback Carson Raddatz has rushed for 1,088 yards (7.7 average) and 17 scores.

No one sells paintings or posters of detective story author Zenith Jones or of Civil War military strategist Anna Ella Carroll. Yet these are two of the women to whom the professor has dedicated her scholarly career.\nAmerica's unsung, all-but-forgotten female authors, poets, historians, former slaves, diary keepers, reporters, social workers and politicians are Beauchamp's business. They have been since the petite 61-year-old professor pioneered the national effort -- started by a handful of academics in the 1960s -- to make the study of women a standard part of college curriculums.\nFrom the time she joined the University of Maryland teaching staff in 1965 until a Women's Studies Program was established in 1973, Beauchamp worked and fought to make stories by and about women an accepted part of acadaemia.\nToday, a University of Maryland degree program devoted to women's history, writing, politics and social issues -- the fruits of Beauchamp's labor -- is one of the most active and respected in the country, serving as a research base for scholars from California to Maine.\nBut Beauchamp's specialty lies remarkably close to home. Since the early 1970s, she has focused her energies on teaching and researching Maryland's forgotten women, both great and ordinary.\n\"Of course there's a good deal of variety among Maryland's women,\" said the Michigan-born Beauchamp (pronounced Beecham). \"But if one strand ties them together it's their strength and resourcefulness. They were in leadership positions quite early.\n\"Take Margaret Brent,\" Beauchamp continued. \"She practically ran the colonial government.\" A mid-17th century landholder and entrepreneur, Brent took over the colonial governorship for several years when the British-appointed official died in 1746.\nBeauchamp's research has also uncovered the Preston family of Towson, in Baltimore County. The mother, Madge, and daughter, May, recorded their lives and the history of the times in carefully detailed letters and diaries.\n\"Madge was a battered wife. There can be no question,\" Beauchamp said, shaking her head. \"Here we are studying the 19th century and learning about the reaction to Lincoln's assassination, and discovering the texture of the ordinary woman's life.\"\nFrom a filing cabinet, Beauchamp pulled out a box filled with the first 480 pages of her book on the Prestons. It has nine chapters to go. \"Look at this,\" she said, holding one of Madge Preston's journal entries.\nSaturday, February 25, 1865: During this afternoon we all have been as unhappy as well could be, owing to Mr. Preston's humor which unfortunately for me, fulminated this evening and ended by Mr. Preston striking me to the floor senseless. . . .

She climbed up into a raised hut and propagated baskets of corn and beans from her body.\nEventually, Selu died to transfer her magic power into field cultivation. Kenati defected to the Wolves, who staged a raid on the corn people and were massacred.\nThe Cherokee story, \u201cOrigin of the Bear,\u201d represents a similar split between traditional hunters and the new agriculturalists.\nA boy tells the people in his farming village that they should follow him and become bears in the mountains. Life is easier there. A variety of foods are available year-round with little labor involved, he says, whereas crops are labor-intensive and iffy. Only his parents go with him. The three turn into bears and the boy tells the villagers that in times of hunger, a bear will sacrifice itself in response to a sacred song.\nThe people of the Swannanoa grew vegetables in the floodplain and corn in the fields in the area now occupied by the Warren Wilson College farm. David Moore, Warren Wilson archaeologist, has identified four successive eras of native habitation there, going back 10,000 years.\nThe farming community of about 50 households lived in wattle and daub houses situated in a circle around a plaza, where festivals and stickball matches took place. The council house stood atop an ancient mound. Each home had pottery, tools, ornaments, statues and toys. When the corn ripened, the people held a Green Corn ceremony at which a unifying sacred fire was lit.\nIt was during such a season in 1776 that General Griffith Rutherford led 2,400 young men in a punishing campaign against the Cherokee of the Middle and Valley towns. The militia routed inhabitants, burned down homes and burned up corn fields.\n\u201cThree varieties of corn were grown,\u201d the authors detail: \u201c\u2018six weeks corn,' a small type like popcorn that ripened in about two months and was roasted in the milk stage; \u2018hominy corn\u2019 with smooth, hard kernels that might be red, blue, white, yellow, or any combinations of these colors; and finally \u2018flour corn\u2019 which was the most important and had very large, white kernels.\u201d Pre-modern corn required grinding.\nThe Davidsons were prominent Scots who made the migration to County Armagh, Ireland, and then Virginia and Rowan County, North Carolina, over several generations. They\u2019d bypassed the land frenzy in Pennsylvania. William\u2019s father, John, had been a prosperous Ulster merchant and set himself up on the western Carolina frontier at Davidson\u2019s Creek near Lake Norman.\nWilliam carried a family tradition of community building to Swannanoa and he knew about mills and mill sites.\nComing upon his Bee Tree Creek land, he noted the adequate amount of creek flow and the location of"}

For publisher Electronic Arts, the unusual game is one of the biggest debuts of the year.\nExpectations for Spore are high because the game's lead creator is Will Wright, an innovator in the industry who is known for taking unlikely-seeming topics and turning them into addictive experiences. Wright's previous hit, The Sims, stands as the best-selling computer game of all time and was a cultural phenomenon that drew many of its biggest fans from outside the industry's stereotypical young, male demographic. As a fixture on the top of software sales charts for two years after its release in 2000, the franchise sold more than 100 million titles -- bringing in billions of dollars in sales.\nWhereas The Sims let players control the daily routines of human-like characters as they went about their careers and social lives in a suburban setting, Wright's new title, which has been in development for six years, ranges a bit wider in its subject matter.\nIn Spore, players oversee the evolution and development of a species, starting from its earliest moments as a multicellular organism floating in a puddle. With the right guidance, a player's virtual life form gains sentience, develops technology and eventually travels into space. The game's powerful design tools allow players to follow their imaginations and create a giant race of friendly-looking teddy bears, if they like, or monsters that look as if they might have been plucked from a horror movie.\nIf certain games are about giving players a sense of control and power, then Spore is the ultimate expression of the urge to play God.\n\"We wanted to impose as few limitations as possible,\" Wright said. \"If you want to make a creature without a mouth, you can; they just starve off the bat.\"\nFrank Gibeau, president of EA Games, the division of Electronic Arts that owns Wright's studio, said the company sees many possibilities for this new franchise. \"This is going to be a long-term business for the company,\" he said. \"I think of Spore as a platform that we want to build over multiple years.\"\nIn addition to a version designed to run on computers with Windows or the Mac operating system, EA is also launching versions for the iPhone and the portable Nintendo DS game system this weekend. Versions for game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii are in the early stages of research and development, though the company isn't ready to say when those might become available. A version that could be played in a browser window is also under consideration.\nBut it would be something of a feat for Spore to live up to the hype surrounding it. Wright's fans expected this game years ago, but its release was put off as the design team tweaked it and incorporated new features. Although Gibeau would not comment on the size of EA's investment in the game, industry analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities said he believes Spore's development cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. Even at such a price tag, Pachter said, he expects Spore to be \"wildly profitable.\"\nIn theory, every Spore player will encounter a unique of mix of species over the course"}

Solar heat gain in your car is caused by the sun\u2019s heat radiating in through the windows and roof.\nEnergy for cooling accounts for nearly 6% of all electricity produced in the United States. What if you could reduce the amount of heat absorbed by your building?\nInstead of cranking down that thermostat, you can prevent solar heat gain by using shading devices. They prevent the direct transmittance of light and heat into the building and lower cooling costs.\nRead on to learn about reducing your air conditioning bill.\nSolar heat gain is a desirable trait when you are trying to heat your building in the winter. Not so much so in warm weather. Heat gain can make your air conditioning work much harder.\nReduce the amount of heat absorbed by your building and hardscape to lower energy consumption. Direct sunlight is the number one source of heat. Don\u2019t ignore the heat absorbed and radiated from pavement, roofs, walls or windows.\nArtificial light sources, office machinery, and appliances also generate an amount of heat.\nLimiting heat gain from direct sunlight will give the most immediate results. For example, shade under a tree feels 10-25 degrees cooler than a spot in direct sunlight. Limiting the heat absorbed by pavement can also be very effective.\nYou can always use landscaping to block direct sunlight. Large trees cool your building through shade and evaporation. If the trees are maintained correctly, it can be 6 \u2013 25 degrees cooler underneath.\nIf you plant deciduous trees, you can block the sun during the hottest part of the year while enjoying bright sunlight during other seasons. Deciduous trees have lush foliage in the spring and summer months and shed their leaves in the coolest months.\nSouth and west-facing exposures might need shade year-round in some climates. Choose conifers or other evergreens if possible. Other ideas include using a temporary fence to create a green wall to shade the area.\nWhen landscaping changes aren\u2019t a good option, you can still see energy savings through the use of reflective roofing, solar shading roof systems, and window awnings. These block solar energy on the structure.\nReflective roofing sends solar energy back towards the sky to prevent energy absorption. Roofs may be coated with highly reflective paint or covered in reflective sheets or tiles. Other possibilities include solar panels to shade the roof and generate hot water or power.\nGreen roof systems are a possibility for certain structures. Plant cover not only absorbs sunlight and heat but can also cool through evaporation. As a bonus, some roofs can double as a community garden.\nWindow coverings, films, shades or awnings can reduce solar heat gain 65 \u2013 77 % according to Energy.gov. You can learn more details about your building\u2019s options through a local professional. There are several thousand options available for exploration.\nShield windows and skylights from direct sun with exterior treatments. This can allow the interior to maintain uncluttered lines. A curtain wall can provide privacy and superior light blocking.\nOther options include awnings, architectural fins, or shade sails. Exterior shades that do not completely block light are best. They reduce glare and provide a comfortable amount of ambient light.\nComplete sun blockage from the inside is not the best for solar heat radiation control. The heat has already entered the building through the window glass. Also, a too dark shade increases the need for artificial lighting.\nThe heat generated by interior lights and appliances can also make your air condition"}

{"idx": "32608", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Several years ago, a scientist at Emory University introduced female capuchin monkeys to money. She gave them granite pebbles and taught them that if they surrendered a rock back to her, she would trade it for a piece of cucumber. Capuchins like cucumbers, and if that were the only deal available, they would trade rocks for cucumber slices almost every time.\nThe researcher then placed two monkeys in cages next to each other so they could see the bargain made by the capuchin next door. The primatologist approached one monkey and made the standard trade: a pebble for a piece of cucumber. Next, the scientist approached the second monkey and exchanged the pebble not for a cucumber slice, but for a grape. Capuchins like grapes more than they like cucumber slices.\nAs logical as the need for fairness may be, feelings of being used are often at the heart of what destroys a working relationship.\nSeeing another monkey get a better reward for the same action, the first capuchin often got upset. She might \"go on strike,\" refusing to make the exchange in future rounds. She might refuse to eat the cucumber piece even though she paid a pebble to acquire it, and if she hadn't seen the grape trade, she would certainly have eaten it. In extreme cases, she might throw a small fit \"such as tossing the token or reward out of the test chamber.\"\nBehaving this way is irrational. The aggrieved monkey didn't hurt anyone but herself by refusing to trade rocks for food or by throwing away cucumbers she otherwise would have eaten. So why did she do it?\n\"Capuchin monkeys,\" wrote the authors of the study, \"seem to measure reward in relative terms, comparing their own rewards with those available, and their own efforts with those of others. They respond negatively . . . if a partner gets a better deal.\" Academics call this phenomenon \"inequality aversion\" or \"distributive justice.\" You might call it evenhandedness, doing right by the other person, or just plain fairness. If fairness is essential for a capuchin monkey, it must be more important and more basic to humans than we realize.\nAre both of you getting \"grapes\"?\nWe share the workload fairly between us.\nWe do not have to keep track of who does what and who gets credit for what.\nWe see each other as equals -- one is not better than the other.\nYour partnership has little chance of succeeding unless both of you believe it is fair. On a scale from 1 (\"strongly disagree\") to 5 (\"strongly agree\"), it takes an average above 3.6 on these statements to reach the range considered \"good.\" Only respondents who strongly agree to all three statements have excellent alliances.\nParticularly at the beginning of a working relationship, colleagues cannot avoid making comparisons between their own rewards and those of their counterpart as they decide how earnestly to maintain the collaboration. Even if you have no formal authority over the pay, promotion, or recognition of your collaborator, you should make sure he gets a fair deal. If you are getting grapes, you have a responsibility to make sure your counterpart is getting something better than cucumbers.\nOn one level, fairness is just common sense. Imagine what would happen if a mother asked her two young children to work together to pick up their toys and then rewarded one child with an apple and the other with an ice cream cone.

But things had gotten a little rocky within the group. Their longtime manager, Brian Epstein, had died the previous summer; they endured their first flop, the British TV film \u201cMagical Mystery Tour,\u201d at the end of that year; they alienated some fans with a trip to India to meditate with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in early 1968; and Lennon was heavily into LSD and, in October, would be arrested on drug possession charges with his new girlfriend Yoko Ono, whose constant presence was not always embraced by the band or its fans.\nToday, Gass thinks of \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d as a \u201crite of passage\u201d for kids of a certain age, a way for young fans to be introduced to the Beatles\u2019 music through a goofy story about evil Blue Meanies trying to sap the magical world of Pepperland of its happiness, with only The Beatles\u2019 music able to save the day.\nBut the film presented an opportunity for The Beatles to fulfill their three-picture deal with United Artists, which began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d So the band approached the project with as little involvement as possible. They didn\u2019t even provide their own voices to their characters, allowing actors to sub in with dopey Liverpool accents.\nBut the band was on the hook to provide four new songs for the new album, Side 2 of which would consist of George Martin\u2019s orchestral music from the film.\nYet the film\u2019s irreverent in-jokes, pun-filled wordplay and psychedelic musical interludes captured much of what The Beatles\u2019 music stood for in the mid to late \u201960s.

It makes sense; consumers have access to products and customer service at their fingertips, 24/7, and can easily compare prices, reviews, quality and service.\nThe reality of today's fast-paced and flexible marketplace is that it conditions people to expect everything to be configured to their preferences -- including jobs.\nThe most sought-after candidates expect (and can get) meaning in their work, a supportive, collaborative environment, and an employer that can match the lifestyle they want to enjoy.\nAnd companies like Glassdoor make it easy to anonymously review companies and managers. That gives workers the chance to consider insider reviews about companies and job opportunities in the same way they scroll through Airbnb and Amazon reviews. LinkedIn and Indeed make regular job recommendations -- even if you don't say you're looking -- and social media offers people a platform to give their subjective views of their employer.\nSo, in today's world, what happens at work does not stay at work -- it ends up on the internet in real time.

Returning investors Capital One Growth Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Wing Ventures also participated.\nSnowflake CEO Bob Muglia said in an interview with VentureBeat that back in September investors recommended the company raise money to fuel its growth, given the success it\u2019s having and the speed at which the market is moving.\nThis round also provided an opportunity to bring Sequoia Capital on as an investor. Muglia said that he wanted to work with the firm because of its long and storied pedigree in venture capital, as well as its track record helping enterprise software startups.\nWith all this cash in the bank, Muglia said the company plans to expand its sales and marketing presence overseas, with a special focus on Europe and Asia.

A tub that is part of a tub surround can squeak where the acrylic wall and acrylic tub meet. Alternatively, a standalone acrylic tub can squeak when the flooring or subflooring under the tub is loose, or the tub isn't adequately supported on the bottom. There are a few things that you can do to help eliminate your squeak.\nSqueaking in an acrylic tub when weight is placed on the floor of the tub can be due to the tub flexing or bending. This can potentially weaken the tub and lead to cracks and splits in the material. Injecting a low expansion foam filler to fill in gaps between the floor of the acrylic tub and the subfloor of the bathroom can help eliminate this flexing and reduce the likelihood of damage.\nMany acrylic tubs come with an acrylic shower surround to protect the walls around the shower from moisture. These acrylic surrounds typically snap into place in a track along the top of the tub. If the surround and tub are not connected properly, you may hear a squeaking sound, due to the two parts rubbing together when you stand in your tub. Check the perimeter of your tub and shower surround to make sure the two are snapped in properly.\nAcrylic tubs are generally installed with a rubber or foam layer between the tub and the bathroom floor. If this layer is deteriorated or missing, you may be hearing the acrylic of the tub rubbing against the floor as weight is shifted in the tub. One solution is to replace the foam or rubber layer, which necessitates removing the acrylic tub and laying down new material.\nIf pulling up your tub to put down a new foam or rubber layer is more of a task than you would like, you may want to consider shimming your tub. Shims are small wedge-shaped pieces of wood, available in most any home improvement store, which can be used to take up gaps between two surfaces. Wedge a shim or two between your acrylic tub and the floor around the area you believe is squeaking. If the shim solves the problem, remove it and cut off the protruding part so that it doesn't stick out from the bottom of the tub.\nSometimes, a squeaking tub is really a squeaking bathroom floor. This is another job for shims, but can really only be handled from beneath. Gain access to your basement or crawl space and shim the area around the tub, between the floor joists and the bathroom floor. In first floor bathrooms in homes built on a slab, this is not possible, and the acrylic tub will need to be removed for the floor to be secured.\nLeahey, Andrew. \"How to Fix a Squeaky Acrylic Tub.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/fix-squeaky-acrylic-tub-33307.html.

The bulk of the tweets are about God helping the Japanese, and prayer for the Japanese, but a number of the tweets are weighing in about God either being involved (see also here, and here) or meting out punishment (or refuting this response).

Nechelput will continue in his current role.\nGisserot, who is leaving for China immediately, will take over the day-to-day management of GSK China while Reilly works exclusively on handling the bribery crisis.\nGSK last week dispatched Abbas Hussain, the drug maker's head of emerging markets, to Shanghai to oversee the crisis. Hussain, the brother of former England cricket captain Nasser Hussain, has met Chinese officials to apologise for the scandal, in which GSK executives are accused of acting as the \"godfathers\" of a criminal scam, bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours worth \u00a3320m via a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies.\nSir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK, said on Wednesday that he was \"absolutely willing and ready\" to go to China to take charge of the investigation into the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" scandal.\nWitty, who was paid \u00a33.9m last year, said: \"It appears that certain senior executives in the Chinese business have acted outside of our processes and our controls to both defraud the company and the Chinese healthcare system.\"\nHe refused to provide details of how the alleged fraud operated, but said the Chinese police investigation is focused on the four Chinese nationals already detained by the police.\nHe said they appear to have been \"potentially defrauding GSK and also at the same time allegedly doing some things in the market which are clearly inappropriate and illegal\".\nWitty has refused to say if he will give up his bonus this year if the company was found to have broken the law in China.

A sentencing date will be announced later, Judge Guy Reynolds said.\nHershberger was found innocent of three charges that included operating an unlicensed retail store that sold raw milk and other products; and operating a dairy farm and dairy processing facility without licenses.\nHershberger's supporters have said he was targeted for prosecution because he sold raw milk directly to consumers through a private buying club with several hundred members.\nThe trial's outcome will set a precedent, according to the Weston A. Price Foundation, an organization that has advocated for the legalization of raw-milk sales in Wisconsin and other states. \"This is a victory for the food rights movement,\" said one of Hershberger's attorneys, Elizabeth Rich.\nHershberger said he was pleased with the acquittals, and that now he can return to his farm in Loganville and continue to run his food store without a retail license because it's a members-only buying club.\n\"I can continue to feed my community,\" he said.\nEarlier in the day, the farmer testified that he felt betrayed by state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection officials who raided his farm in June 2010 and intentionally destroyed 2,000 pounds of milk.\nHe was afraid that DATCP would destroy other food as well. Hershberger said that is why he violated the hold order, taking some food for his family and allowing members of the buying club to remove items for their use.\n\"I prayed and meditated a lot,\" he said about the decision, which he described as an act of civil disobedience.\nHershberger said he had wanted to develop a business plan for his farm that would have been acceptable to state officials and maintained the Amish tradition of sharing food with the community.\n\"I tried to work with people. I would have been happy to sit down with them and come up with a workable solution, and I would still do that,\" he said while on the witness stand for several hours.\nProsecutors, represented by the state Department of Justice, depicted Hershberger as someone who flouted the law by not getting a $265 retail license \u2014 although the inclusion of unpasteurized dairy products in his food store would have made that impossible, according to a state official.\nProsecutors alleged that Hershberger ran an unlicensed retail food business that shipped products out of state and had a product list with many items not from the farm.\nIn his closing arguments, Department of Justice attorney Eric Defort said the dairy farmer clearly operated a retail store, complete with a product price list, a cash register and a credit-card machine.\n\"This is a place where you go to purchase things.

His plan did not affect Montpelier School.\nSince 2006, the district has lost an average of 57 students each year, which is a more than $365,000 loss each year in funding from the state.\nCroner has predicted that enrollment will continue to decline, but eventually will even out at 1,600. This year there are 1,731 students in Blackford Schools grades K-12.\nAs of Sept. 11, Blackford Schools has 283 students in the junior high and 529 students in the high school, for a total of 812 students. The high school building can hold as many as 1,500 students, so it would not need any additions to accommodate for grades 7-12.\nThe proposed new junior high wing would include at least 10 classrooms in the northeast corner of the building on the first floor which would house science, social studies, english and math for 7th and 8th grade as well as a special education resource room and Read 180 literacy intervention room.\nThat area of the high school already has eight classrooms, and Croner said they can open up 11 classrooms.\nCore classes for the high school would be on the second floor of the building.\nWhile this would separate the students for most of the day, junior high students would have to go across the building for different electives, including gym, JROTC and band. All students would also share a library, art room, cafeteria and industrial technology classroom.\nCroner said he would recommend different lunches for junior high and high school students. He also said there are locker rooms on both levels of the school, so the two age groups can be split up.\nStudents would still be sharing buses and facilities for after-school athletics.\nAthletics is one lingering problem with the plan. Croner said he does not think the bulding can house all of the practices. He said they could have some practices at the junior high or consider combining some teams.\nCroner said curriculum would not change for either school, but junior high students would have more access to advanced classes.\nThe district does not have plans for the junior high building yet. Even without knowing whether or not that building would be used, Croner estimates the consolidation would save the district about $200,000-300,000 per year in personnel reductions. The administration would consolidate, as well as custodians and health staff.\nCroner noted in his presentation that 103 schools in Indiana house grades 7-12 in one building.\nRandolph Central Schools just opened their combined junior high and high school at the Winchester High School building. At Randolph Central, a new wing was built to house the students.\nCroner said he hopes to have Randolph Central Superintendent Greg Hinshaw talk about the process at a future board meeting.\nThe board did not vote on the consolidation on Tuesday. Croner previously said the earliest the board would vote is in December."}

Many people teach for 40 or more years: my grandfather, who was 15 and thus a very junior teacher when he started his career, was a record breaker.\nAfter retiring at the age of 65, he became a part-time school librarian, and did not retire again until he was 70. It is obviously quite impossible to estimate how many young lives he influenced for better or for worse.\nMy father, also a teacher, died at 89, and my brother and I were touched to see the number of former students who came to his funeral.\nI now have no idea how many students I've taught in two countries: I don't think I ever really tried to count them.

And there was more evidence of this ease today. I was in the Kalamata post office, waiting my turn and clutching a fistful of cards and letters bound for Australia, when a bearded young man asked me a question of a practical nature.\nThere was no point in pretending: I had no idea who he was, so I used the passage of time and his beard as excuses, and went on to ask his name.

He is now a lawyer, following in parental footsteps, and had spent some time studying in Essex. 'How was England?' I asked. He laughed and replied that life is quiet there (it always strikes Greeks that way), but that he had had only a 40 minute train ride to London, and that had been great.\n\"He brightened again, and recalled classroom days. 'You were strict, but that did us good. We appreciated it.' Perhaps in the long run, I thought, but said nothing.\"\nBut when I asked about work, Andreas' effervescence subsided. 'It's not going too well, to be frank,' he said. 'These are troubled times, and people are reluctant to consult lawyers because of the expense.' As I had once accompanied a friend to the Kalamata Court, and had decided that once was quite enough, I murmured about recourse to law involving a significant ordeal. He sighed then about too much tangled bureaucracy and not enough efficiency and organisation. And sighed again when I asked in true Greek style whether he was married.

The server is aimed at Web-scale workloads and HP claims Moonshot is 90 percent more energy-efficient than a more traditional Proliant DL380 server.\nIBM, not surprisingly, says it\u2019s determined to do better. \u201cWe want to go out and beat the competition,\u201d Chaudhry said.\nWhile it works toward microservers, the company is also introducing other types of high-density server design.\nOn Tuesday it introduced the NextScale System, a rack server system that can accommodate up to 84 x86-based systems and 2,016 processor cores.\nOne component of the rack is the NeXtScale n1200, a 6U enclosure that can hold up to 12 NeXtScale nx360 M4 servers. Each NeXtScale nx360 M4 server will be able to host up to two processors, up to 256GB of RAM, two hard drives or four solid-state drives. The server is targeted at analytics, databases and technical computing.\nThe 6U enclosures can share cooling resources and power supplies, reducing power costs.\n\u201cYou cut down on the number of power supplies ... and double the density,\u201d Chaudhry said.\nThe first NextScale System will be based on Intel\u2019s Xeon E5-2600 v2 chips, which were announced Tuesday at the Intel Developer Forum and are based on the Ivy Bridge architecture.

The central question will likely revolve around constitutionality.\nWhen President Trump declared a national emergency for border wall funding Friday, he said he expected legal challenges. The central question will likely revolve around constitutionality.\nBefore President Trump even uttered the words national emergency, there was already a lot of talk about legal challenges. Here's the central question - is it constitutional for the president to ignore the decision of Congress not to give him all the money he wants for his border wall and instead get it through a declaration of national emergency? Today, Trump said he expects a court fight.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling, and then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake.\nCORNISH: NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg is in the studio now. Hey there, Nina.\nCORNISH: So how is the president actually justifying his emergency declaration?\nTRUMP: I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.\nTOTENBERG: Well, obviously, if you don't have to do something, it isn't an emergency.\nCORNISH: So how do legal experts think this will play out in the courts?\nTOTENBERG: They seem to think that in the end, the courts are likely to defer to the president on the question of whether there's an emergency. Courts just don't like to second guess presidents on this kind of question. And the current Supreme Court conservative majority is even more deferential.\nStill, the devil is in the details. There are going to be a bunch of lawsuits filed, likely by the House of Representatives, by landowners whose property the wall is going to be built on and by others who might be hurt - for instance, state or local governments who may be able to argue that money meant for one thing is being siphoned off illegally for another.\nCORNISH: Now, let's get back to that question we posed earlier then. Does President Trump have constitutional authority to ignore Congress on a funding matter like this?\nTOTENBERG: The House of Representatives is likely to argue that the president is doing more than just rejiggering more than $5 billion in already budgeted money. He's cutting away Congress's power of the purse, and in some instances, contradicting specific mandates. The White House will likely counter that the president has the power to reprogram money under existing laws and that it's no big deal, that it's been done before by other presidents.\nCORNISH: Before we let you go, the Supreme Court also agreed to hear arguments about the census citizenship question. Remind us what's going on there.\nTOTENBERG: This case is all about whether the administration can add a question on the census form that goes to every household in the country. The question asks the citizenship status for every person in the household. It's not been on the form since 1950 because Census Bureau statisticians after lengthy testing and repeated studies have repeatedly concluded in Democratic and Republican administrations that it would lead to lots of folks not filling out the form if any member of the household or a family is not a citizen.\nNow, remember, the Constitution mandates a count every 10"}

It was one of fewer than 135 sightings recorded in B.C. waters since the 1930s.\nThe leatherback is one of the largest reptiles on the planet and can grow to the size of a Smart car. Instead of a shell, the turtles have a thick, collapsible leather-like back that allows them to dive to extreme ocean depths of up to 1,270 metres.\nThe turtles, which travel from Indonesia to feed on jellyfish, have seen their populations decline drastically in recent years, in part due to frequent entanglement in plastic pollution, according to the the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\nIn Jackie Hildering's experience, marine species are often the first to bear the brunt of environmental problems and leatherbacks are no exception, as many are found with plastic in their stomachs.\nHildering, a researcher with the Marine Education and Research Society, said many people in B.C. may not even know the species exists in local waters, but that even small actions such as releasing a balloon into the air without thinking about where it might land can have an impact on the turtles' survival.\n\"One of the powerful things to realize is that they can't discern plastics and balloons from their jellyfish prey,\" she told Jason D'Souza, host of CBC's All Points West.\nLeatherback turtles in Canada have been designated as an endangered species under the Species at Risk Act. The species has lost 70 per cent of its numbers in the past 15 years.\nA major challenge in tracking and restoring leatherback populations in B.C. waters is first tracking their food source, the jellyfish, said Lisa Spaven, a scientist with the DFO's Pacific Biological Station.\nMarine biologists rely on fish surveys to include jellyfish population data, including density and location. Jellyfish are hard to track and scientists are still figuring out whether leatherbacks prefer areas with a high density of small jellyfish or a low density of large jellyfish, Spaven said.\n\"We're still trying to get a handle on the currents and where the jellyfish are. There's a lot of work yet to be done,\" she said.\nFunding for leatherback conservation was not approved by the DFO this year according to Spaven but her department continues to carry out habitat protection work in Indonesia, where nests are at risk from predators such as wild pigs.\nFormer Vancouver Canucks defenceman Willie Mitchell and photographer Jeremy Koreski spotted the turtle on Aug. 6 just west of Tofino, B.C., and forwarded their photos to Hildering.\nHildering said the men recognized the turtle as a leatherback but, like many in B.C., did not know how important the sighting was.\n\"\u200bI don't think they knew that I would fall off my chair when they sent the photos, I don't know that they knew they found the smallest needle in the biggest haystack,\" she said.\nLeatherbacks are \"living dinosaurs\" that \"belong in B.C. waters,\" Hildering said, and their presence is a reminder of the wide variety of species B.C. coastal waters"}

My wife\u2019s pictures show her in tears . . . if her parents managed to get her into the shot at all.\nI can\u2019t pinpoint exactly why I fear Santa. The obvious reason is I never loved the idea of a stranger coming into the house while I was sleeping. But it\u2019s more than that. I was a people-pleaser who took the threat of being deemed \u201cnaughty\u201d instead of \u201cnice\u201d more seriously than most.

With no advance notice to customers, USCI had simply pulled the plug on its five-channel broadcast service.\nRecently, the company filed for bankruptcy.\nA spokesman for Prudential Insurance Co., which has invested $70 million in the DBS venture, said early in April that USCI was still in business, even though he said it was unable to pay a monthly $600,000 satellite link-up fee needed to keep its programs on the air. He could offer no prediction as to when, if ever, the company would resume broadcasting.\nThe company`s predicament came as no surprise to Wall Street, which during the last six months had watched as a series of merger talks between USCI and numerous communications companies, including Communications Satellite Corp. (COMSAT), collapsed. (USCI reportedly is still negotiating for a possible merger or sales agreement with Viacom Inc., a pay-television service investor.) Earlier this year, General Instrument, another partner in USCI, took a tax writeoff on its multimillion-dollar investment in the company.\nEven so, the shutoff undoubtedly came as a shock to USCI`s customers, many of whom had invested at least $800 in satellite equipment. The company never offered a clue to subscribers that it was in financial trouble. In fact, it wasn`t until three weeks after the shutoff, that customers were officially notified about what had happened. A letter sent to customers explained that the company had run out of money, but offered no information as to whether programming would resume.\nWhatever happens, the USCI situation clearly is bad news for the entire home-satellite industry from a public relations standpoint.\nAt the moment, the back yard satellite-dish business is booming. But most consumers probably don`t know that USCI`s DBS system (in which subscribers pay a monthly fee for receiving broadcasts) is completely different than the large back yard dishes, known as C-band, that can receive scores of channels for free.\nUnfortunately, if you are a customer of USCI, that dish sitting on your rooftop at the moment is nothing more than a giant wok.\nA Kulpsville, Pa., satellite company, Galaxy Broadcast Services, says it can convert USCI systems into small dish C-band systems for about $550. Owners would then be able to receive 20 channels of programming.\nBut an unknown number of USCI customers were leasing their equipment from the company, and altering a system you don`t own doesn`t sound wise.

One of the nice things about having this blog is that I occasionally get to bring one of those columns back and run it here.\nFriday wasn't the first day of spring, but it felt like it.\nLong before I reached the Fahy Bridge, I had taken off my windbreaker and tied it around my waist. A balmy breeze riffled the glittering surface of the Lehigh River as I walked toward South Bethlehem. I turned my face up to the sun; it felt wonderful after weeks of rain.\nOn a spring day like this, you can feel the world coming back to life.\nI strolled through the parking lot of the high-tech Bethlehem Technology Center and climbed down the bank and across the railroad tracks. Then I set off east along the river -- into a place so gloomy that even spring couldn't touch it.\nThere was a day when the grea steel plant along the Lehigh River armed our nation for world wars, built great skyscrapers, bridged huge bodies of water. Its success spilled over into the city from which it took its name and the surrounding area, spawning mansions and country clubs for its leaders and a hard-fought but fine standard of living for thousands of workers. Around the world, its H-beam symbol was synonymous with power and prosperity.\nIn one of the most powerful scenes from the post-war classic movie, \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" a war hero walks through a field full of scrapped airplanes. Unable to find a decent job, his personal life in shambles, he climbs into the cockpit of one of the planes he had flown not so long before -- and remembers what it was like to soar into the heavens and help change the world.\nIt must be a little bit like that for an old steelworker in this place.\nI walked on. Geese honked in protest at my approach and scrambled down the rocks to the river. They were the only signs of life until a lazy old freight train squealed into sight from the west. It overtook me, cutting off my view of the plant's remains.\nEvery so often, I looked behind me for the end of it, but the train seemed endless. I peeked between the cars and over them. Someone had scrawled DEAD on two pipes high above the ground.\nThe endless train slowed and stopped, and the place was utterly silent again. As I kept walking, I finally saw the only signs of human life at work in the plant -- a few workers for Brandenburg Industrial Service Co., employed to clean up hazardous materials, tear down many of the old buildings along the four-mile site and prepare it for reuse.\nI passed the first car of the stopped train and continued under the Minsi Trails Bridge, pausing to listen to the traffic rumbling overhead. There was no walkway up to the bridge; I turned around to return.\nThat's where I noticed the graffiti written in the rusty metal of plant debris. \"THE END IS NEAR!\" it said.\nIn fact, it had arrived. A few miles away, employees at the Coke Works were working their final shifts as that operation -- the last of the company's local operating units -- was shut down.\nIn a sense, this was Bethlehem Steel's last day in the city.\nFrom the east came the sound of another train. It was only four cars long; brighter and newer than the big, slow freight train stopped in front of the steel plant.\nThe"}

So what are they? Trans fats are a byproduct of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs). By bubbling hydrogen gas through oil under certain conditions, manufactures can turn liquid oils into whatever saturation or thickness that they desire. Such partially hydrogenated oils have become popular because they give foods taste and texture, and in the 1950s, trans fats emerged as a way to increase the shelf life for processed foods such as baked goods.\nHowever, they have also been linked to major health problems such as coronary heart disease, since trans fats build up plaque in the arteries that can contribute to a heart attack. In 1999, the FDA first proposed that manufacturers disclose the amount of trans fat on nutrition labels but that did not become a requirement until 2006.\nNow, after reviewing studies on trans fats, the FDA issued a Federal Register notice, which is preliminarily determination that PHOs are no longer \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS). The public, include scientists and other experts in nutrition and health, have 60 days to comment on the FDA\u2019s conclusion, and if after that time the agency still deems that trans fats are unsafe, manufacturers would need to get FDA approval to use PHOs and trans fats in their products. Foods that contain unapproved food additives cannot legally be sold, and therefore are banned.\nMany companies have already rid their foods of trans fats, and New York City even banned trans fat from restaurant food in 2006.\n1. Doughnuts: Without trans fats, they may become more oily. Many desserts, like cookies, cakes and doughnuts rely on trans fats to give them a lighter texture. \u201cOnly partially hydrogenated oils continue to stay a part of the matrix and don\u2019t exude out of the food,\u201d says Kantha Shelke, a food scientist at Corvus Blue LLC and spokesperson for the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT).\n2. Crackers: Trans fats may be replaced by soy bean oil or canola oil.\n3. Movie Theater and Microwaveable Popcorn: Popcorn commonly has trans fats, and according to Kristin Kirkpatrick, a wellness manager and registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, we will probably more actual butter may replace the trans fats to maintain that popcorn flavor.\n4. Frozen Pizza: Any frozen food with many ingredients can contain trans fats, and some easy swaps could include vegetable oils, but some experts worry about what other additives might be added to achieve the same food preserving features that trans fats had. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other additives to make these last longer. Do we really want something in our food that can stay in our pantry for three years?\u201d says Kirkpatrick.\n5. Coffee Creamers: Anytime there is cream in a product, you can thank trans fats. \u201cWe will probably see more soy bean oil or even some vegetables oils used,\u201d says Kirkpatrick. Some brands, like MimicCreme, achieve their thickness with finely lacerated cashews and almonds.\n6. Refrigerated Dough Products: \u201cWe will probably see canola oil increase more because we"}

{"idx": "32671", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Much of Powell's short and tragic life was dogged by mental illness, and he spent a large proportion of his adult years in a series of institutions. Towards the end of his life, the drugs he took to control his problems caused him severe side-effects, and he had no sooner weaned himself off them, than he contracted tuberculosis and spent over a year in a French hospital. Despite this, along with Thelonious Monk, he was one of the most significant architects of modern jazz piano playing.\nHis nimble right-hand melody lines rivalled those of Charlie Parker's saxophone or Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet for their speed, invention and harmonic ingenuity. Powell was a child prodigy, playing piano round Harlem as a child, and joining trumpeter Cootie Williams' band while still in his teens. His first discs with Williams from 1944 show a mature piano style, based on Art Tatum's, but with only a few hints of the brilliance that was to come.\nThis emerged in discs made in 1946 with J. J. Johnson and Kenny Clarke, and in a remarkable trio session from 1947, with the miraculous Bud's Bubble, a high-speed virtuoso performance that eclipsed any previous modern jazz piano recording. This was not issued at the time, and when Powell made his next discs for Blue Note and Clef in 1949, he had already spent time in hospital with mental problems, partly brought on by a severe beating he had received from police a few years before, when he was still in Cootie Williams' band.\nNevertheless, his early Blue Note discs were a triumph, and as well as quintet sides with Fats Navarro and Sonny Rollins, he made some exquisite trio discs, including the forceful Latin number Un Poco Loco. His mid-1950s work was uneven, and interrupted by spells in institutions, as well as problems caused by intolerance to drugs and alcohol. In the late 1950s he moved to France and his career underwent a renaissance.\nHis trio with drummer Kenny Clarke and bassist Pierre Michelot was known as Le Trois Patrons (The Three Bosses) and he became a legendary figure in Paris. His best work, including a spectacular session with Dexter Gordon, recaptured the brilliance of his early days, and there were other such highlights from his European years, including discs with Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas and Johnny Griffin. In 1964 he returned to the United States, and his career declined rapidly, leading to his premature death a couple of years later.\nEarl Rudolph \"Bud\" Powell (September 27, 1924 \u2013 July 31, 1966) was an American jazz pianist. Though Thelonious Monk was a close friend and influence, his greatest piano influence was Art Tatum.\nAlong with Charlie Parker, Monk, and Dizzy Gillespie, Powell was a leading figure in the development of modern jazz, or bebop. His virtuosity led many to call him the Charlie Parker of the piano. Powell was also a composer, and many jazz critics credit his works and his playing as having \"greatly extended the range of jazz harmony.\""}

And still the germs persist.\nIn U.S. hospitals, an estimated 1 in 20 patients pick up infections they didn't have when they arrived, some caused by dangerous 'superbugs' that are hard to treat.\nMachines that resemble \"Star Wars\" robots and emit ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide vapors. Germ-resistant copper bed rails, call buttons and IV poles. Antimicrobial linens, curtains and wall paint.\nWhile these products can help get a room clean, their true impact is still debatable. There is no widely-accepted evidence that these inventions have prevented infections or deaths.\nMeanwhile, insurers are pushing hospitals to do a better job and the government's Medicare program has moved to stop paying bills for certain infections caught in the hospital.\n\"We're seeing a culture change\" in hospitals, said Jennie Mayfield, who tracks infections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.\nThose hospital infections are tied to an estimated 100,000 deaths each year and add as much as $30 billion a year in medical costs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency last month sounded an alarm about a \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to one class of antibiotics. That kind is still rare but it showed up last year in at least 200 hospitals.\nHospitals started paying attention to infection control in the late 1880s, when mounting evidence showed unsanitary conditions were hurting patients. Hospital hygiene has been a concern ever since, with a renewed emphasis triggered by the emergence a decade ago of a nasty strain of intestinal bug called Clostridium difficile, or C-diff.\nThe diarrhea-causing C-diff is now linked to 14,000 U.S. deaths annually. That's been the catalyst for the growing focus on infection control, said Mayfield, who is also president-elect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.\nC-diff is easier to treat than some other hospital superbugs, like methicillin-resistant staph, or MRSA, but it's particularly difficult to clean away. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't work and C-diff can persist on hospital room surfaces for days. The CDC recommends hospital staff clean their hands rigorously with soap and water - or better yet, wear gloves. And rooms should be cleaned intensively with bleach, the CDC says.\nMichael Claes developed a bad case of C-diff while he was a kidney patient last fall at New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital. He and his doctor believe he caught it at the hospital. Claes praised his overall care, but felt the hospital's room cleaning and infection control was less than perfect.\n\"I would use the word 'perfunctory,'\" he said.\nLenox Hill spokeswoman Ann Silverman disputed that characterization, noting hospital workers are making efforts that patients often can't see, like using hand cleansers dispensers in hallways.

The change, a two-year experiment starting with the 2020 state tournament, would split the state\u2019s 87 programs into two divisions with the smallest 32 programs by enrollment assigned to Division 2.\nThat state tournament format would have two four-team divisions, essentially keeping the state finalists at eight total teams. Some coaches prefer an expanded state tournament, giving more programs the chance to compete in Madison, where this year\u2019s state tournament takes place Thursday through Saturday at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Wisconsin Hockey Coaches Association had supported a 12-team state tournament format in which eight schools would be placed in the large division and four in the small.\n\u201cMy feelings are really simple here \u2014 I don\u2019t like the change one bit,\u201d University School of Milwaukee coach Jason Woods said. \u201cIt simply will not have the effect the WIAA is looking for.\nWoods pointed to the formats of the state baseball, softball and volleyball tournaments, which all have an eight-team field for Division 1 and four teams for the smaller divisions.\nThe system was approved by the WIAA Board of Control last June, and will run on a two-year trial basis. The format for the four-team girls hockey tournament, held in Madison the same weekend, will remain unchanged.\nThe change was made in part with the thought that more teams would have the opportunity to advance to Madison.\n\u201cAs a large school, you look at the percentage of getting to a final four (tournament),\u201d Wausau West coach Brian Brandt Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly less than what you would have than the bottom 32 schools.\nSaint Mary\u2019s Springs coach Tim Ahern has an issue with the format as well, especially because of the large number of cooperative programs in the state. Currently, about half of the boys programs are made up of more than one school.\n\u201cI think opening (the tournament) to two classes makes sense. I think how the WIAA has done it makes no sense,\u201d Ahern said. \u201cThe size of school (enrollment) means nothing for hockey, it is more about where is each program getting their players from.\nAhern said he thinks there is a better option than enrollment to determine to which division a hockey program should be assigned.\n\u201cIn my opinion, (the WIAA plan) doesn\u2019t open it up to new teams,\u201d Ahern said. \u201cWhat the state has done a nice job with is in regard to the power rankings of teams (based on a team\u2019s record and strength of schedule).

Until now.\nThe new movie \"The Theory of Everything\" is based on the memoir \"Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen\" (Alma Books, 1013), written by Stephen's ex-wife Jane Hawking. The film focuses on Jane Hawking's courage and determination to support Stephen Hawking, who was diagnosed with a type of motor neuron disease when he was 21. His mind remains undamaged, but the disease has destroyed most of his voluntary muscle control.\n\"I didn't want it to be a science movie,\" McCarten told Space.com. \"We don't want to see endless equations; we want a story.\"\nBut that didn't mean they left out all the physics. The director, James Marsh, said the film crew included an on-set physics adviser. Marsh and McCarten knew that, ultimately, Hawking and other physicists would see the film, so they wanted any science and math presented in the movie to be accurate.\n\"I wanted to honor his great discoveries,\" McCarten said. \"There was never a deal where we get rid of some of his discoveries because we're not interested. They had to be there, but they had to be cinematic and entertaining.\"\nMcCarten said he always knew the film would have to be three stories in one: a science story that explores the origin of space and time, the horror story of Hawking's physical decline and the love story between Stephen and Jane. The movie is focused mostly on Hawking's personal life, but a few broad physics and cosmology themes are woven in. The idea was to keep the physics to a level where people could grasp the general nature of the ideas without needing to understand any of the details or complicated mathematics behind them.\n\"I decided, at some point, the trick would be, don't have a scientist explain the science,\" McCarten said. \"And so you would be forced to use layman's terms and, more than that, forced to use objects lying on the table to try and explain quantum mechanics.\"\nStill, audience members will not come away with much of an understanding of Hawking's discoveries and theories.\n\"Physics and movies don't really go together so well, and a dramatic film is not really the best place to discuss theoretical physics,\" Marsh said.\nWhile directing the film, Marsh drew inspiration from anecdotes used to explain science, like Isaac Newton being hit on the head with an apple (gravity) and Archimedes jumping out of the tub naked and yelling \"Eureka!\" (Archimedes' Principle).\nMcCarten wrote the script before he ever approached Hawking about the movie, so the physicist had little input in the film.\nHowever, Hawking did come to the second day of filming. Actor Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking in the film, said the pressure that day was incredible. The crew was filming a scene where Stephen and Jane watch a fireworks show at a school dance at the University of Cambridge.\n\"You saw this silhouette of him in his chair coming down, flanked by nurses, and his face was uplit by his computer screen like a kind of spotlight on his face. And then, as if on cue, the fireworks went off,\" Redmayne"}

Originally used for ornate decorating inside the home, it spread to the exterior, where it proved to be a durable alternative to siding finishes in warm, dry climates. Traditionally, stucco was either plaster white or sometimes tinted by adding specific natural ingredients such as brick dust or clay. Modern stucco generally contains up to 10 percent of either a liquid paint tint or powder cement and mortar dye, custom mixed in one of two manners: either mixed with water before addition to the stucco or combined with the stucco as a dry ingredient.\nFill a 5-gallon bucket with the amount of water required for the stucco amount you need. Various stucco mix manufacturers call for different amounts of water according to product formula and the amount of stucco prepared.\nMeasure and add the amount of powdered or liquid tint specified in the product instructions. Most will provide guidelines for lighter and darker tones as well. Use a plastic measuring cup and add one scoop at a time, mixing with a plastic or wood paint stirrer as you pour in the tint.\nMix in additional amounts of other tints as desired. Most tints come in a limited number of basic colors, and custom colors necessitate a specific mixture or recipe. Do not exceed the manufacturer's given proportion of tint to stucco.\nPour the proper amount of stucco into the well-mixed tint slurry, following the manufacturer's directions. Add slowly and mix thoroughly with a mixing paddle attached to a drill. Move the paddle up and down as you work around the bucket, gradually increasing speed as if you were mashing potatoes. Ensure all water and color is dispersed throughout the stucco mixture. The resulting product should be stiff like peanut butter or thick mashed potatoes.\nMix the stucco according to the manufacturer's instructions, filling a 5-gallon pail with the amount of water appropriate for the amount of stucco prepared. Add the proper amount of stucco mix, stirring it in slowly and mixing thoroughly with a mixing paddle attached to a drill. Once all the mix is in the water, turn the drill speed up and work the mixture up, down and around the pail as if you are mashing potatoes. The resulting mixture should be about the consistency of peanut butter or thick mashed potatoes.\nAdd the tint to the stucco blend slowly, measuring out portions of tint -- whether liquid or powder -- and adding one at a time until the desired tone is achieved. Consult the tint manufacturer's directions for color amount guidelines, but use your own preference to add less or more.\nMix the stucco and tint blend thoroughly to ensure the color is dispersed completely. Add additional tints, staying within the recommended tint-to-stucco proportion.\nFor best results, mix the entire amount of stucco in one batch and keep covered in an airtight container or with plastic. This ensures your color matches throughout the application. If this isn't possible, record the measurements you use and follow the recipe for each batch. A batch typically will last only about two hours.\nBesides stucco mix, you can also purchase and tint premixed stucco or even your own stucco mixture. In each case, the tint is added similarly -- either in a slurry or to the stucco itself."}

This puts him at loggerheads with the government.\nPeter Riddell, a leading political analyst, says Blair's strong pro-European views ensure that attitudes towards the EU will be the ``great divide'' in British politics after Labour's leadership election.\nHis comments were quickly seized on by government ministers who accused Blair of hypocrisy.\nMichael Howard, the home secretary, noted that in the 1983 general election Blair endorsed the official Labour Party line that Britain should withdraw from the European Community. ``The only conclusion can be that he hadn't got the courage of his convictions or that his memory has failed him,'' Mr. Howard jibed.\nIn the 1980s Labour was under strong trade-union influence, which helped to ensure that many of the Party's members of Parliament (MPs) and activists hewed to an anti-European line.\nBut such attitudes, coupled with a commitment to nuclear disarmament, proved deeply unpopular at the hustings, and the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher and Major won four general elections in a row.\nBlair supporters say he is determined to lead his party away from its past strategic errors. They note that Conservative divisions on Europe convey the impression of a government that has lost its way. Blair wants to reap the benefit of these perceptions.\nThere are, however, as many as 50 Conservative MPs who strongly oppose further steps towards European unity, and their presence on the back benches of the House of Commons, where the government has a majority of under 20 is likely to ensure that the government hews to lukewarm EU policies.\nIronically, although he is advocating pro-European policies, Blair also says he admired Mrs. Thatcher's leadership style.\nThe former prime minister was a declared foe of closer European unity, but Blair says he liked the fact that she had a clear set of aims and pursued them with vigor.\nIs Britain's Labour party shedding its labor ties?"}

Presumably a new quango will be set up to measure the exact length of red tape which binds the country, so that Blair will be able to pronounce victory once precisely a quarter of it has been chopped off.\nI don\u2019t hold out a great deal of hope that this latest initiative will achieve anything. We\u2019ve heard it all before. It was six years \u2014 or about 20,000 new regulations \u2014 ago that Blair first set up the Better Regulation Task Force, citing the example of 120 Acts of Parliament which are concerned with fire safety. Chaired by Lord Haskins, the task force was supposed to issue \u2018Regulatory Reform Orders\u2019 ordering civil servants to ease the burdens of business. What became of it? Two years ago ministers gingerly admitted that it had managed to do away with just 27 regulations. The trouble was, it added, that Regulatory Reform Orders had, er, themselves become too bureaucratic.\nWorse, the task force seemed rather more preoccupied with tackling regulations which made life difficult for the government rather than those which affect citizens. Last year it published a report, Less is More, proposing a handful of laws for abolition. One of them was the Trades Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which obliges unions to hold a ballot every ten years to check whether their members still want some of their subscriptions used to make political donations. The government\u2019s other great blow against bureaucracy is a proposal to do away with lengthy public inquiries before constructing airports. Remarkably, the same White Paper came down against any weakening of the rules which oblige private homeowners to obtain planning permission when they wish to extend or alter their homes. Indeed, petty bureaucracy in this field has been greatly increased since the Better Regulation Task Force came into being: since 2002, for example, we have been obliged to call in building control officers to oversee even the minor task of replacing a window frame.\nThe government responded to the inadequacies of its task force in time-honoured fashion: by renaming it. It is now the Better Regulation Commission. Let\u2019s give it a chance, though. It has just published a rather sensible report entitled Risk, Responsibility, Regulation: Whose risk is it anyway?, criticising the official overreaction to such events as the Hatfield rail crash, which resulted in trains running at 20 mph, and the Sudan 1 food dye scare, which resulted in millions of pounds worth of food being removed from supermarket shelves, even though the alleged health risk was negligible. The attitude towards risk, it proposes, should be rebalanced to let the individual make decisions as to which risks he wishes to take.\n\u2018The Better Regulation Commission,\u2019 begins the preamble, \u2018wishes this report to be regarded as a declaration that \u201cenough is enough\u201d.\u2019 Sensible words.

Other animals include the duck-billed platypus, two different species of bats, a tortoise, a cichlid fish, and male and female zebra finches.\n\"This is an exciting new beginning for us,\" said Tanya Lama, lynx team coordinator and doctoral candidate in environmental conservation at UMass. \"We now have access to a wealth of data that was previously not available.\"\nThe work builds on the cutting-edge technologies that allowed the Human Genome Project, a vast international undertaking, to complete the sequencing of the human genome in 2003.\n\"The value of having a high-quality whole genome of a species is almost incalculable,\" said Warren Johnson, a conservation geneticist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., who worked with the UMass team.\nA genome is a \"blueprint for life,\" Lama said, carrying information about the genetic health of a species and its demographic and evolutionary history.\nThis particular blueprint, now available to researchers worldwide, will also serve as a tool for conserving the cat -- an iconic creature of the north that boasts big paws to better hunt its favored prey, the snowshoe hare, in deep snow.\n\"It helps us to better understand the dynamics of populations and to better understand whether those populations will remain viable into the future,\" Lama said.\nInformation from the genome will be critical to wildlife management and policy decisions.\n\"I am excited because what I am most interested in doing is providing the best possible science for (wildlife) managers to make informed decisions,\" she said.\n\"This can help us look at land conservation strategies to help maintain lynx on the landscape,\" said John Organ, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's Cooperative Fish and Wildlife units, and a co-advisor to Lama.\n\"Anytime we can get more information on their population fitness, we'll take it,\" aid Stephen DeStefano, co-advisor to Lama at UMass. \"A lot of conservationists are deeply interested in the future of this beautiful cat.\"\nJohnson said the genome does more than detail what makes the lynx unique -- it helps scientists better understand and interpret genetic information from other species.\n\"Ultimately it's meaningful across vertebrates, including humans,\" he said.\nJohnson said the technology has grown so rapidly in recent years that the genome mapped out for the lynx will be of higher quality, by many metrics, than what has been commonly used for all the major discoveries done with the human genome.\nThe technology is also getting less expensive, making it more accessible to researchers in a wide variety of applications.\nThe process of sequencing a genome starts with the collection of a high-quality tissue sample from a live animal.\nLaboratory or \"wet-lab\" procedures are then used to extract the DNA and arrange it into readable \"libraries,\" which are then fed into a scientific instrument called a sequencer.\nData then comes out of that sequencer as strings of base pairs of DNA.

That night he chowed down on a veal porterhouse. He devoured some pork belly. And he wolfed a serving of lamb meatballs.\n\u201cWe had this gluttony, Game of Thrones kind of meal that was all just meat,\u201d Berry recalled.\nYes, Berry is once again a carnivore, but this year he is going gluten-free. When it comes to this new dietary challenge, the chef doesn\u2019t mince words.\nBerry has long wanted to experiment with his diet so that he could get firsthand experience of what it\u2019s like to live with food restrictions, and could embrace the trend of meatless meals. He figured the exercise would help him improve the menu choices at the restaurant, too.\nMany people experiment with vegetarianism, trying it for a week or a month or a year; then they either make a commitment or revert to their old ways. But it\u2019s different for a chef, who must worry every day about the quality of food \u2013 all of the food \u2013 going out to his customers. Before the food hits the table at Union, typically the cook on the \u201cstation\u201d that made it tastes it, then the sous chefs, then Berry, all checking that a dish is cooked and seasoned properly. It wasn\u2019t until the fall of 2016 that Berry felt his kitchen crew\u2019s palates were trained well enough to leave the tasting of the restaurant\u2019s meat dishes to them.\nBerry doesn\u2019t remember what his first vegetarian meal was, but he does know that he gained about 8 pounds during the first month of his no-meat year. That\u2019s because he made the rookie mistake of substituting carbs and sugar for meat. He ate loads of pasta and breads, and stacks of grilled cheese sandwiches. By February, he realized he wasn\u2019t incorporating enough vegetables into his diet, and he started kicking off his day with juices and smoothies rather than coffee. (He didn\u2019t give up coffee altogether.) He also started experimenting with tofu and other plant-based products.\nOne of his early go-to foods was a mock tunafish salad. Berry would dry a block of tofu really well, then grate it on a box grater, push it through a fine-mesh sieve, or chop it fine. Then he\u2019d add a little sour cream, celery, onion, fresh dill and shallots.\nWhile Union is not a vegetarian restaurant, Berry began developing new meat-free options for diners. For the spring menu last year, for instance, he cooked some local carrots sous vide in bulgogi spice, then charred them on the grill.

Four others trained on their own. Ultimately the six female scribes, or sofrot, worked on the scroll in four countries: two in Israel, two in the United States, and one each in Brazil and Canada.\nThe panels were checked by experts in Jerusalem and New York, who made the minor tikkunim, or corrections, permitted by Jewish law. Major errors require a complete redo of the page.\nLast week the panels were flown to Seattle, where another group of women sewed them together. The Torah mantle, including wooden poles, or atzei chayim, and other traditional accoutrements were created by seven local artists.\nThe scribes were paid, but the others who worked on the project donated their time.\nAccording to Orthodox tradition, women are not permitted to be Torah scribes.\nOver the last decade, however, a handful of women have trained as scribes. It\u2019s an exacting process. Torahs must be written by hand on parchment made from the skins of kosher animals, and scribes must state their intentions out loud each time they prepare to write God\u2019s name.\nIn September 2007, Jen Taylor Friedman of New York completed the first Torah scroll known to have been written by a woman, for the United Hebrew Congregation of St. Louis, Mo.\nFriedman advised the Women\u2019s Torah Project and was one of the experts who checked for small errors. She is among a number of women at work on other Torah scrolls, including Julie Seltzer of San Francisco, one of the six scribes on the Seattle project.\nSeltzer began the year doing all her writing in public at the museum, so visitors could watch and ask questions. She soon realized, however, that she would never complete the scroll by her December 2010 deadline, so Seltzer writes mainly at home now and spends several days a week at the museum talking to the public.\nSeltzer says she doesn\u2019t feel that her experience writing a Torah is any different from a male scribe. But the fact that her Torah, and the one completed by the Women\u2019s Torah Project, were written by women means they will not be accepted for use in Orthodox congregations.\nOn her website, Hasoferet.com, Friedman tells female scribes they need to be upfront about that when they are commissioned to work on a Torah.\n\u201cWhy is a soferet like a swordfish?\u201d she writes. Swordfish, she says, is not considered kosher by most Orthodox Jews, although Conservative Jews will eat it."}

{"idx": "32719", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Xin Jiang is a Realtor with Alain Pinel Realtors in Palo Alto.\nYoung families, both local and international, are attracted to Palo Alto for its excellent public schools. However, not everyone understands what exactly good school means. Moreover, how big is the premium on homes we are paying for good public schools, and how do good schools tend to affect property price in the long run?\nAs for school evaluation, it's convenient to rely on school ratings quoted by popular home-searching websites. It is nevertheless, far more critical to understand the evaluation criteria behind these ratings and come to one's own conclusion. Fortunately, many facts, such as the number of students, enrollment by student ethnicity and student-to-teacher ratio, are publicly available, and not difficult to find through a few web searches. To measure academic strength, while the state of California is shifting to a more balanced assessment system, past academic performance index (API) data are still available as a quick reference. When referring to API, we need to look at the most recent results, as well as the trend.\nWith all the data on hand, it is not difficult to find out that the schools with the highest APIs in the Bay Area are actually not in Palo Alto. However, Palo Alto is the city that has excellent schools (most 900-plus API) across all different neighborhoods and grades the fact of its excellence across the board is unique. Student enrollments in Palo Alto public schools are also generally well diversified among ethnicities. Moreover, teacher-to-student ratio, one measure of school resources, of Palo Alto schools is often lower (better) than those high API schools in the East Bay or the South Bay. Furthermore, another highly appreciated aspect of public schools in Palo Alto is its choice programs, including language immersion and those based on non-traditional educational philosophy and methods. There are increasing demands on the latter, for schools that focus on critical thinking and problem-solving through project-based learning.\nHow does a good public school affect property price then? Palo Alto is not the area that has the most expensive homes in the Bay Area, especially compared to Atherton, Los Altos Hills and even Los Altos. However, Palo Alto does have the highest per-square-foot price among neighboring cities. For instance, during the first half of 2015, average sold price per square foot of living area in Palo Alto was $1,479. This is 29 percent higher than Los Altos, 36 percent higher than Menlo Park, 43 percent higher than Mountain View, and 60 percent higher than Cupertino. In other words, in exchange for good schools, for the same price, one ends up in a much smaller home in Palo Alto compared with other areas.\nAnother proven factor worth mentioning is that property price in Palo Alto tends to decline the least during an economic down cycle, but rebound the most during overall economic recovery. For instance, during the recent financial crisis, the median Palo Alto home price in 2009 declined by 13 percent from its 2008 peak, but rebounded more than two times that since. One the other hand, property prices in some neighboring cities have been more sensitive to overall economic cycles, which matters to people who have to buy or sell during those near-term peaks or troughs. Considering a home is the biggest lifetime purchase for most families, this is actually relevant to everyone in the long run. Both the resistance of Palo Alto property price in bad times and the strong momentum in good times are, to"}

{"idx": "32721", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Thirty-nine percent of Americans believe there is too much government regulation of business and industry, the lowest level in a decade. A third (33%) say there is the right amount of regulation, the highest percentage in 11 years, and a quarter (25%) say there is too little.\nThe drop in the number who think there is too much regulation is occurring as President Donald Trump continues his drive to roll back federal regulations -- a key promise of his 2016 campaign. Trump has boasted of the success of his efforts, including his disputed claim earlier this year that \"No president has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term \u2026 as we have cut in less than a year.\"\nA major target of the cuts has been regulations put into place by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, including key changes on environmental, financial and civil rights issues. The percentage of Americans saying there is \"too much regulation\" rose from an average 37% over the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency (2001-2008) to an average 48% for Obama's eight years in office (2009-2016). The transition to Trump did not change attitudes much in his first year as president -- from 47% saying \"too much regulation\" in 2016 to 45% in 2017. This year, the change was more pronounced -- a six-percentage-point drop to 39%.\nThe pattern has been somewhat different for those who hold the opposite opinion -- that there is too little regulation. The 25% who now say there is too little is only one point above the average of 24% for the Obama presidency. Most of the change since Obama left office has occurred in the percentage saying there is the right amount of regulation, now at 33% -- up from an average 25% under Obama.\nThe question is included in Gallup's Governance poll, which since 2001 has annually measured the public's views on the role of government and how well federal, state and local governments are performing. This year it was conducted Sept. 4-12.\nFewer Republicans Say \"Too Much\" Regulation, More Democrats Say \"Too Little\"\nRepublicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party are driving the decline in the number of Americans thinking the government regulates business and industry too much. While the percentage of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying there is too much regulation has hardly changed since Trump took office in January 2017, the percentage of Republicans has dropped from 74% in 2016 to 57% now. Conversely, while the percentage of Republicans thinking there is too little regulation has stayed about the same over the past three years, the percentage of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying this has risen from 34% in 2016 to 42% now.\nIn response to a related question on the same Gallup Governance poll, a slight majority (53%) of Americans think the federal government has too much power, down from 60% in 2015 and 55% last year. When Gallup first asked the question in September 2002, one year after the 9/11 attacks that left the nation rallying around government leaders and institutions, Americans were more likely to say the federal government had about the right amount of power (52%) than to say it had too much power (39%).

I said to them, 'I can treat you with antibiotics or I can just very carefully monitor the wound and treat you if needed',\" he said.\n\"I put this to each and every one of the patients in my audit and I can tell you, not one of them said 'no doctor, I want lashings of antibiotics'.\"\nThe small audit, conducted with one operator and one hospital in a small regional area \"proves nothing\", Dr McCusker said, but he hoped it would pave the way for future research and larger studies.\n\"What I'm hoping to do is ask other orthopaedic surgeons to see if we can replicate this study,\" he said.\nAntibiotics were a game changer when they were introduced with the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, said South Australian President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), Associate Professor William Tam.\n\"Antibiotics are a very valuable commodity and they have changed how we treat our patients,\" he said.\nBut the era of antibiotic- resistant 'superbugs' has also led to debates on whether the drugs should be used more sparingly in some circumstances.\n\"If we are careless in the way we prescribe antibiotics, over a period of time the"}

In early afternoon, the House rejected the bailout package for the financial industry. Stocks plunged, with the Dow ending the day down nearly 778 points in the worst single-day drop in two decades.\nWhat is a regular investor to make of it all? What about people who have money in bank accounts? Below are some answers to questions that are probably on your mind.\nQ. Why did the stock market fall so far so fast on Monday?\nA. The element of surprise surely didn\u2019t help, since everyone was expecting the bailout bill to pass. There may have been a bit of investor disgust thrown in, too, a sense that our representatives in Washington just don\u2019t get it.\nFear may be the biggest driver, however \u2014 the worry that it may be weeks or longer before companies can get the affordable, short-term loans they need to finance their operations. Without easy access to that money, it\u2019s hard to run a profit-making operation on a day-to-day basis, let alone grow over the long haul. The professional investors who often drive big market moves don\u2019t want to hold onto stocks to see if things will really get that bad.\nQ. What\u2019s likely to happen in the markets over the next few days?\nA. It\u2019s possible that Monday\u2019s market moves will spook members of the House of Representatives enough that they will be willing to change their votes with only a modest amount of compromise. Or, there may be hasty efforts to write a new bill from scratch. This will take days, however, not hours, since Tuesday is the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana. Stocks may rebound, at least somewhat, if another similar bill emerges. But much will depend on the revisions.\nQ. Is any investment truly safe right now?\nA. As long as you trust the United States government, sure. Plenty of banks, like HSBC Direct and Capital One are offering online savings accounts paying more than 3 percent. These accounts have all the normal Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protections of at least $100,000. Also, the Treasury Department is currently insuring investors who had holdings in money market mutual funds as of Sept. 19, as long as the fund company pays to participate.\nQ. What about Treasury bills?\nA. Treasuries are issued and backed by the United States government. But since throngs of investors have rushed into these investments, it has pushed their yields down. Way down. Some Treasuries, with maturities in the one-week to three-month range, are yielding less than 1 percent, anywhere from 0.10 percent to 0.50 percent. Clearly, many investors are willing to accept paltry yields as long as they know their money is secure.\nAnother government offering is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which protect investors against rising inflation. That may be one result of any big government bailout.\nQ. My retirement portfolio has been wrecked by this. How should I respond?\nA. Continue to save.

{"idx": "32726", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Computer scientists at the University of California, San Diego, and Google, are clamping down on fake businesses trying to scam victims through Google Maps.\nMost Google search results are influenced by your physical whereabouts. Googling restaurants, movie theaters, or hairdressers runs up a list of businesses Google Maps believes are nearby. Scammers abused this by registering more than 100,000 fraudulent companies on the popular web mapping service between June 2014 and September 2015.\nEssentially, the miscreants spam Google Maps with registrations for business locations so that they have a greater chance of popping up at the top of search results when someone tries to look up a plumber or locksmith, and so on. There's no actual business at all the registered locations: it's just a filthy trick to make sure you come top, or near the top, of the lists.\nUltimately, this steers web traffic and customers away from real companies. Over 40 per cent of the false Google Map addresses are for on-call contractors like plumbers, locksmiths or electricians. And victims are often quoted a low price over the phone, only to demand a higher fee when the crooked contractors show up.\nIt\u2019s a new form of \u201cblack hat search optimization,\u201d the research team wrote in a paper presented at the International Conference on the World Wide Web in Perth, Australia, earlier this month, and publicized on Tuesday.\nBesides this, other trickery includes setting up false pins for real hotels or restaurants on Google Maps. Over 12 per cent of fake listings, we're told, attempted to make money by creating websites that directed punters to the businesses\u2019 real website, where customers can make reservations or book holidays. Cash can be pocketed by getting a commission for each reservation or referring traffic to the real websites.\nIt\u2019s relatively simple to register a business on Google Maps. All that is needed is a Google account, an address and a phone number to get started. The second stage involves signing up for Google Maps. Google will then send a postcard with a verification code to the business\u2019 address. Once the code is entered, the listing is approved and pops up in the app.\nAround 85 per cent of these fake applications do not make it to the Google Map stage. But the rest get through, as they rent PO boxes under those specific addresses to nab their verification codes. Multiple sham businesses can be registered by using fake suite numbers for the same address. It takes an average of 8.6 days for false listings to be taken down after creation.\nThe majority of these counterfeit listings are in the United States (56.5 per cent), followed by India (17.5 per cent) and France (5 per cent).

But that is exactly what the Museum of Jewish Heritage is planning to do with an elegant glass entry pavilion that it erected in 1997. The pavilion, a pair of trapezoids, was an afterthought, designed in enormous haste when museum officials decided, just before their new building opened, that its design, a granite hexagon by the architect Kevin Roche, didn't include enough room for ticket sales and security screening of visitors and packages. The only solution was a small, separate entry structure. The museum turned to Claire Weisz and Mark Yoes, a young husband-and-wife team of architects who had previously designed a prototype security kiosk for Battery Park City.\n\"The museum people came to us because they said they wanted someone who knew about security booths,\" Claire Weisz said last week as she walked through her building for what may have been the last time. Weisz and Yoes gave the museum rather more than it expected. They produced a crisp, sharply angled structure with a glass roof and glass-and-metal walls that seemed exhilarating amid the earnest and dutiful brick and stone buildings of Battery Park City. Weisz and Yoes managed to get it designed, approved by the Battery Park City Authority and city officials, and fully constructed, in just eight weeks. \"We made it out of any materials we could order and have delivered fast,\" Weisz said.\nThe building, which was known as the visitors center, was never meant to overshadow the museum. But Roche's granite structure turned out to have such functional limitations that the visitors center was soon being used for office space. The little glass pavilion wasn't in most guidebooks, but in time it became the part of the museum complex that architects, especially younger ones, talked about. In a city with few strong modern public buildings, it was a kind of minor, underground icon. In the immediate aftermath of September 11th, when the museum was closed, the visitors center was taken over by the Police Department, which used it to store gas masks.\nBefore the terrorist attacks, the museum had decided to expand, and it had gone back to Roche and asked him to produce a design for the expansion. He proposed a big, swooping form of glass and granite that would sit like a backdrop behind the museum. The little glass visitors center would no longer be needed, and museum officials decided to place Roche's addition right where the visitors center now stands.\nExcavation on the new addition began in late December, and by last week the visitors center had been closed. As a young architect, Claire Weiszhas not had many buildings built, let alone demolished, and she finds it strange that her visitors center might disappear after just four years.\nBut, then again, it might not. The New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, which owns the visitors center, told the Museum of Jewish Heritage last week that it did not want to see the building demolished, not only because of its architectural merit but also because, technically, it has not yet been fully paid for. \"The bonds that financed it are still being paid off, and its useful life has not run out,\" Susan Chin, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Cultural Affairs, said. According to Chin, the city wants the building to be dismantled and moved elsewhere. \"We're hoping that Battery Park City"}

{"idx": "32734", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Why do some Lake Tahoe properties fall out of escrow?\nWhen buyers and sellers open escrow everyone is always hoping for a smooth transaction. There are a number of contingencies during the due diligence period that give the buyer an opportunity to learn more about the property.\nInspection reports, the cost of homeowners insurance, appraisals, loan approval, review of the preliminary title report and homeowners association documents are all important aspects of the process.\nEvery step of the way there is information to be analyzed and judgments to be made as to whether to proceed with the escrow process, do further investigation of a particular issue or potential future construction project or back out of the transaction. Cautious buyers use the due diligence period to learn as much as they can and allay any concerns they may have about the property they are hoping to purchase.\nWhile everyone uses their best efforts to nurture a transaction in escrow toward a successful closing, sometimes issues arise that cause the deal to fall out of escrow. This can happen for many reasons and in a sellers\u2019 market it tends to happen a bit less often than in a buyers\u2019 market.\nWith minimal inventory currently available, buyers have been less particular the past three years when it comes to making discretionary purchases of vacation homes and sellers have become increasingly finicky on the types of offers they accept.\nAs a result, sellers need to be satisfied with every aspect of the proposed contract terms or they will simply wait for another offer to come along and buyers have less power to renegotiate contract terms should they make a discovery during the escrow process.\nOverall, the Nevada contract still is very buyer friendly and buyers still can use disapproval of one of the contingencies as a reason to cancel the transaction risking the chance that they will not find another home to buy that meets their desired criteria for some time. Simply saying that you think the cost of homeowners insurance on the property is too high is enough of a reason for a buyer to cancel the escrow in Nevada.\nSometimes inspection reports come back with unforeseen repairs that will result in costs well in excess of the amount budgeted in the purchase contract. In that case, the parties may either renegotiate or the buyer might simply choose to walk away from the deal.\nIn Nevada, even if the seller offers to repair everything noted in the inspection reports it\u2019s still not good enough. The buyer can simply disapprove of the inspection reports, cancel the escrow and get their earnest money deposit back minus the cost of inspections.\nThe loan approval process has become much lengthier in the recent years. A buyer can have enough down payment and good credit, but if the condo complex in which they wish to make a purchase is involved with litigation or has a high percentage of absentee owners, the lender might not approve the loan.\nAnd on rare occasions buyers simply change their mind that they don\u2019t want a property and release the liquidated damages specified in the purchase agreement to the seller.\nFor all of these reasons and many more, a transaction can fall out of escrow even if everyone involved has worked hard to make it succeed."}

The objects -- or cars -- in your Uber app are meant to be representative of what's really out there on the road.\n\"Our goal is for the number of cars and their location to be as accurate as possible in real time,\" an Uber spokesperson wrote in an e-mail statement.\nUber said it doesn't inflate the number of cars on the road. If anything, there might be fewer cars shown on the app than exist in real life. Visually speaking, Uber doesn't want to overwhelm its customers.\n\"The app only shows the nearest eight cars to avoid cluttering the screen,\" said Uber.\nThe Vice story, written by two people from research institute Data & Society, is the culmination of a six-month study on Uber drivers and how they interact with the app, according to author Alex Rosenblat. She noted that many drivers discussed \"fake cars they see on their own residential street.\"\nThe article thus speculates that phantom cars could be intentional on Uber's part: \"If a potential passenger opened up the app and saw no cars around, she might take another cab service.\"\nUber denies this. While it is possible that a customer might wait longer than expected for a car, even if it appears to be down the road, it's not a means of trickery.\nThe fact that cars are constantly on the move means there might be a slight delay in viewing car locations (which Rosenblat cites).\nUber also said it doesn't reveal the specific location of cars until a ride is requested in order to protect drivers from potentially dangerous scenarios, like the recent riots in France.\nWhen contacted for more information about the study, Data & Society told CNNMoney that it plans to publish its findings and methodology in a future paper.\n\"None of the explanations, that we've seen, dispute the experiences of the drivers,\" a staff member said in an email. \"We would love to know more about what's happening in Uber's system in these cases.\"\nFor its part, Uber said it will continue to invest in its technology to create the best possible experience for Uber riders and drivers."}

The new rules would apply to the UK after Brexit, as the government is committed to emissions standards that are at least as ambitious as current arrangements governed by the EU.\nSeparately, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), which is appointed by the Treasury, on Wednesday said British ministers should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles no later than 2040, matching a similar ban on internal combustion engine cars.\nThe vast majority of goods vehicles on British roads run on diesel because of its higher fuel efficiency. However, the NIC said that the industry would be able to move to hydrogen fuel cell and battery lorries in the early 2020s.\nThe haulage industry and business groups have strongly objected to the NIC\u2019s proposals. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, described the proposed ban as \u201csimplistic\u201d, not realistic and not credible given the lack of alternative fuel sources for long-haul heavy goods vehicles.\nThe tougher attitude towards lorries comes amid a crackdown on carbon emissions across the road transport sector. From 2021, EU carmakers will have to meet an average CO2 emissions target for new cars of 95g per kilometre.\nThe looming deadline has raised the prospect of carmakers paying billions in fines for failing to improve their carbon footprint. Only Tesla and Smart already meet the target out of 50 major brands, according to analysis by Jato Dynamics, a data company. Jato suggested the car industry could pay as much as \u20ac33.6bn (\u00a329bn) in fines from 2021 if it remained at 2018 emissions levels.\nHowever, Transport & Environment (T&E), a Brussels-based campaign group, has raised multiple concerns that carmakers are using loopholes to game the system, avoiding the penalties.\nT&E highlighted the potential for carmakers to sell \u201cfake\u201d electric cars, hybrids that mainly rely on petrol power alongside a little-used, low-range electric motor. Selling more electric vehicles means carmakers are allowed to meet less stringent carbon-reduction measures.\nFiat Chrysler is planning to use another loophole to avoid a big fine for producing dirty cars, reportedly paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros so that the US carmaker\u2019s electric vehicles \u2013 with zero direct carbon emissions \u2013 are included in its fleet.\nPooling emissions in this way is legal but means that the carmaker\u2019s overall carbon emissions will likely fall more slowly than if it stopped producing cars that run on fossil fuels.\nJulia Poliscanova, T&E\u2019s manager of clean"}

But he said that may have to come as a \u201clast resort\u201d in order to reduce costs and remain competitive with Airbus, Boeing\u2019s European rival.\nIn addition to the workforce reduction, Boeing has been trying to save on non-labor costs and supply chain expenses, Alder said.\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes employs about 82,000 people worldwide, accounting for more than half of the Boeing Co.\u2019s total job count. Boeing\u2019s employment in Washington state, including employees in the company\u2019s defense and administrative units as well as commercial airplanes, amounts to about 78,000.\nThe Seattle Times, which first reported the numbers behind the company\u2019s job reduction plan, quoted sources as saying that the reductions could eliminate as many as 8,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of the state\u2019s total, by the end of the year.\nStaffing reductions through midyear, including hundreds of executives and managers, are projected to total approximately 4,000 positions.\nAlder said there was no firm target for the job reductions. \u201cThe more we can control costs as a whole \u2013 the less impact there will be to employment,\u201d he said.\nThe Times said employees were being offered severance packages that advance full pension eligibility and provide a week of pay for every year of service, up to a maximum of 26 weeks.

Our guide to home surveillance systems will help you find the right gear for keeping a sharp eye on your abode.\nAs I'm writing this in the \u00adPopular Mechanics offices in New York City, I'm looking out the front window of my home in Connecticut. There's no one there right now, but only a few minutes ago, I got an alert from the security camera I've got suction-cupped to the inside of the glass. In fact, every day I get an alert around 4 pm; that's generally when the mailman comes for his daily drop-off. But today, I also received a midmorning message that I didn't expect. I checked the video clip on my phone to discover that UPS had left a package on the porch.\nLike many people with surveillance systems, I first got interested in the technology as a home security measure, but over time my relationship with the system has become a bit more complex. Having a constant remotely accessible video link to your front door gives you a sense of connection to what's happening at your house that goes beyond simple peace of mind. Wondering how often your dog runs out the dog door? \u00adCurious about who's leaving all the Chinese menus in your mailbox? Want to know if there's snow on your driveway when you're on vacation in the Bahamas? Modern home surveillance cameras combine software, hardware and cloud-based services to satisfy humankind's instinctual (and occasionally obsessive) curiosity about the status of our homes.\nAnd the software and cloud parts of the equation have gotten surprisingly sophisticated in the past few years. Since Popular Mechanics last discussed the technology, several consumer-grade cameras have come to market that integrate video analytics software once limited to governments and industry. \"All the systems we're seeing now in cities and airports are starting to trickle down to the home,\" says James W. Davis, an expert on video surveillance technology from Ohio State University. \"And it goes beyond security. There's plenty of research into using these systems to monitor and help the elderly in their homes.\"\nWhen choosing a home camera surveillance system, you basically need to ask yourself two questions: How much do I want to spend, and how smart do I want my camera to be? As you might expect, the two questions are interrelated. I tested four surveillance setups ranging from $179 to $650 and found that while many of the basic technological concepts were the same, no two systems had identical features. I also found that if you want all the remote-access, cloud-based bells and whistles, you're going to get sucked into paying a monthly or yearly fee.\nPricing: Basic one-camera system is $179; one-camera motion-detection system is $199. Additional camera is $99 to $129 (outdoor cam is $159).\nMobile Alert: Limited alerts are free; unlimited are $20/year.\nThe Avaak Vue is the cheapest system of the bunch, and it is also the easiest to get up and running. The cameras are battery-operated and completely wireless. They communicate with a hub that plugs into your network router, and all video is viewed through a secure Web page. Even mounting the Vue cameras is easy: They have an ingenious peel-and-stick base that the cameras attach to magnetically. The downside is that Vue cameras are pretty low-resolution"}

The band has agreed to appear at the July 28 and 29 dates at New York's Randall's Island; the August 11 gig in San Bernardino, California; and the August 18 stop in San Francisco.\nNow, a new Web site has surfaced, ratm82407.com, which features two countdown clocks and the opening riff to Rage's \"Bulls on Parade\" running in a continuous \u2014 and, to be honest, annoying \u2014 loop.\nOne clock is set to expire on Monday, with the other ticking away to August 24. But beyond that, there's little information about the actual site itself (which is registered to LiveNation, the concert promotion company spun off by radio giant Clear Channel Communications), or what it might mean.\nBecause of who owns the site \u2014 and the band's reversal of the \"one gig\" commitment \u2014 it wouldn't be a stretch to assume it signifies the announcement of an upcoming, full-on Rage reunion tour and a new studio LP, or possibly even a live release recorded during the band's Coachella set (see \"Rage Against The Machine's Ferocious Reunion Caps Coachella's Final Night\"). Really, at this point, it's all just mere speculation on the part of fans and music-biz insiders.\nSpokespeople for LiveNation and Rage had not responded to MTV News' requests for comment at press time. But one Rage fan site, vietnow.org, may have figured it all out.\nThe site claims the band has booked a show in East Troy, Wisconsin, on August 24, at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre \u2014 basing that assumption on HTML code obtained from the LiveNation-controlled Rage site. Upon viewing the source of the \"Spread the Word\" pop-up, vietnow.org claims a hidden form value \u2014 which it says is intended to help LiveNation keep track of its promotions \u2014 includes the words \"Rage at Alpine.\" After viewing the same source code, MTV News did not find the phrase, but the site predicted early last month that the band would play a gig at Alpine on August 24.\nWhatever the new Rage site might mean, no official clarification seems likely until Monday \u2014 when the final seconds fade from the first countdown clock \u2014 at the soonest."}

The famous slogan used by them was \"Dudlige Badey, Masala Vadey\", implying that Dudley had eaten the Masala Wadey, given to him. Anyone in doubt about this Masala vadey affair, has only to go through the newspapers issued on or after 9th January, 1966.The Bill was however, approved by the then House Representatives. The police were compelled to baton charge the procession, in order to ensure peace and in the process. I believe a Buddhist monk, Ven. Dambarawe Ratanasara, got seriously injured.

GILA, under development by US wartech behemoth Lockheed and academic partners, is intended initially as a planning and training aid for US military air-traffic controllers. In time, it is hoped that the system will be able to learn from its human colleagues and eventually surpass them.\n\"Eventually [GILA] will outperform the novice human planner by 125 per cent,\" Lockheed says.\nThe company believes that GILA will become a true expert system, able to build up knowledge in a continual process - unlike human traffic controllers, who inevitably leave the service or retire. Under phase two, following a successful progress test by DARPA, the programme gets another year of life and a further $5.2m of funds. Phase one was four years long and cost the American taxpayers $22m.\n\"GILA will revolutionize the way expert skill and knowledge are captured and transferred,\" according to Lockheed GILA bigwig Ken Whitebread. \"Using planning, learning and reasoning technologies, GILA will know what to learn, why it's important to learn it, and how to focus resources to quickly achieve that learning.\"\nDARPA hope that GILA will allow deployed US forces to manage crowded airspace above future battlefields and war zones more efficiently, allowing manned and unmanned aircraft, drones, weapons and so forth to cooperate without the crippling planning and authorisation delays common today.\nThis sort of automated routing and planning system - combined, perhaps, with faster-updating and more accurate air tracking - might one day permit much larger numbers of aircraft to operate safely in a given volume of civil airspace. Without something of this sort, it doesn't really matter if you can make a miraculous small, cheap, silent hovering aircraft with synthetic-vision autopilot. Or a decent jetpack, come to that. People would still never be able to fly it in any numbers because this would overload the air-traffic system.\nIt's early days yet for GILA, though; and most DARPA ideas never work out.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel also welcomed the deal, which represents a 3.3% reduction from the previous seven-year budget.\n\u0093From my point of view this agreement is good and it is important because it gives us the ability to act in Europe in the coming years,\u0094 she said. \u0093It gives us the ability to plan for important projects and with a view to growth and employment\u0094.\nThe agreement came after all-night talks.\nCountries such as France and Italy had sought to protect spending, while others pressed for cuts at a time of national austerity. The budget must still be approved by the European Parliament.\nMr Van Rompuy said the deal amounted to a cut of roughly 34bn euro in both commitments and payments. He said EU leaders had met their responsibilities by overcoming sharp differences, and he hoped the European Parliament would meet its responsibilities by passing the budget.\nEuropean Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he would have preferred a budget closer to the Commission's original proposals.

The United States later said it would transport aid to Venezuela in response to a request by Guaido.\nCarrying Venezuelan flags and blowing horns and whistles, his supporters began massed at five locations around the city for a march on EU headquarters in eastern Caracas.\nThe pro-Maduro forces were rallied in the western side of the city to mark the 20th anniversary of the rise of power of the late Hugo Chavez, the leftist firebrand who installed a socialist government.\nFor his part, Maduro called for early legislative elections. In a speech to supporters on Saturday, he denounced the National Assembly as \"bourgeois\" and said it was up to the government-controlled Constituent Assembly to decide whether or not to back his proposal.\nMeanwhile hundreds of members of a civilian militia, public workers and people who have benefitted from the government's social programs have concentrated in downtown Caracas in a show of support for their beleaguered leader.\nThe challenge to Maduro, Chavez's handpicked successor, is his most serious yet, with the United States, Canada and nearly a dozen Latin American countries piling on pressure for his removal from office.\n\"The US calls on all military members to follow General Yanez's lead, and to protect the peaceful protestors supporting democracy,\" National Security Advisor John Bolton said in a tweet.\nUnderscoring the high stakes, Air Force Major General Francisco Yanez announced in a video posted on social media that he disavowed Maduro's \"dictatorial\" authority and recognized Guaido as the acting president.\nYanez, the strategic planning director of the air force high command, commands no troops but he was the highest ranking active duty officer to defect -- \"a hard blow\" to the military leadership, which has pledged absolute loyalty to Maduro, said Rocio San Miguel, an expert on the Venezuelan military.\nThe military and security forces have so far been Maduro's main pillar of support, despite an economic collapse that has created dire shortages of food and medicine and a mass migration to neighboring countries.\nBut there have been signs of unrest in the ranks.\nOn January 21, a group of National Guard soldiers rose up against Maduro in Caracas.\nThe mutiny was quickly put down and 27 soldiers were arrested, but it kicked off a week of violent street clashes between civilians and security forces that the UN said left 40 dead and 850 arrested.\nSpeaking from an"}

The fact that most of us today probably associate the term with the 1984 crisis in Ethiopia is testament to its exceedingly careful dispensation; to use it too often would dilute its power to command the attention of the press and governments around the world. Famines don\u2019t happen overnight, but when the United Nations declares one, those governments are expected to pay attention \u2013 and help pay to get the situation under control.\nOn Wednesday, the U.N. declared two regions in southern Somalia as being in the midst of a famine. It\u2019s the first time the word has been used in that country in nearly 20 years and the first time it\u2019s been employed anywhere in the 21st century. The famine comes after months of the worst drought in East Africa in more than half a century, and is affecting about 3.5 million people around the country, most of whom are in the south. Over 165,000 Somalis have already fled to Kenya to get access to food and water; every day, over 1000 refugees are arriving in Dadaab, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, pushing conditions there to the limit.\nBut when did an emergency morph into a full-blown famine? For the U.N., there is a precise and technical set of criteria used to determine when a famine is occurring. At least 20% of the population must be consuming less than 2100 kilocalories a day, 30% of children must be suffering from acute malnutrition, and two adults or four children out of every 10,000 people must be dying of hunger each day.\nThat\u2019s true even in Somalia, widely regarded as a failed state in which the current government controls little of the country, including the capital. This vacuum had no small part the widespread hunger that we have seen splashed across our computer and television screens this week. The drought, of course, played its role, too, destroying back-to-back crop seasons, and food prices are, once again, soaring. But in the absence of a functional government, the militant Islamist group al-Shabab has routinely hampered aid operations in recent years, prompting groups like WFP to stop its food aid in Somalia last year after delivery became too fraught with questionable conditions and too dangerous.\nGood governance \u2014 or rather lack of it \u2014 has been the tipping point before in turning a food shortage into a famine. As Jeffrey Sachs wrote in this magazine in 1998, Nobel prizewinner Amartya Sen concluded that the Bengal famine of 1943, in which millions of rural workers starved in the midst of an economic boom, came to pass because India\u2019s British rulers were not concerned with monitoring the condition of the colony\u2019s working poor. Sachs writes: \u201cThis political observation gave rise to what might be called Sen\u2019s Law: shortfalls in food supply do not cause widespread deaths in a democracy because vote-seeking politicians will undertake relief efforts; but even modest food shortfalls can create deadly famines in authoritarian societies\u201d \u2014 or, in the case of Somalia, in societies where there is scarcely a government at all. Hence another nation where residents suffer chronic bouts of hunger and malnutrition: North Korea.\nSo far, the attention the international community has paid to the simmering problem"}

In fact, it\u2019s a necessity. Last week I went to CES with a mobile phone, a laptop, a digital camera, a dictaphone, an iPod, a Nintendo DS, a Skype headset, and a USB memory stick.

It\u2019s true that the current crop of mobiles offer five-megapixel cameras, which for many people is converged enough for them to lose the standalone digital camera. Yet for anything more than casual snaps, we\u2019re not there yet. It\u2019s partly down to battery life \u2013 try using a Nokia N95 for more than a few snaps to see that \u2013 and partly due to quality.\nPhones are still catching up when it comes to optical zoom, shooting modes, and overall photo quality. My trusty Panasonic DMC-FZ7 stays \u2013 although thankfully, when I don\u2019t have it with me, my N81 is a decent substitute for snapshots. It\u2019s worth noting here that I have seen bloggers at mobile trade-shows using their handsets as cameras \u2013 so some people are ahead of me on this count.\nCan I throw out my dictaphone?\nI bloody love my Olympus dictaphone: it records stuff as MP3s and then turns into a USB stick to transfer them to a laptop for playback and transcribing. But I\u2019m being a bit lazy \u2013 more than one person has pointed out that my mobile is more than capable of acting as a journalist-grade dictaphone. Meanwhile, there are several iPod add-ons to convert that device into a voice recorder too. If I can get my arse into gear, the dictaphone goes.\nCan I throw out my iPod?\nThe convergence between mobile phones and iPods is one of the most hyped in recent years, yet how justified the hype is depends on your music usage.

This requires astronomers to search for the vibrant flares of energy produced during TDEs.\nThe team first observed the 15 colliding galaxies in 2005, but they noticed that one galaxy \u2013 F01004-2237 \u2013 looked strikingly different when they reviewed it again in 2015, according to study co-author and University of Sheffield PhD student Rob Spence.\nLead author Clive Tadhunter said the results for F01004-2237 suggest that TDE events will become more common in the Milky Way galaxy when it eventually merges with the nearby \u2013 in cosmic terms \u2013 Andromeda galaxy in about 5 billion years."}

The only problem was it may have been a mistake, as other Palm Pre retail outlets including the Sprint Store did not drop their prices.\nAfter news of the mixup broke yesterday on PreCentral.net, many blog readers stormed their local Best Buy locations to grab a Pre for $99 with a two-year contract, instead of the original $199 price. But the Pre spree didn't last long, as John Bernier of Best Buy's Twelp Force -- the retail chain's customer-service team on Twitter -- let the world know the new Pre pricing was an accident. \"Actually, [the Palm Pre is] $199, we corrected an unintentional pricing error,\" Bernier said in one of his many tweets discussing the Pre issue.\nEven though the new price tag may have been an error, the big box retailer still delivered price-dropping joy to many happy Pre fans. Over on Pre Central.net, commenter d2globalinc claims to have received a credit of $214 after taking back two Palm Pres purchased at Best Buy within the last thirty days. Both FV and JG on CrunchGear said they received a similar rebate on Sunday as a result of Best Buy's Palm Pre sleeper sale.\nBut the happiest people may have been those able to get their hands on a cheap Pre after months of lusting after the device. MERGATROYDER on PreCentral claimed to get the last available Pre at the commenter's local Best Buy, paying just $144 plus some reward points for the device, screen protector and case. JKOnTheRun readers Shawn and Justine also claimed to have picked up Palm's iPhone killer at the bargain basement price.\nAmid the joys there were also moments of outrage from some who had already bought their Pre's from other retailers.\nPre Price drop: Honest Mistake or Foreshadowing?\nWhile not exactly parallels, the Best Buy price mix-up is a reminder of a similar situation with the original iPhone. Apple's wonder device was launched on June 29, 2007, but just over two months later, on September 5, Apple announced it was dropping the iPhone's price from $599 to $399.\nApple's announcement -- while spurring sales towards one million iPhones sold just five days later -- enraged early iPhone adopters who were now out $200 compared to those who waited a few months. In fact, user anger got so loud that Steve Jobs was forced to issue an open letter offering early iPhone adopters a $100 rebate as compensation.\nThe Best Buy situation is different since the retailer claims the 50 percent drop in price was a simple human error. But I'm not so sure. Could it be this price cut was originally planned for late summer or early fall to spur sales into the back-to-school and Holiday seasons, just as Apple did two years ago? A $99 price tag may also make more sense since, feature-for-feature, it puts the Pre against the more comparable iPhone 3G instead of the 3GS, as PC World contributing editor Harry McCracken points out on Technologizer.\nSo, what do you say? Did Best Buy jump the gun on an upcoming price drop or was this really just a simple mistake?"}

What if he'd simply slunk off, embarrassed, into the wings? What if he let Guti\u00e9rrez celebrate, leaving the audience and contestants completely unaware of the rightful winner?\nAccording to an extraordinarily pervasive myth, that's exactly what happened to Marisa Tomei.\nMarisa Tomei took home the trophy for Best Supporting Actress at the 1993 Academy Awards for her performance in My Cousin Vinny. At that point, Tomei was a relative newcomer with only five movies on her resume, and was not considered the favorite to win. In fact, many critics were all in for Joan Plowright in Enchanted April (a movie that no one remembers but that sounds very Oscar-worthy), or Vanessa Redgrave in Howards End.\nBut win Tomei did \u2014 a surprise to nearly everyone. How lucky she was that Twitter did not exist in 1993.\nBut a year later, a rumor \u2014 one that Tomei would later call \"hurtful\" \u2014 started to circulate. There was no way, people opined, that a performance in My Cousin Vinny (which Roger Ebert called \"the kind of movie home video was invented for\") could have really beaten all the serious actresses in films-films. It must have been a mistake.\nJudging by detailed investigations from both Snopes and Gawker, the theory can be traced back to a piece printed by the Hollywood Reporter in 1994. \"A rumor has been making the rounds in Manhattan...\" it read, \"...that last year Marisa Tomei received her Oscar statue by error, with a resultant scandal about it soon to be exposed, much to the shame of the Academy.\"\nRumor had it that during the ceremony, presenter Jack Palance found himself unable to read the name on the winner's card. Momentarily flustered, he instead called out the last nominee name listed on the teleprompter.\nSurprise! It was Marisa Tomei.\nOf course, the Hollywood Reporter made it clear that it didn't support the rumor. So did Entertainment Weekly, which also reported on the theory. But by giving voice to whispers most people likely hadn't heard anyway, the two publications kept the rumor mill running. Finally, in a 1997 interview with Geraldo Rivera, Observer film critic Rex Reed endorsed the theory, contending that Palance was intoxicated during the broadcast and that the Academy assembled a \"massive cover-up\" for his alleged gaffe.\nBut, as one might guess, the evidence is not on Reed's side. For one thing, the Academy flat-out denied the allegations, insisting that two representatives from Price Waterhouse (the company that tabulated the Oscar votes) stand ready to intervene during the show in the case of an error.\nFootage from the 1993 broadcast, now widely available on YouTube, further discounts the theory.

The work is never boring, he says. \"I like my coworkers, and I often work on construction sites.\"\nHe completed a long journey to arrive where he is today.\nHashimi is the eldest of four children. His father died in the war in Afghanistan. When he was 15, Hashimi fled from Jalalabad in northeast Afghanistan and embarked on a five-month journey to Munich. He flew from Kabul to Tehran, and from there, he traveled on foot or by bus through Turkey, Greece and Italy before reaching Germany. Sometimes he was part of a group and sometimes he was alone. He completed a journey of more than 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) -- without his family.\nAfter arriving in Munich, he received assistance from the local youth welfare office. As a foreigner, it was difficult at first to find his bearings. \"I couldn't understand anyone,\" says Hashimi, who now speaks German almost fluently. After graduating from lower secondary school with a high grade point average, he completed a traineeship as an auto painter, and then a second traineeship at Heizung-Obermeier, where he was given an important opportunity last year. \"If he wants to, he can also complete the work here he needs to become a foreman,\" says business owner Olaf Zimmermann.\nTwo years ago, Zimmermann noticed that it was becoming more and more difficult to find skilled personnel.

Some countries agree with the The World Bank, like Denmark. The Scandinavian country\u2019s Central Region is building a new international climate center in the city of Lemvig, located on the country\u2019s west coast, facing the North Sea.\nThe $7.9 million building is a key part of the region\u2019s Coast to Coast Climate Challenge, a six-year-long climate awareness initiative that\u2019s being carried by the region\u2019s government and several private and public organizations\u2013like the local utility company\u2013with the help of European Union funds.\nThe name of the building is the Climatorium, and it will be designed by Copenhagen-based architectural firm 3XN. The two-story building will have offices and public space to host exhibitions about climate change, conferences, concerts, and events, as well as a permanent caf\u00e9.\nThe building has a glass fa\u00e7ade that opens to the Lemvig Harbor, which makes the wooden-clad first floor appear as if is floating in the air. Around it, a landscape called the Climate Wedge is made with soft curves that represent the meteorological isobar lines that represent the typical weather of the city.\nBut the takeaway here is not how pretty the architecture is. It is the fact that, by putting the building on the map, Denmark proves that it wants to become one of the world powers in climate solutions. This building will become one of the main hubs to make that happen. The initiative already counts 31 private and public partners and 19 supportive partners.\nThe cities in the area are betting that the center will attract both experts and companies. That, in turn, could create jobs and spur economic growth.\nThe Climatorium is expected to open in 2020.

In every one, the other person and I consistently assume that each other's intentions are positive.\nThis may not seem like a big deal, but it's actually huge. Let me give you an example. Let's say that your co-worker, Joe, promises to get some information to you on Thursday; it's pretty important because you can't finish a key report for which you're responsible with having his info. Thursday comes and goes: no report. What's your first reaction?\nIs it something like: \"How lame is that? Joe has no work ethic and he clearly doesn't care about anybody but himself!\"\nOr is it more like: \"Hmm. I wonder what's going on? - maybe he didn't get how important this was - or maybe he got slammed with something he couldn't avoid. I'll call him and check.\"\nThe first reaction assumes negative intent - that Joe either doesn't care about you or is actively trying to make your life tough. The second reaction assumes positive intent - that Joe is well-intended toward you, and had some legitimate reason for not fulfilling his commitment to you.\nImagine the reaction you\u2019d get if you walked down path #1. Drama, emotion, conflict. Imagine the reaction you\u2019d get if you walked down path #2. Collaboration and resolution.\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward: assuming that the other person\u2019s intentions are neutral to positive will generally cause you to behave in a way that will yield a neutral to positive reaction from him or her. Assuming that his or her intentions are negative will generally cause you to behave in a way that will yield a negative reaction.\nThis is just a small example. Think about how this plays out with your spouse, your children, your team members or your boss over a period of days, weeks, months.\nI worked with someone for many years who seemed to operate on the assumption that almost everyone was out to get her and her company. When others failed to behave as she thought they should, her automatic assumption tended to be that they were trying to make her life difficult or wanted her to fail \u2013 or that they were simply incompetent. She and I spent a lot of time talking about the power of assuming positive intent, but she wasn\u2019t really able to change her mindset. I think she believed that assuming negative intent (although she wouldn\u2019t agree that\u2019s what she was doing \u2013 she called it being \u201cprudent\u201d) protected her from getting hurt or being taken by surprise.\nI saw the impact of her negative assumptions on a daily basis: it was difficult for colleagues to create fluent, easy relationships with her; they felt that she was withholding her trust and approval, and so they treated her the same way - and they began to question her intentions. A good deal of time and effort started getting wasted on a daily basis as they all began second-guessing each other and complaining and gossiping about each other to third parties: \"Did you hear that she....?\" \"Can you believe that he asked me..?\" They started withholding information from each other and looking out for themselves rather than supporting one another.\nAnd then - fortunately - there's the opposite situation. Let me use my daughter as an example. She and I almost always assume positive intent in dealing with each other. Our relationship -- as mother and daughter, as friends, and now as colleagues (she's been doing some work with and for me over the past six months or so) -- is characterized by ease and satisfaction. And when we have a task to do together, our collaboration is almost always smooth and productive, the outcomes"}

He said they eventually may try their luck in a less expensive state like Arizona or Texas if he can land a manufacturing job there.\nThe end to the five-year program that extended benefits for the long-term jobless affected 1.3 million people immediately and will affect hundreds of thousands more who remain jobless in the months ahead. Under the program, the federal government provided an average monthly stipend of $1,166.\nWhile the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress want to continue the program, the extensions were dropped from a budget deal struck earlier this month and Republican lawmakers have balked at its $26 billion annual cost.\nThe end of the program may prompt a drop in the nation's unemployment rate, but not necessarily for a good reason. People out of work are required to look for work to receive unemployment benefits. As benefits disappear, some jobless will stop looking for work out of frustration and will no longer be counted as unemployed.\nThe trend has already emerged in North Carolina, which started cutting off extended benefits in July. The state's unemployment rate went down - from 8.8 percent in June to 7.4 percent in November- even though the number of North Carolinians who said they had jobs rose only slightly in that time.\nThe North Carolina evidence is consistent with the theory that ending benefits will cause some unemployed to drop out of the workforce, said Michael Feroli, an economist at JP Morgan Chase.\nThat's what Fed chairman Ben Bernanke meant when he said this month that the end of extended benefits \"will bring the unemployment rate down, but for ... the wrong reason.\"\nSome unemployed people said the loss of benefits might drive them to take minimum wage jobs to get by until they can find work at their skill level and in their field.\nRichard Mattos, 59, of Salem, Ore., has been out of work since March, when he was laid off as a case manager at a social services organization. Without the unemployment income, Mattos said he and his wife will have enough money for one month's worth of bills. Almost every day, he visits employment centers run by the state of Oregon or Goodwill Industries International.\n\"I don't know what we're going to do,\" he said. \"We could end up homeless because of this.\"\nSince 2008, the federal program paid out benefits to the unemployed after their 26 weeks of state benefits ran out. At its peak, the program offered up to 73 weeks of federal benefits - which are typically offered during periods of high unemployment - to the long-term jobless.\nJames Sherk, a labor policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said ending the extensions could induce workers to take jobs they might have overlooked initially. Extended unemployment benefits can give workers \"a false sense of how much time they have before they have to start broadening their net to less than ideal positions,\" he said, adding that the labor market, while not ideal, is stronger and continues to improve.\nIn November, the country's unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7 percent, but is still above the 5 percent to 6 percent rate that would signal"}

Instead it fears that Iran wants to enrich the uranium to make nuclear weapons.\nIran denies such aspirations. But its move is viewed with concern internationally because it would create material that could then be processed into weapons-grade uranium more quickly and with less effort than Iran&apos;s present stockpile of 3.5 percent enriched uranium.\nOn Wednesday, Iranian Vice President Ali Akhbar Salehi said the process of higher enrichment was going smoothly, a day after Iranian officials announced a start of the operation, but gave no details on the scope of the new activities. The restricted IAEA document, however, indicated that, for now at least, they were was modest in scale.\n\"It should be noted that there is currently only one cascade ... that is capable of enriching\" up to 20 percent, said the document. A cascade is 164 centrifuges hooked up in series that spin and re-spin uranium gas to the required enrichment level.\nThe document, relying on onsite reports from International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, also cited Iranian experts at the enrichment plant at Natanz as saying that only about 10 kilograms \u2014 22 pounds \u2014 of low enriched uranium had been fed into the cascade for further enrichment.\nAgency inspectors were told Wednesday \"that it was expected that the facility would begin to produce up to 20 percent enriched ...

With low upfront and ongoing costs, hardware appliances help control loose drive security using an easy, efficient process.\nMarkku Willgren is President of US Operations for Blancco, where he focuses on the data security sector. His expertise encompasses asset disposal security and process efficiency, regulatory compliance and data erasure technology.\nIn data centers, swapping failed drives from a host system with new ones is a standard process for optimal operation of storage arrays and servers. Failed drives are typically stored, physically destroyed or sent back to OEMs with data intact, but these approaches present problems.\nStored or shipped drives are vulnerable to data breaches if a drive is lost or stolen. Physical destruction may not provide tamper-proof reports for regulatory compliance and can accumulate costs from not exercising OEM drive warranties.\nFor secure and cost-effective operations, data centers should fully erase failed drives on-site for safe transport to the OEM. Turnkey hardware appliances that use advanced data erasure software to sanitize failed drives offer data centers enhanced security, cost savings, regulatory compliance and an efficient data disposal process.\nData centers can quickly accumulate failed \u201camber light\u201d drives, as an estimated 2 percent of drives are replaced yearly. These drives could become at risk unless immediately erased.\nA Compliance Standards poll found that lost or stolen devices affected nearly 58 percent of U.S. enterprises with 10,000 or more employees. For example, Coca Cola lost sensitive data of 74,000 employees this year due to theft at the IT decommissioning phase.\nErasing data from failed drives is critical, as up to 80 percent of them are still operational and vulnerable to data breach. Many industry standards and regulations like healthcare (HIPAA, HITECH), finance (GLBA, SOX, FACTA) and retail (PCI DSS) require data sanitization and proof of erasure for each drive in the form of auditable reports. Non-compliance may result in large fines, civil liability and costly damage to brand image.\nHardware appliances that sanitize drives in-house using advanced data erasure ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance with audit-ready reports, and enable data centers to safely return failed disks to OEMs within RMA timeframes.\nA data center replacing 200 drives annually could save $240,000* with effective RMA processing. Quick and safe return of failed drives is possible with erasure policies and equipment in place.\nIn-house erasure of loose drives supports a secure chain-of-custody for transport to an OEM, without requiring specialized and expensive carriers, as for disks with intact data. Third-party on-site erasure or building your own erasure stations can be cost and labor prohibitive, so an appliance pre-loaded with advanced data erasure software can offer a cost-effective, long-term solution.\nData centers gain control of loose drive decommissioning by using the right processes and equipment. A policy for prompt disk erasure that prohibits failed drive accumulation helps avoid data breaches from lost or stolen disks. Such policy is complemented by equipment that automates the in-house erasure process.\nFor security and efficiency, a hardware appliance with advanced data erasure software simultaneously erases SATA, SAS, Fiber Channel, and SCSI drives from all major OEMs, as well as SATA solid state drives (SSDs).

{"idx": "32830", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: With its global infrastructure and diversified portfolio, Wilhelmsen is much more than a shipping company. It\u2019s a maritime powerhouse.\nThomas Wilhelmsen has a vision. The fifth-generation leader of his namesake company wants it to be a center of excellence for the entire industry. He wants it to offer something \u2013 a product, a service \u2013 to all 50,000+ merchant ships sailing the seas today. Wilhelmsen serviced 26,000 of them in 2015, so he\u2019s well on his way.\nBut more than that, he wants his company to be a moral and ethical leader as well, a model corporate citizen, shaping the industry in areas like sustainability and the environment, workforce diversity, accountability and openness, and the ability to add value for customers, employees and the global community.\nIt\u2019s a tall order. But he knows how to get there, and he\u2019s already delivering results. The company today operates car and ro-ro vessels, produces a wide variety of maritime products, has ship agencies all over the world and oversees an extensive ship management business. It also has subsidiaries involved in maritime safety, logistics, insurance and training. Few, if any, companies can match the extent and depth of its services.\nOn the corporate citizenship side, it\u2019s been running its fleet on low-sulfur fuel for many years now, entirely on its own initiative and expense. In 2013, Wilhelmsen began publishing a Sustainability Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative to accompany its Annual Report, one of the few companies in any industry to do so. And there\u2019s more, but let\u2019s start at the beginning.\nIn 1861 Morten Wilhelm Wilhelmsen established a small ship chandlery and brokerage company, which he aptly named Wilh. Wilhelmsen, in the small town of Tonsberg, Norway. In 1865 he bought his first vessel, the Mathilde, a wood sailing ship, and twenty years later his first steamship, the Talabot, which quickly proved to be a huge success. Named with the letter \u201cT,\u201d Talabot initiated the Wilhelmsen nomenclature.\nAs the business prospered, it continued to modernize with the newest and smartest ship technologies of the day. Wilhelmsen soon became the largest cargo carrier in Norway as well as a major transporter of crude oil and petroleum products.\nDuring World War II, the company lost twenty-six cargo ships and fifty-two sailors. While operating mainly in Europe, it also sent ships to the Pacific theater to transport U.S. troops to the Far East. After the war, many of the ships returned to commercial service to assist in the massive task of rebuilding a war-torn Europe.\nIn the 1960s, a sea-change took place at Wilhelmsen as it invested in a fleet of roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) vessels to take advantage of the new and growing export trade in automobiles. At the time, autos were transported on ordinary cargo ships and simply stowed on top of the other cargoes or lifted onto the ship by a crane using special slings. The new ro-ro vessels had side-ports and shipborne ramps to allow easy access to cars and other drivable units.\nIn 1999, the company formed a joint venture with Swedish company Wallenius Lines, which was the prime exporter for Volkswagen, and expanded its fleet to more than seventy auto carriers"}

Levine said he is in talks with other universities and expects to double the number of participating schools by April.\nThe calculator is the latest tool universities are deploying to fight sticker shock, as college costs balloon and parents and students grow wary of taking on hefty debts for degrees.\nMany colleges, especially, smaller private schools, are concerned the initial cost of an education listed on their websites, anywhere from $60,000 to $70,000, may be scaring off students from low- and moderate-income families.\nColleges generally provide price calculators on their websites, but they are usually complex, require families to check their tax filings, and tend to be abandoned after a few minutes, doing little to allay concerns about the high cost of college.\nAt Williams, tuition, room and board, and fees total nearly $68,000 for the 2017-18 school year. But the average annual financial aid grant is $50,000, and about half the students receive some economic help, say college officials.\nStill, cost confusion can lead qualified students to go to less prestigious colleges that offer fewer grants and may ultimately be more expensive because families have to take out more in loans, university officials say.\nA college degree has increasingly become a marker for job security and a ladder out of poverty. In 2016, the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree was 2.7 percent, but 5.2 percent for those with just a high school diploma.\nMany elite colleges still struggle to attract students of modest means, however.\nAccording to the Equality of Opportunity Project, a collaboration between several leading economists who study income mobility, the share of students from low-income families at the country\u2019s elite colleges changed little between 2000 and 2011, despite tuition reductions and outreach efforts.\nAt Amherst College, nearly 17 percent of students came from top 1 percent of income earners, compared to 4.2 percent who came from the low-income families.\nAmherst, which joined MyinTuition in April, is hoping the calculator helps the school draw more applicants who may need financial help, said Katie Fretwell, its dean of admissions and financial aid.\nThat initial price at Amherst \u2014 including tuition, board, travel, and health insurance \u2014 is estimated at $73,250 to $75,700 annually, and it can bring a family\u2019s interest in the school"}

Their eye was on the retail opportunity\u2014 an estimated 20 million shopkeepers. But the project went on the backburner. It was a huge decision as, two months earlier, the goods and services tax Bill had been passed.\nThe GST law would require India\u2019s massive base of small and medium enterprises (SME) to comply with a new and more complex law by filing returns on a technology platform called GST Network (GSTN). Tally refocused energies on refining the flagship accounting software, Tally ERP.\n\u201cIt was all hands on deck,\u201d recalls Tejas Goenka, 28, executive director of Tally, who spent the previous two years overhauling its partner ecosystem to speed up reach of products to a growing customer base.\nIn hindsight, Tally\u2019s timing to revamp sales and distribution (See Outreach Network) couldn\u2019t have been better, as the push for SMEs to buy software came from regulation. \u201cWhen GST happened, product availability became crucial because of compliance requirement,\u201d says a former senior manager at Tally, who asked not to be identified. The revamp of the partner ecosystem, helmed by Tejas, was to deepen Tally\u2019s hold for the retail opportunity. \u201cIt actually made our ability to scale better,\u201d says a manager from its product team, who asked not to be named because he isn\u2019t authorised to speak to the media.\nUntil 2015, the Tally tale was how software evangelist and social hermit Bharat Goenka built a financial accounting product any Indian business could use. The company was originally known as Peutronics. Incorporated in October 1991, it is one of India\u2019s oldest software product makers.\nTo build that flagship product in 1986, Goenka had to first get the buy-in of father Shyam Sunder Goenka, who refused to learn technology. \u201cWhen I buy a car, I want to be the driver \u2014 not a mechanic,\u201d he would tell Bharat. The late SS Goenka was pointing to technophobia among SME users. Under him, their core business had been to supply materials to textile mills such as Binny and National Textiles Corporation. \u201cWe are not creating a (software) product for ourselves. We are creating it for the market,\u201d he told Bharat Goenka in the late \u201980s.\nIt\u2019s why the philosophy of Tally became about: absorbing the complexity, but delivering simplicity in a software product to open up the SME market, which is not tech savvy. To grow the nascent market, Bharat Goenka built relationships with a sales channel network, which by 2014, spanned 120 master Tally partners (MTPs) and more than 25,000 Tally partners (TPs).\nThe old sales channel had been designed to open up, or discover, the market. Several thousands of TPs took the product for installation to offices of small businesses. \u201cWe had a long tail of TPs, who were essentially being treated the same way,\u201d Tejas says, referring"}

First, the Times editorial board would clearly count as a member of any group looking forward to \u201ca new era of broader cooperation with Iran.\u201d Second, the Times has done far more than merely \u201chope\u201d for such cooperation. While the newspaper has been demanding the release of an American journalist \u2014 one now facing a prison sentence of indeterminate length \u2014 some of its own journalists, under the auspices of their employer, have been engaging in a commercial enterprise that benefits his captors.\n\u201cTales from Persia\u201d is the exotic name the Times has given to the 13-day getaway to Iran it operates. For $7,195 (not including airfare), participants are invited to join columnist Roger Cohen, editorial board member Carol Giacomo (who is leading the trip that is currently ongoing), or Paris correspondent Elaine Sciolino and hear their insights about \u201cthe traditions and cultures of a land whose influence has been felt for thousands of years.\u201d The itinerary for the seven upcoming departures promises \u201cbeautiful landscapes, arid mountains and rural villages.\u201d Needless to say, Evin Prison, where the Iranian government houses political prisoners and Rezaian continues to languish, is not among the stops, though a visit to the home of the late Ayatollah Khomeini is.\nThe Times-operated trips to Iran (which began earlier this year) differ in important ways from those taking place in Andalusia, or aboard the Queen Mary ocean liner. First, such voyages to Iran would be impossible absent approval from high-level figures in the host country\u2019s government, who have a political and financial interest in their taking place. Luxury tours of this sort bring much-needed revenue to the country. And since they are operated by America\u2019s newspaper of record, they also provide a stamp of legitimacy to a regime most Americans rightly loathe.\nIn selling its package tours to prospective travelers, the Times boasts of being \u201cpraised for its intensive and clear-eyed coverage of Iran going back decades.\u201d When I asked Murphy if the Times\u2019 cooperation with the Iranian government on a non-news related business undertaking, in light of the paper\u2019s endorsement of the controversial nuclear agreement, might tarnish that coverage or at least create the perception that the paper has a bias, she told me that, \u201cThese destination choices in no way represent an endorsement by The Times and have no impact on our news coverage. Instead, the trips reflect the broad range of interests of our readers.\u201d Nonetheless, it stands to reason that the Times would jeopardize its newfound business relationship with Iran if Tehran no longer approved of the paper\u2019s coverage.\nAnother issue that ought to concern the Times, but seems not to, is safety. \u201cIf there\u2019s somebody at any organization, travel or news organization, that says they can guarantee their safety or it will not be a problem, that is an absolute lie,\u201d Ali Rezaian says. \u201cThere is clearly no rule of law over there in a sense that we take it. Anything can happen to anybody who goes over there.\u201d The arrest of Siamak Namazi, a prominent Iranian-American businessman, in October offers only the latest evidence that travel to Iran, one of the world\u2019s leading state sponsors of terrorism, is fraught with risk."}

In 18-year-old LaGree's home state, he could not have been the house guest here of playwright Alfred Uhry of \"Driving Miss Daisy\" fame.\nAnd he could not be lounging now in the bowels of a Greenwich Village theater, so blas\u201a that he doesn't even notice that stage and movie star Kevin Kline just sauntered through the room.\nAnd, in neither Kansas nor Georgia--where LaGree moved for high school--could he be awaiting this evening's off-Broadway performance of a play he wrote when he was 16.\nThis young man and three of his peers have been thrust into the heady swirl of the Manhattan stage scene because they've hit a kind of Powerball jackpot for teenage dramatists. They are the four winners of the annual Young Playwrights Festival national writing competition.\nLaGree and the other winners, Clarence Coo of Alexandria, Va., Shaun Neblett of Montclair, N.J., and Denise Ruiz of New York, beat out a record 1,600 other teenagers to get their plays produced professionally here. All four of the playwrights are now 18 and in college, but they crafted their plays while still in high school. LaGree, Neblett, and Ruiz graduated just last spring.\nWhen LaGree and Coo, who have taken this semester off to be here, are asked if the New York debut of their plays is a collective \"big break,\" they offer a noncommittal shrug. Coo says with a laugh, \"It does depend on who sees it and who calls us afterward.\"\nIt wouldn't be all that unlikely. During the October-long run of their plays at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the foursome hardly lacked for attention, including the media interviews they squeezed in between rehearsals. And their four one-act plays, presented together in one evening, received largely favorable reviews last month in The New York Times, Newsday, and The Village Voice.\nAll the attention is not just a way for a handful of teenagers to puff up their egos and perhaps launch auspicious careers. It's part of YPI's comprehensive playwriting-education program. The organization, founded in 1981 by Sondheim and others from the Dramatists Guild, considers itself to be a 50-50 mix of professional theater and educational institution. It bills itself as the only national, professional playwright-development organization for writers 18 and younger.\nWhen YPI was founded, \"the idea was to introduce young people to the professional theater in its highest levels of achievement,\" says Sheri M. Goldhirsch, the artistic director.\nThe notion for the festival was born in 1977--the very same year this year's contest winners entered the world themselves. Sondheim came back from London where he had seen a program that showcased the work of teenage playwrights and wondered why no one was doing something similar in the United States. He reasoned that cultivating young people's writing was the only way to ensure that there would be playwrights to perpetuate American theater.\nIt seems all four of this year's festival playwrights may help preserve the future of the stage; all would like to keep writing plays, even if it's on the side as they make their living another way.\nThe idea behind Young Playwrights is to put the writer--instead of the scenery or a big-name star--at the center"}

At the same time, the 33,000 square-foot plot that delineates the Occupation remains connected to the entrenched racial, ethnic and gender patterns of society as a whole. Issues that Occupy Wall Street has championed as a matter of principle manifest more concretely as day-to-day struggles for POCcupiers. For example, Occupiers have held aloft signs demanding the repeal of the PATRIOT Act, the effects of which Muslim and Arab POCcupiers have experienced first hand when profiled at airports. Indeed, people of color are over-represented in prisons, public housing, public education and crackdowns on undocumented immigrants.\nThe POCcupiers\u2019 first objective is to establish and maintain a presence in every working group among the larger OWS movement, collaborating with a White Allies group whose function is to liaise between the People of Color group and the general OWS community. POCcupiers also feel a special sense of responsibility to conduct outreach to their various communities, some of whom have been isolated by choice or by circumstances for as long as they\u2019ve existed, because the OWS movement requires these missing pieces in order to succeed.\nJuan Carlos Romero, 20, became an activist for undocumented restaurant workers like himself because he couldn\u2019t afford college.

Boyd pleaded no contest to committing the shooting during a hearing last week and was convicted of attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The trial this week was to determine whether she could be held responsible based on her mental state at the time of the crime.\nThe trial included testimony from two doctors who said Boyd suffered from severe paranoid delusions.\nDeputy District Attorney Scott Ceman used store video footage during his closing argument to show the deliberate nature of Boyd's actions.\n\"She knows what she's done was wrong,\" Ceman said.\nThe jury determined Boyd had a mental illness at the time of the shooting; however they found she didn't lack the ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of her actions or conform to the law.\nBoyd fired one shot at Goffard, who was working at a cash register inside the store's liquor department. Boyd began to mingle \u2014 calm and quietly \u2014 among the people who gathered at the scene before returning to a cash register at the direction of a supervisor.\nGoffard underwent blood transfusions and several surgeries that saved her life.\nOver two days of testimony, jurors heard that Boyd's behavior changed beginning in spring 2013. She was worried people were following her and she talked to friends and family of a drug cartel that was targeting her and her loved ones.\n\"Her fear, her paranoia was such that she couldn't stop what she was doing,\" defense attorney Joseph Hildebrand said.\nCeman said the store video showed otherwise. He pointed out how Boyd waited for an opportunity to approach the liquor section and what looked like a calm exchange of words between Goffard and Boyd before the shooting.\nHe also noted that Boyd returned the gun to her pocket to conceal it after pulling the trigger.\nGoffard, of Neenah, fell to the ground after the shooting and was bleeding profusely. She was slipping in and out of consciousness, but was able to identify Boyd as the shooter.\nBoyd returned to her cash register and resumed work.\nHildebrand said the physical evidence found at Walmart adds credibility to the role mental illness played in Boyd's actions.\nPolice found a cocked and loaded semiautomatic handgun in the right front pocket of her shirt. They also found a revolver in her bag. She had speed loaders for the revolver and additional ammunition for both guns in her bag and shirt pockets.\nIt wouldn't make sense to have that amount of weaponry to fire one shot, Hildebrand said.\n\"She's preparing for a drug cartel to assault her,\" he said. \"She's not preparing to kill Sharon.\"\nCeman also reminded jurors of the testimony of Walmart employees who said Boyd was pleasant to customers that day. None of the store witnesses observed paranoia in her behavior.\n\"This is the only direct evidence of her mental state,\" Ceman said.\nThe verdict was read about 7:30 p.m. Judge John Jorgensen revoked Boyd's bond and ordered a presentence investigation.\nBoyd will return to court"}

But I\u2019m also a big fan of Whannell\u2019s work. Not only did he write and direct the incredibly entertaining Upgrade, he also penned the scripts for Dead Silence and Insidious.\nThe original Escape From New York, released in 1981, was set in a future where Manhattan has been walled-off and turned into a massive high-security prison where criminal gangs run wild. That\u2019s all well and good \u2013 until Air Force One is hijacked by terrorists, leading the President (Donald Pleasence) to eject via escape pod and end up in the heart of the prison city. The authorities send former Special Forces solider and current criminal Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) in to rescue him. It\u2019s one of Carpenter\u2019s best films, filled with iconic moments, gritty and dark cinematography courtesy of Dean Cundey, and a killer performance from Russell. Carpenter later followed Escape From New York up with the cheesy but entertaining Escape From L.A.\nA potential Escape From New York remake has been knocking around for a while. At one point, Robert Rodriguez was attached to direct, with a script from Luther creator Neil Cross. Nothing personal against Rodriguez, but I\u2019m glad that never happened.\nAs for Whannell\u2019s approach, THR says the writer is \u201ckickstarting Escape with a new vision for the project that sources say will retain elements of the original but bring new ideas to the table. One of Whannell\u2019s goals is to avoid the bloated tentpole remake path that afflicted the reboots of other 1980s-era movies such as Robocop and Total Recall.\u201d That\u2019s promising, and I have faith that Whannell will actually put some thought, and heart, into this material.

My suggestion, obvious as it may be, is Russell\u2019s son, Wyatt Russell.

While these concerns contradict Mr Trump\u2019s past assertions that the only mission for US forces in Syria was defeating ISIS and that this had been accomplished, it is not uncommon for the president to change his mind.\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr Trump appeared to backtrack on his assertion that ISIS had been defeated by saying US troops would continue fighting \"ISIS remnants\", and would be returning home \"slowly\".\nMr Trump's calculus appears to have also been changed by the promise of more financial input from America's Arab allies.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn\u2019t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbours rather than a Great Country, the US, that is 5,000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!\" the president tweeted last week.\nMr Trump is also facing resistance to his withdrawal plan from his national security team and the State Department, an official familiar with the discussions told The National. The State Department's Syria team led by James Jeffrey and Joel Rayburn and the president's national security adviser John Bolton are advocating a slow pullout, and the Pentagon is preparing a list of options for the president. A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on \"operational matters\".\nMr Bolton is scheduled to visit Israel and Turkey next week to discuss the withdrawal plan.\nAaron Stein, the incoming Middle East director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told The National that Mr Bolton\u2019s trip was to discuss how to \u201ckeep the Assad regime and Iran out of areas vacated by US forces\u201d.\nBut Nicholas Heras at the Centre for New American Security said Mr Graham\u2019s statements \u201care important because they give us greater insight into just how tumultuous the process to withdraw US forces from Syria is\".\nThe contradictions and uncertainty around Mr Trump\u2019s plan and the pace of withdrawal \u201cmakes it hard to take him or his Syria team's efforts seriously\u201d, Mr Heras told The National.\nThe US president, according to the Washington Post, has also consulted Senator Rand Paul, who favours a speedy withdrawal and has long opposed any US"}

The Saints (11-6) will meet the Chicago Bears or the Seattle Seahawks in the conference championship game next Sunday. This is a remarkable turnaround considering that the team finished 3-13 a year ago during a vagabond season played, post-Katrina, at makeshift home fields in San Antonio and Baton Rouge, La.\nMcAllister rushed 21 times for 143 yards and also caught an 11-yard touchdown pass to put the Saints ahead 27-21 in the third quarter of a game that was viewed as the most important in the Saints' mostly futile four decades of existence -- both in football and civic terms. Saturday's victory was only the team's second playoff win in seven postseason games spread thinly over 40 seasons.\nFor residents who have returned here after Hurricane Katrina, the Saints have come to symbolize the resolve of a city still half empty but determined to rebuild after enduring a staggering blow. For those still scattered from Houston to Atlanta, the Saints provide a familiar link to what once was, and might become again, home, as well as a reminder of the good times that were had following a mostly bad team.\nTheir newfound success -- coming amid reports of spiraling violence and the uncertain sustenance of the tourist trade -- also provides a sense of assurance that New Orleans, even badly injured, remains a vital, major-league city.\n\"I think the fans that have followed this team so long have been through a lot of thick and thin, more thin than thick,\" Saints coach Sean Payton said. \"They've been loud and passionate and they come from everywhere -- New Orleans, Mississippi, Alabama. It's gratifying to be able to get them fired up about their team.\"\nPayton added: \"Everything that's gone on here within this last year and a half, Katrina, and how much recovery we still have to go, this is a bright spot. We said at the beginning of the year, we hope to be out front in a leadership role. We're not afraid of that. There's still a lot of work to be done in this city. We just hope we can give people a little kick in their step.\"\nOn Saturday, the Saints proved too resourceful for Philadelphia (11-7), ending an improbably resurgent season for the Eagles, who seemed finished after quarterback Donovan McNabb tore a knee ligament in November but who rallied to win six consecutive games.\nAgainst the Saints, the Eagles nearly succeeded by doing something unlikely -- reverting to the big-play ambition they had with McNabb but that they had abandoned with his replacement, Jeff Garcia. Philadelphia had the longest scoring pass play in its playoff history (a 75-yard throw from Garcia to Donte Stallworth for a 7-6"}

Asked later if she supported impeaching Trump, Warren was noncommittal, saying only that special counsel Robert Mueller needs to be allowed to finish his investigation and make his report public.\nWarren formally launched her White House bid Saturday in Massachusetts, grounding her campaign in the populist calls to combat economic inequality that have long made her a favorite of liberals. In Cedar Rapids, she said sweeping changes are needed to rebalance an economy that she now favors the wealthy at the expense of middle- and lower-income Americans.\nWarren has struggled to shake the controversy surrounding her past claims to Native American heritage. She's apologized for claiming Native American identity on multiple occasions early in her career. Trump has frequently taken digs at the senator by calling her Pocahontas, a reference to the native woman who lived in present-day Virginia in the 1600s and agreed to marry an English colonist to help ensure peace and protect her people.\nWarren has said the story of Pocahontas long has \"been taken away by powerful people who twisted it to serve their own purposes.\""}

{"idx": "32866", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Recently I was interviewed by Aschwin de Wolf from the website Against Politics about my new book Beyond Democracy. It explains why democracy is an immoral and impoverishing political system which leads to social conflict, runaway spending, and a tyrannical government.\n1. What specifically motivated you to write this book?\nAs far as Karel, my co-author, and I knew there was no easy to read, structured, and concise book showing the inherent weaknesses and dynamics of democracy from a freedom loving perspective. Of course many libertarians have written on the subject and we are indebted to them, especially Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Democracy, The God That Failed. But Hoppe's book is a collection of academic essays and touches on things we don't and vice versa. Our book is for the average person but I also think seasoned libertarians can learn lots from it.\nMany people still believe democracy equals freedom. And many libertarians still believe the proper road to more freedom is through the democratic process. Many non-libertarians are convinced democracy needs fixing but find no problem with the fundamental democratic principles themselves. Our book refutes those notions. Democracy is the opposite of freedom, almost inherent to the democratic process is that it tends towards less liberty instead of more, and democracy is not something to be fixed. Democracy is inherently broken, just like socialism. The only way to fix it is to break it up. You couldn't fix socialism by replacing Lenin for Trotsky or the Russians for Cubans. And you can't fix democracy by legally restricting payments to presidential candidates, by barring felons from voting, changing the voting age, or replacing Bush Jr. with Obama, et cetera.\nAnother reason for the book is that writing structures your thoughts and thereby brings you to new ones. While writing we came upon new insights that we of course included in the book. Fifteen years ago I was an ignorant proponent of democracy, ten years ago I thought it had serious drawbacks, and after writing the book I think it's much worse than that.\nTo be clear, we don't want to withhold democracy from people and we don't begrudge others a democracy. Also, we don't claim that democracy is worse or better than dictatorship and neither that the problems we describe in the book are exclusive of democracy.\n2. The first myth about democracy that you seek to debunk is the idea that voting in an election empowers the individual. But even many libertarians vote. How do you explain this?\nThere are several reasons I think. First, as a libertarian, you want to advance liberty and voting seems a way to do it. Although I generally consider voting immoral, voting for the least bad option can be a good thing. Note that generally such a vote is rather impossible to cast since many self-declared freedom loving candidates end up robbing you of liberty too when in power. As the late Harry Browne has pointed out, voting for the least bad party can be counterproductive since they know freedom loving people have no other option than to vote for them and therefore these parties have little incentive to improve their political goals towards more liberty.\nSecondly, even when your libertarian-leaning candidate seems totally unlikely to rise to power or to have any significant political influence, getting him or her in a parliamentary seat will provide a serious stage to gain media coverage. Ron Paul certainly achieved that and through his candidacies many people were confronted with libertarian ideas, or at least with the term libertarian. I am a great fan of Ron Paul and if I were an American citizen I would probably vote for him, mostly symbolically, but such candidates are extremely rare. But"}

It brings together all types of rental accommodation, including social housing, purpose-built rental, condos, houses and secondary suites in homes.\nAccording to the index, which uses Statistics Canada\u2019s latest census data, 40 per cent of renter households are paying more than 30 per cent of their before-tax income on rent and utilities, an amount widely considered to be unaffordable.\nRidings in the GTA account for 11 of the 15 most expensive ridings for renters, according to the index. Markham-Unionville topped the list with average rents of $1,415 a month.\nAn alarming one in five households is paying more than half of their income on rent, a situation that puts them at risk of homelessness, say affordable housing advocates who released the index in Toronto Thursday.\nMore than 10 per cent of rental households are living in overcrowded conditions such as sharing a house or apartment with other families or renting a smaller unit than needed.\n\u201cWhen we talk about housing in Canada during elections, we are most often talking about home ownership and the middle class,\u201d said Tim Richter, of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.\nPart of the reason for the crisis in affordability for renters is that governments stopped building social housing about 20 years ago and there have been no incentives for developers to build rental apartments, said Tony Roy of the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, which spearheaded the index.\nThe group is hoping policy makers at the municipal, provincial and federal levels use the index to better understand the needs of renters in their communities, including seniors, students and service workers who are particularly squeezed due to their low incomes, he said.\n\u201cFor anyone making below $40,000 a year, there is no housing being built for this group what-so-ever,\u201d Roy said.\nBased on the index\u2019s indicators of affordability, income gap, overspending, overcrowding and bedroom shortfall, 13 of the worst 15 ridings for renters in Canada are in the Greater Toronto area. The worst is Willowdale (currently Conservative), followed by Markham-Unionville (currently Liberal) and the new ridings of Brampton East and Mississauga Centre where a majority of residents voted Conservative in the last election.\nIn Willowdale and Markham-Unionville, about 55 per cent of renters are paying unaffordable rents, including 36 per cent who are paying more than half of their incomes on shelter, according to the index. In Brampton East, 30 per cent of renters are living in overcrowded conditions while in Mississauga Centre and Willowdale about one quarter are doing so.\nWhen people have to spend more than they can afford on housing, they have to forgo other necessities, like groceries, clothes, transit, noted Sharad Kerur, of the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association, which represents 734 non-profit housing providers in the province, including Toronto Community Housing Corp.\n\u201cThe result is a lot of stress in people\u2019s lives,"}

Because, of course, we couldn't understand.\nMilitary service has always been an honorable path toward citizenship in this country, and immigrants without citizenship can enlist in our armed forces. However, despite their honorable service to our country, some veterans are deported after they complete their time in the military.\nSay you're a person who wants to express solidarity with troops and veterans this Memorial Day, and you're not sure how. Here's a place to start: Consider that war is not inevitable, even though it seems like it is these days.\nI never have known fear like I did in the midst of a few bouts of the depression.\nIf this war is to be forgotten, I ask, in the name of all things sacred, what shall men remember?\nThose unknown heroes whose whitened bones have been piously gathered here, and whose green graves we now strew with sweet and beautiful flowers, choice emblems alike of pure hearts and brave spirits, reached, in their glorious career that last highest point of nobleness beyond which human power cannot go. They died for their country.\nTo the indifferent inquirer who asks why Memorial Day is still kept up we may answer, it celebrates and solemnly reaffirms from year to year a national act of enthusiasm and faith.\nIn post-9/11 times, despite waging seemingly endless wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, only about 1 percent of Americans today have served in the military. That means a disconnect between men and women who have worn the uniform and those who put yellow ribbons on their bumpers and fly flags from their porches.\nReflections on those who gave all and died, and on those who returned and need respect.\nThe Global War on Terror is our longest war, and a conflict without a national memorial.\nThe VA Dallas Medical Center is one of the largest facilities providing the full range of medical care to veterans in America."}

The amounts paid out were huge \u2014 $500,000 by actress Lori Loughlin to get her two daughters into USC. The lack of oversight in athletic departments was also appalling; the University of Texas tennis coach was fired for taking bribes to provide athletic scholarships to kids who didn\u2019t play tennis. Uh, didn\u2019t anyone notice?\nWhat really stands out, however, is the futility of it all. You really don\u2019t need a degree from Harvard or Yale to succeed in life. Study after study, expert after expert has said that a good education at a much affordable institution (like, ahem, Lamar University) will serve you just as well as a sheepskin from an Ivy League giant. And it does matter. The U.S. Department of Education said that in 2015, adults with bachelor\u2019s degrees earned an average of $48,500 a year, as compared to $23,900 for high school graduates.\nGranted, if you\u2019re rich and you can get Timmy or Susie into Harvard, it won\u2019t hurt them. That instant name recognition will at least get them their first job, but most of them will have to rely on their talent and perseverance afterward. New hires have to adapt to their workplace culture, figure out what the boss wants done, and do it. If they want to get promoted, they will have to do it better than their co-workers.\nA fancy degree does not guarantee this. If anything, a spoiled kid who thinks he\u2019s got it made because of that distinguished institution could set off warning signals at interviews that shout, \u201cDon\u2019t hire me!\u201d Graduates like that will not work as hard as they need to, which is pretty hard at any company that\u2019s serious about its profits, which is most of them.\nThe education available at many lesser-known, more affordable colleges \u2014 whether in business, medicine, engineering or law \u2014 is virtually the same as the one you get at Big Name U. Lamar has a list of highly successful grads in many fields (several are mentioned below) that would cover this page.\nThe famous debt-reduction guru Dave Ramsey preaches this often on his national radio show. He has hired hundreds of college graduates for very demanding, well-paying jobs. He doesn\u2019t care where they got their degree from, and certainly never hired one because of the college name on the diploma.\nIn an interview, he and other employers are looking at the young man or woman sitting in front of them, going over their resume and life story, sizing them up, trying to figure out if they will work hard and well for them.\nThe lesson that Ramsey and other smart people teach is that young people should not go into huge debt for college, and preferably no debt at all. If you doubt this advice, consider that the biggest problem for young graduates is \u2014 surprise \u2014 student-loan debt.\nSome millennials have debts of $150,000 or even higher when they start working. But for a very few careers that guarantee big salaries, that burden can\u2019t be managed. For most people, it means a long, hard slog of paying back Sallie Mae while also trying to buy a home and start a family.\nAt schools like Lamar, graduates can leave with student-loan debt about the price of a new car.

The preparation time: four to five hours Friday afternoon in Minneapolis. The pressure: off the chart.\n\"We practiced a little, and hoped for the best,\" she said.\nThe moment was perhaps the brightest highlight in a first year to remember at Ciprian's new school.\nShe made an instant impact on the volleyball team during the fall, recording 117 kills and 105 blocks while setting Cavaliers records for single-match blocks (13 against Boston College) and blocks per game by a first-year player (1.35).\nCiprian's singing skill isn't something brand new. When she joined Virginia's volleyball program last fall, the college featured her voice as her hidden talent in a video presentation.\nBefore Saturday night, though, she said the largest audience for her music was during a choral performance during her sophomore year inside Creekside's auditorium.\nThat's a long way from singing the national anthem in front of a crowd of 72,711 in Minnesota and a national audience of millions watching on CBS.\n\"I've never sung the anthem in front of anybody before, not even at Creekside,\" Ciprian said.\nIt wasn't until last Monday that she heard that she might be on the way to Minneapolis.\nIt might have sounded like an April Fools' Day joke. It wasn't.\n\"I got a call from my coach saying, 'I've got a really cool opportunity for you,'\" she recalled. \"They asked me to basically send in a video with my voice because they were interested.

In fact, he thinks it's pretty cool.\nMartin is one of two students in the Little Harbour School chess club whose opponent lives thousands of miles away in Belize. The cross-continent competition was facilitated by the trips of physical education teacher Steve Schulten to the small country that borders Guatemala, Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, thanks to a University of New Hampshire program.\nMartin has three game boards going at his house, and is anxiously awaiting an e-mail from his opponent abroad about what move will be made next.\n\"It's really cool,\" Martin said. \"I didn't know that could actually happen, but it's fun.\"\nOver the course of a dozen years, the Little Harbour School chess club has served hundreds of youngsters in the city. Schulten, who started the after-school club, never has trouble attracting 20 or so students to learn the game. From first grade to fifth, boys and girls, everyone is welcome to chess club and anyone can win on any given day. It all depends on one's concentration level and ability to out-think the opponent.\n\"My goal is to get chess included in the school curriculum so every kid can be taught to play,\" Schulten said. \"It's such a low maintenance thing and the Rotary Club already gives everyone a chess board. The more I play, the more I see the benefits to kids.\"\n\"I like it because it doesn't matter who you are, as long as you just concentrate and think about what you're doing,\" said Martin, who claimed to have won every game since chess club started in November. That is, until the press showed up Thursday and distracted him, resulting in his defeat by 10-year-old Elija Huynh.\nTwo years ago, Schulten brought 100 chess sets to the Belize National Youth Chess Foundation, thanks to a donation from Portsmouth Rotary Club's Jeremy Alex Fund, which also donates sets to local fourth-graders. That trip inspired Schulten to encourage students to start online games with their peers in Belize, though Internet connections can be spotty there.\nProblem solving, sportsmanship, concentration, abstract thinking and instant consequences are all benefits of the game, according to Schulten. But to Bella Anzalone, 10, and Kaitlyn Greeley, 9 \u2014 who started playing when the club started \u2014 it's just fun.\n\"Chess is really fun because it takes a lot of strategy,\" Anzalone said. \"You have to plan out every move very carefully.\"\n\"It's fun,\" Greeley said. \"But it's hard, too, because I don't know which one to move.\""}

Terry Madonna noted, Trump\u2019s current job performance approval rating is right where former President Barack Obama\u2019s rested at this point in his first term. Obama went on to win Pennsylvania in his re-election by more than 5 percentage points.\nSaturday\u2019s keynote speaker, national political reporter Salena Zito whose focus on covering rural and small town America attracted lots of notice for her early reading of a populist revolution in 2016, said her work tells her that it\u2019s so far, so good for the president.\n"}

Anyone who tells you that they know with 100% certainty \u201cthe bull market is over\u201d or \u201cthe bull market isn\u2019t over\u201d is lying.\nYou don\u2019t need a complicated model like GMO\u2019s to tell you that a 1998-2000 final rally scenario is less likely.\nHere are some key differences between 1998 and today.\nFor starters, the unemployment rate today is lower than where it was in 1998. The economy is more \u201cas good as it gets\u201d.\n*In September 1998 and today, the Unemployment Rate Model went to cash for 1 month, just like right now. So in this regards 1998 and today are similar.\n*If you haven\u2019t read the 13.2% trading model already, please see it here. This simple model beats 95% of market commentators, most of whom can\u2019t beat buy and hold.\nThe Fed is hiking interest rates today, vs. cutting interest rates in 1998.\nA key leading sector of the economy \u2013 housing \u2013 was improving in 1998. It is deteriorating today.\nAll in all, macro data leans towards the top already being in rather than a 1998-case. This isn\u2019t set in stone. If macro starts to improve again, then a 1998-1999 finally rally scenario becomes more likely. Wait and watch the data.\nEither way, late-cycle. If you\u2019re a long term investor, now is not the time to buy and hold.\nMost companies have beat their earnings estimates so far this earning season. But that was because the bar (expectations) were already set very low, making a \u201cbeat\u201d very easy.\nIt\u2019s easier for companies to game earnings than revenues, due to accounting rules. While most companies beat their earnings expectations, the % of companies beating revenue expectations is quite low.\nOn the surface this seems like a bearish sign for stocks. But when you look at the chart more closely, you can see that it\u2019s not necessarily a bearish sign. A low \u201c% of companies that beat revenues expectations\u201d happens in almost every 15%+ decline. In other words, this is more of a coincident indicator than a leading indicator for the stock market.\nBloomberg noted that companies that missed expectations are being punished more than usual.\nSo if disappointing earnings are being punished more than normal, why is the broad stock market going up this earnings season?"}

This week, BMW unleashed its latest M car, the M2, upon the world.\nThe introduction of the M2 finally gives BMW's 2-Series its own representative in the company's M lineup. Since it landed on US shores a couple of years ago, the 2-Series has been one BMW's most highly praised models. Consumer Reports gave the M235i a score of 98 out of 100 on its road test. That makes it the third-highest-rated car in the world and the highest-rated car not made by Tesla, according to Consumer Reports.\nWe also liked the 2-Series quite a lot.\nHave a closer look at the new BMW M2.\nIn 1985, BMW's Motorsports engineers worked their magic on the company's compact 3-Series coupe. The resulting first-generation M3 (known as the E30) was a revelation for buyers of sports cars.\n... all wrapped up in a relatively stylish but still rather German package. The result was a car that has become a cultural icon.\n.... more powerful. By its fourth generation, the M3's 4.0-liter, 414-horsepower V8 engine was nearly twice the size, with more than double the power, of the original M3's 2.3-liter, 197-hp inline-four.\nThe latest generation (now known as the M4) is still a spectacular sports car. However, it has gotten incredibly luxurious and expensive. Our most recent BMW M4 Convertible test car cost more than $93,000. That's Porsche 911 territory.\nThus, the modern M3/M4 has lost a bit of the original version's pure sporting spirit.\nFor BMW buyers in the US, the 2-Series represents a return to the ethos of the E30.\nBusiness Insider's Matt DeBord recently tried out the M235i and was blown away by the experience. Though the M235i carries the \"M\" designation, it isn't an official product of the Motorsports division. As DeBord put it, the M235i is just a snazzier version of the standard 2-Series coupe.\nThe M2 gives the 2-Series its own \"M\" car.\n... the Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG.\nThe M2 retains the standard 2-Series' basic body and internal architecture. But BMW's engineers have added some serious performance goodies.\nTo start, BMW bulked up the 2-Series' 3.0 twin-scroll, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine. For M2 duty, the powerplant produces 365 horsepower\u2014 up a beefy 45 horses from the M235i.\nAccording to BMW, the M2 can make the run to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds and all the way up to an electronically controlled top speed of 155 mph.\n... purists can still order an M2 with a six-speed manual!\nAesthetically, the M2 gets a host of aerodynamic treatments. In addition to giving the car a more muscular stance, they also help the M2 operate more efficiently in a straight"}

Leaf rust, or \u201cla roya\u201d in Spanish, has been making waves since January, when Costa Rica and several other countries declared national coffee emergencies because of the fungus.\nNearly 50 percent of coffee plantations have been infected with the fungus in the region, where nearly 2 million mostly small farmers make their living from coffee, according to a report from the International Coffee Organization. The same report estimates that upwards of 64 percent of Costa Rica\u2019s coffee-growing regions are suffering from leaf rust damage.\nWhile conventional coffee growers struggle with the devastating fungus, organic farmers face a unique challenge. Organic farmers in Costa Rica are working to find sustainable solutions to coexisting with leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix, but there are few organic options to treat roya when it strikes beyond copper sulfate fungicide and a prayer.\n\u201cThere are no silver bullets when it comes to leaf rust and organic farmers have even fewer options,\u201d said Pam Kahl, a representative from Sustainable Harvest, a U.S. coffee importer based in Portland, Oregon, who runs the Roya Recovery Project.\nThe fungus spreads through direct contact. Once infected, the plant\u2019s leaves dry out and its coffee cherries fail to mature properly. Farmers must prune back all the infected parts of the plant to attempt to save the rest of the tree and prevent the fungus\u2019 progression. Large monoculture coffee plantations are especially vulnerable to roya.\nSo far, MAG has been providing organic coffee farmers with an approved copper sulfate fungicide but several sources interviews for this story agreed that it is not a long-term solution, according to Luis Zamora, national coffee manager for Costa Rica\u2019s Agriculture and Livestock Ministry (MAG). He noted that any fungicide or pesticide, regardless of its organic seal of approval, should be used sparingly and with great care so as not to contaminate nearby water sources.\nChac\u00f3n opined that organic farming practices and the relatively high altitude at which their coffee is grown serves as a strong deterrent to leaf rust.\nOrganic farms like Las Lajas, which climbs as high as 4,900 feet above sea level, plant their coffee under a canopy of banana and other trees. This strategy nurtures a diverse growing environment that makes it difficult for roya to spread quickly from plant to plant. There is a trade-off, however: sun-drenched fields produce more coffee, enticing many farmers to abandon shade-grown coffee.\nZamora pointed out that every farm is different, however, and that organic practices alone are not a sure-fire guarantee against the virulent fungus. Dry, hot but humid created an ideal environment for the fungus this year, reaching heights where it was never seen before. Some scientists suggest that climate change may also be responsible for roya\u2019s wide reach.\nChristian Mora Rojas, general manager for the Organic Families\u2019 Association of the Caraigres Mountains, or AFAORCA, told The Tico Times that they are experimenting with several organic alternatives to copper-based fungicides. Echoing Chac\u00f3n\u2019s belief in prevention, Mora agreed that stronger, healthier plants are more likely to successfully fend off roya.\nOddly enough, one of the best organic alternatives to fighting leaf rust could"}

The revelation this week that FTSE100 bosses have seen their pay packets skyrocket has put them further under the microscope.\nSo far, the response from business has been muted. All too often this is the way that some companies deal with the political process: either by keeping their heads down or by treating Westminster, Holyrood and Brussels as sideshows that can be handled by government affairs staff, or maybe by the chairman. Too many chief executives then seem to be shocked by regulatory changes, failure to win government contracts, or, I don't know, decisions to leave the European Union.\nBrexit has shown up how feckless, and at times ridiculously reckless, many businesses have been about political risk. The Government bizarrely asked companies not to intervene, but in truth few of them ever really planned to do so. Certainly the efforts of many firms were not in proportion to the threats they faced. This was not a one-off: the Scottish referendum was the same. We pay trade bodies to look after us, is the common refrain, and anyway it'll never happen. We are a Big Business.\nWe can only hope that the surprise of Brexit or the realisation that May really does plan to put fetters on companies will end this insouciant attitude to political risk. It seems clear the Prime Minister will advance a wide-ranging suite of proposals to alter and improve over the coming months. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Fat Cat story this week, it has given the Government new ammunition to use in this fight.\nBusinesses must accept that the spotlight will stay on them, and they can't hide from it. Who knows whether May and her closest advisers are channelling Joseph Chamberlain, or if they are morally outraged by the excesses of capitalism, or if they believe this is the best way to win seats in northern cities and suburbs. It doesn\u2019t matter. Companies are in their crosshairs.\nChief executives are not controlling this debate \u2013 Downing Street is firmly in control \u2013 but they can and should be active participants in it. Their job is to explain to politicians, and most importantly to the public, what is good and what is bad in May's measures. They have to set out their own proposals. In short, they need to engage. And once they've got into the habit they should also take leading roles in \u200eother debates that are critical to their businesses. That would be the sensible way for companies to deal with political risk."}

The attacks were carried out in violation of the 1996 April Understanding, the American-brokered rules of war on the protection of civilians in Lebanon and Israel.\nIn the wake of the air raids, Israel and the United States have charged Syria, the dominant force in Lebanon, where it has 30,000 troops, with failing to restrain Hezbollah fighters based in southern Lebanon, who have killed seven Israeli soldiers in the last three weeks. Their accusations increase the possibility of Syria being drawn into the conflict.\nEncouraged by Washington's stance, Israeli officials have announced that any future attacks on its army of occupation in southern Lebanon will pave the way for new attacks on Lebanon's infrastructure. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared, \"We shall respond when and how we want with very painful strikes against all of Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory.\"\nBarak's statement was followed by another Israeli air and artillery attack on villages just north of the Israeli occupied zone. This came despite condemnation of the Israeli attack by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.\nLast week Israeli F-16 bombers targeted three power stations in Jamhour, Zgharta and Baalbeck in Lebanon, the mountain village of Ein Bouswar and the home of a Hezbollah leader in Tyre. Fifteen civilians in Baalbek and at least two people in Tyre were wounded.\nThe air attacks were launched in retaliation for the deaths of five Israeli soldiers in Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon in 10 days and Hezbollah's assassination of Akl Hashem, the second-in-command of Israel's proxy force, the militia known as the South Lebanon Army. Hezbollah is a Shiite Muslim group that has relied on the patronage of Syria and Iran in its campaign to free southern Lebanon from the Israelis, who have occupied the region for nearly two decades.\nLast week's air raids on power stations were a carbon copy of a raid last June on the same power station at Jamhour, where five people died. That power station had only just been replaced at enormous cost. Lebanon has spent billions of dollars rebuilding the infrastructure destroyed during its civil war and is already more than $20 billion in debt to the international banks.\nIn the latest attacks Beirut lost its entire power supply and much of the country was left without electricity. The hardship is particularly great as the weather is freezing and there is snow on the ground. The Lebanese people face power cuts for the 12 months it could take to repair the power stations, at a cost of at least $50 million.\nBarak holds the office of both prime minister and defence minister and is a former chief of staff of Israel's defence forces. He came to power last May, promising a withdrawal from Lebanon by July this year and a final peace settlement with Yassir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. He also held out hopes of a deal with Syria.\nHowever his actions in the past week belie his election promises. Barak warned, \"Those who harmed us will be harmed.\" He said he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save Israeli lives. Foreign Minister David Levy was even more aggressive. \"The soil of Lebanon will burn\", he said, \"if Hezbollah fires rockets into Israel.\"\nThe prime minister has declared a military state of emergency and ordered all those living just south of the Lebanese border to stay in underground bomb shelters.

He was national chair of the youth wing of Denmark\u2019s liberal party Venstre from 1986-1989, and he was been active in local politics, serving on the council of Gr\u00e6sted-Gilleleje Municipality in a number of different capacities. He has been a member of the Danish Parliament since October 1994.\nFrom 1998-2001 Rasmussen served as mayor of Frederiksborg Amt and from 1998 he was deputy chair of his party.\nRasmussen also has considerable ministerial experience, having served as minister of the interior and health minister under the government led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen from 2005-2007. He was then appointed finance minister in 2007 and became prime minister for the first time in April 2009 when Anders Fogh Rasmussen was appointed NATO\u2019s secretary general.\nWhat do you see as the most important foreign policy priorities for Denmark at the present time?\nWe live in a fast changing world. The unpredictability of international politics has not been this extensive in decades. Last year, my government issued our Foreign and Security Policy Strategy for 2017-18, identifying five overall areas of particular focus in the light of current global developments: Migration, instability and terrorism, security in the neighbourhood region, Brexit and the future of the European Union, globalisation and The Arctic.\nThese five areas are not the only issues demanding our attention. But within these overall areas, we have launched a number of concrete initiatives to enhance our foreign and security policy focus and efforts. At a more fundamental level, these challenges represent an increasing pressure on the international rules-based cooperation as we know it. For a small country like Denmark with an open economy, this is a very serious challenge. In the years to come, it will continue to be a fundamental priority in Danish foreign policy to support a strong international rules based order of co-operation.\nHow do you see the role of diplomacy from the perspective of a Danish politician?\nDiplomacy is very important, not least for a small country like Denmark. Among allies, Denmark is often said to be \u201cpunching above its weight\u201d in international politics. A focused and efficient diplomacy is very much part of this, alongside with other Danish international efforts including military operations and development co-operation.\nWith the current unpredictability in international politics and pressure on the international rules-based co-operation, the framework for Danish foreign and security policy is challenged. That only increases the importance of Denmark being actively engaged multilaterally and bilaterally in shaping developments and ensuring Danish interests.\nWhat role does diplomacy play in the way Denmark co-operates with foreign countries?\nObviously, Denmark has strong ties with many countries on numerous levels. Relations among European Union Member States are particularly close politically and commercially. So are our relations to our closest allies, not least the US. In the past couple of years we have also engaged in much closer strategic partnerships with several countries outside the circle of traditional allies.

The heart-shaped seeds are 1/32 inch wide and range from tan to brown in color. The best time to germinate Dutch clover seeds is in the fall or spring.\nFill a shallow bowl with warm water and pour the Dutch clover seeds into the water.

If it is cool, drain most of the water off and refill the bowl with warm water.\nPour the water/seed mixture into a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds from the water. Discard the water and spread the seeds out on paper towels to air dry until just damp. Do not place the seed in direct sunlight while they are drying, and do not let the seeds become completely dry.\nMix the seeds with an equal part of sand, which helps spread the tiny seeds more evenly. Place the seed mixture into a grass-seed spreader and broadcast the seeds over the planting area. Keep the seeds damp while they are germinating, which takes about 10 to 15 days when the soil temperature is 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\nOne soil-enrichment practice is to plant white Dutch clover and let it grow for the summer. Plow it under before planting the lawn or garden; this releases nitrogen into the soil, providing natural fertilizer for the next generation of plants.\nWhite Dutch clover can become weedy by spreading through seeds and stolons. Mowing the blossoms prevents seeds from spreading.

He\u2019s developed a lightweight machine that streamlines the process of DNA analysis, but says that given the stakes of the mission in Pakistan, it\u2019s likely that the most traditional and well-established methods of DNA analysis would have been used.\n\u2022 The Daily Beast's Complete Osama bin Laden CoverageThis process involves several steps, and serious equipment. The \u201clab bench\u201d that could accommodate all the equipment necessary for accomplishing the analysis would be roughly 30 feet long; the combined weight of the equipment would be several hundred pounds. The first step for the U.S. officials on the scene would be to obtain a DNA sample\u2014either a swab of the cheek or a sample of blood drawn from bin Laden\u2019s body.\nThat sample would then be rushed to a laboratory set up for the task\u2014at a nearby military base, a mobile laboratory, or even, conceivably, on the USS Carl Vinson, the same vessel in which bin Laden\u2019s body was taken out to sea.\nOnce there, the sample taken from bin Laden would go through a purification process, with a technique known as PCR, with which specific sections of DNA are detected and amplified. Zenhausern says that it would be possible to get to this point of the analysis in roughly one hour; other protocols call for about two and a half hours to complete. The purified sample would then be stained with dye and loaded into a machine known as the \u201ccapillary electrophoresis,\u201d a high voltage is applied, and 13 separate fragments\u2014known as STRs-\u2014emerge, identifiable because of the distinct way each one of these dyed fragments looks when reacting to the voltage applied.\nThe 13 fragments of STRs\u2014short for Short Tandem Repeats\u2014constitute the standard DNA profile.

Select appropriate accessories, textiles and unframed artwork, and use area rugs to break the monotony of wood floors or furnishings.\nOak comes in many colors and while yours is light, look to see if any highlights come through the wood. Red oak has a pink hue in the wood. European oak has overtones spanning the color spectrum from white to pale beige. Once you\u2019ve determined the color casting of your oak, you can continue decorating.\nA dark wall begs for artwork that\u2019s bright and airy. Buy large oil paintings and hang them without frames, or create a collage of prints that all float within glass frames. Adding more wood to the wall only adds more heaviness in the room. Watercolors have a feeling of lightness and so do prints of the seashore that use an azure sky and beige sand.\nMirrors bring brightness into a room. Hang a large mirror with a gold frame horizontally on the dark wall. Surround it with smaller mirrors with different gold frames to create a collage, or use the entire wall as a collage background for a collection of smaller antique mirrors.\nA Japanese white or gold silk kimono hanging against a dark wall is dramatic, or an Indian sari, ruffled and flowing across a wall, creates an airy feeling. Tapestries that use beige as a background also work against a dark wall. Stretch a favorite silk damask piece of fabric across a frame and hang it on the dark wall. Be creative and stretch a blank canvas and wash it with light colored acrylic or oil paint.\nChinese area rugs are plush and often woven in a variety of light colors. Use one as a focal point in your room to distract the eye from the darkness of the walls. Quom silk carpets, or Kerman Persian carpets also have champagne-colored threads in their designs. A sculpted off-white area rug also complements the oak.\nWood or a fabrication of a wood, painted white, can be used as crown and base moulding. Buy pieces that are at least five inches deep to break up the wall. You can also make artificial white frames and attach them to the wall to create a separation within the dark color. Hang your artwork inside the newly created space, leaving some of the dark wall to act as a mat between the art and the frame.\nUse soft, subtle lighting, or even pink bulbs, near the wall. Avoid track lighting that casts too strong a light. Sconces with soft bulbs on either end of the wall also create a glow that adds to the ambiance of your room.

Hamas has refused Israeli demands to allow the International Red Cross to visit Shalit, although Israel allows such visits at its prisons. Not much more is known about the Israeli hostage\u2019s situation. Shalit, now 24 years old, seemed in the 2009 video to have recovered from the physical wounds he suffered during the abduction. The fear now is mainly about Shalit\u2019s psychological well-being: What have nearly five years in total seclusion done to his emotional health? Will he return from Gaza a shadow of his former self? In the video Shalit was quite coherent, but 19 months have passed since the taping, and Shalit had read from a script dictated by his captors. Shalit\u2019s parents are usually reluctant to express personal feelings, but from interview to interview their worry about his mental state only seems to grow.\nHamas activists have told Nathan Thrall, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, that members of the group mentioned \u201cGilad\u201d many times during phone conversations after the abduction, to mislead Israeli intelligence. \u201cWe took Gilad to lunch,\u201d the activists would say, or \u201cWe met with him.\u201d But it is believed that the people who are actually responsible for the soldier avoid using phones. Most of their contact with the outside world is done through messengers, young boys who deliver handwritten notes.\nOne might assume that Shabak, Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence service, has some general information about the area in which Shalit is being held, but for an Israeli prime minister to seriously consider the possibility of a rescue operation along the lines of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, the information has to be precise. Netanyahu also has to ask himself what kind of risk he\u2019d be willing to take regarding the lives of the commandos.

AVE use in UK PR may not have not fallen as much in recent years as AMEC suggests, according to two surveys: a study in 2009 found 37 per cent of UK agencies were using it, while another this year put that figure at 35 per cent.\nThe CIPR last month said it would ban members from using AVEs and said they would \"discipline\" those who flouted the ban, raising concerns from both a past president and its president-elect that this was disproportionate.\nA survey released earlier this week from measurement and marketing effectiveness agency Crescendo Consulting found relatively low support for bans on AVE use. Of the 104 PR and marketing professionals questioned, 44 per cent of those surveyed said they agreed that PR industry bodies should ban AVEs, with 43 per cent opposing it, and 13 per cent saying they had no preference either way.\nOf the 14 in-house PR professionals in the survey, three said they agreed with such a ban, nine said they did not, and the other three had no opinion.\nCrescendo director Mark Westaby, who was the chair of AMEC from 2001 to 2005, said bans such as the CIPR could be divisive.

His clothes and self-confidence still sag, but whenever Eric eats a banana, his muscles rip and his IQ shrinks as he transforms into Bananaman (played by Matthew McKenna, complete with banana-tipped horns). As floppy villains chase the powerful meteor shard, Eric hopes to impress wannabe reporter Fiona (Emma Ralston), and so reluctantly gets his five-a-day and bounds into adventure.\nIn its original form, Bananaman lovingly parodied the silver age of comic books, but this musical\u2019s sloppy slapstick and over-egged puns lack much of the slick wit and wordplay of the TV cartoon and the vivid design of the comic strip. Dipping into parody but still clinging to standard superhero cliche, it\u2019s not until after the interval that this silly show finds any not-so-secret powers.\nWith half-hearted panto charm, the musical fits together about as well as Eric\u2019s clothes. The script misses the opportunity for anything below surface level and, although there is a stellar live band, the repetitive songs rely too heavily on the cartoon\u2019s theme tune and overlaid melodies turn into a splurge of sound rather than giving a sense of different character narratives.\nThe real hero is the marvellous Marc Pickering as Dr Gloom, the deliciously mischievous villain who trips over his own words and feet while concocting his evil plans, but still has enough heart to bring biscuits to meetings. Dr Gloom\u2019s dynamism leaves little space for fellow villain General Blight (Carl Mullaney), who flails desperately for power, and only comes into his own in a hilarious but incomprehensible dance scene towards the end.\nThe supporting cast do well with muddled direction. In a rare instance of puppetry detracting from a show, Bananaman\u2019s sidekick Crow is a messy addition and a waste of Jodie Jacobs, who is otherwise one of the strongest performers. TJ Lloyd as the bumbling Chief O\u2019Reilly and Ralston as the courageous Jodie also stand out.\nIt\u2019s the final standoff in Mark Perry\u2019s uneven production that receives the longest laughs, with juvenile jokes entirely unrelated to the plot causing fits of hysterics.

It's the first decline in more than two decades. And after years of gains, U.S. life expectancy has been essentially flat for a few years, which means an inauspicious trend could be in the works.\nThe decline \"could be a blip, but even if it\u2019s flat, we have a real problem,\" said Jonathan Skinner, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice.\nThe culprits for our declining years, the report says, were increases in mortality from heart disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, kidney disease and suicide. Not surprisingly, that group plus cancer and the flu make up the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.\nReport author Jiaquan Xu said the decline is the first since 1993, when AIDS and a brutal flu epidemic swept the nation. This time, he says, the cause is not so clear.\nHe did highlight a 3% increase in \"unintentional injuries.\" The heading includes, among other things, traffic accidents and drug overdoses \u2014 both of which often involve relatively young victims whose deaths can have a strong impact on the numbers.\nStill, heart disease and cancer are the runaway top killers. The death rate from heart disease increased almost 1%. The death rate from cancer actually fell 1.7%.\n\"Obesity has to be a major factor,\" said S. Jay Olshansky, a public health researcher at the University of Illinois School of Public Health. \"Heart disease, stroke, diabetes \u2014 the impact of obesity is across the board. And people are living long enough to show the long-term effects.\"\nGender matters. For males, life expectancy fell to 76.3 years from 76.5 years. For women, life expectancy decreased to 81.2, down about a month from 2014.\n\"My major concern is that we know the exact cause of the fall in life expectancy \u2014 mortality is rising across a wide variety of illnesses,\" said Skinner, who was not involved in the study. \"It\u2019s not entirely easy to figure out what to do about it.\"\nThe march toward a higher life expectancy has been pretty consistent for decades thanks to gains in medical and public health knowledge. And, big picture, the news isn't all bad. Babies born in 2015 are still expected to live about two years longer than babies born in 2000 were expected to live. And a 2015 baby's life expectancy is more than 10 years longer than what those who joined the world in 1950 faced.\nThe latest numbers technically mean someone born in 2015 is expected to live an average of 78.8 years, although those who turned 65 in 2015 had brighter prospects. If you made it that far, you're expected to live an average of another 19.4 years.\nFor the record, there were more than 2.7 million U.S. deaths in 2015, 86,212 more than the previous year and a 1."}

The team has been busy setting up their supply chain and tweaking the design since the campaign was concluded in October, but have ordered components, and the plan is to deliver units to eager backers starting in April.\nMost impressively, the project is basically on time. Some backers were supposed to receive Form 1 3-D printers starting in February, but the majority were promised for April. The team that created the first hobby-grade high-accuracy printer also seems to have mastered the art of high-accuracy forecasting.\nThere are still some challenges to overcome. Formlabs owes 1,018 printers to their supporters and one of the most highly funded tech projects in Kickstarter's history will surely face a great deal of scrutiny once in the hands of users. Formlabs co-founder and CEO Maxim Lobovsky is excited about shipping the first wave of 3-D printers to enthusiasts. \"Kickstarter exceeded our expectations,\" he says. \"It definitely gets scary when dealing with larger numbers, but higher volumes also help things get cheaper.\"\nUnlike rival MakerBot, Lobovsky says Formlabs has no plans to open their own factory. \"The success of the Kickstarter certainly helped cement our decision to use a contract manufacturer rather than setting up our own facility.\" he says, but notes that the Form 1 is being assembled in the United States.\nThe close proximity to the factory has paid off, even if the labor costs are a little higher. \"We definitely had a few last-minute changes,\" says Lobovsky. \"For instance, after sheet metal production started, we found a bug. It would have worked, but it would have caused some failures. We worked with the manufacturing shop and were able to make the fix.\"\nEven with the deadline quickly approaching, improvements are still being made. \"One thing we're hoping to do a little different than other consumer electronics companies is to continue to tweak the product.\" says Lobovsky. \"A lot of companies are loath to touch a design once it works, but almost every component has been touched. We did a a few things to improve the accuracy of the build platform and improved laser driver. We've also made some aesthetic improvements, like figuring out how to make a seam smoother or smaller. We've changed finishes to make things look better. We're going to do some laser etching for branding that we weren't originally planning on.\"\nLobovsky is equally passionate about technology and improvements that customers will never see. \"We've done a lot since the Kickstarter with our manufacturing software, tooling, and processes,\" says Lobovsky. \"We have amazing automated production software \u2014 we're able to test every function of the device on the manufacturing line and drop the results into a database. Our goal is to keep making our system more accurate with lower-cost components.\"\nWhat's next for Formlabs once the hardware ships? \"One really great thing about shipping the hardware is that we're now focusing heavily on materials and software.\"\nFor those that missed out on the Kickstarter and early pre-orders, a batch of Form 1 printers shipping in May"}

In a country ruled by that very party for more than four decades, it was clear that the irrational, irresponsible and reckless move meant only one thing: Creating a security vacuum.\nSince power does not like vacuums, it was an open invitation to violence in various formats: Sectarian, ideological, political and so on.\nThe net outcome was direct hit that took lives of 4,487 American soldiers whose lives were taken into direct combat, according to the Pentagon official figures, while 32,226 were wounded in action. The latter could be a much underestimated figure depending on how one defines \"wounded in action.\"\nMoreover, and according to \"Iraq Body Count,\" the name speaks for itself, 100,000 Iraqis were killed in the violence that erupted in 2003 and continued till the Iraqi war was officially declared over on December 15 last year, while 1.5 million Iraqis became refugees in other countries and between 2 million to 2.5 million were termed internally displaced people.\nMoreover, not much has been spoken about economic cost of the Iraqi war on the American economy. The figure is estimated to be in trillions of dollars that was borne by the American taxpayers. Simply put the surplus inherited by the Bush administration when it took over power back in 2001 turned into red and indebtedness to China and other Gulf countries that bought the American treasury bonds.\nOthers like Joseph Stigliz, a Nobel Prize laureate and former Clinton economic adviser estimated the cost to be $ 3 trillion and more taking into consideration issues like medical treatment and so on. He concluded that no country can wage a failed war abroad without having to feel the pain at home. And that pain is in the form of economic troubles starting with deficit.\nThe significance of the American advice is that aside from the bitter lessons learned, it looks into the future not only of Syria alone, but of the whole region as such. Though the prime motive of the Arab Spring was to challenge repression and for that matter the security apparatus defending the regime, the American advice goes a long way in finding an alternative to keep that security somehow intact to avoid creating a vacuum that will eventually imperil the new political arrangement.\nIn other words security is as important as freedom.\nA step further and on the political front \u2014 the advice implies the need to find a way to incorporate those who were part of the previous regime. Though that could be difficult to swallow for the time being given the violence that seems to be the only game in town and the bitter experiences of the defunct regimes.\nBut the issue at stake is the future, not the past. More important is the need to decide whether to remain locked in the bitterness of the painful past or to look into the future to find ways to accommodate all and move on.\nIn most cases those supporting the regime were not only the staff, but they also reflect some social groups that will be around"}

Revenues were impacted by near-record rainfall on the Delmarva Peninsula during the quarter, which lowered water consumption and offset an increase in water sales revenue resulting from a temporary rate increase in Delaware.\n\"We continue to diversify our business to increase our revenues from sources other than water sales,\" said Artesian President and CEO, Dian C. Taylor. \"But, the reality is that water sales are still core to our business and when we have historically bad weather, water sales will be adversely affected.\"\nDuring the third quarter, the Maryland Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing Artesian Water Maryland's exercise of its water service franchise area in the eastern part of Cecil County. Artesian is now well-positioned to provide reliable water service throughout Cecil County's growth area. Artesian already provides water service to the Town of Port Deposit through a Susquehanna River water appropriation, has a water interconnection with the Town of Elkton and provides water service in the Mountain Hill area in the western part of the county that includes the Principio Business Park and communities of Carpenters Point and Whitaker Woods.\nArtesian mutually agreed with Cecil County during the third quarter to terminate agreements to purchase wastewater facilities from the county and recorded a one-time charge against income of $349,000.\nNet income decreased by $659,000, to $2.24 million for the third quarter. Diluted net income per common share was $0.26, down $0.12 from the same period last year. Earnings per share was impacted by the one-time charge as well as this year's late summer near-record rainfall and the effect of an 888,290 common stock share offering in the third quarter of 2011.\nOperating expenses, excluding depreciation and income taxes, for the third quarter of, 2011, increased by 3.9% to $10.0 million, compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher water treatment equipment maintenance costs, meter maintenance costs, fuel and personnel expenses.\n\"Despite the bad weather, we had many positives,\" Taylor said. \"Our profitable Water and Sewer Service Line Protection plans continued to grow and we moved one step closer to providing end-to-end water service in Cecil County's growth area. We are committed to driving this business forward by providing safe, reliable water and superior customer service; continuously improving our efficiency and performance; and delivering sound returns for our investors.\"\nArtesian Resources Corporation operates as the holding company of eight wholly-owned subsidiaries offering water, wastewater and engineering services on the Delmarva Peninsula.

Instead, it plunged into areas where remote islands dot a vast ocean.\nNASA says those new calculations show the 20-year-old satellite entered Earth's atmosphere generally above American Samoa. But falling debris as it broke apart didn't start hitting the water for another 300 miles to the northeast, southwest of Christmas Island, just after midnight EDT Saturday.\nExperts believe about two dozen metal pieces from the bus-sized satellite fell over a 500-mile span.\n\"It's a relatively uninhabited portion of the world, very remote,\" NASA orbital debris scientist Mark Matney said. \"This is certainly a good spot in terms of risk.\"\nScientists who track space junk couldn't be happier with the result.\n\"That's the way it should be. I think that's perfect,\" said Bill Ailor, director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at the Aerospace Corp. \"It's just as good as it gets.\"\nOn Saturday, scientists said it was possible some pieces could have reached northwestern Canada and claims of sightings in Canada spread on the Internet. But NASA said Tuesday that new calculations show it landed several minutes earlier than they thought, changing the debris field to an entirely different hemisphere.\n\"It just shows you the difference that 10 or 15 minutes can make,\" said Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, who tracks man-made space objects. On Saturday, he noted, \"We were talking about, 'Wow, did it hit Seattle?'\"\nAfter UARS was launched in 1991, NASA and other space agencies adopted new procedures to lessen space junk and satellites falling back to Earth. So NASA has no more satellites as large as this one that will fall back to Earth uncontrolled in the next 25 years, according to NASA orbital debris chief scientist Nicholas Johnson.\nBut other satellites will continue to fall. Late in October, or early in November, a German astronomy satellite is set to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth. While slightly smaller than UARS, the German satellite is expected to have more pieces survive re-entry, said McDowell, who worked on one of the instruments for it.\nThe German ROSAT satellite was launched in 1990, died in 1998 and weighs 2 \u00bd tons. The German space agency figures 30 pieces weighing less than 2 tons will survive re-entry. Debris may include sharp mirror shards.\nThe German space agency puts the odds of somebody somewhere on Earth being hurt by its satellite at 1-in-2,000 \u2014 a slightly higher level of risk than was calculated for the NASA satellite. But any one individual's odds of being struck are 1-in-14 trillion, given there are 7 billion people on the planet."}

In the previous article -Componentizing a Monolithic Application in Java, we discussed the need for componentizing applications to get the benefits of reusability and modularity. We also looked at how an E-Store application can be componentized using a simple component model developed by the authors using a factory whiteboard pattern and a simple repository.\nIn Part 1 of this article we will try to understand various component models in Java and provide a brief comparison of the features provided by them. Traditionally to explain component-based software engineering (CBSE) principles, popular component frameworks like CORBA, DCOM and JavaBeans are used. Instead of this traditional approach, this article will focus on the latest and widely adopted component models and frameworks specific to Java platform such as Enterprise JavaBeans Component Model (EJB), OSGi Component Model (OSGi), Spring Component Model (spring) and Component Model using Service Component Architecture (SCA).\nIn this article, first an introduction of component is given and types of components are explained and then the four component models are discussed in brief. At the end, a summary of the four component models is given.\nComponent-oriented programming is a preferred solution to address the increasing complexity in developing software applications. Component oriented development has many advantages. Typically a component is accessed using an interface that is provided by the component. A component can also depend on other interfaces provided by other components for fulfilling the functionality. Components are developed, assembled and composed with the help of a standardized component model. Each component model has its own standards for development and composition. These component models provide are accompanied by component framework which provides the runtime environment where these components are executed.\nComponents can be classified into different types depending on where and how they are used. We try to classify the components into the following types based on their usage in N-tier architecture.\nReusable components created for User Interface in applications. These components typically represent UI elements like form control - text field, radio button, data grid, table etc. used for managing the presentation tier of the application.\nReusable components that contain the business logic of the application. The components are usually POJO based, developed and deployed according to a standardized component model. The model also provides the environment for execution of these components.\nReusable components used in the persistence tier of an enterprise application. These components typically help in managing the persistence between the enterprise application and the data store.\nReusable components which perform services like security, infrastructure management, transaction and validation for the application. These components are used along with the business components since they provide the application services required for the business components.\nThe objective is to give an introduction of these component models from the perspective of component principles and to understand the features provided by each of them. This article does not delve much into the details of the component models.\nEnterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a component model that is significant part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. This is a standard from the JCP (Java Community Process) for representing business components in an n-tier enterprise application. Enterprise JavaBeans are distributed business components that contain the business logic of the enterprise application. The first release of the standard is EJB version 1.0. Much has changed in the EJB standard from its version 3.0. EJB has become truly lightweight, POJO based component model from EJB 3.0. This article will focus on the features of EJB with reference to EJB 3.0 specification. The classes and interfaces required for developing the components as per the model"}

In today's post, Paula Arce-Trigatti, Director of the National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships (NNERPP; @RPP_Network) shares how NNERPP's thinking on theories of action as a critical tool to guide RPP work has evolved.\nCheck out Monday's post for more thoughts on important topics in the RPP field: What's Next for Research-Practice Partnerships?\nIf you are anything like us at the National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships (NNERPP) a few years ago, you might have been asking those very same questions. (Well, if we are being perfectly honest, at NNERPP's first official gathering as a network of RPPs \u2014 the 2016 Annual Forum \u2014 there was no mention of theories of action, let alone the questions listed above).\nToday, however, it seems to be all we can think about (#obsessed). We attempted our first official theory of action session at the 2017 Annual Forum, where we asked participants to sit with their RPP teams and draw their partnership's current theory of action on poster paper. We even provided teams with a handy template to work from, prompting them to list out the resources and activities that would support a variety of partnership products and outcomes. At our most recent Annual Forum in Portland, which we recapped in Monday's post, we hosted not one, but two sessions on theories of action (see the blog post for more information on what the sessions entailed). And as we look ahead to the 2019 Annual Forum, it is no exaggeration to say that the entire 3 day event could be solely about theories of action (like I said, #obsessed).\nWhy are we so hung up on theories of action? In today's post, we'd like to share some key ideas around RPP theories of action that are surfacing in our conversations. Who knows \u2014 maybe you'll join us on the RPP theory of action bandwagon as well!\nOur shift in conversation over the last couple of years reflects an increasing recognition in the field of the value in spending time thinking and planning how to create processes and conditions to achieve partnership goals. A simple definition that we've adopted here at NNERPP is that a theory of action illustrates how a change is expected to come about. In the RPP context, this requires the partnership to put to paper a few things: First, the partnership needs to agree upon a set of goals the team will work towards. Second, a pathway to achieving those goals can then be jointly negotiated across the research and practice sides of the partnership. Beyond that, a theory of action can take on many forms, far too many to summarize here.\nAll of this might seem obvious to some, but for us (myself included) the concept of a theory of action, especially in the context of RPPs, is quite new. This may simply be a reflection of the variety of research training backgrounds many RPP directors come to the work with (e.g., people with graduate degrees in disciplines other than education may be less likely to know what a theory of action is). Part of it may also be due to the organic way in which the field itself grew \u2014 new partnerships learning from existing partnerships in more fundamental ways (e.g., \"How do you develop a research agenda with your partners?\" versus \"Are you testing any hypotheses about how to support evidence-based decision making in practice?\").\nRegardless of the origins of our knowledge gap, other leaders in the RPP"}

Forest\u2019s win takes them up to eighth, within one point of Derby and three of sixth-placed Bristol City.\nMartin O\u2019Neill, savouring his first east Midlands derby as Forest manager, said: \u201cI am naturally delighted to have won the game, I thought we did terrifically well. I do think we deserved to win the game, because we were very strong; defensively we were very good.\nDerby\u2019s defeat means they have one point from three games and Frank Lampard said his side did not do enough in the final third to take anything from the match. \u201cOn reflection, I don\u2019t think it was a fantastic game, quality-wise. And when you give a goal away from a set piece that floats around your box it plays into Forest\u2019s hands. It was perfect for them.\nForest enjoyed a blistering opening, taking the lead after barely 70 seconds. Joe Lolley\u2019s inswinging free-kick was headed up into the air by defender Jayden Bogle and in the ensuing panic Daryl Murphy headed the ball across to the far post where it was bundled in by Benalouane.\nMurphy headed over from Jack Robinson\u2019s long throw before Derby missed a glorious chance to equalise after 13 minutes. Duane Holmes slipped the ball through a sleeping Reds backline for Martyn Waghorn to run on to but as Costel Pantilimon came out to narrow the angle, Waghorn curled his effort well wide.\nForest wasted a great opportunity as play immediately switched to the other end. Lolley took advantage of a defensive error and played in Murphy who, with just Kelle Roos to beat, took too heavy a touch and the visiting keeper was able to gather the ball.\nRoos saved comfortably from Lolley, before Holmes shoved Ryan Yates to the ground after a late tackle by the Forest midfielder. Both players were booked.\nIn a predictably feisty affair Forest were managing to keep their rivals at arm\u2019s length and nearly doubled their lead when Yates reacted brilliantly but nodded Lolley\u2019s cross-shot inches wide.\nDerby made a change at half-time, bringing on Florian Jozefzoon for Tom Huddlestone, and the Dutchman tested Pantilimon four minutes after the break.\nAfter a lengthy stoppage for treatment to King, who had to be replaced by Bradley Johnson, the Reds made their first attack of the second half and Lolley fired an effort just wide of Roos\u2019s right-hand post.\nWith Forest sitting deep and inviting pressure, the Rams were enjoying a lot of possession but creating little and Lolley launched a counterattack after a Derby move broke down. After running 50 yards up the pitch, though, he hammered a shot well over.\nDerby were then awarded a free-kick 12 yards outside the Forest box as the game entered its final throes but to sum up the visitors\u2019 night, Waghorn\u2019s delivery failed to trouble Pantilimon as he caught the ball above his head with little difficulty.\nJohnson then hooked a shot over as he pounced on Pantilimon"}

{"idx": "32974", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Why couldn\u2019t Africa defeat these invasions? Indeed by 1900, the whole of Africa had been defeated except for Ethiopia which defeated the Italian invaders in the battle of Adua in 1896. According to our analysis, it was not because of lack of courage or the will to resist.\nIt was, mainly, on account of political balkanization. The African population is only divided into four linguistic groups. These are: Niger-Congo (Bantu and Kwa); the Nilo-Saharan (Hamitic, Nilotic and Nilo-Hamitic); the Afro-Asiatic (Arabic, Tigrinya and Amharic); and Khoisan (so called bushmen in Southern Africa). Therefore, the entirety of the African peoples are either similar or linked. I can pick words that are similar to the ones in my dialect, Runyankore in the Bantu dialects, all the way from Cameroon to South Africa. 2000 miles away in South Africa, for instance, the Zulus and Xhosas greet: \"Saubhona\", which, I suspect, means: \u201cI have seen you\u201d. This must be from the verb: \u201cKubona\u201d \u2013 meaning \u201cto see\u201d. In my dialect, Runyankore, the verb \u201ckubona\u201d means to find something that has been lost. In Swahili, however, the verb: \u201ckuwona\u201d means exactly what it means in the South African dialects. That is within the Bantu cluster of dialects. Even between clusters \u2013 e.g. Niger-Congo versus Nilo-Saharan \u2500 you find similarities. The Nubians of Southern Egypt and North Sudan, apparently, use the word: Nina to mean \u201cMother\u201d.\nWhat, however, is amazing is that many of the African political elite, the intellectuals, the other social leaders etc., have not bothered to investigate the cause of our near extinction in the last 500 years and to look for ways of how we can immunize ourselves against any and all threats against our survival, our sovereignty, our security and our prosperity in our land. That is how we come to the two issues that we regard as crucial for our future. These are: political and economic integration of Africa. Our view is that African integration means three things: prosperity, security and fraternity. We cannot guarantee our prosperity if we do not solve the issue of market. When companies or families produce products (goods) or services, how many consumers will buy those products? If a product does not have enough buyers, the business will fail. In Uganda, recently we had a big crop of maize. We produced 5 million tonnes; but Uganda consumes only 1 million tonnes.\nThe prices collapsed. Many farmers will move away from maize in the coming seasons. This is just one example. Many others can be quoted across Africa. We, therefore, need economic integration to provide market for our producing families and companies to be assured of a market on principles of competitiveness. The integrated African market will not only stimulate production in Africa, it will also enable us to negotiate credibly with the other big markets such as the USA, China, India, Russia, European Union, etc. It is good that, recently, we agreed on the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA).

Yes, last year\u2019s planning looks good when comparing it with the 2013-2017 average. Permits were up 4,567 units, a 9 percent boost, in 2018 vs. the previous five years. But last year was down 1,750 units (3 percent) vs. 2017 and was the second decline in three years.\nLook at 2018: Southern California\u2019s real estate market stalled and builders in the seven-county region cut permitting by the largest amount since the Great Recession ended.\nThere are plenty of factors are in play including NIMBY-ism as neighbors resist new housing projects. That\u2019s a hurdle most developments must overcome.\nBut 2018\u2019s slightly cooling job market helped create a large local supply of unsold newly built homes. And as summer began, homeowners were rushing to list their existing homes for sale. More competition for sellers, at a minimum, diminished builders\u2019 immediate need to create more single-family homes.\nSouthern California builders filed 24,947 permits for single-family homes last year, down 1,577 units (off 6 percent) vs. 2017. It was the first drop since 2011, but I\u2019ll note last year\u2019s permitting pace vs. the 2013-17 average was a 5,019-unit improvement. Yes, a gain of 25 percent!\nSimilar economic uncertainties \u2014 plus a political worry, the statewide rent control initiative that failed \u2014 seemed to zap landlords\u2019 enthusiasm for development.

After rising from 2010 through 2015, we\u2019ve seen three consecutive years of multi-family construction declines putting last year\u2019s pace 452 units \u2014 1 percent \u2014 below the five-year average.\nThe region\u2019s slowdown was not found elsewhere in the state where 58,809 permits were filed \u2014 up 4,196 units (8 percent) in a year, the fourth-consecutive yearly gain. Single-family permits jumped 12 percent in \u201918; multi-family rose 3 percent.\nOn a scale of zero bubbles (no bubble here) to five bubbles (five-alarm warning) \u2026 ZERO BUBBLES.\nRemember, developers are in the business of making money while mitigating their risks.

It erupted in March and is still spewing columns of smoke that have been captured by satellite images and fishermen.\nThe island is so remote that experts at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) say it will be impossible to assess what impact the eruption has had until an expedition visits in December 2016 or January 2017, but the risk to the penguins is that at worst they could be buried alive in ash, burned or suffer breathing difficulties.\nThe danger to the 55cm tall chinstraps comes from the fact the eruption began during their moulting season. During this time, which can last six weeks from the first to the last bird in the colony, the penguins are not waterproof and cannot go into the water.\nHe added that consequences for the population could be \u201cvery significant\u201d, a warning echoed by BAS geographer Dr Peter Fretwell who said the impact on the penguins could be serious.\nThe volcano is hundreds of metres from the penguin colonies to the east, south and north of the island, and the ash is being blown eastwards by prevailing winds.\nChinstrap penguins are a sub-Antarctic species that live close to, but not on, the continent. There are around 7.5m globally, and they live for 20-plus years, breeding two eggs each year, with chicks taking around three to four years to mature to adults.

{"idx": "32991", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: A majority say Merrick Garland should be confirmed. But that means less than you think.\nSince Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, polls have established that a majority of Americans think the Senate should at least consider President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy.\nBut in politics, understanding what people support is often less important than understanding what they'll actually vote on. And a new poll from Gallup suggests Americans -- and especially independents -- aren't yet demanding that the Senate confirm Merrick Garland.\nGallup is the first major national telephone poll to survey Americans' opinions on whether the Senate should confirm Garland to the Supreme Court. (Obama nominated the judge on Wednesday.) The results show that Garland, who is viewed as a safe consensus pick by Obama, is indeed supported by a majority of Americans, with 52 percent in favor and 29 percent opposed.\nGood news for Democrats, right?\nGiven how many voters are undecided or unfamiliar with Garland, it's too early to draw conclusions about how -- or whether -- the confirmation battle will influence Americans' votes in November. But these numbers indicate that Democrats' efforts to make this into a cause celebre over the past month haven't lit too much of a fuse.\nDemocrats are trying to make Senate Republicans' refusal to consider Garland an election issue that can help them take back the Senate in November. They are trying to leverage public support for Garland to make this something Republicans simply can't ignore.\nTo do that, they're going to need independents to side with Democrats in a handful of competitive Senate elections in swing and blue states. Senate Democrats are hoping Garland is one of the reasons those voters will oust Republican incumbents in favor of a Democrat -- or at least that this possibility will cause some of these GOP senators to flip and call for Garland's consideration.\nOn principle, polls indicate most independents agree with that argument. By a margin of 2-to-1 in a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, independents said the Senate should at least consider Obama's nominee to the court.\nBut independents don't feel strongly one way or another that Garland should be confirmed, with Gallup's numbers showing 44 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.\nThose numbers are actually pretty similar to what they were for Elena Kagan -- Obama's last Supreme Court nominee in 2010 -- and worse than they were for Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. Indeed, a big reason Garland has majority support overall right now is because he has an unusually high amount of support from Republicans -- 33 percent. Will those Republicans ditch their party for holding up Garland's nomination, though? We'd venture to say probably not.\nThe GOP is banking on the idea that their blockade of Garland won't incense voters who either don't care or aren't paying attention to the process of how a Supreme Court justice gets confirmed. Of course, Garland's nomination is just days old, and a majority of Americans have yet to learn much about him. There's plenty of room for both sides to make their case about why the Senate should -- or shouldn't -- consider this particular nominee.\nBut this poll, while showing majority support for Garland's confirmation, doesn't exactly scream that this is Democrats' silver bullet."}

The articles written and edited by the Morning277 network tended to deal with relatively obscure companies and products that might not otherwise merit their own Wikipedia pages. To make them look more credible, the articles would often be written and edited by several different accounts working together, and would contain vague citations to mainstream news accounts that crumbled upon closer inspection.\nAs a result of the investigation, the admins have shut down some 250 accounts linked to the sockpuppet ring, perhaps the largest in the site's history. The admins were careful not to publicly finger any suspects, but the Daily Dot's Simon Owens traced several of the deleted pages to a company called Wiki-PR, a firm that offers to help clients \"tell your story on Wikipedia\". Its services include \"page creation and editing\", \"page management\", and even \"crisis editing\", in which Wiki-PR pledges to \"directly edit your page using our network of established Wikipedia editors and admins\".\nBut Wiki-PR is defending itself, telling the Wall Street Journal that \"the 'PR' in 'Wiki-PR' is a misnomer\" \u2013 it's simply a \"research and writing firm\" that helps clients ensure that articles are neutral and accurate.\nEven that would seem to run afoul of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales' dictum that paid editing is \"antithetical\" to the site's mission. The thing is, Jimmy Wales doesn't run Wikipedia. No single individual, corporation, or non-profit does, either. Wales founded the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation in 2003 to support the site and maintain its infrastructure. But the real power over the site's content lies with a core group of top volunteers, who serve as \"admins\" tasked with overseeing the collective editing process, adjudicating disputes and conducting sockpuppet investigations.\nThese admins \u2013 there are roughly 600 on the English-language site \u2013 do an admirable job, but are often at loggerheads and are prone to endless bickering when confronted with controversy. And, more problematically, they're stretched increasingly thin as the site continues to grow in scope and stature. The problem was detailed in a major MIT Technology Review story this week, titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\". In the piece, Tom Simonite reports the number of active editors on the site has"}

It has been nearly a year since the vessel was intentionally lost at sea by Canadian authorities who were happy to let the \"biohazard\" become another country's problem.\nThis gruesome gift from Canada is now expected to crash ashore in Ireland or the United Kingdom, dumping the plague ship's living cargo of cannibal rats onto the land.\nNamed for a popular film actress in Stalin's USSR, the Lyubov Orlova was built by the Soviets in 1976 to treat Russian elites with pleasure cruises to Antarctica and the Arctic Circle.\nBut it was seized in 2010, by Canadian police acting as debt collectors against the ship's now-private owners, and for years it remained anchored off St. John's, the provincial capital of Newfoundland. Finally sold for scrap in 2012, the massive ship was lost at sea just a day after being towed out. When Canadian authorities finally captured the cruise ship last year, they decided to let it loose in international waters.\nIn our era of Google satellite maps, GPS and constant government surveillance of the most mundane activities on land, it seems peculiar that a 295-foot-long ocean vessel could disappear in the North Atlantic while still afloat. But maritime officials in Ireland and Scotland say they haven't heard from the Lyubov Orlova since March of last year, when an emergency signal from the ship placed it about 700 miles off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland. The ship itself was spotted by radar operators not long after, but search pilots sent to confirm the location couldn't find it.\nEver since, the rat ship has been missing at sea.\nIt may still be afloat, the Independent reports today, because its lifeboats are equipped with distress signals that only transmit when they hit water\u2014only two of the lifeboats' transmitters have been heard, probably after those rafts were shaken loose as the Lyubov Orlova is continually tossed by North Atlantic storms. It has already traveled two-thirds of the way to the British Isles.\nIf the ship is spotted before a big storm slams it against the populated coastline, scrap haulers or the closest Coast Guard crews will have to board the awful vessel.\n\"There will be a lot of rats and they eat each other,\" a Belgian scrap sailor told The Sun. \"If I get aboard I'll have to lace everywhere with poison.\"\nThere may be no chance to get aboard, because the 4,251-ton ship full of rats could suddenly be pushed ashore in a winter storm. Once the rats make landfall, they will be very, very hungry for something besides the raw flesh of their comrades at sea.\nKen Layne writes Gawker's American Almanac and American Journal.

Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and television host, mentioned that voter turnout in Ferguson, Mo., was a mere 12 percent in the last election, and pledged to help boost that number with a registration drive. Twelve percent, he said, was \u201can insult to your children.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the first to think of channeling the anger over Mike Brown\u2019s death in this particular direction. Twitter users on Saturday noted voter registration tables in front of the makeshift memorial where the unarmed teenager was shot by a police officer.\nEncouraging more participation in the democratic process in a community that feels alienated from political power \u2014 hence the demonstrations \u2014 seems like an obviously good idea; and one that\u2019s particularly compelling because it\u2019s so simple. Voting is an alternative to protesting in the streets.\nAnd yet, the executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, Matt Wills, denounced the plan.\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Mr. Sharpton did not say that the residents of Ferguson should vote for Democrats; he said they should vote, full stop. He didn\u2019t even mention the ideological composition of the area\u2019s governing bodies; though he did mention their racial composition (lopsidedly white in a majority black community). And of course the residents of Ferguson, once registered, will have the ability to vote for anyone they please \u2014 not just Democrats.\nIsn\u2019t it telling that both Mr. Wills and Mr. McLaughlin make no distinction between voter registration and Democratic registration? Mr. Sharpton, a Democrat, may well assume the same, and that\u2019s telling, too.\nBoth sides here seem to think that enlarging the franchise is good for Democrats and that, conversely, keeping it small is good for Republicans \u2014 a dynamic that also exists at the national level. Republicans try to make voting more difficult to vote, by passing voter ID laws, and Democrats resist these changes, confident that high turnout is better for liberals."}

Control of the U.S. rail system also gives the CCP a network of sensors across the United States, and control of a key tool used for domestic transport by the U.S. military.\nAccording to Erik Olson, vice president of the Rail Security Alliance, the main company behind this push is CRRC, a state-owned Chinese company. A report from Oxford Economics, backed by the Rail Security Alliance, found that CRRC\u2019s actions could eliminate 65,000 jobs from the United States if China takes over U.S. freight rail production. If allowed to proceed, it could also reduce the U.S. GDP by close to $6.5 billion.\n\u201cWe feel they\u2019re very transparent in their interests in rail. It\u2019s obviously part of their 2025 Plan,\u201d Olson said, referring to the Chinese regime\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan to become a manufacturing superpower by replacing foreign competitors in global high-tech markets.\nAs part of its 2025 Plan, the CCP has identified 10 technology sectors to overtake which includes, among others, advanced rail equipment. To achieve this goal, the Chinese regime is directing state-owned and private firms to invest in and acquire foreign companies, and to acquire or steal technological innovations.\nWith CRRC, it is quickly advancing to dominate the global rail industry.\nIn Australia, the CCP has already demonstrated its tactics. According to Olson, CRRC went to Australia nine years ago. Since the Chinese state-owned company didn\u2019t need to make a profit, it was able to make bids that no competitors could match. Of the three primary Australian rail companies, CRRC eventually acquired one, and the two others went out of business.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see that here in the United States because we have a healthy, vibrant freight industry,\u201d Olson said.\nAlready, however, CRRC is making inroads in the United States; it has won bids in Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\u201cThe Boston one is particularly interesting because the second-lowest bid was from Bombardier, which was around a billion dollars, and CRRC came in at 569 million,\u201d Olson said.\nAs part of the agreement in Boston, Massachusetts will get a facility and jobs, but parts for the rail projects will be shipped from China. Boston also waived federal funds, so it won\u2019t need to follow provisions under President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order.\nOlson noted the first train cars going to Boston under the deal were shrink wrapped and shipped whole from China.\nIn addition to the CCP\u2019s growing influence over the business side of railways, there are also issues that could affect U.S. national security.\nToday\u2019s trains are fitted with closed circuit cameras, have internal WiFi, and, according to Olson, the technologies in the Chinese-made rail cars are from some of the same companies currently being accused of spying for the CCP.\nUser data could be at risk from the Chinese companies having access to internet traffic on the networks, and data collected by the sensors could feed back to the Chinese regime as well.\nAccording to Olson, however, the bigger security threat is to the U.S. military, which"}

Lloyd Grove reports.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the militant animal rights group best known as PETA, has been trying for more than a decade to put the circus out of business. The arduous war between PETA and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, a global enterprise that has trademarked the slogan \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth,\u201d has deployed every tactic from guerrilla action to expensive litigation.\nAt issue is PETA\u2019s claim, vehemently denied by Ringling Bros., that The Greatest Show on Earth has demonstrated a conspicuous pattern of negligence and cruelty toward its animal-entertainers, violating the federal Animal Welfare Act and leaving a grisly trail of beaten, drowned, and otherwise mistreated elephants, who allegedly died under their masters\u2019 abuse, and a baked-to-death lion, who perished aboard a Ringling Bros. rail car in the Mojave Desert. Then, PETA alleges, Ringling Bros. hid evidence to cover up the humans\u2019 misdeeds.\nIn PETA\u2019s latest salvo, it is targeting a former enforcement official of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which regulates the treatment of animal-performers and controls the granting of exhibitors\u2019 licenses. Nine months after his retirement from the government, former USDA assistant general counsel Kenneth H. Vail has turned up as the Animal Welfare Act compliance officer of Virginia-based Feld Entertainment, Ringling Bros.\u2019 multibillion-dollar parent company\u2014which he formerly regulated. PETA is requesting that USDA\u2019s inspector general launch a conflict-of-interest investigation into Vail, who retired in May 2011 after four decades at the agency and joined Feld Entertainment this past February.\n\u201cWhile at the USDA, Vail received numerous recommendations from the USDA\u2019s Investigative and Enforcement Services to initiate proceedings against Feld Entertainment\u2026for beating and abusively and negligently causing the deaths of animals and withholding evidence from the agency, yet no meaningful action was ever taken,\u201d claims PETA\u2019s 41-page complaint to USDA Inspector General Phyllis K. Fong. \u201cNow Vail has taken a job with Ringling,\u201d the complaint continues, arguing that Vail, while at the USDA, \u201callowed the company to get away with repeated, egregious violations of the AWA for more than a decade [and] appears to have thwarted AWA enforcement action against the company\u2014[raising] the specter of impropriety.\u201d A spokesman for the USDA inspector general declined to comment on PETA\u2019s complaint.\nReached at his office, Vail told me that he\u2019s been aware of his unenviable position in PETA\u2019s crosshairs at least since March 2011, when the animal rights group sent his USDA boss a letter accusing Vail, among other officials, of \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d and giving \u201cimproper preferential treatment\u201d to Ringling Bros and Feld Entertainment. Vail declined to respond to PETA\u2019s allegations. But Stephen Payne, Feld Entertainment\u2019s corporate communications chief, offered a rousing defense of his new coworker.\n\u201cMy initial reaction is that it\u2019s a contemptible piece of fiction,\u201d Payne said of PETA\u2019s complaint, which was brought to his attention by"}
