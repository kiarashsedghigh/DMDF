It was sold off by the Westfield Group, which owns Roseville\u2019s Galleria, after various redevelopment ideas for the site fizzled. JMA recently sold the mall to the new Kings ownership group for $36 million, according to court records. The Kings are building a $448 million NBA arena and entertainment venue, which will be owned by the city. They\u2019re also working with JMA to develop a surrounding mix of retail, housing and hotels. The arena is scheduled to open in 2016.\nRoughly two-thirds of the aging mall is set to be jackhammered into oblivion starting this summer. Construction fencing marking off the arena site\u2019s boundaries \u2013 roughly between J and L streets, from Fifth to Seventh streets \u2013 could go up in a matter of months. Most of the scattered tenants still open in Downtown Plaza\u2019s eastern edge are expected to be gone by late April.\nWorkers are pulling out the existing information kiosks and moving them to the Macy\u2019s end of the mall. Golden One Credit Union is informing customers that its Downtown Plaza bank branch and three ATMs will close on April 25.\nOn the opposite, western end of the mall \u2013 home to Macy\u2019s, Forever 21, River City Brewing Co. and the upstairs Century movie theater complex \u2013 it\u2019s mostly business as usual. That end of the mall isn\u2019t part of the arena development plan. The mall has hung banners proclaiming \u201cOpen During Anticipation,\u201d listing some of the stores expected to remain during construction.\nBy late April, all of the store\u2019s remaining merchandise will be sent to the Fairfield location. The eight employees of the jeweler\u2019s three Downtown Plaza outlets have been offered positions at the chain\u2019s stores in Stockton, Fresno, Modesto and San Rafael, she said.\nJust a few hundred yards down the mall, All Star Sports is throwing in the towel.

Blunt was being held in lieu of a $75,000 bond on weapon and robbery charges.\nThe way the inmates used pinups to hide their escape route was reminiscent of a scene in the 1994 movie \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\nRomankow played down the comparison.\n\"I think this is a very serious situation you saw,\" he said. \"I really prefer not to compare with any movie, although I can understand why you might, because it does look certainly very similar to some of them.

It was built not in 1905 but in 1980.\nIt was one of the first new homes built in the historic neighborhood during a revival more than three decades ago, says local real estate agent Doug Newby, an investor among several neighbors who acquired the lot where the original house burned to the ground.\nIn 1980, Munger Place was one of Dallas\u2019 most run-down neighborhoods.

Its facade looked like an early-1900s house, but inside it was 1980.\n\u201cThere were floor tiles around the fireplaces,\u201d she says.

{"idx": "21013", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: What Are the Benefits of Jogging vs. Walking for Muscle?\nMuch has been said about the benefits of walking vs. jogging. Both are touted as great aerobic exercises that can help you lose weight, sleep better, make you happier, give you more energy, decrease your blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lessen your risk for a host of ailments, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Both are praised for their accessibility -- just lace up your sneakers and, in most cases, simply walk out your front door. To the surprise of some, walking has proven to be of greater health benefit than running in some areas. Running, for instance, can cause greater stress to your immune system. But what if your goal is to build muscle -- is it better to walk or run?\nThe edge here goes to jogging, but not in all forms. Watch the Olympics and check out the sprinters, in the 100, 200 and 400 meters \u2014 those athletes generally have pretty impressive, well-defined quad muscless. To help with their explosive starts, sprinters incorporate weight training into their workout. Weight training emphasizes the cycle of breaking down a muscle only to have it heal and come back bigger and stronger. Sprinters also don\u2019t run long distances, which shrinks muscle fibers in an effort to make them more efficient metabolically.\nDistance runners may not have bigger calf muscles, but theirs are typically more well defined. Distance runners tend to take shorter strides than sprinters, which has the effect of transferring the work down the leg \u2014 to the calf muscles. And the longer distances you run keeps the quads from gaining too much bulk. An argument could be made for walking in the form of backpacking; spend much time around ardent thru-hikers and you\u2019ll notice some impressive calf muscles. But remember that their form of walking includes carrying a pack of usually between 30 and 50 pounds, throwing in an element of weight training.\nFor the most important muscle in this equation, both activities are good, with walking garnering perhaps a slight edge. A study published in the May 2013 issue of \"Journal of Ateriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology\" using data from the National Runners and Walkers Health Studies found that runners exhibited a reduced risk of 4.5 percent for developing heart disease compared to sedentary types. Walkers, however, exercising for the same amount of time exhibited a reduced risk of more than 9 percent.\nA similar physiology that applies to your quads also applies to your backside. The longer and harder your work the three muscle groups back there \u2014 the gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus and gluteus medius \u2014 the smaller they\u2019re likely to get. Genetics aside, you rarely see someone with a sizable derriere competing in a marathon. It\u2019s not unusual, on the other hand, to see a good-size bottom on even the most dedicated walkers on the local greenway or track.

Students in the class wrote an adapted version of the last movie of the trilogy and acted it out at Kepler Theater on Friday, she said.\nMany of the students memorized their lines and made props for the play that was about 30 minutes long, she said.\nAnother popular new class this year was \"Crime Scene Detective,\" in which students used forensic science - as is done on the television series \"CSI\" - to solve crimes. There were 15 students in the class and a waiting list of others who wanted to take it, she said.\n\"Dino Might,\" in which students learn about the different types of dinosaurs, dig for dinosaur bones and have a dinosaur egg hunt.\n\"Bug Me!,\" in which students learn about types of bugs. At one point, the students had to capture a bug outside and identify it.\n\"Vet Academy,\" in which students learn about the veterinary profession and visit the Humane Society of Washington County facilities.\nIn its first few years, the program was only for elementary school students, but over the years it has expanded to include students ranging from first grade to high school seniors, Myers said.\nThe programs about dinosaurs and bugs, for example, are for first- and second-graders; the one on \"Lord of the Rings\" was for students in grades six through eight; and a program about repairing and networking computers was for students in grades eight through 12.\nWhile the students in the program are younger than the average college student, their presence at the college makes total sense because it fits with the college's goal of providing a \"learner-centered, accessible lifelong learning experience,\" Myers said.\nThe program also may inspire students to pursue degrees and careers as veterinarians or forensic scientists, she said.\nMany of the instructors for the classes return repeatedly, she said.\nAs part of an appraisal and evaluation, teachers and college officials talk about what classes they should offer next year. They are talking, for example, about offering a Spanish class next summer, she said."}

In the UK, the systematic recording of flowering times dates back to 1875, when the Royal Meteorological Society established a national network of observers.\nSince then, data has also been recorded by full-time biologists and part-time enthusiasts, and in recent years there have been mass-participation projects such as BBC Springwatch.\nThis new research suggests that these observations of flowering and leafing carried out in many different parts of the world over the past thirty years are remarkably similar according to Dr Wolkovich.\n\"In terms of long term observations, the records are very coherent and very consistent and they suggest for every degree celsius of warming we get we are going to get a five- to six-day change in how plants leaf and flower.\"\nShe argues that the difficulties in mimicking the impacts of nature in an artificial setting are much greater than many scientists estimate. The team found that in some cases the use of warming chambers to artificially raise temperatures can sometimes have the opposite effect.\n\"In the real world, we don't just see changes in temperature - we see changes in precipitation and cloud patterns and other factors - so certainly when you think about replicating changes in clouds, we are very, very far away from being able to do that.\n\"I guess we will never get to perfectly match nature, but I am hopeful as scientists we can do much, much better, given funding resources.\"\nThe team found that the greater investment in the design and monitoring of experiments, the more accurate the result.\n\"We have a very consistent message from the long-term historical records about how plants are changing, but we need to think more critically about how we fund and invest in and really design experiments,\" said Dr Wolkovich.\n\"We do need them in the future, they are the best way going forward to project how species are changing but right now what we're doing isn'"}

Drawing from years of classical training and a personal devotion to modern jazz and classic rock, the talented songwriter/multi-instrumentalist/front man, Eric Margan, makes an original and sophisticated entrance with an impressive collection of 12 incredible tracks in Midnight Book.\nThe debut album for 22-year-old Margan resonates as a somber, theatrical novel \u2013 complete with love, tragedy, heartbreak, and revival. Midnight Book, as the title might imply, is best experienced from \u201ccover to cover.\u201d Midnight Book delivers stellar and distinctive compositions, augmented by ensnaring and intriguing lyrical poetry, leading the listener into an introspective musical journey.\nThe album opens with \u201cAn Ocean Blue\u201d, a swirling, seductive tapestry of orchestral grandeur, seemingly emerging from the darkest depths of the piano and sets the stage for a colossal, metaphor-laden song cycle. As the pages of Midnight Book turn, the love story that began so triumphantly begins to unravel in Margan\u2019s \u201cA Speckled Mind.\u201d It is here that Margan displays the delicate touch of an impressionist painter, through the juxtaposition of orchestral strings combined with a powerful yet poignant drum and bass polyrhythm.\nThe album\u2019s standout \u201cOld Man River\u201d is the turning point in the story, full of grandiose and massively cinematic crescendo. Margan\u2019s colorful plot thickens to a soaring climax, telling a story of an estranged marriage \u2013 complete with twists, turns, murder and revenge.\nMargan appropriately concludes his heavy narrative with the relatively bare instrumentation of strings, piano, voice and guitar. The last notes are imminent, chords that are prepared to leave their final impression \u2013 but not without a last fighting chance.\nBorn and raised in Columbia County of Upstate New York, Eric Margan\u2019s musical endeavors started at just nine years old when he began studying flute. It was when he turned 14 that the hobby had become a potential career. He began treading new waters with the formation of his first band \u2013 a three-piece rock group in which he was a co-songwriter, bassist, and singer. Margan furthered his bass skills by participating in various jazz ensembles and combos throughout his high school years. Furthering his music studies, he brought together his classical training with his passion for modern rock and live performance with the addition of the talented musicians that make up the Red Lions.\nThe Red Lions, the talented line-up of musicians sellected to augment Margan\u2019s music on stage, include Drummer Jim Bertini, bassists Scott Kellerhouse and Vince Chiarito, keyboardist Zachary Seman and guitarist/flutist/vocalist Johanna Warren are the Red Lions. Live performances and Midnight Book also feature various string, woodwind and brass players.\nEric Margan and the Red Lions are rapidly earning the respect and admiration of fans and bands, from opening for such acts as the Benevento Russo Duo and L.A.-based Bittersweet, to recording sessions with Pete Seeger, Richie Havens and David Amram, and playing a multitude of shows in the Northeastern United States.\nMore dates will be released at http://www.ericmargan.com"}

It has yielded lessons and discoveries that could benefit millions, including coastal Australians, air and sea travelers and scientists trying to understand ancient changes to the earth\u2019s crust.\nThe knowledge gained so far is of little comfort to family and friends of the 239 people still missing from the plane, which vanished last March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. While finding the plane remains the top priority for searchers and investigators, what they\u2019re learning along the way may prove valuable long after the search ends.\nIn the Indian Ocean west of Australia, where experts believe the plane crashed, scientists have been mapping the sea floor to aid in the search for wreckage.\nPrevious maps relied on satellite data, which gave only rough estimates of the ocean\u2019s depth. Now, using sonar readings from ships, scientists have mapped an area the size of Nebraska and have discovered previously unknown trenches and underwater mountains that rival the height of any on Australia\u2019s surface.\nSearchers are getting even more detailed sonar readings using small underwater vehicles called \u201ctowfish\u201d that are towed just above the sea floor.\nScientists from around the world are eagerly anticipating the release of the three-dimensional maps and data once the search is completed.\nStuart Minchin, a divisional chief at Geoscience Australia, said that when the maps are released and further analyzed, they will give scientists a better understanding of areas that during earthquakes are susceptible to underwater landslides, which can create or exacerbate tsunamis.\nHe said the information will help scientists pinpoint areas along Australia\u2019s west coast that are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis and enable better warnings and predictions for coastal residents.\nKnowing the topography of the ocean floor also helps scientists predict ocean currents, said Minchin. That can help with everything from predicting where a disabled boat might drift in a search-and-rescue mission to understanding how marine species spread to new areas.\nHe said it can even help scientists understand how heat is distributed through the ocean, which could be used by meteorologists to help fine-tune weather forecasts.\nOne thing the airline industry learned from Flight 370 is that more tracking is needed, even for planes expected to fly over land for their entire journeys.\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization, which is part of the United Nations, has proposed that airlines be required to get position updates from each of their planes every 15 minutes. That requirement is expected to be in place by November 2016.\nA more stringent requirement would seek updates every minute if a fire is detected or the plane makes an unusual move, such as suddenly dropping or climbing in elevation. That would apply only to jets manufactured after 2020.\nAustralian Transport Minister Warren Truss said Sunday that his government\u2019s airspace agency will work with Malaysia and Indonesia to test a new method, which would enable planes to be tracked every 15 minutes, rather than the previous rate of 30 to 40 minutes. However, even if such a system had been in place for Flight 370, it would not have made it possible to track the plane because transponder and other equipment were switched off.\nBecause investigators still don\u2019t know what happened to Flight 370, airlines have no information to help them update their mechanical systems or flight-training techniques.\nCapt.

DICE's brief detour from their best-selling Battlefield series was a slick, inventive, and gorgeous video game.\nUnfortunately, it didn't sell well\u2014not surprising for a $60 game that was only about six hours long.\nMirror's Edge is a first-person action game about flow. It's at its most fun when you're climbing, jumping, and running your way through a virtual obstacle course. It stops being fun when you stop moving.\nConsider the gaming landscape in 2008, especially first-person shooters. Developers were releasing games like Call of Duty: World at War and Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway. Crytek's Crysis: Warhead launched just a year after the first game, as did GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky. Ubisoft's African-set Far Cry 2 released to the acclaim of some and the consternation of others.\nMirror's Edge is nothing like them.\nIn 2008, shooters largely focused on a kind of 'start and stop' gameplay. Most still do. Players make their way to an encounter, decide how to deal with it, and then engage. How you got to where you were going could be interesting, but your decisions rarely boiled down to more than \"I want to go in that basic direction\" or \"I want to get to that particular spot.\" Much of the meaning in these games could be found in the stories that emerged along the way, but even then, the gameplay loop was: approach, assess, engage.\nWith Mirror's Edge, the destination was the journey itself. The story, one about a dystopian future and couriers being its last hope for survival, was paper-thin. Even the objectives\u2014the things you'd use your gaming skills to run to\u2014amounted to simple barely-interactive cutscenes. They didn't matter all that much. What matters in Mirror's Edge comes up during all the running you do\u2014the choices about how to handle individual motions, a stride, a vault and a lunging grasp at a time.\nOut of all the levels in Mirror's Edge, Jacknife is my favorite. Like The Silent Cartographer in Halo, it's representative of the rest of game: from its successes in both flow and breathtaking leaps to its failures, namely its gunfights. In Mirror's Edge's second chapter, a former runner, Jacknife, has information that's crucial to you. You've got to go find him. It's a nice, simple objective.\nThe city in Mirror's Edge is too clean to feel human and too caged by barbed wire\u2014even on the rooftops you often run across\u2014to feel welcoming. This is not a pleasant place, especially for a runner like Faith, the game's player-character. Speakers in the city streets blare warnings that attempt to frame you for someone's murder. Yup, it's a dystopia alright.\nIn a game about free running, a dystopia that targets free runners makes a lot of mechanical sense. There's barbed wire everywhere, discouraging you from climbing the chain-link fences that define your boundaries. If you've ever climbed a chain-link fence, you know how clumsy and awkward you can feel while doing it. For a game that'"}

In one of them, the group --which in cyber-security circles goes by many different names such as APT-C-06, Dubnium, Fallout Team, Karba, Luder, Nemim, SIG25, and Tapaoux-- also hid malware inside a copy of North Korea's antivirus sent to foreign researchers for study.\nBut in 2018, the group has been especially active and has been seen numerous times targeting the same technology --Internet Explorer's VBScript scripting engine.\nThis year, researchers say DarkHotel hackers found and exploited a first IE zero-day (CVE-2018-8174) in April, and then a second (CVE-2018-8373) in August. Microsoft patched both, in May and September, respectively.\nBut according to a new report published today, researchers at Qihoo 360 Core say the group has also created new exploits for two older IE scripting engine vulnerabilities --namely CVE-2017-11869 and CVE-2016-0189.\n\"After analysis, we found that the obfuscation and exploitation of these four [exploits] are highly consistent,\" said Qihoo 360 Core researchers. \"We suspect that they are from the same hacker (or hacking group).\"\nZero-days are hard to discover and even harder to weaponize in usable exploits.

There was healthcare, when he rallied a huge swathe of the country against the grotesque Republican \"reform\" bills. And now there is the horror in Las Vegas\u2014Kimmel's hometown. \"It feels like someone has opened a window into Hell,\" he said last night, towards the end of a formidable monologue in which he marked the severity of the tragedy, then demanded action from both lawmakers and the public in a way it seems few others can.\nThere was something captivating about watching Kimmel\u2014a self-professed newcomer to tackling political issues\u2014attempt to tackle America's unhinged gun debate.

At least some of them were there legally. Why is that allowed? I don't know why our so-called leaders continue to allow this happen. Or maybe the better question\u2014why do we continue to let them allow this to happen?\nThis is just a regular part of our lives now. You know what will happen: We'll pray for Las Vegas, some of us will get motivated. Some of us won't get motivated. The bills will be written, they'll be watered down, they'll fail. The NRA will smother it all with money. And over time we'll get distracted and move on to the next thing. And over time it will happen again and again.\nBut Kimmel wasn't helpless. He reminded the audience that there is a strong constituency for action on guns: 99 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans are in favor of universal background checks. 89 percent of everybody want to stop mentally ill people from obtaining guns.\nYet, as Kimmel sharply put it, President Trump signed an executive order in February reversing an Obama-era initiative that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. Keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill seems like the most common sense measure possible, yet it is beyond a Republican Congress and White House afraid to ever strain against the NRA's tight leash. Kimmel drove that home by throwing up the photos of all the senators who voted against background checks after Orlando, the last most-deadly-mass-shooting-in-modern-American-history. That was last summer.\nMaybe I'm nuts, but I think maybe we can put politics aside and agree: No American needs an M-16, or ten of them. And then maybe we don't do this again.

{"idx": "21037", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Be specific in noting your concerns.\nOrganizations may periodically reclassify employees who have held positions for extended periods of time. The method used to reclassify an employee will depend on many factors. Both private and governmental organizations commonly have systems in place to reassess the work performance of an employee. When the job and responsibilities of the employee change, the organization may assess the employee for reclassification.\nReclassification is one way for an organization to implement a natural progression to the next level of development for an employee's career. An organization may reclassify an employee when the scope of the duties that the employee performs changes in complexity, accountability, decision-making authority or required knowledge. Employees who have held new job responsibilities for at least six months may also want to directly request the reclassification of the job position. Reclassifications include lateral, upward and downward job movement.\nA reclassification will typically result in a new title for the employee's position. In many cases this means that the position, not the employee, received the reclassification because the previous job title no longer describes the job of the position. An upward reclassification usually signifies an increase in job responsibilities from the previous position. On the other hand, downward and lateral reclassifications typically involve lowered or the same amount of responsibility.\nIf you feel the job tasks you perform deserve reclassification, you should contact your supervisor to initiate the process. Depending on the organization, a system may or may not exist for job reclassification. In most organizations, your supervisor will assess your current and previous job descriptions, review your current and previous responsibilities, assess the length of time you have performed these new duties and responsibilities, and initiate the reclassification request with the organization's human resources department.\nHow Often Should You Request Reclassification?\nMost organizations have a system in place to periodically assess employee performance and duties. In many organizations, this assessment process occurs on an annual basis. However, you can request reclassification at any time in most organizations. Many smaller-sized organizations do not have the capacity or resources to reclassify positions or increase your salary based on a reclassification. Therefore, when requesting a reclassification, you should maintain realistic expectations based on the needs, resources and policies of the organization you work for.\nBass, Brian. \"Employee Reclassification Process.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-reclassification-process-19207.html.

The industry hopes to increase that number.\nJuly 21, 2011, 12:26 p.m.\nOpen the hood of your car and you might be surprised to learn those automotive parts came from recycled carpet. Instead of padding a landfill, carpet also provided erosion control along the Gulf Coast following the BP oil slick.\nCarpet has been recycled for nearly 20 years in the U.S. Still, it\u2019s not as convenient as leaving a bin of recycled aluminum and paper at the curb or dropping it in a designated dumpster.\nThe heavy floor covering with its petroleum-based components must be transported to recycling facilities, specially designed for the purpose. It can be a pricey proposition, which is why recycling rates remain low.\n\u201cWhile most components that make up carpet are recyclable or reusable, only about 4 percent of waste carpet currently gets handled in these ways,\u201d according to the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE), which oversees a major nationwide carpet diversion and recycling effort. It involves the carpet industry, government agencies and entrepreneurs.\nCARE has seen a growing number of businesses handling post-consumer carpet over the past few years.\nMore than 100 carpet reclamation sites are listed on CARE\u2019s website, www.carpetrecovery.org. The majority are in the Southeast \u2014 where the largest carpet manufacturers are located \u2014 and Texas and California.\nIn many areas of the country, especially rural ones, it\u2019s still cheaper to ditch a carpet in a landfill than recycle it. But if you live in a large metro area, where landfill space is at a premium, it becomes cost-effective for businesses to recycle carpet, says Georgina Sikorski, CARE\u2019s executive director.\nDepending on the recycler, they may allow consumers to drop off their used carpet, Sikorski says. Recyclers, who set their own rates, may also have a preference for a certain type of carpet, she says.\nSome only accept from commercial clients. Consumers should inquire at the sale whether their retailer or dealer has a take-back program to transport used carpets to a collector or processor, she says. The cost of recycling is generally built into the price tag, Sikorski adds.\nCARE members have increased carpet diversion and recycling 10 percent each year, a trend Sikorski expects to continue. The majority of carpet collected for diversion is recycled. Some is burned as waste-to-energy.\nRecycling involves identifying and grouping carpet by its component fiber, mostly nylon and plastic, she says. Next the carpet is run through either a shredding or shearing machine to separate the carpet layers. Further processing is required to mold plastic into other products, such as automobile parts. The fiber also can be reused, say for new carpet or carpet cushions, Sikorski explains.\nEngineered resins make up more than half of the products produced last year by carpet recyclers associated with CARE, according to its 2010 annual report. One-third went into new carpet as either carpet fiber or backing, the report says.\nRecycled content becomes more valuable when oil prices rise, affecting the price of virgin or new material, Sikorski says.\nThe carpet industry seems to realize that if it doesn\u2019t voluntarily take responsibility for disposal of their products, government mandates might force them to.

Nearly a decade later, he set the Senate record for filibustering when he spoke for a straight 24 hours and 18 minutes against a bill to end discrimination in housing.\nIronically, his presidential campaign sparked controversy more than a half-century later, when then-Majority Leader Trent Lott declared at Thurmond's 100th birthday party that voters of Mississippi were proud to have supported the South Carolinian when he ran for the White House. \"If the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either,\" added Lott, who was forced to step down as the Senate's Republican leader in the ensuing uproar.\nThurmond's racial politics changed over the years as blacks began voting in large numbers.

{"idx": "21046", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Adnan Badreddine (left) mourns in Beirut beneath a billboard of his brother Mustafa, one of the architects of Islamic terrorism.\nMustafa Badreddine, a cocky Lebanese bomb maker and one of the architects of Islamic terrorism, was buried Friday. He was Hezbollah\u2019s top military commander, and, along with his brother-in-law Imad Mughniyah, who died in 2008, masterminded one of the longest-running sprees of violence\u2014bombings, hostage-takings, assassinations, and airplane hijackings\u2014in the Middle East. Badreddine, who was fifty-five, was killed in a mysterious explosion in Syria, where he commanded at least six thousand Hezbollah fighters who are propping up the regime of President Bashar Assad. A few months ago, he vowed, \u201cI won\u2019t come back from Syria unless as a martyr or a carrier of the banner of victory.\u201d He came back in a box.\nBadreddine gained fame for developing a sophisticated technique for using gas to increase the power of plastic explosives. It was used in the 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine compound in Beirut, the largest loss of American military personnel in a single incident since Iwo Jima, in 1945. His name did not surface publicly until two months later, when a truck laden with forty-five large cylinders of gas connected to explosives careened through the gates of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. The Embassy annex crumbled; shock waves blew out windows and doors for blocks, including those of the Hilton Hotel across the street. The driver, however, rammed into the wrong building, missing the main chancery, and only a quarter of the cannisters ignited. \u201cIf everything had gone off, this place would have been a parking lot,\u201d an American diplomat told me at the time.\nOver the next few hours, five other bombs went off in Kuwait City, including one at the French Embassy. The impact unbolted a large crystal chandelier above the ambassador\u2019s desk that missed his head by inches. Suicide bombers also struck the control tower of Kuwait International Airport, the living quarters for American employees at Raytheon, Kuwait\u2019s largest oil refinery, and its main power station. Badreddine is credited with the idea of attacking multiple sites at the same time\u2014a tactic later adopted by Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and others.\nBadreddine didn\u2019t get away with the Kuwait bombings. He and twenty others were caught, and seventeen were convicted. A Kuwait court sentenced him to death, but the sentence wasn\u2019t carried out, and he proved as dangerous in prison as at large.\nBadreddine, a Lebanese Shiite, worked closely with Mughniyah, who was his cousin as well as his brother-in-law. (Mughniyah married Saada, Badreddine\u2019s sister.) They first trained together under Fatah, Yasir Arafat\u2019s wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization. They were then among the early recruits for a new Shiite movement fostered by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards after Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon.\nAfter Badreddine was sentenced, Mughniyah launched a spate of attacks to pressure Kuwait to free him. They included at least three commercial hijackings. The seizure of Kuwait Air"}
{"idx": "21047", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Back in the \u201970s, I used to expect the government to suffer a financial collapse at which time it would have to quit doing most of the things it\u2019s doing because it would run out of money. That isn\u2019t what has happened. Instead of cutting spending it has printed more money and tried to increase taxes on various things.\nLike many things historical, there\u2019s a precedent for this. There\u2019s a proverbial saying that \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day,\u201d but it didn\u2019t collapse in a day either. Probably most of the Romans who lived as the Empire was collapsing didn\u2019t realize that was what was happening, but plenty of them realized they weren\u2019t living in the good old days.\nOne such person was a man named Salvian, sometimes called Salvian the Presbyter. He wrote a treatise that is called in English The Governance Of God or De gubernatione Dei in Latin*. Its original title was On The Present Judgment and it is well worth reading to see how things played out then and probably always will. His purpose was to show that the then current problems were caused by moral collapse, excessive taxation and a greedy and conniving landed class, not an abandonment of the old pagan religion. Julian the Apostate who had made the opposite argument 70 or so years before, had tried to re-institute paganism and even tried to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, presumably because it wasn\u2019t Christian and he liked practices such as animal sacrifice, but his efforts ended when he was killed in a war with the Persians after a short reign.\nIn making his case, Salvian left us a first-hand account of how things went to rot. One of the things he mentions over and over is how the peasant class was obliterated by oppressive taxation and how the small land owners indentured themselves to the large land owners who paid their taxes for them, but in return got their land and their labor, eventually leading to feudalism. Even after the small land owners had lost their land and become coloni \u2014 those who worked the land but did not own it \u2014 they still were liable for the tax, thus permanently indenturing them to the wealthy land owner who paid it for them.\nThe Romans had a system of permanent tax collectors called curiales. If you were born a curiale, you could not change jobs and were liable to pay any taxes you could not collect. Needless to say, this assured great diligence on the part of the curiales.\nOne of the many things Salvian mentions that is starting to be more common in the U.S., but was unheard of just a few years ago is people fleeing the Empire and renouncing their citizenship.\nJust as Washington refuses to rein in its excesses, the same was true of Rome around A.D. 450.\n\u201cThen, indeed, the authors of base pleasures feasted at will in most places, but all things were filled and stuffed to overflowing. Nobody thought of the State\u2019s expenses, nobody thought of the State\u2019s losses, because the cost was not felt. The State itself sought how it might squander what it was already scarcely able to acquire. The heaping up of wealth which had already exceeded its limit was overflowing even into trifling matters.\nIt wasn\u2019t just in fiscal matters that modern times resemble the fall of Rome. Salvian laments the obsession people had with attending American Idol the games. Rome had degenerated so far that there were 175 holidays per year, each with its state-sponsored amusements. The Roman Army had boy camp-followers instead"}

News published a speech by Chinese President Hu Jintao, delivered at an annual policy meeting of the party\u2019s Central Committee, \u201cHu: Hostile Forces Seek to Westernize, Split China\u201d (by Gillian Wong, Associated Press).\nHu said his country is in a \u201ccultural war\u201d with the West and that China must battle the \u201cinternational hostile forces\u201d behind the barrage of foreign culture, which he considers part of a strategic plot of westernizing and dividing China.\nThe announcement by Shanghai General Motors carried the header: \"Joining hands with China Film Group, Cadillac whole-heartedly supports the making of the Birth of a Party.\"\nOf interest in this respect is the involvement of some American business companies in contributing to this Chinese communist propaganda effort.\nCadillac, a division of American General Motors auto company, one of the auto companies which received federal (taxpayers\u2019?) bailout money in 2009 to avoid bankruptcy, committed itself to funding the production of a Chinese Communist Party propaganda film \u201cBirth of a Party,\u201d or \u201cThe Great Achievement of the Founding of the Party.\u201d The film commemorates the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, a political organization which has been responsible for the deaths of many millions of human beings whose only crime was that they may have disagreed with the Party.\nThe participation of the American company, which agreed to pay for the production of the Chinese communist propaganda film with the American taxpayers\u2019 money, is highly unprincipled, immoral, and disloyal and is nothing more than the appeasement of a power hostile to the United States in the name of financial gain.\nWell, the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Maoist stuff is still considered sufficiently effective for the total subordination of the brain of every Chinese. China used to be one of the most reliable slave camps for centuries.\nOn the other hand, many of today\u2019s countries cultivate freedom, not the Chinese slavery. This is what the leaders of China take into account: an old Chinese slave was reliable, in contrast to a modern inhabitant of a free country. Freedom is the worst enemy of a slave society.\nOnce upon a time every city was a slave city: all of its inhabitants were slaves except, of course, for their owners. But in those days, a slave country knew how to grow and maintain its slaves.\nToday the free countries emanate freedom via their international radio, television, the Internet, and via their artists and intellectuals traveling abroad.\nChina\u2019s rulers realize the force of the social media: China has more than 485 million Internet users, the most of any country in the world, which they consider a danger to their existence.\nRecently Chinese officials imposed tighter Internet restrictions on most microblog services as well as strict guidelines for social media sites: the users are required to register with their real names, a move likely to deter many online users. Authorities also have blocked Twitter and Facebook.\nFreedom is good for any country in the sense that it expands the human brains, which produce the best science and technology of genius, since genius requires freedom. Well, having deprived itself of freedom, a country perhaps gets rid of creative thoughts as well.\nThe older generations of the Chinese were deprived of freedom for centuries. That is, in the absence of freedom, the regime deprived them of \u201cdangerous thoughts.\u201d As a result, they may have actually been deprived of unusual, original, valuable brain cells, necessary for creativity.\nCurrent or future Chinese \u201cemperors\u201d may find a \u201cscientific\u201d way to eliminate the creative brain cells from the brains"}
{"idx": "21049", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Cloud storage and security are two concepts that many people think are exclusive. But that's not the case with IDriveSync, a cloud storage tool that puts the user in control of security.\nOnce you add files to your IDriveSync folder, they are automatically encrypted and synced to your cloud-based storage space.\nIDriveSync bills itself as a \"sync and share solution,\"and it's a good description. This software-and-service combo allows you to sync files across multiple devices, including Macs, PCs, Android, and iOS devices, and lets you share files with friends and colleagues. It also is accessible via the Web.\nOnce you install IDriveSync on your desktop, it adds an IDriveSync folder to your computer\u2014and I like that it allows you to select the folder's location. You simply drag files to that folder in order to save them to your IDriveSync account, where they will be synced across all of the devices that you use to access the service. I also like it that IDriveSync saves the 30 most recent versions of each file, so you can go back and see what changes have been made.\nIDriveSync has some handy features that anyone looking for a cloud storage service will appreciate. I like the different views that IDriveSync offers when you're browsing the content you've saved. You can browse by folder and file name, or you can use the Timeline view, which allows you to browse files chronologically, by the date they were updated. And with any photos that you've saved, you can choose to view them individually or using the Gallery view, which arranges them on a black background for a better look.\nI also like the \"Out of Box\" feature, which allows you to save files to the cloud without first transferring them to your IDriveSync folder. This feature allows you to save files or folders directly to the cloud, where they will be stored until you need them\u2014not synced across your multiple devices. This feature is handy for any data you don't need to access or update frequently.\nIDriveSync makes it easy to share files, and encrypts everything you share.\nBut where IDriveSync really distinguishes itself is on security. All of the data you store in your IDriveSync account is automatically encrypted, and you can select the level of encryption. By default, IDriveSync uses 256-bit AES encryption for storing and transferring data. If you want to go above and beyond, you can opt for private encryption, where you set the encryption key yourself. With this option, IDriveSync does not have access to the key, which offers an extra level of security\u2014but it also means that if you forget your encryption key, your data is gone forever, as the company cannot help you recover it.\nYou select your encryption level when you set up your account, and you cannot change this option once it's selected, so it's best to choose carefully.\nThe security offered by IDriveSync will appeal to users who have concerns about services like Dropbox, which has suffered from well-publicized security pitfalls. And IDriveSync's offering is more complete than what you get from Boxcryptor. That service lets you add an encrypted folder to a cloud storage service you already use, like Dropbox or Google Drive, but it's not a storage service on its own, and it doesn't offer the private key-level encryption that IDriveSync does. IDriveSync offers both storage and security in one, and it does so with an added level of security that its rivals don't offer.\nIDriveSync offers both storage and security in one, and it does so with an added level of security that its"}

Yet despite being widely documented as ineffective and demotivating, the annual review remains a continued practice with changes over the years made only to the format and tone.\nWhat it really needs is an actual overhaul.\nToday\u2019s reality is that, for the first time in history, any given company may have multiple generations working alongside each other, with millennials influencing as much change on policy and procedures as their boomer predecessors did.\nThese differences bring their own challenges, especially when older workers may find themselves reporting to someone younger. In addition, the increased pace of modern business has led to new and rapidly changing roles, making the traditional annual review an antiquated exercise, at best.\nThanks to the digital age we have all come to expect instant responses. And having grown up in an era of \u201cinstant gratification\u201d from social media, instant messaging and text, millennials and their younger counterparts are especially more likely than older workers to require constant feedback and more frequent check-ins.\nWhile managers have long been encouraged to provide regular feedback and periodic check-ins, what actually makes feedback meaningful is when it\u2019s given in a timely manner. Employees benefit more from in-the-moment praise for a successful achievement, while immediate coaching for a \u201cteachable moment\u201d provides a stronger learning opportunity, regardless of age.\nA more formal structure may include a weekly or monthly meeting with each employee to discuss their progress, performance and their developmental needs. Other programs may be less formal but, in all cases, they should keep to the spirit of frequent and regular \u201ccoaching\u201d rather than evaluating, with the focus being on the employee and what they need to succeed.\nWhile all generations value communication, each has a different opinion on what is the best way to communicate. For example, older employees tend to prefer face-to-face interaction while young people tend to favour digital communication.\nGenerally speaking, preferences should be taken into consideration, but when it comes to performance-related communication, this is still best done face-to-face (or video conference calls for remote workers).\nMost employees appreciate a tangible expression of their worth to the company, demonstrated by your time and full attention. This also helps provide more certainty that feedback was clearly received through body language and other visual cues that could provide useful positive \u2013 or even negative \u2013 insight.\nThat said, feedback should never flow in one direction only. Managers need to build trust with two-way dialogue that encourages the exchange of candid feedback, so employees feel comfortable sharing ideas. Save the digital communication for sending out timely meeting summaries and confirmation of next steps.\nJust because something was always done a certain way doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how it has to be done now. There\u2019s a new kid on the block, literally. Compared with older generations, who were more concerned with tenure and loyalty, millennials are more likely to change employers often and therefore will want specific feedback that relates to their career progression.\nSo, while \u201chow you can help the company\u201d may resonate with older workers, it means little to the younger ones. In this case, think about how you can shift the conversation to opportunities for growth and development and demonstrate how they can achieve their career objectives.

Opposition to the designation, which was officially announced on Dec. 11, extends well beyond groups ideologically sympathetic to Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s radical goals. After more than 40,000 deaths, the starvation and torture of many, and the sadistic tactics of the Assad regime, Syrians now want the fall of the regime more than ever \u2014 even if that means temporarily embracing groups with suspect long-term goals.\nThe Barack Obama administration\u2019s designation of Jabhat al-Nusra asserts that the group is an extension of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) \u2014 merely one of the terrorist organization\u2019s aliases. Whether this is the case or whether the administration is issuing the designation as part of a political effort to convince the opposition to shun Jabhat al-Nusra, the move will likely fail to marginalize the group at this juncture. Following the fall of the regime, however, it could help sideline the most destructive influences trying to gain a foothold in post-Assad Syria.\nThe reaction among anti-Assad Syrians was perhaps best captured by an image that appeared on Facebook shortly after news of the planned designation broke last week. In the picture, residents of the northwestern town of Kafr Anbel hold up a poster showing Obama pointing accusingly toward a flag associated with Jabhat al-Nusra, saying \"Terrorism.\" Behind the U.S. president, however, is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad standing triumphant on a pile of murdered Syrian civilians.\nThe image reflects the reality that the Syrian opposition simply does not view Jabhat al-Nusra as the primary threat to the country \u2014 that designation still belongs to Assad\u2019s murderous army. Nor is it lost on Syrians that the Obama administration has provided scant military assistance in their efforts to topple the regime \u2014 but is now singling out a rebel group that has become perhaps their revolution\u2019s most effective fighting force. This is a view that seems to extend well beyond Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s ideological milieu: None of the individuals in the Kafr Anbel picture, for example, look like Islamists or Salafis.\nIslamists, of course, have also condemned the Obama administration\u2019s decision. The popular Islamist group Suqur al-Sham (\"the Falcons of Greater Syria\") \u2014 a more mainstream faction \u2014 released a statement from its leader Ahmad \u2018Issa al-Shaykh on Dec. 9 rejecting the designation. The Islamist group stressed the importance of unity and cohesion between the different rebel factions and emphasized that Jabhat al-Nusra is like any other brigade working to overthrow the Assad regime. Shaykh refers to Assad\u2019s army as the real terrorists in Syria, and concludes with a reminder of U.S. \"crimes\" in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nOpposition to the designation is only gaining momentum within Syria\u2019s anti-Assad groups.

{"idx": "21064", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Database myths and legends (Part 7) In this series we're looking at the myths and legends of the database world; some turn out to be true, others false. This myth is about why we use OLAP.\nIf you follow the Inmon model, you use a relational data warehouse for flexibility and OLAP cubes in the data marts for the speed. On the other hand, if you follow Kimball, you simply use OLAP in the core data warehouse. Either way, OLAP is where you get the incredible query response time that we need for a good Business Intelligence system. So OLAP is all about speed.\nOK, let's get back to basics for a moment. OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing, was originally very well defined, and is a surprisingly new term. It first appeared a mere 14 years ago, in a paper entitled Providing OLAP to User-Analysts: An IT Mandate by E F Codd, S B Codd and C T Salley, ComputerWorld , July 26 1993.\nWhile Codd never directly says OLAP systems should be fast, he is clearly very interested in their performance (see rule 4). In addition, almost all OLAP systems do provide a phenomenal increase in performance over relational systems. So we can argue from this that the myth is true: OLAP is about performance.\nBut it is clear from reading the paper that Codd also sees the multi-dimensional component of OLAP as essential. Early on in the paper he says: \"This...multi-dimensional conceptual view appears to be the way most business persons naturally view their enterprise.\" And, as you can see, four of the 12 rules directly refer to dimensions, so OLAP is also about the way users think about, and are allowed to visualise, their data.\nWe know that speed is important to OLAP, but exactly how important is this multi-dimensional aspect?\nOne easy test of the importance of a property to the definition of an object is to imagine the object minus that property. Does it remain essentially the same object without the property or does the loss turn it into something else? Is a robin without a red breast still a robin? Are Christians who loses their faith still Christians? Is OLAP without multi-dimensionality still OLAP?\nWell, imagine a relational data warehouse that is magically very, very fast. Users can perform any query they like against it and expect a response time of one second. Would this still be OLAP? We can be certain that the answer here is \"no\" for the simple reason that there is no need for a new term like OLAP to describe this; what we have here is simply a very fast relational database. Apart from the speed, it will suffer all the joys and pains of normal relational databases. It will be very flexible (it puts no constraints on the queries that can be posed) but the users will still find it very difficult to query because, in order to formulate the query, they have to understand the data structure. Experience suggests that business users find this very difficult.\nSo, OLAP without the multi-dimensional structure isn't OLAP. This is true in the real world of 2007 and it was also true in Codd's original definition of OLAP. In the paper he says: \"OLAP is the name given to the dynamic enterprise analysis required to create, manipulate, animate, and synthesise information from exegetical, contemplative, and formulaic data analysis models.\" In other words, OLAP is more about the data model"}

The new commander in chief will face pressure from foreign entities looking to embarrass them early on, just as U.S. government agencies jockey for position within the new administration, she said.\nCyberwarfare between Russia and the U.S. will escalate, and the U.S. government will respond in 2017, said DeMartine.\nU.S. intelligence officials have blamed Russia for the hacking of Democratic National Committee servers and subsequent leaks of sensitive information timed to interfere with the U.S. election.

Missed payments: A bill or credit card payment can easily be put aside and forgotten until the due date passes. Not only will this cost you late charges, it can also trigger universal default on your credit cards that instantly raises their interest rates to the most expensive levels.\n2. Overdrawing accounts: If you don't know how much money is in your checking or savings account because you haven't balanced either recently, you increase the chances of accidentally overdrawing one of the accounts and having to pay overdraft fees.\n3. Frequent ATM stops: Knowing the amount of money that you will need during the week or on a particular day will help ensure that you have enough on you when you go about your daily activities.

Missed opportunities: Knowing what you are going to need in the future gives you time to research and find the best price on the item. If you are forced to purchase something at the last minute, chances are you will pay a lot more for it. If you plan ahead knowing that you need a new barbeque for the summer, you can look for a good deal and likely get it on sale. But if you end up realizing you need a barbeque a few days before a party, you are going to have to pay whatever the current price is at your local retailer.\n5. Purchasing unneeded items: You can often have items in your house, but not know exactly where they are located. Or you may have completely forgotten that you had already purchased something, since your closet or a cabinet is cluttered. Not knowing where items are located can result in you thinking you need something you already have -- and wasting money.\n6. Return trips to the store: If you go shopping without a list and try to remember what you need as you walk down the store aisles, there's a good chance that you will accidentally forget something. If the item happens to be important, you are going to have to make another trip to the store -- wasting both the cost of gas and your time.\n7. Rebates: There are a lot of opportunities to save money with rebate offers, but you have to actually follow through with the entire process. That means having your receipt, the rebate form, the proof of purchase seal and anything else you are required to submit sent in by a certain date. It's not difficult to do, but it does take a bit of organization. This can mean several hundred dollars saved off your purchase of computers and other electronics if you are organized enough to follow through.\n8. Emergency purchases: Much like having to go and purchase a forgotten item, an emergency purchase is when you have to purchase something that you thought you had but don't -- or can't find.

This is supposedly based on a report by the the head of the Indonesian Institute of Volcanology and Mitigation of Natural Disasters that has raised the alert status at 17 volcanoes from 1 to 2. Now, as Chris Rowan from Highly Allochthonous pointed out in a tweet, these volcanoes are not likely any more \"ready to erupt\" than they were last year. However, as with any random distribution of events, sometimes the said events will appear to \"cluster\", like the activity currently in Indonesia. You can see a great map of the alert status of all the Indonesian volcanoes here - but my guess is that what this might reflect is better monitoring on the part of Institute of Volcanology and Mitigation of Natural Disasters rather than a volcanopocalypse.\nVolcanoes on Enceladus: Now, to take our focus from, well, Earth, I saw this great image this morning of 4 plumes on Saturn's moon Enceladus taken by the Cassini probe. These plumes are products of the abundant cryovolcanism on the moon - where water and other volatile materials are erupted much the same as ash is on Earth. In a sense, they are \"super geysers\" that form from the melting of the icy material inside Enceladus and the source of the heat is likely the tidal energy on the moon from Saturn.\nThe plumes of Kamchatka: Back on Earth, the NASA Earth Observatory posted a new image of two Russian volcanoes and their plumes - specifically Shiveluch (towards the top) and Kluichevskoi (aka Klyuchevskaya; at the bottom). I recently talked about the source of the abundant volcanism on Kamchatka, and the peninsula just keeps chugging along.\nTop left: Gamalama volcano in Indonesia, one of the volcanoes \"ready to erupt\" according to the Jakarta Globe."}

As long as you're OK with ads.\nIt's now cheaper than ever to stream Hulu originals like The Handmaid's Tale.\nThe price of streaming TV is changing all the time, and Hulu's latest price adjustments are bringing the price up... and also down.\nIt all depends on which flavor of Hulu you want to subscribe to.\nHulu's $2 price drop for its cheapest plan, which offers Hulu's on-demand catalog of network and cable shows and movies as well as Hulu originals such as The Mindy Project and The Handmaid's Tale, matches the $2 price increase just instituted by Netflix on its most popular plan, the one with HD video quality and two simultaneous streams. It went up from $11 per month to $13 in the US.\nOne big difference between the two? Hulu's cheapest plan makes you watch ads while Netflix is entirely ad-free. To get the ad-free version of Hulu you'll have to pony up twice as much: $12 per month.\nHulu's live TV plan offers a slate of national and local channels designed to replace traditional cable TV -- and also includes the entire Hulu on-demand library including the ads. It follows price changes at competitors too. Last year all of the major live TV streamers bumped up the prices of their cheapest plans, including Sling TV (now $25), DirecTV Now, YouTube TV (both now $40) and PlayStation Vue (now $45).\nThe Hulu price changes go into effect Feb. 26.\nThe $6 price matches some past promotions, including during several months in 2018. They typically lasted for a year before reverting to the standard $8 price. Hulu's best promotional price, however, offered the service for $1 per month for a year last Black Friday.\nPrice drops and promotions often coincide with increased subscriber counts, and like every other streaming service, Hulu is striving to catch up to the \"big N.\" Hulu recently announced an increase of 8 million subscribers across all of its devices in 2018, bringing its total subscriber base to 25 million. That total still lags far behind Netflix, which had 137 million members worldwide at the end of September.\nWhat we know about the Disney+ streaming service: It's getting ready to rival Netflix."}
{"idx": "21082", "prompt": "Continue the following text: If you've been anywhere near the internet over the weekend, you've probably already heard of Bandersnatch, even if you haven't watched it. Netflix dropped the new interactive addition to the Black Mirror universe on Friday, and to say it's been trending would be an understatement. But what's all the fuss about? And what is an \"interactive movie\" anyway? We took a straw poll in The National's office of the questions preying on the minds of those who haven't yet seen the film or become part of the Bandersnatch fan club. If you're still in the dark too, hopefully their questions can also answer some of yours.\nBe warned, there may be some mild spoilers ahead, but we've kept it minimal.\nBandersnatch is the new episode of Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones\u2019 dystopian sci-fi drama Black Mirror. It comes not in the form of a traditional episode of the show, but an \u201cinteractive movie.\u201d That means that, much like the Choose Your Own Adventure storybooks of yore, every three to five minutes, viewers are given a decision to make on where the storyline goes next. If you choose to follow path a, you\u2019ll head down an avenue that leads to decisions c or d. Choose path b and you\u2019ll head for options e and f.\nIt\u2019s a sprawling narrative tree that Netflix claims has a total of over a trillion story permutations. That sounds unbelievable, but it\u2019s actually not as incredible as it sounds. If every single dual option leads to a further dual option, a mere five decisions would already lead to almost 4.3 billion branches in the story. Maths aside, viewers make their decisions by using their mouse, laptop trackpad, or smart TV remote, leading eventually to one of five possible endings.\nOn Netflix, on a compatible device. Netflix hasn\u2019t issued a comprehensive list of which devices are and are not compatible. What we do know is that Apple TV and Chromecast are not compatible, and nor are \u201csome older smart TVs,\u201d PlayStation Vita or Nintendo Wii U. Laptops and home computers with the latest version of Netflix should be compatible, as well as newer smart TVs, Android and iOS devices.\nIf your device is not compatible, you\u2019ll see a video telling you this when you try to watch. If your device is compatible, you\u2019ll see a star icon at the top right of the screen when you access the Bandersnatch title page. As a usual Apple TV viewer, I can confirm that Apple TV does not support Bandersnatch, but also that viewing on a Macbook and air streaming to Apple TV is fine, so you can still watch on your TV, you just need to use your Macbook trackpad to control your decisions.\nBandersnatch puts viewers in control of computer programmer Stefan, who, in 1984, is struggling to adapt a huge, sprawling Choose Your Own Adventure novel into a computer game as well as struggling with plenty of inner demons of his own. Along the way he becomes obsessed with the notions of free will, pre-determination of fate, and simultaneous timelines and basically goes a little bit crazy, or a lot crazy, depending on the decisions you make for him.\nHow long do you have to make your choices? What happens if you don\u2019t choose?\nYou have 10 seconds to make each decision within the film. If you don\u2019t choose, the film will choose for you, and the makers have programmed a version of the narrative that will carry the story through from beginning to an ending with no viewer interaction"}

Hafizur's body was handed over to his family after an autopsy.\nSaiful Islam, works manager at the workshop, said Hafizur was working on top of the pole, connected to a traverser (a sideways-moving platform for transferring a railway vehicle from one set of rails to another parallel set). While working, he got electrocuted and fell on the iron platform around 11:30am.\nMeanwhile, agitating workers placed a five-point demand that included compensating Hafizur's family, hiring an adult member of the family to his post, maintaining proper work schedule in the workshop, providing workers with adequate safety gears and ensuring risk allowance and payment of overtime.\nSeeking anonymity, a protesting worker told The Daily Star that workshop authorities hid the evidence and took the body to hospital in secret. He alleged that Hafizur did not have any safety belt and helmet on.\nHe even had to climb up the pole as no ladder was available.\nVisiting the workshop, this correspondent saw that the spot where Hafizur fell was covered with sand and there was no sign of accident.\nFM Mohiuddin, divisional superintendent of the workshop, refuted the allegations. \u201cIt was an accident. We did not intend to spoil or hide evidence.

{"idx": "21085", "prompt": "Continue the following text: What does it feel like to be hungry?\nLike no other holiday, we equate Thanksgiving with food. We sit down with family and friends to enjoy a hearty meal and express our gratitude. Turkey is a mainstay for Thanksgiving meals - annually, 46 million turkeys are eaten the fourth Thursday of November.\nIn keeping with the holiday spirit, tens of thousands of turkeys are donated to hungry Americans. In fact, my organization distributes more than 22,000 turkeys each Thanksgiving to local soup kitchens, food pantries and social services agencies.\nAlthough turkey is essential to Thanksgiving, I'd argue that the oven is the real star of the show. Without an oven, there's no pumpkin pie, no green bean casserole, no stuffing - and no turkey. On Thanksgiving, the oven works overtime, churning out comfort foods and filling the kitchen with tantalizing aromas.\nTry to imagine a Thanksgiving with no oven.\nWhen I was homeless, I was one of the 41 million Americans who struggle with hunger on a daily basis. I lived on New York City streets, in foster homes and homeless shelters. One Thanksgiving, I received a donated turkey - a thoughtful, generous gift, for which I was grateful. My shelter, however, didn't have an oven where I could roast my dinner. Ultimately, I cut meat off the turkey bones, boiling it in a small pot on a hot plate - my only cooking appliance.\nThe idea is it's much easier for someone to deal with health or addiction issues if they have a home.\nThe generosity of the donated turkey was tempered by the indignity I felt as a hungry person, scrambling to find any possible way to prepare my Thanksgiving meal.\nAs president and CEO of the country's largest food bank, my life has come full circle. Today, I work to provide food for the nearly 1 million hungry people in New Jersey.\nAs a formerly food-insecure individual, and as head of an anti-hunger organization, I'm grateful every day for thoughtful, kindhearted donors. Our supporters, from grocery stores to community members, contribute much-needed in-kind and financial gifts which are used to help feed hungry neighbors.\nBut the reality is that food donations don't alleviate hunger if they're not suited to recipients' needs.\nFood insecurity goes beyond just having an empty pantry or fridge. It may mean not having access to kitchen appliances, tools or other resources to prepare certain types of food. This lack of access - often unseen by those who have never experienced hunger firsthand - can affect how and when your generous food donations reach the people who need it most.\nThis holiday season, please consider how your contributions to food banks can go farthest. Non-perishable, high-protein items are desirable; they have a long shelf life, are often nutrient-rich and can be easily prepared in microwaves or on hot plates. If you're able, contribute your energy through volunteering to sort, pack and distribute in-kind donations.\nIf your budget allows, consider making a financial contribution, which has the greatest flexibility to meet a nonprofit's needs to fulfill its mission.\nAnd when you gather around your Thanksgiving table, ready to enjoy that roast turkey and express gratitude - pledge to pay it forward for those who are not only hungry, but who don't have an oven.\nDebra Vizzi is President and CEO of the Community FoodBank of New Jersey."}

Both teams are currently in the bottom five in scoring defense, with UConn dead last giving up 51.4 points per game and the Minutemen surrendering 42.3.\nWith a high scoring affair a possibility, UMass may be forced to do so without starting quarterback Andrew Ford, who suffered a leg injury during Saturday\u2019s loss to Coastal Carolina. That would thrust senior Ross Comis into the starting job, who has thrown for 601 yards and six touchdowns this season, while also rushing in for three scores.\nLast week against Coastal, the Minutemen struggled to get the ground game going, rushing for just 63 yards on 22 carries. With starter Marquis Young expected to return from injury, UMass should have the weapons available to exploit a vulnerable Husky run defense that has allowed opponents to average eight yards per carry.\nIn the loss to the Chanticleers, UMass saw a breakout game from wide receiver Sadiq Palmer. The 6-foot-2 junior hauled in seven catches for 139 yards and a touchdown, taking some of the pressure off of Andy Isabella, who is currently leading the country in receiving yards with 1,013.\nWith Palmer\u2019s size and Isabella\u2019s quickness, the two are able to complement each other well. Going against a weak UConn defense should give the pair plenty of opportunities to get the ball and make plays with it afterwards.\nThe loss to Coastal saw UMass put together one of its stronger performances on the defensive side of the ball, but it still wasn\u2019t good enough as it surrendered a big passing play in the third quarter off a broken coverage.\nBig plays have plagued the Minutemen all season long, and they will be looking to put together a full 60 minutes of defense against a Husky offense that has scored just 21 points a game so far this year.\nKickoff is set for 12 o\u2019clock in East Hartford on Saturday."}

A malicious HTML page exploiting the hole could easily be circulated via e-mail.\nAnother issue resides in code that processes session files, which enable HyperTerminal users to specify parameters such as the connection method and the destination host, Microsoft says.\nThus if a user opened a maliciously-crafted session file, it too would trigger the buffer overrun.\nBecause the flaw is specific to the utility, not the OS, an exploit can easily be developed to attack all Win machines running HyperTerminal without individual modifications for the several flavors of Windows in circulation.\nWindows 98, 98SE, ME, NT, and 2K are all vulnerable, though in the case of 2K, HyperTerminal is not automatically installed as the default client.\nSince Win95 is no longer supported, we're uncertain whether its edition of HT is affected, but chances are it's vulnerable too.

{"idx": "21098", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Reaching education goals in the coming years will require sharp increases in funding and better delivery. Despite a global focus on improving access to education, nearly 60 million children in developing countries remain out of primary school and increased investments have not translated to better education quality or improved learning outcomes (UNESCO 2015a). Even with an increase in domestic public expenditure, UNESCO estimates that the financing gap for delivering good quality universal education from pre-school through junior secondary levels by 2030 in low-income countries will be $10.6 billion, on average, between 2015 and 2030\u2014over four times the level currently provided by official donors ($2.3 billion) (UNESCO 2015b).\nClosing acute financing and delivery gaps that prevent access to quality education will be a major challenge, requiring all hands on deck. Domestic governments and foreign donors will need to step up their game substantially, but fiscal and capacity constraints are likely to prevent them remedying resource deficits on their own in the short term. Non-state actors\u2014mainly religious and charitable organizations, private (\u201cfoundation\u201d) schools, and a small number of for-profit schools\u2014are already partially filling the gaps, although the precise extent of their services and their impact is unknown.\nDetermining the appropriate role of non-state actors in education is a contentious topic among specialists. Disagreements have revolved around serious normative issues, including such basic questions as whether non-state provision is consistent with the principle of education as a human right, and serious empirical questions relating to quality and equity implications. This discussion has been blurred by definitional issues (i.e., what is non-state and private education?); lack of clarity over distinctions between ownership, delivery, and financing; a lack of accurate data on current and potential provision rates; and an insufficient base of evidence from which to draw clear conclusions on the effectiveness of non-state engagement in education. These problems have made it difficult to generate comparisons across empirical studies, leading to significant variation in the interpretation of evidence. For some observers, evidence has fueled concern that non-state education is violating human rights principles (e.g., the report by the United Nations Rapporteur on Education),1 while for others it has provided encouragement that non-state engagement can help address financing and delivery challenges (e.g., Tooley 2009).\nOur goal is to provide a neutral background to this debate and identify areas of common ground. Beginning with some big picture facts, this paper develops a detailed language around non-state actors in education. We then outline current issues and poles of debate around engagement of non-state actors in education and provide an assessment of the depth of available data and evidence. To close, we establish a typology and propose a framework for discussions around the role of non-state actors in basic education and how these actors can best contribute to the achievement of Education for All and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our paper refers largely to basic education, including pre-primary, primary, and lower-secondary, as this is the main focus of much recent discussion around the role of non-state actors in education and an area of strong growth in developing countries."}

Another hoop by Pratt brought the deficit to seven before MCS's Jeremiah Worthem scored just before the end of the third quarter to push the lead back to nine.\nBut Taylor opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer - the Leopards' only field goal from the perimeter all afternoon - and Pratt added an old-fashioned 3-point play.

I had to finish.\"\nTaylor had seven of his nine points in the second half, and he and Pratt (15 in the second half) scored all but four of the Leopards' points after halftime. He also had two assists, a block and a steal before fouling out late.\nTaylor actually shot the best of the mostly cold-shooting Leopards, making four of his nine field-goal attempts.\nThe disappointment was clear in Taylor's voice after the game. He felt satisfied, however, that he and his teammates gave their all.\n\"We've been through a lot,\" Taylor said. \"We overcame a lot of disappointing losses this season, and to come here and lose on the big stage, it's tough. But I think we had the best season we could have.\"\nWhile the Leopards will lose four of five players who were in the starting lineup at the end of the season - Pratt, Taylor, Sharron Moreland-Jones and Jevar Smith - but they also will have a solid foundation returning.\nChief among the players who will return is Devontae Watson, the 6-foot-10 center who already has several Division I scholarship offers.

The ADL claims that by allowing Al-Manar to register a domain and by allowing it to \u201cquickly move its site from one host computer to another\u201d, eNom is aiding a terrorist organization.

This may be an uphill battle for a president who's been in office for only 10 months.\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey of global attitudes toward Trump in 37 countries released in June, a median of just 22 percent had confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. That was down sharply from the final year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency when a median of 64 percent of those polled expressed confidence in the American leader.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for Trump. He was more popular than Obama in at least two of the 37 nations polled by Pew \u2014 Russia and Israel. In Russia, confidence in the U.S. president jumped from a low of 11 percent in 2015 to a high of 53 percent, according to Pew.\nA question now for the U.S., as Trump stamps his imprint on the country\u2019s image abroad, is not only how the world\u2019s adults perceive him, but how a generation of children \u2014 the leaders of tomorrow \u2014 view America and its leader.\nIn the absence of an objective measure of children's views, NBC News conducted its own unscientific survey in nine countries around the world: China, South Korea, Russia, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Poland.\nNBC News reporters interviewed approximately 50 people \u2014 males and females, aged five to 20, as well as parents and teachers \u2014 and asked them how they viewed the U.S. president. In addition, in Beijing, 52 students, aged 12 and 13, replied to an anonymous survey.\nIn some countries, such as Egypt, Iraq and Russia, children said they didn\u2019t discuss politics much and didn\u2019t have much of an opinion on Trump. In Israel, no parents or children would go on the record regarding how they view the American leader. In other places, such as South Korea, China and the occupied West Bank, kids had plenty to say. Some viewed the American leader as an object of both ridicule and fear, while others expressed admiration for the former businessman-turned-president.\nMany mentioned watching videos of Trump on YouTube \u2014 in particular, a wrestling video he retweeted of himself mockingly punching a figure with a CNN logo over its face. Others expressed a lack of confidence in the American leader because he has said that he doesn\u2019t believe in climate change and that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.\nIn Seoul, some young people expressed concern over Trump\u2019s seemingly flip use of words at times.

As the field general for \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d he created a sprawling modern classic, and for \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d he pioneered new technologies \u2014 whether we wanted them or not.\nBut \u201cThey Shall Not Grow Old\u201d will stand as one of Jackson\u2019s most remarkable achievements. Asked by London\u2019s Imperial War Museum to create a documentary film out of a vast trove of World War I footage, he has assembled a unique and haunting testament.\nThe film consists of that footage (as well as magazine illustrations and posters created at the time), but rendered in a new way. No purist, Jackson uses all the digital tools at his disposal to colorize the film, add voices and sound effects, and generally try to make the ghosts on screen come to life.\nJust to give the material an extra dollop of you-are-there immediacy, it\u2019s in 3D, too.\nFilms made between 1914-1918 were in black and white and had no sound recorded, so this is a big job. Also, silent films were recorded at variable speeds, which is why when you see silent films they sometimes have a herky-jerky rhythm. Jackson has managed to smooth that out, with movements and facial expressions easy to perceive.\nBy lip-reading some of the people onscreen, dialogue has been added. We hear the booming of the cannons and the crack of rifle fire, especially during one sequence that approximates the horror of battle.\nThe film does not identify places or people. The intention is to chronicle the war experience, not distinguish between battles \u2014 it\u2019s less educational than immersive.\nAccompanying this revived footage is a soundtrack of soldiers\u2019 voices, mostly recorded in the 1960s and \u201870s. These recollections are constant, and they take us from the early enthusiasm of young British men (one says he went happily to war thinking, \u201cIn six months, it\u2019ll be all over and Bob\u2019s your uncle\u201d) to the grim details of dealing with rats, lice, and the smell of corpses in the muddy trenches.\nExcept for footage of captured German soldiers, we are focused on the British, and their experiences in Belgium and France. There was much more to the war, but evidently this is the material that Jackson had at his disposal.\nAs someone staunchly against colorization and wary of fiddling with historical footage, I think there\u2019s an argument to be had about not making this kind of thing a habit. But Jackson appears to have been cautious in his methods.\nWhen you see bright orange poppies growing in the green fields of death, the First World War becomes newly vivid. If \u201cThey Shall Not Grow Old\u201d helps keep this global disaster from becoming a museum piece, it\u2019s worth it.\nPeter Jackson creates a fascinating documentary from World War I footage, using digital technologies of colorization and 3D to make the films breath in a new way. The film is less educational than immersive, and the remarkable footage is accompanied by recordings of WWI veterans\u2019 voice, recorded during the 1960s and 70s."}

Government uses this money to provide public goods; streets are an example. Everyone agrees that street management is a necessary and proper role for government.\nIn Corpus Christi, spending on existing street programs is approximately $35 million per year. It is likely that this number will grow by an additional $10 million to $20 million as a new, residential street reconstruction program is implemented.\nOrdinary people and businesses pause from time to time to evaluate if their own money is spent wisely. This is especially true when considering a large, new purchase.\nConversely, government does not generally evaluate its spending \u2014 because it is your money, not theirs. There is one exception, when the people come together to demand information and accountability from government.\nThe history of street spending in Corpus Christi is not good. Delays in the bond programs. Cost overruns. Hidden underinvestment leading to failed streets.\nIf we want a different outcome, then we must have a different process and probably a different culture. This is particularly necessary at this time, as the city is about to ask the citizens for a lot of new money and the amount of street projects is likely to grow by 30 percent.\nThe City Council has empowered independent citizens to form a street committee on which I am one of nine members. Now is the time to fix underlying problems, put the past behind us, and to start with a clean slate to avoid repeating mistakes from the past.\nWhen one plans for the street reconstruction program, it is valid to look at the existing street maintenance program to get an understanding of the way the city does business. These programs primarily differ only to the degree of construction on a particular street. However, most other processes are comparable, including contracting, planning, budgeting, information sharing, and accountability, among other processes. Understanding the current situation is a necessary precursor for improving it.\nMost people agree that there is too little information being shared with the public about the current spending on the streets. We must fix this with regard to existing street programs, so people have confidence that money is spent wisely before considering government demands for more money and new street programs.\nCurrent street spending includes city staff, outside consultants, systems, materials, contractors, and overhead, among other items. What is the spending mix among these categories? \u2014 hard to tell. Is productivity for each of these spending categories measured and managed? \u2014 Unsure. How much road gets reconstructed or maintained per dollar spent? \u2014 hard to tell. Are street work activities grouped into understandable projects so work plans, budgets, and contractor bids minimize costs? \u2014 don't know.\nThis is not an effort to find problems within the city departments in order to assign blame. This is an effort to evaluate if the city has good procedures to avoid problems in their entirety, or at least avoid repeating problems.\nIf city accountability is strong, then the committee should present its findings in detail to the public and the City Council. It will build trust. If city accountability is weak, then the committee should present its findings in detail to the public and City Council, and the city should fix it. It will build trust.\nI hope that city staff, consultants, contractors, the City Council, and the committee embrace this opportunity to get it right. We are all on the same team.\nThe committee will not and cannot impose any solution. The committee only facilitates change, because any improvements and the implementation must come consensually from within the system.

The app you have been working on for months is built, tested, deployed, and ready to welcome its first users; and more importantly, start bringing in some ROI. Unfortunately, making money with a mobile app is not as easy as it seems.\nAccording to the 9th Developer Economics report, more than half of all existing apps generate $500 or less in monthly revenue, while 19% of apps don\u2019t bring in any revenue at all. Only 4% of mobile applications bring their developers $500k+ monthly.\nIf you want your app to join the lucky 4% of profitable mobile apps, this article is for you. Discover app monetization strategies that really work and have your hard work get rewarded.\nFrom paid-for apps to affiliate marketing, there are many ways to monetize an app. Some of them are less efficient, and some work best for a certain type of app. But how do you choose the one that will work best for you? Here\u2019s our comprehensive guide on how to monetize apps.\nBeing probably one of the most straightforward mobile app revenue models, it implies that the user should actually buy an app in order to download and use it.\nWhile the app price can represent a certain barrier for new users, this strategy is a surefire way to get ROI.\nMost paid apps can usually be classified as utilities or productivity tools. Another popular type of paid-for app is the automotive app. Professional apps, including advanced photo/video editing tools (i.e. Afterlight), and games (i.e. Minecraft), often fall into the paid-for app category as well.\nAs follows from the listed examples, this mobile app monetization strategy works best for apps that offer unparalleled value (either pro tools and utilities, or high-quality entertaining content).The price of an app can vary depending on a number of factors. For example, the same app can come at different prices for users from different countries. However, the average price of an app is quite low (this might be due to the fact that a higher price is harder to justify).\nInteresting fact: The most expensive iOS app comes at a price of $1,399.99 while Android\u2019s highest priced app reaches only $400.\nThe freemium app business model combines free basic functionality and \u201cpremium\u201d capabilities.\nWhile the app itself is available for free (with a limited, basic set of features), there is a certain fee charged to access the app\u2019s premium content: unlock additional features and advanced capabilities, customize the app, add more integrations, or remove ads.\nThis strategy is successfully used within mobile games and SaaS products.\nThe latter usually provides \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d options at a certain cost, while basic features used by individuals come for free. A good example is Slack, a business messenger platform.\nProbably the most popular variation of the freemium model, this mobile app revenue model offers the ability to purchase some virtual goods within the app to augment the basic (usually free) app functionality.\nThis might be in-game objects (for example, Candy Crush boosters), additional features (VSCO effects or Snapchat filters) and content (stickers for messenger apps like WeChat or Viber).\nMonetization through in-app purchases works best for iOS apps. The statistics show that iOS users usually spend 2.5 times more than Android users ($1.08 vs. $0.43 on monthly in-app purchases \u2013 per user, per app).

It capped a grueling debate that locked lawmakers in argument from Wednesday morning to 5am Thursday and, after a pause for sleep, through midnight Friday.\nWhile the decisive outcome was expected given Prime Minister Enda Kenny's lopsided parliamentary majority, passage of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill did inflict damage on Mr Kenny's 2-year-old coalition government.\nCatholic conservatives vowed to drive his centrist Fine Gael party from power for violating its 2011 campaign pledge not to legislate on abortion. The government drafted the bill in response to last year's case of a miscarrying woman who died in an Irish hospital from blood poisoning nearly a week after being refused a termination. The death highlighted Ireland's failure for two decades to draft abortion legislation in support of a 1992 Supreme Court judgment ruling that life-saving abortions, including to prevent suicides, should be legal in Ireland.\nMr Kenny, meanwhile, expelled five of his 74 lawmakers from Fine Gael's parliamentary group for voting against the bill and said they couldn't seek re-election as Fine Gael candidates. Strong support for the bill came from left-wing politicians, including Mr Kenny's coalition partners in the Labour Party, who favor much easier access to abortion.\nMany lawmakers in the round-the-clock debate expressed hopes, or fears, that passage of the bill would put Ireland on a slippery slope to granting wider abortion rights, as has already happened in the rest of Europe. The island of Malta is the only other European Union member to outlaw the practice.\nDivisions ran deepest on the bill's provisions permitting an abortion for a suicidal woman if a three-doctor panel agrees she would try to kill herself if denied a termination. Anti-abortion activists warned that suicide-faking women and sympathetic doctors would exploit the rule.\nBut abortion rights lobbyists countered that such cases were rare, and even the most distressed abortion seekers would take the easier option of travelling to England, where abortion has been legal since 1967. Figures released Thursday showed that nearly 4000 Irish women traveled there for abortions last year, while many hundreds more have performed their own at home using miscarriage-inducing pills ordered over the internet.\nThe epic debate reflected Mr Kenny's determination to get the bill passed before parliament closes for summer holidays next week. The marathon took its mental toll on lawmakers, one of whom accidentally pressed the wrong button during a 5am vote to reject opposition amendments.\nAnother lawmaker, Tom Barry, grabbed a female colleague, Aine Collins, by the hips during a 3 am amendment vote and pulled her on to his lap right in the middle of the debating chamber.

{"idx": "21137", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: When you parse his Inaugural address \u2014 and watch the unmistakable prominence and power of deeper-thinking nationalists like chief strategist Steve Bannon, policy guru Stephen Miller and Attorney General-in-waiting Jeff Sessions \u2014 you see a Trump form of nationalism emerging.\nWhat Trump believes: According to advisers, Trump's core beliefs boil down to pro-America, pro-U.S. jobs, pro-strong-borders. One of those advisers told us that while Trump might not think much about philosophy or specifics, he's the perfect vehicle to carry their ideas because he has an intuitive sense of how to sell them, especially to the white working class.\nIts origin: Trump has bounced all over the place on most issues. But he has been a fairly consistent critic of trade deals, outsourcing and China. Starting several years back, Bannon, Miller and others searched for a vessel for their more fully formed version of nationalism, just as a similar wave swept across Europe. Trump embraced the notion, if not the specifics, and the inauguration speech was the advisers' victory lap. It was also Trump's fullest public embrace of it.\nIts clout in Trump White House: The true believers share views that run counter to the Paul Ryan-wing of the GOP on everything from immigration and infrastructure spending, to bullying corporations. They are anti-\"corporatists\" who want to methodically destroy conventional conservatism. The group includes Bannon, Miller, son-in-law Jared Kushner, Sessions and his top adviser, Jeff Dearborn, Peter Navarro (the head of the National Trade Council), Wilbur Ross, the longtime Trump friend and Commerce Secretary-nominee, and others. They have planted true believers throughout the White House, so the roots run deep and will soon run deeper.\nTrade: The White House is intent on slapping tariffs (or the equivalent) on imports from Mexico and other nations. Trump genuinely feels the United States gets shafted in trade deals such as NAFTA, and his team plans to use tax reform and other openings to impose penalties on imports. This is also about gaining leverage over China for all upcoming talks about currency and trade practices. Interesting subplot: We hear the House Speaker is privately referring to his tariff-like border adjustment policy \u2014 crucial to raising revenue via taxing imports \u2014 as \"responsible nationalism.\" He's speaking Bannon's language.\nInfrastructure: On trade and infrastructure in particular, many Trump aides proudly say they are closer to Bernie Sanders than Paul Ryan. Watch for a very high-profile push for huge spending on U.S. infrastructure executed by U.S. workers, using U.S. products. The Bannon wing believes minorities who benefit from this spending will open their eyes and minds to Trump's politics. This also see it as a way to jam Republican leaders into rethinking their pro-business-at-all-cost mentality.\nThe wall: Trump told us in our interview last week he will use existing law to force a fast start to building a big stretch of wall on the Mexican border. At the same time, he said he can't imagine deporting fewer illegal immigrants than President Obama did in 2016. That said, he seemed to soften his tone on deportation to put the emphasis on a wall built by U.S. workers.\nNATO: Trump and his base love attacking NATO member nations for relying on U.S. security without kicking in their fair share of troops or money. He's not likely to change NATO itself much but he will escalate"}

That Braeton murder case against those officers. When you look at the evidence, it was clear in my mind beyond a reasonable doubt, a shadow of a doubt that those officers where innocent, certainly at Braeton and everybody in the public had found them guilty.\"\nAtkinson was for a brief while Powell's lawyer before he gave up private practice after he was elected to Parliament in late 2011. However, after serving only one term as a parliamentarian, during which time he was the attorney general, Atkinson went back to private practice. He again led Powell's defence with Deborah Martin by his side. According to the veteran lawyer, the only result possible in the case was not guilty.\n\"You have to look at what the evidence is in court, and based on what the evidence was, this was the only possible outcome that they could have had. The DPP could have gone ahead and just wasted peoples time by calling witnesses when she knows it won't improve its case,\" Atkinson said.\n\"When you have a case that is based on one eyewitness, it's basically what this man wants to say. And the situation was from day one you seem to be having a problem and it seem to me that there was a problem. The first statement he gave was that he don't know who ... him don't know which car, and him don't know the shooter,\" Atkinson said.\n\"And then him change that,\" the lawyer added.\nTHE STAR asked Atkinson how his client felt to have been found not guilty.\n\"He must feel relieved.

{"idx": "21140", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Chicago Police Department has ramped up the use of its \"predictive analysis\" system to identify people it believes are likely to commit crimes. These people, who are placed on a \"heat list,\" are visited by police officers who tell them that they are considered pre-criminals by CPD, and are warned that if they do commit any crimes, they are likely to be caught.\nThe CPD defends the practice, and its technical champion, Miles Wernick from the Illinois Institute of Technology, characterizes it as a neutral, data-driven system for preventing crime in a city that has struggled with street violence and other forms of crime. Wernick's approach involves seeking through the data for \"abnormal\" patterns that correlate with crime. He compares it with epidemiological approaches, stating that people whose social networks have violence within them are also likely to commit violence.\nThe CPD refuses to share the names of the people on its secret watchlist, nor will it disclose the algorithm that put it there.\nThis is a terrible way of running a criminal justice system.\nLet's start with transparency, because that's the most obviously broken thing here. The designers of the algorithm assure us that it is considering everything relevant, nothing irrelevant, and finding statistically valid correlations that allow them to make useful predictions about who will commit crime. In an earlier era, we would have called this discrimination -- or even witchhunting -- because the attribution of guilt (or any other trait) through secret and unaccountable systems is a superstitious, pre-rational way of approaching any problem.\nThe purveyors of this technology cloak themselves in the mantel of science. The core tenet of science, the thing that distinguishes it from all other ways of knowing, is the systematic publication and review of hypotheses and the experiments conducted to validate them. The difference between a scientist and an alchemist isn't their area of study: it's the method they use to validate their conclusions.\nAn algorithm that only works if you can't see it is not science, it's a conjuring trick. My six year old can do that trick: she can make anything disappear provided you don't look while she's doing it and don't ask her to open her hands and show you what's in them. Asserting that you're doing science but you can't explain how you're doing it is a nonsense on its face.\nNow let's think about objectivity: the system that the CPD and its partners have designed purports to objectivity because it uses numbers and statistics to make its calculations. But -- transparency again -- without insight into how the system runs its numbers, we have no way of debating and validating the way it weighs different statistics. And what about those statistics? We know -- because of transparent, rigorous scholarship, and because of high-profile legal cases -- that police intervention is itself not neutral. From stop-and-search to arrest to prosecutorial zeal or discretion, the whole enterprise of crime statistics is embedded in a wider culture in which human beings with social power and representing the status quo can and do make subjective decisions about how to characterize individual acts.\nPut more simply: if cops, judges and prosecutors are more likely to give white people in rich neighborhoods in possession of cocaine an easier time than they give black people in poor neighborhoods in possession of crack (and they do), then your data-mining exercise will disproportionately weight blackness and poorness as being correlated with felonies. Garbage in, garbage out -- there's nothing objective and scientifically rigorous about using flawed data to generate flawed conclusions.\nBut even assuming that this stuff"}

An event like this is such a platform.\nHe says the cyber security space is moving so fast that many products are already outdated or made redundant by newer solutions almost as soon as they are introduced. \"Some vendors have adapted faster than others, and newer products work better and are far more effective from a ROI perspective.\"\nThe ITWeb Security Summit 2019 is an opportunity for customers to see what is happening in the cyber security world. \"It's a common point of discussion that SA is a year behind the rest of the world when it comes to implementing cutting-edge or newer, more disruptive, technologies.\"\nJacobsz says some partners in SA are a lot slower to adopt these technologies due to additional investment required, installed base and existing revenue streams. \"So it's an education process in the partner as well as the customer space. There are many businesses in SA that are on the cutting edge of technology, business processes, and are far ahead of other companies in other parts of the world.\n\"We need to assist them in implementing solutions that help them get there quicker and cheaper, and to be more competitive. This goes for all industries and solutions, not just ours.\"\nJacobsz believes one of the summit's biggest draw-cards is the formal and informal networking opportunities. \"Networks Unlimited is a distributor, so we can't sell directly to customers, but we and other cyber security companies will be there to promote new and exciting ideas, solutions and developments in the security sector.\"\nMany customers do not have the time to do as much research as they would like to, he adds. This event will provide a platform to get a holistic approach to what is happening in the industry and what is available to them.\n\"Many large system integrators will sell a product because of the margins they make, their rebates and their investment in a particular product, and not necessarily because it is the best fit for the customer. While not the case in every instance, it does happen, and I believe through the summit, customers will have an opportunity to see for themselves what is out there to assist them meet their obligations in terms of compliance, GDPR and corporate responsibilities.\""}

The virus doesn't occur naturally in Aedes aegypti \u2014 the tropical mosquitoes primarily responsible for spreading viruses such as Zika, yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya \u2014 but researchers have spent more than 10 years working to coax the bacteria into infecting that particular breed of insect in a bid to derail the diseases it carries.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Gates said the $18 million roll-out would finally test whether the concept can work.\n\"We'll know within a year, if these mosquitoes we've released, if they're becoming common amongst the population,\" he said. \"Then we'll see simply by the number of people who get sick from either Zika or dengue. If those numbers come down quite substantially in these cities but not in other cities that'll be the proof of this over a decade-long quest to use this intervention.\"\nIn a statement , the Eliminate Dengue campaign said the roll-out in Latin America follows earlier field trials in Australia, Vietnam and Indonesia as well as small-scale work in Brazil and Colombia dating back to 2014.\nZika was initially known only to cause flu-like symptoms in some people but has since attracted global concern after a surge of cases in babies born with small heads in northeast Brazil. The virus has since been linked to a birth defect known as microcephaly and become a leading public health worry.\nIn his AP interview, Gates also spoke about polio\u2014 he hopes next year will mark the last reported case of the disease \u2014 and the British exit from the European Union, which he said probably wouldn't be dramatic for U.K. science but \"could create a little bit of uncertainty and disruption.\"\nFinally, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder poured cold water on talk of a turn toward U.S. politics.\nGates, who was identified in leaked emails as being among those Hillary Clinton's campaign considered for vice president last spring, gave an emphatic \"Nope, not me\" when asked whether Americans should expect to see his name on the ballot in 2020.\n\"My full-time work for the rest of my life will be work for the foundation,\" he said."}

Getting down to the basics for spring will not, nevertheless, mean dressing poor - although that theme has a certain following in Socialist France, where Paris designers sense an atmosphere of retrenchment.\nIn America the simplification is expressed through purity of line and cut. Much is being made of modern, architectural fashion in the innovative manner of Ronaldus Shamask, a New York designer who uses soft fabrics for geometrically seamed clothes. His influence is expected to grow in the future.\nThere is also much less extraneous decoration than was given last season's lavishly embellished clothes. Fashionmakers are responding to the preference women have shown in their buying habits for fewer but better clothes by cutting back on the frills, especially when meeting costs has been a necessity.\nThe more conscientious designers uphold good standards of quality, using expensive materials with a free hand and maintaining a high grade of workmanship wherever possible. Lasting value has become a watchword for buying cheap disposable clothing is a luxury no one can afford.\nThe diversity of shapes and styles continues, but a few changes are in progress. Classic tailoring is phasing out, except for the tradition-bound areas of the business world. The blazer appears to be headed toward the same fate as the dodo. The most popular replacement is the collarless cardigan jacket.\nLiz Claiborne, whose separates are reliably fashionable and appropriate for the office, makes a cropped jacket with modified leg-o'-mutton sleeves, an indication of the direction career fashions are taking. Feminized trousers are also proliferating, and they are finding wider acceptance as a day-to-day alternative to skirts.\nAlthough length is not an issue, what may rock the fashion boat are the new ultrashort shorts and skirts, many of them gathered or flared. At the advance showings, designers sent troupes of models wearing every length imaginable out on the catwalks.\nOtherwise the news is not headline stuff. It centers around such sidebar stories as the reappearance of black and white (a simple, elegant, and time-honored combination), bright colors with white, and an outburst of vivid, clear colors.\nStripes, as bold as they come, are the domunant pattern in a season in which plain and textured fabrics outnumber prints. The so-called rugby stripe is everywhere in bright white in silks as well as cottons. Suede, handled like cotton or crepe de Chine, ranks as the prestige material.\nRalph Lauren was the advanceman for the Santa Fe vogue that is hitting the mass market with copies of American Indian concha belts and prairie skirts.

The officers then confiscated his ID, saying they needed to verify that he was an active Columbia student. Videos of the confrontation circulated widely on social media over the weekend, and students also held demonstrations condemning anti-blackness and Public Safety on Friday night and Sunday morning.\nDuring a listening session hosted by Barnard on Friday, administrators stated that the six officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave. Beilock announced in her email that an independent firm has been hired to investigate the incident, and will issue a report on the origins and escalation of the confrontation and make recommendations for future action. The report will be made public.\nThe email was the first from the Barnard administration to explicitly acknowledge the physical confrontation of McNab and disavow racism on Barnard\u2019s campus in relation to the incident, though she did not explicitly state that Public Safety\u2019s confrontation with McNab was anti-black.

In an interview with Spectator on April 12, McNab stated that he felt the rule of showing a Barnard or Columbia ID to enter Barnard\u2019s campus after 11 p.m. had been applied unequally for white students in contrast with students of color.\nConcerns around the nebulous role of Public Safety officers on campus were also raised at a recent Barnard Student Government Association meeting in March, wherein Public Safety Executive Director Antonio Gonzalez stated that Public Safety officers act as civilians on campus and have no authority over students that is comparable to that of the New York Police Department or any other police force.\nAdditionally, the college will be undertaking a review of training procedures for all Public Safety officers and supervisors with the intent of ensuring policies are enforced equally \u201cregardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or national origin\u201d while the independent investigation is ongoing.\nThe email also referenced long-term initiatives that the college is undertaking to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus, including the imminent hiring of a vice president of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and a series of open forums on inclusivity.

However, instead of celebrating his new football contract, the pro football player was busy hosting his album release party at a nightclub in Miami.\nBell\u2019s new rap album called Life\u2019s a Gamble had its release party on March 16 at Miami Beach\u2019s Rockwell Nightclub.

Her Gothic dreamlike studies are neither rooted in pure movement nor overt body language. And yet she constructs sturdy dramas of considerable impact that draw largely from formalist experiments.\nMiss Neville's imagery over the years has been clearly literary and pictorial. Her tendency is to mythologize an emotional state. We cannot quite place the legend from which the imagery descends, but we sense its mood. The air is full of mystery and menace, all the more effective because Miss Neville creates a degree of suspense through the anticipation that her riddles will eventually be solved. Sometimes they are not. Her characters usually appear to have stepped off the pedestals of antique ruins or surfaced from some tomb. We never find out who they are, perhaps because they are all of us.\nThis approach was evident, if not consistently persuasive, Thursday night at St. Clement's Church, 423 West 46th Street, where the Phoebe Neville Dance Company opened a run through tonight and tomorrow afternoon. A special benefit performance on Wednesday will open the second weekend series.\nOn this program, Miss Neville presented the premiere of ''Voyage,'' a fine work that would have been finer and even more mesmerizing if one did not sense that Miss Neville felt obliged, in the second half, to fill out the swelling Rachmaninoff music.\nYet this ebb and flow are also the underpinning for the sea metaphor that Miss Neville seemingly uses for life, and eventually death. The program note reads, ''Voyage ... from which no Traveler returns.'' Everyman's journey into death is a traditional theme, but Miss Neville treats it here with originality.\nSheila Kaminsky, Tryntje Shapli, Jessica Fogel and Miss Neville are the four women, standing in a diagonal, who create the wave image. They wear tan tanksuits with low-waisted blue sheath skirts. Relentlessly, they will repeat throughout the piece a series of variations on a theme - a breast-stroke with arms and a circular brush of the leg. Vic Stornant, in white, appears as the ''traveler.'' As the women regroup into other formations, Mr. Stornant has not only to plow through this miasma, but to face the immutability of their force. Like a wave, they almost sweep over him. He lies, with fist clenched. The anticlimax, and yet at the end, Miss Neville's accumulative structure makes itself felt. The women turn back. The man rises, pushing the space aside as if entering a void, his face frighteningly blank.\nThe intensity of these performers is always admirable. ''Dodona,'' with a program note about a pre-Greek oracle, had Miss Neville, Miss Shapli and Miss Kaminsky entering in various states of ecstasy as possible priestesses. The increasing violence with which Miss Neville performed her solo, ''Passage,'' merely by stepping up the dynamic of head rotations and circular walks made it highly emotional.\nMiss Shapli's ''Spring Dance'' for herself and Mr. Stornant as two animal-like creatures awakening to a bull-frog type of romance had its charms and the oddity of being set to Bach.

And that could spell trouble not only for the stock market but for the job market as well.\nOn Thursday, durable goods orders fell 2.8 percent month-over-month and core orders fell 1.8 percent, much worse than expectations for a 0.5 percent decline. At least initial weekly jobless claims came in at 265,000, below the consensus estimate and marking the 55th consecutive streak below 300,000 -- the longest since 1973.\nStill, the durable goods data led the Atlanta Fed to downgrade its first-quarter GDPNow forecast to just 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent previously (chart below). Moreover, the final read on fourth-quarter 2015 GDP growth released on Friday came in at 1.4 percent. While that's up a bit from the earlier estimates, it's down from the 2 percent result posed in third-quarter 2015 and a clear drop-off from the 2.2 percent average growth rate seen in the first three quarters of 2015 and the 2.4 percent advance seen in 2014.\nThe problem, it seems, is that strength in consumer spending (primarily on services) is being outweighed by a slowdown in corporate profitability and factory activity. Much of this is the result of lower crude oil and commodity prices as well as the dampening effect a stronger dollar has had on the value of foreign corporate earnings. Economic instability in China and Europe hasn't helped, either.\nAnd more recently, based on survey responses to the March manufacturing PMI report that missed expectations by the most since 2013, concerns are rising about the increasingly contentious U.S. presidential campaign.\nLooking ahead, Wells Fargo analysts warn that if \"profits remain depressed, the prospects for (capital spending) and hiring will come under greater pressure.\" Business outlays on equipment declined at a 2.1 percent annualized pace last quarter, for context.\nAll of this is a problem for stocks because the S&P 500 has been tracking the ups and downs of the economy with a slight lag (chart above). With stocks contending with overhead resistance going back to late 2014, the drag from slower economic growth could result in a retest of the January-February lows in the months to come.\nIf we're going to see a positive surprise, it will depend on consumers.

In the end it's a judgment call.\"\nThe Antideficiency Act, which guides many of the decisions around a government shutdown, provides this broad guideline: \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" It does specify that language cannot be used to justify \"ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"\nThose decisions are generally the domain of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\"Our mission from the President has been to make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law,\" Russ Vought, the current deputy director of OMB, told reporters earlier this month.\nHe ticked off some of the administration's adjustments to make that happen, such as recalling IRS workers to process tax refunds, reversing plans to stop issuing flood insurance policies and bringing back rangers to clean up national parks.\n\"In some cases, activities and performance would not qualify for continuation during a very brief funding lapse ... but they would qualify if the duration of the funding lapse became longer,\" reads a December guide from OMB to federal agencies.\nRivlin, who led OMB during a 21-day shutdown that had been the longest until the current one surpassed it, said she believed it was appropriate to include flexibility in the laws and guidelines, as it allowed the administration to adapt as circumstances changed.\nShe had urged her Clinton administration colleagues to make decisions that visually reminded Americans that their government was closed, such as by cutting power to the National Christmas Tree.\n\"I said I didn't think the Christmas tree was essential. That one got a lot of screams and a lot of volunteers\" to keep it lit and operating, she said. \"I thought that was unfortunate.

John McCain died Saturday, more than a year after he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor.\nOn Friday, his family said in a statement that McCain had made the decision to discontinue medical treatment.\nUnlike other brain tumors that start in the body and spread to the brain, glioblastoma starts in the brain or spinal cord. The tumor arises from star-shaped brain cells known as\u201dastrocytes.\u201d The American Brain Tumor Association labels the tumor \u201chighly malignant\u201d and cancerous because of its ability to invade and stay within normal brain tissue.\nThe senator underwent surgery to remove a blood clot in July 2017 at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. Lab results from the surgery confirmed the presence of glioblastoma.\nGlioblastoma is the most common of all malignant brain tumors, representing 15.4% of all primary brain tumors, according to the brain tumor group.\nThis form of tumor killed Sen. Ted Kennedy and Beau Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.\nCNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta spoke in 2017 to doctors involved in McCain\u2019s care with permission from his family.\nGupta said he learned McCain had felt tired over the months before his diagnosis and had a bout of double vision but blamed it on his intense travel schedule.\nDoctors ordered a CAT scan and an MRI scan of McCain\u2019s brain that revealed the tumor.\nThe symptoms of glioblastoma are usually a result of increased pressure on the brain.\nThe American Brain Tumor Association lists headaches, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness as symptoms for the tumor. Depending on where the tumor is, however, weakness on one side of the body, memory and speech difficulties and visual changes can all be developed as a result.\nThere is no specific treatment used for glioblastoma, but there are a few approaches doctors can take, Gupta said.\nWhen a cancer is malignant, this means cells are dividing uncontrollably and can invade nearby tissues. They may also spread to other parts of the body through the blood stream or lymph system.\nThe brain tumor association labels the prognosis for glioblastoma survival in terms of median survival, the length of time at which an equal number of patients do better and an equal number of patients do worse. Depending on the type of glioblastoma and treatment used, this can range from 14 months to three years.\nThe association also cites a 2009 study that found 10% of patients with glioblastoma may live five years or longer.\nThe average survival time for malignant glioblastoma is around 14 months with treatment, Gupta said."}

What other topic would let me praise the gravitas of flying squirrels, read a blog called \"Two Different Socks,\" learn about Plato's Cinema, vote against a Sith Lord or write about dragons?\nSince I've had so much fun, I've decided to share. In the great tradition of the \"year in review,\" I thought it might be a blast to share my picks for the Best and Worst of 2011.\nBest Fight of 2011: It's natural to think of data types as thugs who love to rumble, but you'd be surprised to learn there are actually very few fights among the data management set. Oh, sure, occasionally an IBM executive backhands Oracle about its hardware integration, and occasionally a tech journalist (not me - well, maybe a little bit me) will try to stir the Twitter pot by writing that executives focus too much on data quality.\nBut by and large, the data heads are pretty mellow.\nSo, really, there was only one obvious choice for the Best Fight: Data Governance Wars, an educational rumble between Rob \"Darth\" Karel of Forrester Research and Jim \"the Jedi\" Harris of the Obsessive-Compulsive Data Quality blog.\nBest Mind-Boggling Integration Project: A $60 million effort launched by the Department of Energy to integrate all the biological data silos about everything known about plants and microbes. It's been called the \"computational equivalent of a manned mission to Mars.\"\nBest Success: U.S. Xpress trucking company CIO Dale Langley turned an off-handed remark by another executive into $6 million in fuel savings after a mere six-week data integration initiative. Now there's a CIO who deserves a reality show!\nSpecial mention also goes to Alameda County Social Service Agency for a 631 percent ROI on its data integration project and Del Monte for its 10-year enterprise architecture effort that resulted in triple profits and a 600 percent increase in net revenue.\nBest Food-Inspired Integration Idea: Selling integration by the pizza slice, by John Schmidt, the vice president of Global Integration Services and Lean Integration Practice Leader at Informatica. Schmidt came up with this concept while at Best Buy, where it reduced the average costs per integration point from $10,000 to $1,000 within three years.\nThe Worst Metaphor: Comparing enterprise vendors to a marriage that's \"three years and one upgrade cycle too long\" and cloud SaaS providers to \"the mistress you ultimately decide to marry after ditching SAP or Oracle.\" Sorry, ZDNet, I love you, but that one made me cringe and left me wondering about someone's personal life.

Why is it now?\nRALPH PETERS: Well among other things, our immigration policy is so utterly screwed up. How we not only brought in Somalis in very large numbers, we ghettoized them. We allow them to congregate in one area where they don\u2019t have to learn English, they don\u2019t learn American values, they\u2019re subject to hate preachers, most radical forms of Islam, and it\u2019s a little Somalia within the United States.\nCARLSON: But for years we brought Scandinavians into Minneapolis and they congregated together and lived in their own neighborhoods and spoke Swedish and Danish and they didn\u2019t plotting terror attacks. What\u2019s the difference?\nPETERS: Well they did clog our arteries with a lot of cheese. But very seriously, it really comes down to culture. Scandinavians came over here from European culture. Traditionally, European culture has been our culture and its American derivative. And to be fair, most Muslims have done a fair job of integrating. Some of the Iranian Americans have done a great job. But the Somalis were undereducated or uneducated, practiced a very primitive form of Islam, and again they didn\u2019t get dispersed, they didn\u2019t have to integrate and that\u2019s a fundamental problem.\nIt\u2019s not exactly new news that our enemies have noticed the laxity of American border enforcement.

You've seen enough layoffs and reorganizations to know that your seemingly stable cash flow could evaporate tomorrow.\n\"I met someone recently who got laid off after 32 years of service just six weeks before her retirement,\" says Dr. Janet Scarborough, a psychologist with 17 years of experience counseling clients on career issues. \"I cannot think of a story that highlights better how important it is to shape your own destiny instead of trusting that a company is going to do it for you.\"\nIf you're going to take a career risk anyway, wouldn't it be better to go after what you really want?

In fact, you can do most of your preparation--and even start making money at your new vocation--before you quit your corporate day job.\nUnfortunately, many of the best-laid corporate escape plans never even get off the ground because of fears about money.\nWhen you work in a corporate job, you become very accustomed to that regular paycheck being direct-deposited into your bank account.

You may be miserable staying in Corporate America, but at least you won't be broke.

And it's about to be easier for women to get this cash.\nThe Grameen Bank made its name by offering loans of $1,500 to impoverished female entrepreneurs in the developing world. In 2008, it expanded its program to the United States.\nIn the last six years, more than 28,000 women have received micro loans from Grameen America totaling over $150 million. Last week, the organization officially opened the doors of its first U.S. training institute in Queens, N.Y., which it will use to reach even more women across the country.\nIn partnership with Capital One (COF), the Robin Hood Foundation and Citibank (C), the new center will act as a training school for loan officers, who are crucial to Grameen's strategy of empowering female entrepreneurs.\nThe organization takes a peer-group lending approach: Groups of five women band together and work with a loan officer or \"center manager\" at one of Grameen America's 18 branches. Center managers, who are full-time salaried employees, give women financial training to open bank accounts (for many, it's their first), establish credit and launch businesses.\nLoan officers are the gateway to capital and play a \"critical, pivotal role,\" according to Grameen America CEO Andrea Jung.\n\"Part of scaling nationally is embedding best practices to our loan officers,\" she said.\nThere are already over 110 Grameen loan officers in the U.S., and Jung expects the new training center to add 200 men and women to the roster in the next year. Center managers will be trained at the new center and then will return to their local branches around the country. Each manager can help an estimated 400 women get their small businesses off the ground per year.\nAll women who receive micro loans from Grameen are living below the poverty line, and many are single moms working dead-end or unsustainable jobs. The new institute could help as many as 80,000 women a year launch their own small businesses and improve their financial situation.\nThe center had a soft launch earlier this year, and 70 people already went through the training, including Mercedes Martinez.\nOriginally from Puerto Rico but now living in the Bronx, Martinez received $1,500 in loan from Grameen America in January 2014. A new mom, she wasn't working when a neighbor told her about the program and suggested she start a business selling jewelery. Martinez, who had previously worked as a cashier in the jewelry business, opted to buy jewelry on Canal St. with her initial loan.\n\"I wasn't good at money management,\" explained Martinez. \"Through Grameen, I learned you have to save and make your money grow.\"\nMartinez paid off her loan in March. Changed by the foundation and its mission, she completed the one-month training -- which combines classroom-style learning with shadowing Grameen America loan officers -- and is now a loan officer at the Manhattan branch of Grameen.\nThe fact that the training center is located in Queens, where the first of Grameen America's 18 branches opened, is no coincidence, according to Jung.\nFranklin"}

{"idx": "21200", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: ON May 18, Caremark Rx Inc., a pharmaceuticals services concern, surprised many investors when it disclosed that a day earlier federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission had notified the company that they were scrutinizing how it awarded stock options to company insiders. Caremark's shares tumbled 6.8 percent on the news.\nSome investors, however, found the regulators' interest in Caremark not so surprising. As early as last January, SEC Insight, an independent research firm, warned its clients that regulatory risks might be brewing at the company \u2014 noting that federal authorities had refused to release records on Caremark because doing so could interfere with enforcement activities. SEC Insight reiterated its warning on March 20.\nThe stock of Caremark, which is based in Nashville, has been a top performer in recent years. But shareholders who heeded SEC Insight's warnings and sold their stock dodged a significant loss.\nIn a world where truly independent stock research is a valuable and rare commodity, SEC Insight is even more unusual. The firm makes its calls after poring through correspondence and other internal S.E.C. documents it secures by filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Ever since John P. Gavin, a former money manager and chartered financial analyst, founded SEC Insight six years ago in Plymouth, Minn., he has prided himself on its ability to sniff out regulatory trails like a corporate bloodhound.\nDuring the last two years, however, Mr. Gavin says, his snooping and his ability to send early warning signals to clients have been stymied by an unlikely adversary: the S.E.C. itself. The agency, overshadowed by aggressive prosecutors like Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, has gone to great lengths recently to reassert itself as Wall Street's top cop. But the S.E.C. has made it nearly impossible for Mr. Gavin to round up documents it once routinely provided to his firm. Mr. Gavin's experience, he says, suggests that the agency, which bills itself as the investor's advocate, is less than forthcoming about what it actually finds at the companies it polices.\n\"In this post-Enron era, as the S.E.C. demands record levels of disclosure from public companies, it's a shame that the agency itself has become disclosure-challenged,\" Mr. Gavin said.\nIt is a troubling paradox, Mr. Gavin says. The S.E.C., which requires public companies to make full disclosure of all meaningful facts, has stopped granting most of Mr. Gavin's requests for regulatory correspondence. For his part, Mr. Gavin has sued the agency in federal district court in Minnesota, seeking to compel compliance with federal disclosure laws.\nThe suit aims to force the S.E.C. to turn over records to Mr. Gavin on 12 companies, which the S.E.C. has so far flatly refused to do. The judge overseeing the case has given the S.E.C. a deadline of Thursday to prove that it has reviewed the documents that Mr. Gavin requested on six of those companies. The agency has appealed that ruling, arguing that the task is too onerous.\n\"We are defending the action to protect our ability to complete these law enforcement investigations, and to protect investors by enabling us to get relief where appropriate, including disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,\" said Richard M. Humes, associate general counsel at the S.E.C"}

{"idx": "21210", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Defensive line: LDE Arik Armstead, DT DeForest Buckner, DT Quinton Dial, RDE Aaron Lynch.\nNotes: Armstead is bigger than a traditional 4-3 defensive end, but he's got enough movement skills to play on the edge of the defense. He and Buckner could pair up at defensive tackle in nickel and dime defense just as they did earlier this year. The alignment would make Tank Carradine a 4-3 defensive end, which is the position he played at Florida State and the one at which he'd be most comfortable. Eli Harold also would go from 3-4 outside linebacker to 4-3 defensive end as would Ronald Blair.\nNotes: Brooks played inside linebacker in college (watch this and this), entered the NFL with the Bengals as an inside linebacker and dabbled at the position with the 49ers, notably in goal-line situations against the Panthers in the 2013 playoffs. In this scenario, he'd be the team's strong-side or SAM linebacker (and probably would have to lose weight to do so, something he hasn't done all that well in the past). Bowman would be the traditional middle linebacker, a la Luke Kuechly in Carolina. The leap of faith here is that Bowman will return to full strength after his second major lower-leg injury in 2 1/2 years. Who would play the 'Will,' weak-side position, which usually calls for a lighter, more athletic linebacker who can run to the ball and make plays in space? The 49ers could re-sign Ray-Ray Armstrong, who is scheduled for free agency in March. Or they could draft one. Michigan's Jabrill Peppers likely will be viewed as a safety at the NFL level because of his smaller stature (He'll likely measure 5-11, 210 pounds or so at the combine), but the Wolverines are using the aggressive, playmaker as a linebacker this season. The 49ers also could convert one of their bigger-bodied safeties (see below).\nNotes: The 49ers should not have to worry about the spot for years. Tramaine Brock, Jimmie Ward, Rashard Robinson, Keith Reaser, Dontae Johnson, Will Redmond and JaCorey Shepherd are signed for next season.\nNotes: The question at this position is whether Ward, perhaps the team's most gifted defensive player, is best at cornerback or free safety. He started at cornerback Sunday and showed off his play-making ability against the Cardinals with four pass break-ups and seven tackles. But would that ability be better utilized at safety? And would pairing Ward with his old high-school teammate, Jaquiski Tartt, give the 49ers a faster, harder-hitting and more dynamic duo than they have now? Eric Reid, a starter since his rookie season in 2013, has played along the line of scrimmage more this season than he has in the past. Could he convert into a Will linebacker the way Thomas Davis did with the Panthers? Or maybe the safety pairing should be Ward and Reid and the team should think about using Tartt as its 'Will' linebacker."}

There is no question that medical marijuana is helpful for people with various health conditions, but making it a legal recreation drug makes no sense from a public safety standpoint.\"\nMunicipalities such as Saugus that voted \u201cno\u201d on the 2016 statewide ballot question can ban recreational marijuana establishments by passing a bylaw prior to Dec. 31, 2019, according to the Cannabis Control Commission.\nIn cities and towns where a majority of voters approved the recreational marijuana ballot question, an initiative to ban recreational marijuana in that community must be presented to voters at a town-wide election.\nThe Cannabis Control Commission that is tasked with implementing the laws for recreational marijuana is required to begin accepting priority applications for recreational marijuana businesses this month.\nA timeline on the Cannabis Control Commission website shows that applications will be opened for recreational marijuana cultivation businesses on May 1 and retail businesses can apply starting on June 1."}

The project didn't happen, and today the land is the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.\nThose displaced landowners were taxpayers who contributed to Delaware Valley and East Stroudsburg school districts. Without them, the district says there is an additional burden on taxpayers.\nIf the federal land, assessed at $30 million, had stayed in private ownership, the districts would have reaped the benefit of those taxes.\nEach year Delaware Valley requests a federal impact fee, which offsets some of the lost revenue. The annual fee from the feds is roughly $750,000, Business Administrator Bill Hessling said.\nThe Department of Education would cut the funding of federal impact fees by 9 percent under sequestration, Hessling said. The district has written lawmakers asking for special consideration to prevent the loss of funding, he said.\nOther federal agencies are also preparing for deep budget cuts.\nThis month Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar wrote to the Senate Appropriations Committee listing some of the ways the Department of the Interior would handle the sequester.\nThe United States Geological Survey may have to discontinue operation of 350 to 375 stream gauges used throughout the country to predict and address drought and flood conditions by monitoring water availability, Salazar's letter said.\nIt is unknown which river gauges would be affected, but cuts could include the gauges on the Delaware River. The USGS has an office in Milford, and the river is constantly monitored.\nReliable funding of the stream gauge network is necessary in order to obtain the information needed to make good decisions about managing of shared water resources, according to Delaware River Basin Commission's website.\nNature does not supply water at a constant or predictable rate. In order to properly manage water, it must be measured. Gauges are indispensable as tools for flood forecasting and warning along rivers and streams, the commission says."}

The bond proposal's size is record-breaking for the district. According to Texas Comptroller Data, eight out of the 10 largest bonds voters will decide Nov. 6 are for new schools and school improvements.\nSheldon ISD's $285 million bond was the largest in the school's history and is going toward a new 10,000-seat football stadium, new track, baseball and softball fields, tennis courts, a new high school, energy management upgrades, and additions and renovations to existing middle schools.\nThe new elementary school, which will be constructed by Durotech, will be completed in time for the start of the 2019 fall semester, according to Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam.\n\"The new PVA school will meet Sheldon ISD's needs for the next 50 to 75 years and provide students the environment and infrastructure needed to succeed in the 21st century,\" said JP Grom, vice president at Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam."}

Nutmeg decides how to invest its customers' money based on their personal profiles, taking into consideration the amount of risk they are comfortable with and the timeframe they want want to invest for.\nThe company has been founded by Nick Hungerford, who worked at Barclays for six years in wealth management, then as a divisional director at Brewin Dolphin before completing an MBA at Stanford.

It eliminates the need to be super-wealthy in order to be a client of a stockbroker or a private banker. Customers can create separate funds for different goals -- from buying a house to putting money away for a rainy day -- and they can top-up, withdraw or transfer their money whenever they like. All they have to do is decide how much they want to invest, how long they might want to invest it for, and the level of risk with which they feel comfortable. Then Nutmeg does all the investing work for them: choosing the best balance of funds, rebalancing portfolios regularly to keep them on track with their goals and keeping a close eye on performance.\nWe charge customers fees as a percentage of their assets under management. Total annual fees start at one per cent (including VAT). By collecting \"Nutmegs\", a points-based scheme based on loyalty, referrals and pounds invested, users can reduce their management fees to as low as 0.3 percent. This compares favourably to the industry average of 1.36 per cent.\nThere are a couple of firms in the US offering similar propositions. In the UK and Europe we face competition from industry incumbents such as stockbrokers, private banks and investment managers for people with assets of over \u00a350,000. At lower levels, our main competition is apathy and a lack of time.\nNutmeg was created because I was frustrated by the exclusivity and lack of transparency in the investment world -- and I knew I was not the only one.

So where was that service for the rest of us? While studying at Stanford Business School in the heart of Silicon Valley, surrounded by people who worked at companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, I realised that the internet could enable this vision to make intelligent, trusted investing accessible to all.\nIn short, everyone wants to take control of their money in a simple way, through a business they can trust.\nAt Nutmeg, we are determined to rebalance"}

Prior to this, there were two previous primary categories of service: The Regular Force, soldiers that perform military duties on a full-time basis, and the Reserve Force \u2014 soldiers that perform military duties on a routine or on-call, part-time basis.\nThe JDF said individuals wrongly turned up at Up Park Camp to be interviewed for acceptance into the programme.\nAccording to Major Basil Jarrett, civil-military cooperation and media affairs officer for the JDF, the army typically interviews and tests approximately 60-80 applicants daily, so yesterday's turnout of almost 2,000 people was extremely unusual.\n\u201cBefore anyone is called to do the interview and test, they would first be required to complete the application process online before they are notified to come in.

It could've happened at any time to anyone. Skinful is a wonderful event, that benefits charities as well as the community. It is a very special event for Charleston and I truly hope that it continues for many years to come. My prayers are with the young man (who is my same age) and also with Dr. King-may his vision of Halloween greatness continue. I would hate to think that one person's misjudgement would mean the end of a Charleston institution. The young man's father is obviously hurting, but his son's accident should not be then end of what is arguably the most amazing night of the year in Charleston.\nSo,the roads in downtown Charleston are more narrow than others because of the age of the city itself. The roads in surrounding areas are populated with just as many people behind the wheel of a car with NO sense of how to navigate a heavily trafficked area. People in Charleston have very little to complain about, in terms of traffic congestion - try living in a city with more than 350,000 people in it, really. Maybe then some of you will understand the importance of more people using bicycles as a means of transportation.\nI agree that cyclists need to obey the rules of the road, meaning the use of proper signals, lights, etc., just as any other vehicle would. I've seen a large majority of people in downtown Charleston NOT riding on the far right side of the lane when on a bike. However, it seems that a lot of CARS pay zero attention to the lines on the road either.\nBike! Bike often! Bike legally!\nAnd as for the bike that Santa never brought MaxF...I hope you, one day, get over the childhood trauma which has obviously left you so bitter and embattled. Best of luck with that.\nI absolutely love Santi's. My boyfriend and I are regulars and the place simply cannot be beat as far as I'm concerned.

Her size, speed, and firepower made her a definite threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic, and it was imperative that she be neutralized.\"\nIn July 2001, the wreck of the Hood was found 9,334 feet below the surface of the Denmark Straight. She lies in three sections with the bow on its side, the mid section upside down, and the stern speared into the seabed. In 2013, the wreck was more fully explored with a remote-control vehicle. The exploration appears to confirm a massive explosion had taken place in the magazine feeding Y Turret and breaking the back of the ship. However, it remains a mystery, given the low trajectory of any shell, how one could have passed through four decks and the magazine armor. It must have been a lucky shot, indeed.\nIn May 1941, Admiral Sir John C. Tovey, commander of the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in Scotland\u2019s Orkney Islands, was ordered to attack the German battleship Bismarck and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen that had just been spotted in the Denmark Strait. Tovey\u2019s fleet consisted of two new battleships, King George V and Prince of Wales, the battlecruisers Hood and Repulse, and the aircraft carrier Victorious, plus many additional cruisers and destroyers. Also hurrying north to join him was the older battleship Rodney, mounting nine 16-inch guns, the largest caliber in the fleet.\nOf all the German surface warships, the British feared Bismarck the most. Her size, speed, and firepower made her a definite threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic, and it was imperative that she be neutralized.\nOn May 21, 1941, Hood and Prince of Wales left Scapa Flow with six destroyers under the command of Admiral Lancelot Holland flying his flag in Hood, their mission to provide heavy support to the cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk covering the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland\u2013\u2013one of the likely routes the German naval squadron would take to reach the North Atlantic. The rest of the fleet was gathering to cover the area between Iceland and the Orkney Islands.\nEarly on the evening May 23, Suffolk made contact with the enemy ships, quickly turning away toward the coast of Iceland and into a fog bank. Suffolk immediately transmitted a sighting report to the Admiralty and then came around astern of the German ships to shadow them on radar.\nNorfolk came up as well, a little too boldly, for Bismarck opened fire on her; like Suffolk, she raced for the fog bank. The blast from Bismarck\u2019s 15-inch guns disabled her own forward radar, and overall German commander Admiral Gunther L\u00fctjens ordered Prinz Eugen to take the lead.\nThe Germans had picked up the sighting report from Suffolk and advised their own high command. L\u00fctjens was shocked their presence had been discovered so easily and had little intelligence on what his two warships might face.\nAs the two forces moved toward each other, Holland had a marked two-to-one superiority in firepower. However, this was offset by the age of the Hood (commissioned in 1920) and the newness (commissioned in January 1941) and lack of combat readiness of Prince of Wales, which was still having trouble with her main"}

Beyond that, though, the bargain hunting crowd was as colorful as that at any big flea market. Even before the 8 a.m. official starting time, hundreds of computerphiles meandered through the open-air stalls, their faces--sallowed by endless hours under florescent lamps--already turning a slight pink with exposure to the morning sun.\nMuch of the merchandise had already achieved antique status, even though it was made only a few years ago.\n\"That's an old computer,\" said a seller who would identify himself only as Ralph, as he pointed to a big Intel 80/20 computer he hoped to unload. \"Obsolete like all the rest of them. Something that cost $4,000 or $5,000 two or three years ago, you can't even give it away now . . . .\"\nAlthough most buyers and sellers wistfully agreed with that assessment, it didn't limit the low and high-tech ingenuity with which some buyers pursued deals. One man, for instance, displayed a hand-scrawled message mounted on a stick.

The \"Warrior\" script was vetted by a Marine Corps liaison to the entertainment industry, and more than 200 real Marines appear in uniform in a crowd scene.\nThe Department of Defense regularly cooperates with Hollywood on projects large and small, from Lifetime's fictional Army base-set series \"Army Wives\" and CBS' naval police procedural \"NCIS\" to Paramount Pictures' warring robots franchise \"Transformers\" and Sony's Columbia Pictures film \"Battle: Los Angeles,\" about Marines fighting an alien invasion. The military has allowed Universal Pictures to film its upcoming action movie \"Battleship\" on the battleship Missouri and permitted Navy SEALs to appear in Relativity Media's February thriller \"Act of Valor.\"\nThat's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. Given that less than 1% of the U.S. population is currently serving in the military, entertainment \u2014 including movies, TV shows and video games \u2014 is key to shaping the public's idea of what it means to be a soldier.\n\"Hollywood feature films have served as the most significant medium to argue for the military,\" said Lawrence H. Suid, author of \"Guts & Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film.\" \"Americans love violence, and war movies provide all that violence without the danger.\"\nBut controversy over an upcoming movie about the killing of Osama bin Laden \u2014 and how much U.S. officials should assist director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal \u2014 has shed light on some of the minefields that must be navigated by real-life warriors and the showbiz engine that seeks to portray them.\nThere are constant tensions over how troops are depicted \u2014 the military brass is often uncomfortable with the defiant, cocky heroes that filmmakers, and moviegoers, like to embrace.

This rise in popularity appears to have two origins: a cultural shift toward computers and a concern for the environment in the form of paper consumption.\nRobb Waterman, CEO of one of the first e-card sites and one that snagged the domain name e-cards.com, said when his company started in 1995, \"We didn't think about replacing paper cards, but did think of it as environmentally sensitive.\" Waterman started experimenting with e-cards when he found he couldn't send photos by e-mail to friends in Europe.\nClearly technology has overcome that limit, and e-card use has only grown.\nThis December Maureen White, 35, says she received an e-Christmas card from her younger cousin that started out, \"To save the postal carriers' legs, I have opted to send out an E-Christmas card. In reality, I have very few of my friends and family's actual postal addresses these days because I was born in 1980, and us Gen Y'ers are concerned with speed and convenience. 99% of what I do is on the computer!\"\nWhite says, \"The card was really nice and had tons of pictures from his life. I'm sure it took him a while to put it together.\" Nonetheless the greeting generated some lighthearted heckling from one recipient. Someone on her cousin's list hit \"reply all\" with the playful note, \"Get a wife and send a real card.\"\nBut according to American Greetings \u2014 the largest paper and e-card company in the world \u2014 women, men, husbands, young and old are among the 2 million people paying $13.99 a year to subscribe to the company's e-card service. Its 30,000 e-cards range from still photos, audio-video clips, and the means to create your own card.\nThat\u2019s what Carolyn Hampton, 45, received this year, \"I got an e-card that was actually a link to YouTube. My friend uploaded a video of her three kids.\"\nE-card popularity might primarily reflect our increasing dependence on the Internet, but it does have green benefits.

For it embodies and expresses--with her characteristic confidence, style and verve--a fundamental change in her views about where U.S. K\u201312 education should be heading. Simply stated, she believes it should recapture the strengths of the traditional public school system, incorporate a vigorous common curriculum and renounce many of the theories, practices, policies and programs that have constituted America's major education-reform emphases in recent years. More than a few of those are reforms that she herself had promoted in her writings, board memberships, speeches, media comments and government service.\nShe admits that she's changed her mind.\nDiane and I go back a very long way--three decades, give or take--and in addition to the personal friendship we have, during that period, shared a basic diagnosis of what's awry in U.S. education.

The uninsured. The fragmentation.\nDuring a speech at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), the pioneering health economist narrowed his gaze to whether a single-payer system is the fix to those problems.\nThe answer is complicated, and it depends on the questions behind the question, said Fuchs, a SIEPR Senior Fellow and the Henry J. Kaiser, Jr., Professor of Economics and Health Research and Policy, emeritus.\nRecent challenges to the Affordable Care Act have rekindled a debate over the merits of a single payer health care system \u2014 where one entity, namely the federal government, would foot the bill for essential services for all \u2014 and Fuchs spoke at SIEPR to succinctly explain what a single-payer system could achieve, what would probably never happen, and why.\nThe problem, Fuchs pointed out, is that the United States spends the most of any high-income country on health care, yet Americans are not achieving better health outcomes. Part of the solution would have to address the nation\u2019s higher administrative costs, higher prices for prescription drugs, and the expensive, increasing mix of services and specialists.\nFuchs contended a single-payer system would lower costs. For one, it would create the bargaining power needed to offset the monopolistic powers of those providing the drugs, medical services and equipment.\nEven as it provides for universal health care insurance coverage, a single-payer system could take on various forms, including a blend of private and public controls.\nAnd to have any chance at success, Fuchs said, the single-payer system would have to be simple, require minimum bureaucracy, and provide choice.\nThen comes the rub, of course: The political will has historically tread against single-payer.\nAmericans are not willing to provide subsidies for those too poor to afford health insurance; neither do they have a compulsion for everyone to acquire coverage and contribute to those subsidies.\nAnd unfortunately, Fuchs added, he does not believe universal health coverage would necessarily improve health outcomes. Many other socio-economic and environmental factors also play a role there.\nIn leading a brief discussion with Fuchs, Mark Cullen, a SIEPR Senior Fellow and professor of medicine, asked what makes him think the federal government would work to control costs under a single-payer system \u2014 when it has thus far chosen to exert little buying power under the current structure.\n\u201cI have not discussed the political feasibility of this, deliberately,\u201d Fuchs quipped.\nYou can learn more about Fuchs\u2019 viewpoint in The Journal of the American Medical Association."}

While some votes are still being counted, Trump is expected to end up with 306 electoral votes.\nFaithless electors are the official voters in the Electoral College who vote against the wishes of their state. Even though Trump \"won\" 306 electoral votes, the Electoral College still has to meet and the votes still need to be cast by its actual members.\nAccording to the Constitution, each state legislature decides who will serve as electors for their state.\nIn the country's early days, state legislatures chose their best representatives to choose the next president. Today, each state appoints its electors based on which candidate won the popular vote in their state (Nebraska and Maine are the only exceptions, and they appoint their electors based on which candidate won each congressional district in their state).\nThis is why the media declared Trump last week the winner even though the Electoral College hasn't met yet.\nHowever, electors still have to cast their vote, and it is possible for electors to vote against their state's winner.\nUsually, the voting of electors is a mere formality. The political parties in each state choose the electors they'd like to send. When one party's candidate wins the state, that party's electors are who the state sends to the Electoral College. Since parties choose electors loyal to their party, it's very unlikely the electors would vote for a different party's candidate.\nSome states have even gone further to guard against the possibility of electors voting for a different candidate than expected. There are 24 states, plus the District of Colombia, with laws requiring electors to vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.\nBut the punishment is limited to small fines. For example, Oklahoma's is a $1,000 fine for an elector voting for a different candidate than the one who won the state. Further, according to the National Archives and Records Administration, \"no Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged.\"\nEven with these safeguards in place, there have been 157 faithless electors throughout the country's history. In the last 17 presidential elections, there have been nine elections where faithless electors cast their vote for a different candidate, including the 2004 election.\nWill Faithless Electors Vote Against Trump?\nThe Electoral College has become a last hope against a Trump presidency for many. A petition urging the Electoral College to vote for Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump has gotten more than 2 million signatures.\nHowever, the real threat to a Trump Electoral College victory comes from his own party, as these are the voters who could sway the outcome. Robert Alexander, a professor of political science at Ohio Northern University who studies the Electoral College, explained on CNN that Republican electors could be unhappy with him.\n\"Trump has angered many establishment Republicans throughout the campaign, and many of those same establishment Republicans will undoubtedly find their way to the Electoral College.\" In fact, the \"Never Trump\" movement originated among Republicans opposed to his nomination in the primaries.\nAlexander says it's possible for these Republican electors"}

{"idx": "21261", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Everything you need to know from Chesapeake Energy Corporation\u2019s second quarter conference call.\nChesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) recently reported second-quarter results that were a bit below expectations. However, that had to do with the prices the company realized for oil and gas as opposed to any operational missteps. In fact, listening to the management team on the conference call discussing those results would have investors believe that the company is doing better than ever before as it is making progress toward its goals, which are the four pillars detailed below.\nI'd just like to iterate that Chesapeake is standing strong on four pillars today. We are growing production at a double-digit annual rate. We are demonstrating excellent capital efficiency and cost leadership. We are reducing our financial complexity. And we are laser focused on creating shareholder value through a variety of strategic initiatives. \u2013 CEO Doug Lawler.\nMore than anything else Chesapeake Energy's management team wants its investors to know that its new strategy is built upon four pillars. The company plans to grow production in a very capital efficient manner while at the same time reducing its financial complexity in order to create shareholder value. Now, let's take a deeper dive into what management had to say about each of these four pillars.\nChesapeake is a growth company. We have the strategy, high-quality assets, and talented employees to deliver growth quarter after quarter. \u2013 Doug Lawler.\nChesapeake Energy has always been a growth company. However, this time the company is focused on managing its growth in a more sustainable manner. That means it won't pile on debt in order to build an empire. Instead, the company is focused on growth that matters, which is growth that delivers positive returns and creates value.\nFor years, growth in the oil and gas industry meant adding more rigs to drill more wells. That's no longer the case as multi-well pads are allowing companies like Chesapeake Energy to drill more wells with less rigs. As the following slide from a recent investor presentation notes, the ability to drill more wells with less rigs is improving the company's cost to drill each lateral foot and therefore returns.\nOne of the ways Chesapeake Energy is reducing its financial complexity is by cleaning up its balance sheet of all the various non-traditional financing agreements it has, like subsidiary level preferred shares and volumetric production payments. This past quarter the company bought back all of the outstanding preferred shares of its Utica subsidiary for $1.26 billion. In doing so the company was able to retire what it called a \"high cost leverage instrument\" as it will save $75 million in annual cash dividend payments to preferred shareholders.\nChesapeake Energy is taking calculated strategic steps to create the most value it can for investors. Its recently announced deal in the Powder River Basin is an example of this. It took acreage spread across two counties and consolidated it as the following map shows.\nIn doing so Chesapeake Energy increased its average working interests from 38% to 79%, giving it operational control over more future drilling locations. Having operational control has been a key for the company in driving returns as it controls how its capital will be spent to create value for investors. As the earlier slide from the Utica Shale pointed out, Chesapeake Energy's operated wells produce rates of return substantially above the rates of non-operated wells.\nTo sum everything up, Chesapeake Energy wants its investors to know that it has a plan. That plan is focused on growing value and not growing an empire. Because of that plan and"}

He\u2019s been the chief lobbyist for Waltham-based Raytheon, helping to secure many contracts, including a Navy destroyer the Pentagon didn\u2019t want.

Kennedy, at the Hyannis Port compound, commemorating their friendship.\nSimilar portraits and paintings from Kennedy decorate offices throughout Washington, from President Obama\u2019s private dining room to the lobbyist corridor on K Street, potent symbols of the ongoing influence of the longtime senior senator from Massachusetts who died five years ago.\nA Boston Globe review of thousands of lobbying records and interviews with two dozen former aides reveals an informal network that is almost unrivaled in the nation\u2019s capital, both in size and quiet clout.

It is a corps of well-placed Washington players who say they still hear the echo of the late senator\u2019s booming baritone in their ears and are still moved by his priorities, even as they have followed the well-worn track of many former Congressional staffers, parlaying inside connections into lucrative lobbying careers.\nMany of the former Kennedy aides are highly influential, working for firms that pull in millions of dollars annually in lobbying and other fees.

Sydney was well taken care of. Though Mary has a hand in things and I suppose EJ was around Sydney once in a while, Nicole was super attentive. Nicole would only get a sitter when she was trying to hide her secret. Hmm. When Nicole took Sydney out of the DiMera residence, I wasn\u2019t upset about it. Sydney thinks of her as mum and Nicole merely wanted to get Syd away from Sami, EJ and Stefano\u2019s yelling. If they weren\u2019t yelling, she may never have taken the child.

As a parent these days she has made headway with Will, but they still have major issues because of Sami\u2019s issues in her romantic life. Her other two kids aren\u2019t around her very much. They\u2019re with their fathers or grandmother but they can\u2019t be in each scene like Syd can. Let me digress. Syd isn\u2019t in all those scenes you may think. We see a lot of fancy camera work and empty carriages! At any rate, the twins are with grandma and that\u2019s important too, but it makes Sami\u2019s parenting look shabby, as though she\u2019s pawning her kids off, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s really like!

Martin wrote that Kong used to be a client there, and a caseworker had reported him to law enforcement for texts about killing people.\nOn Dec. 3, the same Facebook user then posted about shooting up Skowhegan Area High School.\nFacebook has since deleted that account.\nIt appears Kong was at the center of a similar investigation in Florida two years ago.\nInvestigators with the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in August 2016 that they wanted to speak with Jesus Wellington Kong, 23, about threats made to Orlando-area schools, according to a story on the clickorlando.com website. Deputies increased patrols around at least five schools that month after threats of violence surfaced online.\nInvestigators said one of the threats made reference to shooting up a high school, while others involved planting pipe bombs at another high school and a middle school. That story also stated that Kong had been arrested multiple times, had several aliases and was believed to be transient.\nKong currently does not have any court appearances scheduled in Maine."}

It causes an unpleasant reaction and makes them feel unwell.\nAs a result, there is a wide variation of alcohol intake in China - one in three men doesn\u2019t drink and very few women do.\nBut by comparing the health outcomes of drinkers and non-drinkers according to their genetic profile, scientists say they have been able to assess - with much more certainty than before - the direct effects of alcohol on stroke risk, distinct from any other factors.\nWestern populations don\u2019t possess these genes, so it would be impossible to carry out a similar study here.\nAnd most studies are observational, which makes it difficult to judge which factor is causing what effect.\nThe researchers say their key message is that there is now clear evidence of no protective effect of moderate drinking on stroke.\nThat means drinking even small amounts of alcohol each day can increase the chances of having a stroke. What do other experts say?\nDr Stephen Burgess, from the University of Cambridge, said there were some limitations to the study - that it only looked at a Chinese population and focused mainly on the drinking of spirits and beer, not wine.\nBut he said the research reflected the culmination of many years of research into the impact of alcohol consumption.\n\u201cIt strongly suggests that there is no cardiovascular benefit of light drinking and that the risk of stroke increases even with moderate light alcohol consumption,\u201d he said.\nProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the study didn\u2019t answer every question.\n\u201cIt has certainly advanced what we know about the role of alcohol in some diseases but it can\u2019t be the last word,\u201d"}

Either he changes himself or he changes his club.\nFor all that Liverpool manager director Ian Ayre expressed a desire for the striker to honour the remaining three and a bit years of his contract, Suarez\u2019s chomp into the arm of Branislav Ivanovic highlighted how there can be no certainty as to what happens next.\nProffering apologies comes almost as easily as scoring goals for the tainted Uruguayan forward, though it is actions rather than any amount of words that will now define the next chapter in the player\u2019s extraordinary, tumultuous relationship with Liverpool.\nBut the Reds have renowned psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters in situ at Anfield once a week, a man who, outside of football, has helped Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan conquer his demons and control his \u201cinner chimp\u201d.\n\u2018Anger management\u2019 is the buzz phrase. But unless Suarez genuinely recognises how he has let down manager Brendan Rodgers, just as he did Kenny Dalglish, and realises the debt he owes the club, then all talk of his rehabilitation is meaningless.\nIf you say he can\u2019t play for Liverpool again, then what club is he going to go to?\nSuarez\u2019s tweets, away from the scripted mea culpa, hinted at a belated understanding of the gravity of what has occurred and there is plenty more for him to chew on between now and the end of the season as he contemplates what is likely to be a lengthy FA ban.\nIt should be no surprise that Liverpool are staking their reputation on Suarez once again, despite Rodgers\u2019 assertion in the aftermath of the 2-2 stalemate with Chelsea that the club\u2019s \u201cvalues and ethics\u201d were paramount. When your best player transgresses, \u201cvalues and ethics\u201d quickly trail in second place to overheads and balance sheets.\nThey did so, initially, in 2011 when recruiting him from Ajax in an \u00a318 million deal, confident the episode in which he sunk his teeth into the shoulder of PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Otman Bakkal was a one-off.\nThey did so on numerous occasions between October that year and January this year, as the race row with Patrice Evra rumbled on and, from a cynical outlook, that they continue to do so now protects not only the player but also his price tag. If the club had distanced themselves from him yesterday, it would have driven down his value.This must have been a concern, because if Suarez is not committed to reinventing himself, then he will agitate to leave Anfield sooner rather than later.\nIt did not take long for the conspiracy theories to start raging. Suarez begins bleating about how his life has been \u201cmade impossible\u201d and how he is being \u201chounded out of English football\u201d.\nThe ferocity of the opposition he encounters is too much to bear, the criticism pouring down from all sides unfair on his young family, and the realisation dawns that he needs a fresh start elsewhere to escape the brutal scrutiny.\nFrom out of the woodwork interest materialises from Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, and the pariah will be pursued in a different sense.\nThat this was done in order to engineer a move is surely too far-fetched even for a player who thumbs his nose to convention and prefers to deal in the extremes.

Overworking our ovens and testing the limits of our tables, we nourish our souls even more than our guests' hungry stomachs, and the holidays are peak season.\nHaving a few friends over for a warm meal starts the season of gratefulness and giving on exactly the right foot (call it \"Friendsgiving\" if you must). Although an omnivore myself, a few of my dearest pals are vegetarian, so I created a menu in their honor featuring a meatless main dish that beats any turkey I've ever met.\nAs soon as I pulled the Braided Puff Pastry Lentil Roast from the oven, I knew the recipe was a winner. This sage-scented, nutty, vegetable-and-lentil loaf blanketed with a flaky golden crust and topped with a generous drizzle of caramelized onion gravy will win over even devout bird-lovers in the bunch.\nEnrobed in umami flavor, Super Savory Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup is like a bear hug from your favorite uncle. It's difficult to describe the toothsome chew of the cremini mushrooms and whole wild rice without using the word meaty.\nBy boiling the wild rice with baking soda, the flavorful browning process known at the Maillard reaction occurs at a lower temperature, creating a richly flavored broth that takes this soup over the edge.

Shake up bourbon with orange liqueur and bitters, pureed pumpkin and real maple syrup, pour over ice and you've got dessert in a rocks glass, so classy.\nA few chewy Medjool dates in a bowl along with some roughly chopped dark chocolate do well to quell a sweet tooth, too.

Rowling's readers, as we grew up with Harry, his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, and his beloved teachers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nIn these tumultuous times, when people all over the world are so divided, politicians sell their principles for money and prolonged power and many world leaders have forsaken the greater good for the good of the few, we can always escape to Hogwarts and join Harry's ranks. We can imagine a world where people choose to be brave, who do the right thing even when it is incredibly hard and against all the odds and were often almost completely alone in doing it. At Hogwarts, a few excellent people fought incredibly hard for years because they believed in the greater good, and in an inclusive magical world. In a time where it feels like so few people are being brave, and standing up for what is right, it is good to be reminded that people like Harry, Hermoine, the Weasleys, Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid, Severus Snape, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Dobby the Free Elf, Professor McGonagall, Neville Longbottom and others are out there, groups of dedicated citizens persistently fighting for a better world.\n\"Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.\"\n\"It's our choices Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\"\n\"But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\"\n\"Don't let the Muggles get you down.\"\n\"Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.

He was arrested and faces several charges, including murder, kidnapping, and three counts of aggravated assault on law enforcement.\nAfter two years in jail, Harris was evaluated by state doctors who found him to be exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia.\nA year later, the doctors reported that he was incompetent to stand trial.\nMississippi Circuit Court Judge Lee J. Howard attempted to continue Harris' trial several times over the next two years, despite the doctors' original finding, until the doctors restated their finding of incompetence in a 2010 hearing.\nJudge Howard then referred Harris' case to Mississippi's Chancery Court, which handles sanity hearings, among other disputes. But before the Chancery Court could take the case, a Clay County judge ruled that the Chancery Court couldn't hear Harris' case either, since he had pending charges.\nThe ruling created a legal catch-22: One court could not try his charges because of his incompetence, and the other could not address his mental state because of his charges.\n\"The typical legal response is to commit a person found incompetent to stand trial\" to a mental health facility, Stephen J. Morse, professor of Law and of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, told Business Insider.\nThe goal of that commitment is to restore patients' competence \u2014 their ability to rationally understand the charges and court proceedings and to assist their counsel.\nThis \"typical legal response\" appears to have never happened.

Indiana.\nIn that case, the court ruled that the government cannot detain a defendant indefinitely simply because of his or her incompetence to stand trial. Instead, the state can hold the person only for as long as it takes to determine if there is a \"substantial probability\" that he or she will become competent in the \"foreseeable future.\" Otherwise, the state can proceed with civil-commitment procedures \u2014 having the defendant committed to a mental-health facility \u2014 or else release the defendant.\nThat is not how it worked before Jackson v. Indiana.\n\"In the bad old days,\" professor Morse said, if the state couldn't restore people's competence to stand trial, defendants \"languished in these commitments.\"\nMorse noted that Harris' treatment did not appear aimed at restoring his competence and that the \"nature and duration\" of his commitment \u2014 to borrow language from the Supreme Court's ruling \u2014 was not reasonably related to the purpose of that commitment, as the ruling said it must be.\nWhile the Supreme Court's ruling in Jackson v.

However, researchers claim that by combining blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy with traditional rehabilitation efforts, the bone loss could be slowed down and returns to function.\nDr. Lambert and his colleagues are presenting new results of a randomized prospective study initiated and directed by Dr. Patrick McCulloch, MD (PI & Chair of Research for the Department) whereby 23 active young patients (Mean age 23) were studied following ACL reconstruction. Participants were divided into two groups. Both groups received the same rehab protocol, however during select exercises the BFR group exercised with an 80% arterial limb occlusion using an automated tourniquet. Bone mineral density, bone mass, and lean muscle mass were measured using DEXA. The addition of BFR therapy to standard rehab exercises was found to prevent muscle mass loss in the whole leg and thigh in the post-operative limb compared to rehab alone. Intriguingly, the addition of BFR was also observed to minimize losses in bone mineral content and preserve bone density in the limb compared to standard rehab alone. These findings coincided with improved functional outcomes observed by Dr. Corbin Hedt, DPT who oversaw the therapy sessions.\n\"BFR is a suitable additive therapy to ACL rehabilitation for the purposes of minimizing the loss, and enhancing the recovery of muscle, bone, and physical function. While further research is needed to fully illuminate the physiologic mechanisms responsible for our results, these findings likely have wide ranging implications for fields outside of ACL rehab alone such as injury prevention, age-related muscle and bone loss, military rehabilitation, and potentially space flight,\" said Lambert."}

The fishermen involved in the hunt hid behind a tarpaulin from reporters while carrying out the slaughter, which, according to a union representative, was done in a more \"humane\" way than in the past.\nThe marine wildlife conservation organization Sea Shepherd, whose efforts were largely responsible for the amount of media attention paid to the hunt, wasn't convinced. \"A metal rod was stabbed into their spinal cord, where they were left to bleed out, suffocate and die,\" activist Melissa Sehgal told Reuters. \"After a traumatic four days held captive in the killing cove, they experienced violent captive selection, being separated from their family, and then eventually were killed today.\"\nThe group says that this year's was one of the fishermen's most successful in recent history. Of 250 dolphins herded into the cove, 40 were killed, while 52 were kept for sale to aquariums and other customers. The rest were set free.\nJapanese officials pointed out that the number of dolphins killed were well within the government's set quota; unlike commercial whaling, dolphin hunting is not regulated by international law.

I spent six years there, until I went to the YouthBuild in Somerville, Mass. They wanted to start a program in Fall River, so in 2006, I came in as director.\"\nAccording to Moran, YouthBuild is not just a GED program, it's also a job training program. \"When we're working with our students, we're looking at the whole person,\" Moran said. \"We evaluate what their obstacles are, determine ways to get around them and then help them develop a plan to be successful in life.

From clever ways to conserve water at home to the urgent need to tackle pot's environmental footprint, there are so many places that we need to adjust our collective behavior and reduce our water footprint.\nCoal plants, like most other steam-producing electricity-generating plants, typically withdraw and consume water from nearby water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, or oceans, to create steam for turning their turbines. A typical coal plant with a once-through cooling system withdraws between 70 and 180 billion gallons of water per year and consumes 0.36 to 1.1 billion gallons of that water.\nIn 2014, wind energy saved 2.5 billion gallons of water in California by displacing water consumption at the state's fossil-fired power plants, playing a valuable role in alleviating the state's record drought. Wind energy's annual water savings work out to around 65 gallons per person in the state \u2014 or the equivalent of 20 billion bottles of water, according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). According to AWEA, one of wind energy's most overlooked benefits is that it requires virtually no water to produce electricity while almost all other electricity sources evaporate tremendous amounts of water.\nThe drought has taken a toll on California's hydroelectric generation, but wind energy is helping to pick up the slack, according to AWEA. Last year, California's hydroelectric generation was down 7,366 GWh from its 2013 levels. California-based wind generation more than made up for that shortfall, providing 13,776 GWh in 2014.\nRenewable energy critics tend to harp that wind power is unreliable and unpredictable. Here too, however, the reality is a little different. As the AWEA points out, wind power allows hydroelectric generators to conserve their water resources until they are needed, using them only at times of high demand, thus contributing to grid reliability too.\nSo as more and more of us are urged to quit watering our lawns, and to \"let it mellow if it's yellow,\" we would also be wise to consider our energy consumption. Every time we choose a renewable energy provider, every time we switch off the lights, and every time we make efforts to conserve energy and/or support renewables, we are not only cutting carbon emissions \u2014 we are conserving water too.\nAnd in other news, floating solar power plants are also gaining traction as a way to generate energy while reducing water loss from evaporation.\nWe have the solutions.

The NSC is not a fixed office, and appointments don\u2019t always tell who calls the shots. As political scientist Elizabeth Saunders notes, in the George W Bush White House, Colin Powell had a seat on the NSC but no actual power, while in the Nixon White House, the NSC consisted essentially of just Henry Kissinger. And these are the administrations that gave us the invasion of Iraq and the bombing of Cambodia, respectively, so some skepticism is warranted regarding the superior functioning of a more \u201cnormal\u201d NSC.\nEvery US president organises their councils differently, according to their personal preferences. And given Trump\u2019s fondness for conspiracy theories, suspicion of anyone with relevant experience, and predilection for picking fights with countries such as Germany and Australia for no discernible reason, Bannon was \u2013 in a perverse way \u2013 a perfect fit.\nBannon\u2019s job has been to translate Trump\u2019s racial dog whistles into white nationalist sirens, and he is the brains behind such blatantly illegal policies as Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. He\u2019s also served as the face for Trump\u2019s anti-elite populist posturing, a laughingly unconvincing role given his career trajectory spanning Wall Street, Hollywood and the Washington media.\nBannon\u2019s appointment was, indeed, unorthodox by past standards, insofar as the NSC principals committee on which he briefly sat typically includes military and intelligence officials. Bannon\u2019s chief qualification is running a website that publishes stories such as \u201cBirth control makes women unattractive and crazy\u201d. The White House\u2019s explanation is that he was initially appointed to keep an eye on the previous national security adviser, disgraced conspiracy theorist Mike Flynn, which is a strange message to inspire confidence in Trump\u2019s appointments.\nBut then again, his rival for the president\u2019s ear is Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate investor whose chief qualification is marrying well. Both figures have ambiguous official roles, yet enjoy tremendous power. Bannon reportedly heads something called the White House Strategic Initiatives Group, a position so ill-defined that the White House denies it exists. Kushner, as head of a new (and, for now, officially recognised) Office of American Innovation, is tasked with remaking the entire US government, adding to his modest portfolio of overseeing relations with China and Mexico and resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nSo Bannon\u2019s demotion tells us little about the actual power he wields, and will continue to wield informally, at least until Trump tires of federal judges telling him all of Bannon\u2019s ideas violate the constitution. Kushner\u2019s ascent, on the other hand, affirms Trump\u2019s classic banana republic approach to governing: keeping it in the family.\nBoth Bannon\u2019s and Kushner\u2019s appointments are"}

In the 19th century, commercial hunting for prized buffalo robes and hides evolved into a deliberate program of bison eradication.\nThe program was so successful that by the end of the century, Plains tribes had been forced onto reservations and there were fewer than 1,000 bison left in North America. Cattle ranching, urban sprawl, and sport hunting have further squeezed the beast from the land it once dominated.\nThe story of bison survival also parallels the cultural survival of Native American tribes. A traditional Kiowa tale tells of a woman named Old Lady Horse, who saw the last herd of buffalo disappear into the earth, at a place that is still called Hiding Mountain in Oklahoma. According to the story, one day, the bison will once again rise from the earth and repopulate the Great Plains.\nMost of the remaining bison in North America \u2014 around a half million \u2014 are now ranched for their meat and hides. A few thousand exist in semi-captivity, most notably in Yellowstone National Park. But the future of the species remains uncertain. Each year, thousands of bison are slaughtered for sport, more than in any other time since the 19th century.\nCan bison survive and thrive in the 21st century? Many cattle ranchers view the animals as a disease threat for their domestic herds, competition for grazing, and an overall nuisance. Yet modern wildlife conservationists see the bison as the great hope of the Great Plains, hoping to restore wild herds on Native lands \u2014 an undertaking that requires a new understanding of how economy, ecology, and culture can work together to form a way of life.\nThis rich history of human sustenance, exploitation, conservation, and spiritual relations with an icon of wild America shows us that the bison is not only a symbol of a lost world, but may also show us the path to a more sustainable future.\nBig Sky Film Institute, Inc. a/b/n High Plains Films, Inc.\nThis program was produced by Big Sky Film Institute, Inc.\na/b/n High Plains Films, Inc. which is solely responsible for its content.\n\u00a9 2011, Big Sky Film Institute, Inc.\na/b/n High Plains Films, Inc.

Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that regulates the activity of acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter.\nSoldiers were exposed to AChEIs in pesticides, in pills given to blunt the effects of nerve gas, and in nerve gas released during the destruction of an Iraqi weapons depot.

But the original American corn chip, the Frito, was first meant to be a healthy side dish and ingredient for cooking.\nPresented on a gourmet plate or eaten out of the bag the chips came in, Frito Pie is an American standard.\nThis Super Bowl Sunday, millions of Americans will watch the game with bowls of corn-based snacks at their side. Whether you prefer Doritos, Cheetos, or even Funyuns, you owe the pleasure of that crunchy munchy to the humble corn curl that started it all: the Frito.\nThis week, our friends at Smithsonian's Food & Think blog trace the origins of the Frito back to entrepreneur C.E. Doolin's encounter with a Mexican frita, or \"small fried thing,\" made of cornmeal, water, and salt. It was 1932 in San Antonio, and the flavor so inspired Doolin that he found the man responsible for the chips, a Mexican immigrant named Gustavo Olquin, and bought his equipment, recipe, and business contacts for $100.\nOver the years, Doolin expanded the business, mechanized the chip-making process, and invented new flavors and products, like the Cheeto. The Fritos brand went on in 1961 to merge with the Lay potato chip company, another Depression-era family business.\nDoolin died in 1959, but had already paved the way for an explosion of corn-based snacks \u2013 from Cheetos, to Doritos, to Tostitos, and even Funyuns. And like the original Frito, each of those products is essentially just fried cornmeal with flavorings.\nUnlike Fritos, though, Funyuns and Cheetos are extruded: Their puffy texture comes from batter being mixed with hot water under pressure and exposed to air. You can see it and the rest of the Funyun-making process happen inside the factory in this recent video from National Geographic.\nThe Fritos brand pulled in more than $1 billion last year \u2014 much of it from the winning combination of corn, fat and salt. It's a strange legacy for Doolin, who was actually something of a health nut, according to a 2007 story from NPR's Hidden Kitchens series. Although his wife created recipes like Frito Pie and Frito Jets (Fritos smothered in chili and dark chocolate, respectively), Doolin always imagined Fritos as a side dish for meals, something to eat by the handful \u2013 not by the party-size bag.\nDoolin's daughter Kaleta told NPR's Kitchen Sisters that she and her siblings \"were raised vegetarian, and people made fun of me for eating yogurt and figs in my sack lunch.\" She said her father would even bring home bags of Fritos he'd taken off the manufacturing line before they'd been salted.\nThe success of the less-healthy versions of his snacks doesn't seem to have bothered Doolin during his lifetime, though. Were he alive today, he might be happy to see that they've become a staple of Super Bowl parties nationwide.\nBut I wonder how he'd feel about Vanilla-Caramel Corn FRITOS\u00ae Pie."}

Instead of staying at a hotel, you purchase your own vacation home valid for a specific time frame each year. When you purchase a deeded timeshare, you get property rights to the unit. You pay homeowners insurance, property taxes and maintenance fees on the property. If you finance the unit, you also pay your mortgage note plus interest. Failure to pay your bill results in the timeshare management company taking the unit back.\nAfter sending numerous payment demands and receiving nothing in return, the management company of your timeshare can file for foreclosure with the county in which the property is located. In California, the management company files for a Notice of Default, which gives you 90 days to pay your past-due bill. Failure to do so results in a Notice of Sale. You get three weeks to pay the balance due on the property before the trustee sells the property at auction.\nThe timeshare foreclosure process will affect your credit score. A foreclosure entry appears on your credit report for seven years in the Public Records section. You also might have past-due entries and collection agency entries on your report from previous collection efforts. The foreclosure entry alone drops your credit score up to 160 points. With a foreclosure on your report, you may find it difficult to obtain future credit, including another mortgage loan. You may face increased insurance premiums and a slash in credit lines.\nThe IRS requires forgiven debt to be included in your taxable income. The increase in your income level could result in additional taxes owed when you file. Because it was a secondary property, you do not qualify for the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, which only applies to principal residences. You may be able to exclude the forgiven debt if you can prove you are insolvent, which means your debts exceed your assets.\nBefore going through the foreclosure process, talk to the timeshare management company. You may be able to perform a short sale or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Both of these alternatives negatively impact your credit, but the impact is less than a foreclosure. The management company may set up a payment plan or modify the terms of your contract during your financial hardship. You also may sell your timeshare on your own or rent your week out to another person to try and recoup some money.\nThompson, Leigh. \"What Happens When You Foreclose on a Timeshare?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/happens-foreclose-timeshare-51230.html. 19 June 2017."}

The Central Censor Board also raised objections on the scenes and dialogues of the film that are very sensitive,\u201d a senior member of PFCB told The Express Tribune then.\nThe decision to ban Anushka Sharma\u2019s Pari was taken because the content of the horror allegedly promotes black magic, non-Islamic values and anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\u201cPari\u2019s script, dialogues and storyline go against our Islamic values. The concepts within Islam have different ideologies about magic. This film stimulates the viewers in favour of black magic and promotes thoughts that are contradictory to our religion,\u201d stated a senior member of CBFC.\nBaaghi 2 has been produced by Sajid Nadiawala and directed by Ahmed Khan, while the script was written by Hussain Dalaal. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story star Patani will be playing the female lead opposite Tiger with Randeep Hooda, Manoj Bajpayee and Lakshmi Manchu amongst the cast.\nThe film is a sequel to 2016\u2019s Baaghi and features the remake of iconic Ek Do Teen song from 1988\u2019s Tezaab. This super hit track originally featured the legendary Madhuri Dixit but this time, the audience will see Jacqueline Fernandez performing in it.\nAccording to the film\u2019s distributors, Baaghi 2 is a light action thriller with hints of romance. It revolves around Shroff\u2019s character Ronny and his hurdles through life to achieve love. It will also showcase the actor\u2019s martial art skills in full force.\nThe first look of Sohai Ali Abro's 'Motorcycle Girl' is here and boy, does it look cute!"}

Previously, the investor could borrow as much as two million yuan.\n\"Downside bias for Singapore shares is expected to continue this week depending on how Chinese equities perform,\" Mr Yong said. \"The Chinese government recognises that wild and excessive margin lending is a systemic risk to the stability of financial markets, and wants to prevent another meltdown.\"\nSentiment will likely be influenced by Singapore's October non-oil domestic exports (NODX) due to be released tomorrow, and third-quarter gross domestic product numbers on Wednesday.\nInvestors are also expected to watch for the US Federal Reserve's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) minutes, to be released on Thursday morning local time for further clues on the first rate lift-off.\n\"A rate hike starting in December is a foregone conclusion.

{"idx": "21361", "prompt": "Continue the following text: SEVERAL years ago, I met a man at a tennis club who belligerently claimed the court for which my sister and I had signed. His attitude was so hostile that I have never forgotten him.\nWe were of the same race, religion and nationality, so I could not take his attitude for racial or religious bigotry or jingoism. We had never met before, although he was acquainted with my sister, and so I could not take his obvious and intense dislike personally.\nIt felt very strange to be the object of such powerful negative feelings from someone I didn't even know. I wondered if this guy might be a misogynist: it wasn't just me he hated, possibly, but women - all of us.\nBut how unfair! Why should any man despise any woman without knowing her individually, and knowing that she personally deserves his rancor?\nMy guess is that there are two sources of such feeling.\nOne dates to the caveman days. Some male cave people were sitting around the fire one night when one of them mentioned that he had observed a strange phenomenon: The woman who shared his cave bled.\nMonthly, he noticed, she made small packets of dried leaves and grass for herself, put them close to her private parts and then discarded them. Although she was careful to hide these packets in the earth, he was curious enough to dig one up.\nTo his amazement, it was drenched with blood!\nDid his fellow cavemen notice this phenomenon? That a woman might bleed copiously at regular time intervals - in fact, in rotation with the moon - and not die?\nOthers began to observe their women and, sure enough, it was true: Nearly all of the women of the tribe bled with the phases of the moon and lived! What did it mean? There was only one answer: Woman had great and secret powers. Did she not also swell greatly and expel babies from her body, both male and female, periodically? Surely, she was both powerful and mysterious.\nShe was to be feared. And controlled, lest she use her powers on the men.\nAnd so, friends, to this day there are men who hate women. They fear our power and use theirs to keep us down so that we will not overwhelm them.\nThe other source for misogyny is that most of us are raised, for the most part, by women - our mothers. This person is both wonderful and terrible, someone to be adored and feared. She has the powers of life and death over us, literally.\nIf we have any personality at all, early on we are able to decide for ourselves what we want and do not want. And this lady often thwarts us. Sometimes, she even inflicts physical pain on us; sometimes, merely humiliation. But always - because she is bigger and smarter and more experienced - she wins, overpowers us, puts us down.\nFor female children, this is not too terrible. We identify with our mother and assume that one day we will have her powers over our own little people so that we can work out with them our frustration over her treatment of us.\nBut for the male child, it's not quite that easy. He cannot identify with this creature, for she is not of his kind. He will never have the opportunity to rectify the great injustice of her power over him.\nHe may grow to be a man and take on the world of men, but he will be forever vanquished by mother. Thus, another source of powerful negative feelings for women in general.\nI wonder if my guesses have any validity.\nAnd whether, if I am correct in my judgments, merely learning the sources of his hatred will pac"}

The sleepy hamlet has had just one great story to tell in all these years -- that Lord Rama had prayed at the Shri Ambegalu Shri Krishna temple before he set out to Lanka to battle Ravana.\nThere was a great deal of confusion regarding this place as far as stories of Prema Sai Baba were concerned.\nEarlier, it was being said that he would be born in a village called Gunaparthi near Mandya, but now it is official that the reincarnation would happen at Doddamallur.\nThe villagers are in a frenzy. They are aware that if this happens then their village will become hugely important and what is more they all believe that Sathya Sai Baba's reincarnation will be born in their village.\nPrema Sai Baba, according to the discourses given by Sathya Sai Baba, would be the third and the last incarnation of Sai Baba, the first being Shiridi Sai Baba.\nThis has also been documented in a book written by a lady by the name Kannamma who herself is a great devotee of Sathya Sai Baba.\nNow, only till will tell if Prema Sai will be born or is this just a myth?\nThe search for Prema Sai's parents first began five years ago. A team had been dispatched from Puttaparthi to find out if a lady by the name Kasthuri existed in this village. According to Baba, this lady would be the mother of Prema Sai.\nHowever, at that time they were sent back by the villagers stating that there was no such thing happening.\nThe people from Puttaparthi have been showing a great deal of interest in Doddamallur.\nWhat is more ironical is that two months back, Baba himself had dispatched a team of around 700 members to Doddamallur. The villagers were a bit taken aback to see such a large contingent.\nThe group headed straight to the temple at Doddamallur and offered 'Laksharchana' and 'Kumkumarchana' pujas, which were conducted for nearly 10 hours. Temple trust Chairman Venu confirmed this.\nVenu goes on to add that this was the moment that they are all waiting for. They have no reason to believe that this will not happen and the whole village thinks that the prophecy by Baba will come true.\nBut when Venu was reminded that as per the prophecy Prema Sai would be born in 2024, he said that there is no clarity on that.\nWhat we were given to understand is that there is no date specified for the birth of Prema Sai and so it could happen anytime in the near future, he said, ading,"}

Everything I did revolved around racing.\n\"I'd deposited just over $300,000 into my account, I don't know how much I took out, but it was a cycle.\nAllen Christensen has bravely opened up about his struggle with gambling.\n\"I'd say definitely hundreds of thousands of dollars (were lost), at the track, at the TAB.\n\"Biggest outlay was $18,000. The next race I acted like it never happened. (The) biggest amount I won was around $50,000 in a day, but I think I lost a lot of that over the next week.\"\n\"He came knocking on the door and told me he'd been hearing things about me owing money to some people,\" Christensen said. \"(He said) 'We need to help you'.\nChristensen was soon in talks with the Brisbane Lions and admitted \"absolutely everything\" to the Queensland club.\n\"I don't know if I could have gone cold turkey straight away if I didn't leave Geelong,\" he said.\n\"I'm forever grateful to Brisbane for taking a chance on me at the time, there was a lot of s*** being spoken about me. Ever since I got the trade to Brisbane I was able to remove those triggers from my life and become that person I wanted to be.\"\nUnder coach Chris Fagan's guidance in 2019, Brisbane is hotly tipped to rise from its recent woes, with some believing the Lions can secure a first finals spot since 2009."}

We don\u2019t even know, at this point, whether he will seek re-election.\nBut at Townhall, Kevin McCullough is undeterred. He offers five reasons why Trump will sweep to re-election in 2020, carrying 40 states. McCullough\u2019s reasons are cogent: foreign policy dominance, stronger armed forces yielding a safer world, the strongest hold on his base in recent years, and the administration\u2019s remarkable record on jobs.\nDriven largely on great home-ownership numbers, George W. Bush garnered the modern era\u2019s greatest numbers of African American voters. It was all of 11%.\nThe lock-hold that the American left has handcuffed the African American vote with is both cultural and economic. And while President Trump will \u2014 like all GOP Presidents in the era \u2014 not likely gain the majority of African American votes, even an increase of 15-20% of their overall votes would trigger a seismic landslide. \u2026 Consider that President Obama oversaw a rapid decline in the lives of African Americans. Then consider that no group has benefitted more from Trump reforms, deregulation, and job creation initiatives than the nation\u2019s African Americans.\nBut also consider the cultural impact President Trump is making on the issue of prison reform, cracking down on dangerous gang activity (of which minorities are the overwhelming majority of victims,) and pardoning African Americans wrongfully imprisoned, and there is a cultural shift occurring that no one is yet reporting. That he is even reaching out to the very sports figures who have opposed him and embracing cultural figures and giving them audience to hear their hearts and minds in order to achieve justice on some social level\u2014is a picture that African American communities are unaccustomed to seeing.\nPresident Obama went to black churches, put in affected speech patterns, and bemoaned conditions. By contrast President Trump invites them to the White House, listens to their legitimate complaints and plots solutions. I would not be surprised if he were to break 30% of African American support in 2020.\nMcCullough doesn\u2019t mention her, but the person most responsible for shaking up the African-American community is Candace Owens, with a huge assist from Kanye West, and now West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian. But the pro-Trump movement among African-Americans is not based in Hollywood (unlike the incoherent anti-Trump hysteria that we saw most recently emanating from the washed-up Robert De Niro). The pro-Trump sentiment is solidly based in reality: this administration has done more for African-Americans, mostly through economic growth, than any administration in a long time.\nThen there is the free speech/free thought aspect that Owens and West emphasize. A great many blacks resent the Democrats\u2019 smug assumption that their votes are locked in, more or less forever. Can we have a little diversity here? It won\u2019t take much: if 30% of blacks vote for Trump in 2020, the Democrats are in deep trouble.\nSo, yeah, it is way too early to tell. But reading the tea leaves today, it appears likely that President Trump will dispatch whomever the Democrats nominate in 2020 with relative ease.\nPAUL ADDS: McCullough says that Trump is making a \u201ccultural impact\u201d that no one is reporting by supporting prison reform, pardoning African-Americans \u201cwrongfully imprisoned,\u201d and reaching out to sports figures who have"}

Kim Reynolds for treating Iowa taxpayers like a bunch of fools. The administration has again failed to produce credible estimates and methodology on calculating supposed savings from the privatization of Medicaid. Yet it continues to insist handing over the $4.8 billion health insurance program to for-profit companies has magically and inexplicably saved millions.\nThe latest example of seemingly plucking numbers out of thin air came in the form of a letter from DHS to Sen. Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, who asked the agency for a current savings estimate. The letter claimed a total savings of $411.4 million, including $140.9 million in state money. There was no information about where these numbers came from. No information on how the amount was calculated. No information about how so-called \"cost avoidance\" was realized.\nMore confusion ensued when a Des Moines Register reporter asked follow-up questions about the period of time this savings was to have occurred.\nWhat the public does know about Medicaid since former Gov. Terry Branstad privatized it in 2016: Low-income Iowans have lost access to health services, while the managed care companies beg for and receive more and more taxpayer money.\nLess than a year after private insurers took over, the state provided them $33 million more than was originally negotiated. Then came the increase in payments to the companies after secret contract negotiations with the state in 2017. The insurers pocket millions of public dollars for administration that could otherwise be spent on health care for Iowans. Lawmakers recently appropriated an additional $55 million to Medicaid, even though the expense could be much greater after the state wraps up another round of clandestine negotiations with the insurers.\nRather than saving taxpayers a penny, privatized Medicaid may well be costing us more.

And she gave those women a voice.\nPlanned Parenthood is a health care provider that has taken on the responsibility and cost of mounting legal challenges to misogynistic laws, including the fetal heartbeat bill recently signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, which will essentially ban abortion in Iowa if implemented. Unlike other health providers, it fights to try to ensure patients have access to legal health services.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration).\nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: Prime Minister David Cameron urged parliament to vote on Wednesday (December 2) to approve British air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria after months of wrangling over whether enough opposition Labour lawmakers would back military action. \"The question before the house today, is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by ISIL. Let me be clear from the outset, this is not about whether we want to fight terrorism, it is about it is about how best we do that,\" he said at the start of a 10-hour debate due to culminate in a vote at around 2100 GMT. He added: \"The question is this - do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands from where they are plotting to kill British people, or do we sit back and wait for them?\" However, Cameron faced a possible stiffening of opposition in Labour ranks after media reports he urged his Conservative Party lawmakers at a private meeting late on Tuesday not to vote with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \"and a bunch of terrorist sympathisers\". Many lawmakers demanded Cameron apologise for his remark. Cameron has said he believes British warplanes, which have been bombing Islamic State targets in Iraq for more than a year, should also be tackling the group in Syria rather than \"sub-contract\" national security to other countries. He said that any air strikes on IS in Syria would not increase the likelihood of militant attacks on Britain. \"If there is an attack on the UK in the coming weeks or months, there will be those who try to say it has happened because of our air strikes, I do not believe that will be the case. Daesh have been trying to attack us for the last year, as we know from the seven different plots that our security services have foiled. The terrorist threat level to the UK was raised to severe last August in light of the threat from Daesh, meaning attack is highly likely,\" he said. The November 13 Islamic State attacks that killed 130 people in Paris gave momentum to Cameron's push for air strikes, but critics have questioned whether the action would significantly add to international efforts to defeat the group. Keen to avoid a repeat of a humiliating 2013 parliamentary defeat over plans to bomb the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Cameron had made it clear he would not bring a vote to parliament if he did not think he could win it. That appeared more likely after Corbyn, a veteran anti-war campaigner who says strikes would be ineffective and kill civilians, said on Monday he would allow his lawmakers to vote according to their conscience rather than directing them to follow his lead."}

Still, confronting such a challenge might help address the roots of many ills, shedding light on rule-breaking that can have can have important consequences for society.\nResearchers focused on social class \u2014 a person&apos;s relative standing in society in terms of wealth, occupational prestige and education. Lower-class folk, living with fewer resources, might seem more driven to behave unethically to improve their lot, the researchers suspected. However, upper-class individuals, having greater resources, might have more latitude to focus solely on themselves, giving rise to unethical behavior.\nIn two tests conducted in a natural setting, scientists examined a simple example of unethical behavior on the road \u2014 how likely it would be for drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area to cut in front of other vehicles at a busy four-way intersection and cut off pedestrians at a crosswalk. They estimated the social class of drivers based on vehicle make, age and appearance, and discovered that drivers of upper-class cars cut off other cars and pedestrians more often.\nFour lab tests that included undergraduates at Berkeley and national online samples of adults revealed those who considered themselves upper class had greater tendencies to make unethical decisions. This included unrightfully stealing something, lying in a negotiation, cheating at a game of chance to boost their chances of winning cash or endorsing unethical behavior at work, such as stealing cash, receiving bribes and overcharging customers.\n\"This isn&apos;t just a case of upper socioeconomic people being more willing to admit that they would be unethical,\" Piff said. \"We actually measure cheating behavior \u2014 not just &apos;Would you do something unethical&apos; but &apos;Do you do it?&apos;\"\n\"I was surprised at the consistency and strength of all these effects \u2014 upper-class individuals often acted unethically three to four times more often than lower-class individuals,\" Piff told LiveScience.\nAre some rich people inherently evil?\nAnother lab experiment revealed that unethical behavior was not necessarily inherent to individuals. The researchers had volunteers compare themselves with people with the most or least money, education and respected jobs, thereby subtly putting them into the mindset of someone with a relatively low or high socioeconomic status. When then presented with a jar of candy ostensibly for kids in a nearby lab, those made to feel as if they were upper class took more candy that would otherwise go to children, findings that suggest the experience of higher social class might nudge one to act unethically.\nThese findings dovetail with other studies that also suggest more unethical behavior in the upper class. \"A 2008 study of shoplifting found that upper-income and more educated participants were way more likely to have reported shoplifting in their lives \u2014 that&apos;s self-reported data, admittedly, but still interesting,\" Piff said. \"Also, upper-income individuals are more likely to report having sped or breaking the speed limit.\"\n\"Juveniles of upper socioeconomic status are just as likely to engage in del"}

So if your internet is coming from Opt-Online or through a compatible Apple device, then \"just the internet\" applies.\nSTEP 1: Apple customers can subscribe to HBO NOW by downloading the app on their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch or directly on Apple TV using their iTunes account.\nSTEP 2: Customers purchase an HBO NOW subscription directly in-app through Apple for $14.99 per month, following the limited time, introductory 30 day free trial period.\nSTEP 3: Upon registering with Apple, subscribers will set up HBO NOW login credentials, enabling them to watch their favorite HBO programming on their iOS devices as well as on HBONOW.com via PC or Mac.\nThose on the fence about which set-top box they want to get to handle their subscription streaming video services may be swayed by Apple TV being the first of them to offer HBO Now, as it's one more reason to appreciate the Apple device. Apple TV can not only be used for HBO Go or HBO Now, but you can also use it with Netflix, Yahoo Screen, Hulu, Crackle and other apps, in addition to streaming any video or music content you've purchased through iTunes. I've found Apple TV to be much faster and easier to use for Netflix and other streaming content than my Blu-ray player was. The only feature I wish it had is compatibility with Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video, but given Amazon has its own set-top box (and stick), it's no surprise that Apple TV would exclude those options.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the Apple option for HBO Now, is that you can set up an HBO Now account through the Apple device, but from the above instructions, it sounds like you'll be able to log into the service through your computer browser. So you can register for HBO Now on your iPhone, but still watch the content on your computer, if that's your preference.\nSTEP 1: Cablevision\u2019s Optimum Online customers can purchase an HBO NOW subscription by ordering the service online at Optimum.net/HBONOW or by calling 866-262-9329 for $14.99 per month, following the limited time, introductory 30 day free trial period.\nSTEP 2: After purchasing their HBO NOW subscription, Optimum Online customers can access the service by downloading the HBO NOW app on their Apple TV or iOS device or by going to HBONOW.com. Customers then select \u201cOptimum\u201d from the drop down menu of providers and sign in using their Optimum username and password.\nSTEP 3: Upon registering with Optimum, subscribers will set up HBO NOW login credentials, enabling them to watch their favorite HBO programming on their Apple TV or iOS devices as well as on HBONOW.com via PC or Mac.\nThis option"}

As for what has been circulated by the media, they have even mentioned that I was a Christian and converted to Islam after we were married and that I named myself Fatima al-Zahra. This is untrue since I originally belong to Muslim parents while my children bear Muslim names.\nA: Have the Spanish security authorities permitted you to contact Taysir?\nFZ: Since his detention and the beginning of investigations he was permitted only once to call me and the children. The next time he was permitted to make a recorded call for only two minutes. This call had only worried me more about his health.\nYou are aware that he suffers from backache besides his heart illness. The strain he felt was apparent in his voice when he talked to me.\nA: How do you respond to the accusations levelled against Taysir? Had he really been close to the Taliban movement during his stay in Afghanistan?\nFZ: Taysir only went to Afghanistan after he joined Aljazeera in 1999 as a correspondent and manager of the channel's office in Kabul. He reflected the suffering of the Afghani people to the world through Aljazeera.\nI would like to state clearly here that Taysir has been a staff member at the Granada Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies since 1996 and up to today. This institute is mainly designated for preparing studies that help bridge the gaps between any conflicting parties in the world as well as preparing studies on Islamic fundamentalist movements.\nHis concern was focused on North African and Arab and Islamic regions since he is a Muslim Arab. He was then assigned by the institute to prepare studies on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan along with what they see as fundamentalism and extremism in order to reach a means for closing the gaps between conflicting parties. What I mean here is the conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance.\nThe institute had also planned to host a delegation from the Taliban to discuss with them ways of reaching a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.\nBut some media organisations then accused Taysir of collaboration with the Taliban.\nI do not like the accusation that Taysir collaborated with the Taliban or al-Qaida. I am challenging anyone who can give a single piece of evidence to support this accusation. He was deeply sympathetic to the Afghanis for what they have suffered from misery, subjugation and bitter internal conflict.\nTaysir had repeatedly tried to contact some figures from the Northern Alliance but had no response from them. What he sought from his contacts was to convey the scene on the other side through Aljazeera Channel.\nHe also tried to mediate between the conflicting parties in the context of the role he played at the institute. That took place in the year 2000 before the resumption of hostilities and fighting between the two parties, as they usually begin fighting during the summer.\nThe greatest evidence of Aljazeera's impartiality on this matter, with Taysir being the channel's representative in Afghanistan, and an evident refutation of the accusations against Aljazeera of sympathising with the Taliban, was the channel's airing of an interview it had with the leader of the"}

Church leaders say the demand rate hurts them more than other businesses because they use the vast majority of their power on only one day of the week, thus ensuring a large peak demand.\nBecause their power demand is so much higher on Sunday than it is on the other days, the demand rate for churches is much higher for them than it is for businesses that use essentially the same amount of power each day. Regular use means a smaller peak. Consequently, the demand charge is smaller.\nCity commissioners tentatively voted Feb. 25 to exempt the churches from the demand rate awaiting final approval by the PSC.\n\"The PSC had no comment, so they essentially approved the exemption,\" City Manager Rex Taylor said Monday.\nCommissioners will give the measure final approval in their meeting next Monday, although Taylor said the new churches were placed on the general commercial rate May 1.

It's about as easy as any other drug. You just gotta ask for it,\" says Nick, who asked that his last name not be used. \"It's easy to get.\"\nLaw enforcement officials say stories like these highlight a disturbing trend they're seeing across the country. Most alarming, they say, is not only is ecstasy back after years of decline, but most of the time it's laced with meth.\nAlmost 5.5 million pills of ecstasy were seized in the states bordering Canada in 2006 (the most recent year for which full statistics are available) -- an almost tenfold increase since 2003, top drug enforcement officials say.\n\"They drive them in. They bring them in by boat. They bring them in by plane. They bring them across by people just carrying them across their back much like the southwest border,\" says Ed Duffy, an assistant special agent in charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration's northern region.\nBecause meth is less expensive than ecstasy, mixing the two saves producers money, but it also makes it more dangerous, officials say.\nEcstasy can cause sharp increases in body temperature and can result in liver, kidney or heart damage. When laced with meth, officials say, the combination can cause more severe harm because meth can damage brain functions, as well as lead to an increase in breathing, irregular heartbeats and increased blood pressure. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says meth -- or methamphetamine -- is a \"very addictive stimulant drug.\"\nLaw enforcement officials say European countries cracked down on ecstasy production in the early 2000s and manufacturing moved to Canada. And now, Asian gangs in Canada have been smuggling the chemicals needed to make ecstasy from China and India, officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police tell CNN.\nFinished pills are then pushed in vast quantities into the United States, a flow that's difficult to stop because of the vast, largely unpoliced border, officials say.\nThose on the front lines in Canada and the United States say they are working closely and sharing intelligence to try to stem the flow. Canadian officials also say they have a good relationship with Chinese law enforcement.\nThe Mounties have created teams across Canada focused on identifying the criminal organizations producing ecstasy and meth and say they have shut down 17 labs in the past year.\n\"The labs that we're finding now are what you refer to in the United States as super labs. We call them economic-based labs,\" says Raf Souccar, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nEach lab produces more than 10 pounds of ecstasy in one batch, he says. \"It's not your mom and pop operation. It tells me that it is criminal organizations that are, yes, more sophisticated and producing it for profit as opposed to producing it to fuel their habit.\"\nIt's then finding its way into schools, like Nick's in Albany, New York.\n\"I have been seeing an increase in pill use among the teens in general,\" says Greg Reid, a counselor at Equinox Community Services Agency, which sponsors drug counseling and other"}
{"idx": "21405", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: PAIN is one of the basic defense mechanisms created by Almighty Allah to protect us from danger. If there is a problem somewhere in our bodies, and if that problem is growing, then our body informs us through pain. Nerve cells establish communication in transmitting stimuli to the brain by releasing various chemicals. These chemicals\u2019 production is ensured by certain proteins called enzymes.\nFeelings of pain and discomfort are warnings that a tissue in the body has been damaged. Almighty Allah has created several inter-related systems that all work together to allow that system to function in a flawless manner.\nThere are nerve endings beneath our skin and tissues and some of these are sensitive to pain. For example, we feel pain when we bump into the corner of a table, tread on a piece of broken glass, when the temperature changes as we hold our hand above a flame, when a hammer hits our thumb, when we cut ourselves or when any abnormal event takes place in any of our internal organs.\nAlmighty Allah has created several million of our neuroreceptors in such a way as to be able to perceive pains and to be stimulated in proportion to the severity of the blows suffered. When cells in the body are injured they release a chemical known as \u201cprostaglandin.\u201d This chemical, which increases pain signals, has a major effect on the nerve endings that feel pain.\nAs soon as the nerve endings are stimulated by this chemical they immediately transmit pain messages to the brain. The brain perceives the pain depending on the location and intensity of the incoming message, and by triggering the speech center enables us and those around us to be aware that something is wrong.\nFeelings of pain and discomfort have a vital place in our lives because without these it would be impossible for us to know there is a problem anywhere in our bodies. Had Almighty Allah not created these sensations, human beings might often be in grave danger. For example, someone might lose a lot of blood if he did not feel pain when he cut himself, and this might become life-threatening.\nOne might not realize one had broken a bone in one\u2019s ankle in an accident, and continuing to use the injured ankle might damage the bone even further and lead to permanent disability.\nIf pain did not warn us beforehand, numerous diseases could advance, starting out as some minor or trivial pain, but then going on to have serious consequences. Pain is therefore the first and only symptom of many diseases. For example, without stomach pain we might not realize we had appendicitis, or without pain or tightness in the chest we might not know we were having a heart attack.\nIf we did not feel pain when we fall over or lift a heavy load, we would continue to strain our joints and muscles and might worsen the degree of injury.\nAs revealed by Allah, \u201c\u2026It may be that you hate something when it is good for you and it may be that you love something when it is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know\u201d (Qur\u2019an, 2:216), pain, which appears to be evil and that causes us discomfort is, in fact, actually a very good thing.\nAlmighty Allah has created a very powerful pain killing system in the human body. The organ that feels pain in the body is the brain. In the event of pain, the brain releases a very powerful pain killing chemical called endorphin. These suppress neurotransmitters in the area of the brain that feels pain and in the spinal bulb, thus preventing or reducing pain sensations.\nThe reason why people may not be aware that they have been"}

Performing in local bands until he was eighteen, his passion for music started early. In his early twenties, LaManna took on the production side. At the time, the music industry was experiencing a bit of a renaissance. With digital media becoming more accessible to the masses in the early 2000s, independent artists were empowered to produce their own music videos using camcorders, not much unlike making home videos. At the time, LaManna says MTV was the one video distribution giant in the world and they were only working with major labels. The other option at the time was getting MPBs and onto public and cable shows like Wayne's World. That's when LaManna got involved in the marketing side of the music industry. At the time, publicists and marketing professionals were vital for artists to get their music videos in front of the eyes of potential fans.\nAs LaManna's career blossomed over the years, the music industry saw another change. With Youtube becoming a powerful resource for artists to get their music in front of fans, LaManna predicted that one day, his job will be replaced by hashtags, followers, and views and he started thinking about what it was that would replace him. \"I had a choice: to be replaced or to own the technology that was going to be my replacement,\" he said. Knowing that artists would need a way to protect their content, LaManna developed Vydia which has now become one of the fastest growing companies this year, ranking on the coveted Inc. 500 list - coming in at #8 in the media category.. LaManna tells us, that 2018 will bring much more growth with the intention of doubling their employees.\nLearn more about Vydia here.\nIt easy to see why the company grows so quickly. LaManna himself is a force of nature, a quick thinker, and innovator. Developing more realizations and ideas on the spot over the course of our hour long interview, I was quite shocked at how quickly he thinks. He told me Vydia came to him when he realized other online platforms were going to start embracing video content more and more. He recalls talking to a potential business partner years ago. He predicted that Facebook would get involved in video content and that it would be a leading platform for artists to use for self-promotion. At the time, it was hard to imagine that Facebook, the place where your great Aunt goes to post photos of her cat, could be so influential in the success of independent artists, but in line with LaManna's prediction in 2017 we're seeing most content consumed on Facebook and a big change in the way consumers experience music. Everyone from Spotify to Facebook to Instagram seems to be switching over to videos. It now almost feels necessary to use a video as the medium to promote your music. This is something most industry professionals didn't pay close attention to, but Roy had his eyes on the shift all along.\nRoy wants artists to feel empowered. He says, that there is a big misconception with artists that they need representation or a label or a publisher to be successful; however, he argues that signing with someone in most cases is just giving away your rights. He explains that not enough musicians and artists know their value. He encourages artists to look at their music and ideas as intellectual property and to truly grasp an understanding of the way the industry works. He told me, \"You can do it all yourself. You own"}

Walking through a field of electricity, Bowie\u2019s Nikola Tesla greets Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), conducts and produces electricity with his body, and then offers the magician a meal. Even though the real Tesla, a famous germaphobe, probably wouldn\u2019t have shaken Angier\u2019s hand, it\u2019s still a wonderful exchange between the two characters.\nBelow, Christopher Nolan remembers David Bowie and the time they spent together.\nThe experience of having him on set was wonderful. Daunting, at first. He had a level of charisma beyond what you normally experience, and everyone really responded to it. I\u2019ve never seen a crew respond to any movie star that way, no matter how big. But he was very gracious and understood the effect he had on people. Everyone has fond memories of getting to spend time with him or speak to him for a little bit. I only worked with him briefly\u2014four or five days\u2014but I did manage to sneak a couple moments to chat with him, which are very treasured memories of mine. Normally when you meet stars, no matter how starry they are, when you see them as people, some of that mystique goes away. But not with David Bowie. I came away from the experience being able to say I was still his biggest fan, and a fan who had the very miraculous opportunity to work with him for a moment. I loved the fact that after having worked with him, I had just the same fascination with his talent and his charisma. I thought that was quite magical.\nFew films have been able to capture David Bowie\u2019s charisma, but Oshima\u2019s wartime drama seems tailor-made for his talents. Tom Conti has rarely been such a sympathetic guide for the audience\u2019s emotions.\nLong after Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, Nolan got a terrific performance from David Bowie.

Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., speaks during the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Md., on Thursday March 6, 2014.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) delivered a fairly long speech at the Library of Congress yesterday, fleshing out his vision for making America \u201cconfident again\u201d through a far-right approach to governing. There wasn\u2019t anything particularly surprising about the remarks, and the Republican leader conceded his vision won\u2019t be implemented so long as President Obama is in office.\nBut there was one part of the speech that jumped out at me as noteworthy. On health care policy, the new Speaker said \u201cthe other side\u201d \u2013 presumably, Democrats \u2013 opposes giving consumers choices, while Republicans want to encourage \u201cinsurance companies to compete for your business.\u201d It\u2019s an odd line of attack, since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchange marketplaces were specifically designed to invite insurers to compete for consumers\u2019 business. I\u2019m not sure how he could have missed this detail.\nLet\u2019s just skip the usual points about the efficacy of the ACA, the law\u2019s many successes, and the millions of Americans benefiting from its implementation. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s no credible reason to try \u2013 or even want to try, really \u2013 to replace \u201cevery word\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\nAs the Republican leader sees it, there\u2019s no time to waste. The problems in the health care system are so great that the Speaker believes it\u2019s \u201curgent\u201d for his party to present their conservative alternative \u2013 nearly six years after the ACA was signed into law, nearly two years after the ACA was fully implemented. Now Ryan\u2019s serious about his party\u2019s replacement plan.\nIt\u2019s hard for even the most charitable observers not to laugh. On June 17, 2009, then-Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the House Republican leadership at the time, publicly declared that he was helping craft his party\u2019s alternative to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI guarantee you we will provide you with a bill,\u201d he said six and a half years ago.\nThe Huffington Post\u2019s Jeffrey Young has gotten quite a bit of mileage out of a joke, documenting all of the many, many times in recent years GOP officials have said they\u2019re finally ready to unveil their big health care solution, only to quietly fail every time.\nWe were told 2014 would be different. In April 2014, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said his party\u2019s plan was nearly done, but was being delayed \u201cat least a month.\u201d That was 20 months ago.\nThat was 11 months ago.\nAs of yesterday, however, Ryan believes the issue is \u201cso urgent\u201d that we\u2019ll see the Republican \u201cplan\u201d in 2016. And who knows, maybe we will. I wouldn\u2019t bet on it, but anything\u2019s possible.\nBut revisiting a piece from February, I think we can safely assume that the House GOP alternative to \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 if it ever exists \u2013 is going to be cover-your-eyes horrible. How can I know that? Because in order to actually reform the pre-2010 health care system \u2013 \u201creplacing every word\u201d of the ACA \u2013 policymakers have to commit to extensive public investments, expansive government regulation of the insurance industry, and a commitment to help struggling families receive guaranteed benefits.\nIn other"}

{"idx": "21419", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara yesterday said accountability and prudent management of resources remained critical to making progress as well as meeting the various demands for improved infrastructure in the maritime sector of the economy.\nHe expressed dismay that the sector was yet to attain the desired and expected status of becoming the hub for international freight and trade in West Africa.\nSpeaking at the opening of a three-day investigative public hearing by the House Committee on Ports, Harbours and Waterways, chaired by Hon. Patrick Asadu (PDP, Enugu), he regretted that the maritime industry has failed to attract the required local and foreign investment in-flow which is proportionate to its contribution to both the Nigerian and West African economy, despite its great potential and enormous investment opportunities.\nQuoting statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in March 2018, Dogara pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s Ports dropped down the global ratings basically due to bad infrastructure.\nHe noted that major competitors in the region, including Port of Lome in Togo, Port of Dakar in Senegal, and the Port of Cotonou in Benin Republic, all delivered better efficient services than the Nigerian Ports.\n\u201cThis is really not acceptable,\u201d he said.\nHe identified some of the problems hindering the performance of the country\u2019s ports to include bad infrastructure, high cost of doing business and low draught at a lot of our major waterways.\nHe reiterated the need to dredge the nation\u2019s port channels to increase traffic to the various ports and invariably increase economic productivity.\nDogara said:\u201dIf we have cargoes going up north to places such as Kaduna, Kano and Maiduguri, such cargoes would not need to go through Lagos, which is already so congested.\n\u201cBut for this to happen, the channels of other ports need to be dredged. Reports have it that the Lagos water channel is about 14.5 meters deep, while the Port Harcourt and Calabar channels are less than 10 meters deep, which limits their capacity to receive big cargo ships. This explains why there is so much congestion at the Lagos Port.\nThe speaker, however, expressed hope that the hearing will proffer lasting solutions to the problems.\nA total of seven maritime related motions gave room for the public hearing, including Guaranteed Minimum Tonnage at the Nigeria Ports, Extra Budgetary Spending and other Financial Improprieties by Terminal Operators and Service Providers engaged by the Nigerian Ports Authority among others."}

{"idx": "21422", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Very few sports games apps use baseball as the focus activity. Perhaps it\u2019s because hitting a ball as far as you can over and over again would be laborious \u2013 as an app, at least. However tedious such a game might sound, Baseball boy manages to successfully make it interesting, and worth your time \u2013 although, it\u2019s certainly not the game of baseball we\u2019d all recognise.\nIn Baseball Boy, players take the role of a small boy with a peculiarly large and square head. He holds a bat, and in front of him is a constantly swaying arrow moving between a scale of red to yellow. The aim of the game is simple: tap the screen when the arrow hits red in the middle and our quadrilateral character will hit the baseball as far and straight as possible. Tap slightly to the left in the yellow areas, though, and your ball will veer off out of peripheral vision. Even if you hit the perfect shot, there are cars, buildings, and trees in the way to prevent you from reaching your highest score.\nFor every shot you make, money will be rewarded. The further you hit the ball, the better the reward. This money can then be spent of improving your character\u2019s strength, the speed the ball travels in the air, its bounciness, and the finances earned whilst offline. The former three all directly impact how far you can hit the ball, ultimately enabling you to gain more and more cash as you progress.\nYour personal best will be marked, giving you an indication of how far you need to hit your next shot. However, this doesn\u2019t only act as a personal incentive, but it allows you to see how close you are to the game\u2019s next milestone. Surpass each milestone (or level), and you\u2019ll be rewarded a brand new bat, ranging from a banana to a fish. Unlockables currently finish as 17,000m, which you\u2019ll soon realise takes a heft amount of playtime to reach.\nBaseball Boy is an enjoyable take on the sport. It doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously with its Minecraft-like block visuals and silly unlockable bats. Upgrades can be achieved nearly every other shot, so at no point does it feel like you\u2019re having to grind just to make your character hit the ball further. The ability to earn in-game currency when offline is helpful, meaning you\u2019re not required to play 24/7 just to improve.\nIt doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously with its Minecraft-like block visuals and silly unlockable bats.\nThe only issue is with advertising. In the gold mine that is the app industry, it\u2019s understandable why so many companies sell themselves to adverts. But in Baseball Boy, adverts appear every two shots. That\u2019s too often. We\u2019ve come to recognise and accept that advertising is a part of the industry, but there\u2019s still a limit as to how much is too much, and Baseball Boy surpasses it.\nIf that doesn\u2019t faze you, though, then Baseball Boy is an enjoyable sports game with a twist. It may not be true to the game of baseball, but, like a lot of sports mashups, some might find it better than the real thing."}

Nintendo's new Switch hybrid can hit high graphics preset in 1080p in Unreal Engine 4 while in docked console mode, and medium GFX preset in 720p in handheld mode.\nThe Nintendo Switch is expected to deliver varying performance across its two form factors, handheld and console mode. When taken on the go in its handheld mode, the Switch may underclock the GPU on its onboard Tegra processor to just 302MHz to ensure optimum battery life and heat mitigation, whereas the CPU is expected to stay at a steady 1050MHz. The Switch tablet handheld also reportedly features a 6.2-inch 10-point capacitive touch display locked at 720p, which would account for the GPU downclocking as well.\nWhen the Switch is docked for home console play, it will be fully unlocked in every respect, with its GPU hitting full perf for full 1080p gaming on an HDTV.\nWe also expect the Switch to have unique slide-on controllers that are designed to compliment specific games, and Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima corroborated these claims by saying the Switch will have an \"array of different hardware add-ons and accessories.\""}

Sure enough by the time it was finished the two teams had combined for seven home runs.\nAlthough a couple of these shots would have been out of Yellowstone Park, contributing to the home run barrage was the fact the Lawrence field has artificial turf and no fence.\nAs a result, anything in the gap just rolls and rolls and on several of the home runs the runner was already around third base before an outfielder had finally retrieved the ball.\nWhile Lawrence really needs to erect a fence, this had nothing to do with the fact it committed seven errors. A couple were of the careless variety, including allowing a runner to race home while a ball was being returned to the pitcher following an out at first.\nThe fireworks started immediately when North's Julia Baber launched the first pitch of the game deep to center field for the first of the seven home runs. West Windsor North scored in ever inning but one and also got home runs from Maddie Russell and Jackie Pacifico.\nIn addition, starting and winning pitcher Dillanie Sumanthiran drove in four runs with a double, fielders choice and a two-run single.

If you're concerned about security upon reaching your destination, it's wise to avoid flashing valuables while in public. Instead of carrying a purse and hoping no one with ill intentions harasses you, purchase a travel vest to safely hide your possessions.\nTravel vests take many shapes and sizes but in general, are nondescript vests you wear to discretely carry several types of small possessions. Wearing a travel vest won't turn onlookers' heads; travel vests appear the same as a standard vest from the outside. When you open the vest, however, the inside of the garment is lined with multiple pockets of several sizes. These pockets are ideal for carrying a wide range of personal items.\nOnce you've bought a correct-fitting travel vest in anticipation of your trip, empty your purse's contents onto a table and evaluate the items you wish to take with you. Carrying a purse can make you a target for street robberies in several cities and countries, and by placing essential items out of sight in a travel vest, you won't have to carry a purse that could attract the attention of a thief. Purse contents you might wish to take with you include your wallet, passport, makeup, contact information for friends and family, digital camera, cellphone and a travel itinerary.\nAfter assembling the items from your purse you wish to take on your trip, evaluate which items are absolutely essential. At home, you might carry an extensive selection of makeup, but a limited supply on your trip might be sufficient. Check the vest's instructions and take stock of its pockets. Travel vests often have pockets designed for specific items. For example, a long, thin pocket is suitable for carrying a cellphone. Load the vest with the items you plan to carry on your trip.\nPassing through the security checkpoint at an airport can be stressful and arduous, especially if you have multiple items to remove from your pants or jacket pockets. The process becomes much more complicated if you choose to wear your travel vest through the checkpoint. Instead of doing so, carry essential items with you and place the travel vest and nonessential items in your checked luggage to avoid the time-consuming process of emptying each of the vest's pockets.\nIndependentTraveler.com: Why Is Delta Afraid of This Jacket?\nMcCoy, William. \"How to Use a Travel Vest in Place of a Purse.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/use-travel-vest-place-purse-109105.html.

Rumour has it that when Imran Khan visited Riyadh on his maiden visit to KSA as Prime Minister, he was driven by the Crown Prince himself.\nThat was on the lighter side of it, but the Royal visit should be considered a roaring success, not only for the 20 Billion dollars worth of MOUs signed between the two brotherly countries but the humane gesture displayed by the visiting Royal. Formalities aside, during the Royal banquet, Imran Khan made two requests from his visitor. He asked that the 3000 Pakistanis suffering incarceration in the Kingdom, be freed. Majority of them hailed from very poor families, were from rural backgrounds and were the sole supporters of their households. Most were apprehended for petty or inadvertently committed crimes. In a magnanimous gesture, the Crown Prince acceded to the immediate release of 2107, prisoners and to review the cases against the remaining. The Prime Minister also asked his Royal Guest to consider the Hajis from Pakistan proceeding for pilgrimage to have their immigration done in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad before departure. Imran\u2019s rationale was that most pilgrims from Pakistan are old people, who save all their lives to go on Hajj. When they arrive at Jeddah, they have to wait for hours waiting for immigration. Prince Mohammad bin Salman generously agreed to the second request as well.\nHe must have been amazed that most heads of states while visiting KSA or hosting Royal visitors, seek concessions for themselves or their families but here two requests came for the poor and the downtrodden people of Pakistan.\nThe opposition was seething with anger that its leadership was not extended invitations to the Royal Banquet, ignoring the fact that the Senate delegation comprised of members from both sides of the bench. Scathing comments from some members of the opposition bench were tantamount to calling Imran Khan a \u2018beggar\u2019 and suggested that the Prime Minister House be renamed to \u2018Beggar House\u2019. Ironically the visiting Saudi Foreign Minister was cognizant of the derisive comments and in his joint Press Conference with his Pakistani counterpart, declared that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was investing in Pakistan because of its development potential and that they believed in Pakistan\u2019s leadership.\nFull marks to the fledgling PTI government in its execution of foreign policy. The difficulties and challenges facing Pakistan were numerous when it took up the cudgel to govern Pakistan. The treasury was empty, corruption was rampant, and terrorism was prevalent.

One week from today Bill Belichick's History Boys will play the San Diego Chargers or Indianapolis Colts in Foxborough for the right to advance to Super Bowl XLII in Arizona Feb. 3.\n\"We played well enough to win,\" said Belichick. \"It gets tougher every step of the way in the playoffs.

The 2007 Patriots set regular-season records for points, touchdowns, and victories. Running the table to 19-0 would give them the best record in the history of professional football. The 1972 Dolphins (17-0) are the only undefeated team in NFL annals.\nNew England's perfect team has a perfect quarterback and Tom Brady threw a near-perfect game. Improving his playoff record to 13-2, Brady completed 26 of 28 passes (the two misses were on target), throwing three touchdown passes.\n\"When they're open like that, it's my job to hit them,\" said Brady. \"That makes it fun to play.\"\nAlready league Most Valuable Player, Male Athlete of the Year (AP), Sportsman of the Year (Sporting News), boyfriend of a supermodel (Gisele Bundchen), Brady is rumored to be up for a Golden Globe tonight.\nThe Patriots' QB surgically dissected and demoralized the worthy visitors - beating them once with the old Statue of Liberty Play (\"Yeah, I'm looking for the Academy Award on that play,\" joked Brady). Under Brady's direction, New England did not punt until the final 30 seconds.\n\"Tom's been great in the big games,\" said the ever-understated Belichick. \"He's a tremendous player and he's had a great year for us.\"\nYes. The best year in the history of the quarterback position.\n\"We have the opportunity to play another week,\" said Brady. \"I'm glad we're playing at home. I think we've learned a lot of valuable lessons throughout the season. After 17 games, it all comes down to this and we were here last year. I hope we play better.\"\nThe Patriots lost the AFC Championship game, 38-34, at Indianapolis last Jan. 21.\nFor more than three quarters there was some doubt if the Patriots were going to advance to another AFC title game. The muscular Jags battled to a halftime tie (14-14), and didn't fade until late in the night. Jacksonville quarterback David Garrard completed 22 of 33 passes and it was still a one-possession game with less than 10 minutes to play. It wasn't officially over until Rodney Harrison intercepted a Garrard pass with just over four minutes left.\nIt was a perfect night for football, an unseasonably warm 42 degrees at kickoff.

That\u2019s the view quickly emerging inside American intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\nThe FBI suspects that Russian government hackers breached the networks of the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that were posted to the anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks on Friday. It\u2019s an operation that several U.S. officials now suspect was a deliberate attempt to influence the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump, according to five individuals familiar with the investigation of the breach.\nThe theory that Moscow orchestrated the leaks to help Trump\u2014who has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and practically called for the end of NATO\u2014is fast gaining currency within the Obama administration because of the timing of the leaks and Trump\u2019s own connections to the Russian government, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and developing quickly.\nAbout 20,000 internal DNC emails were disclosed just days before the beginning of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia and several showed an effort by staffers to undermine Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign against Hillary Clinton. One email even discussed challenging Sanders\u2019s religious faith. In response to the embarrassing revelations, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced she would step down after the convention.\nCurrent and former U.S. officials drew analogies to so-called active measures campaigns, or state-sponsored operations designed for political effects.\n\u201cThe release of emails just as the Democratic National Convention is getting underway this week has the hallmarks of a Russian active measures campaign,\u201d David Shedd, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The Daily Beast. Shedd said that additional leaks were likely, echoing an opinion expressed by U.S. officials and experts who said that the release of emails on Friday may just be an opening salvo.\nOfficials also noted Trump\u2019s own connections to the Russian government. Putin has publicly praised the nominee, who said he was \u201chonored\u201d by the compliment. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was a consultant for Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine who was ousted for his pro-Moscow orientation (and now lives in Russia). One of Trump\u2019s top national security advisers, retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn, sat with Putin at a dinner celebrating the 10th anniversary of Kremlin-backed media network RT and was paid to give a speech at the event; Flynn later retweeted an anti-Semitic message that called into question any Kremlin-Trump link. Another Trump adviser, Carter Page, recently denounced America\u2019s \u201coften-hypocritical focus on democratization\u201d while in Moscow. And last week, Trump said that he might not come to the aid of U.S. NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression unless they paid what he thinks they owe for Europe\u2019s common defense.\nOfficials also thought it was telling that the emails were given to WikiLeaks, which is perceived as being hostile to the U.S. government. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t surprising to us,\u201d said one U.S. official familiar with the investigation.\nAn FBI spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the bureau was investigating the breach but declined to comment on whether political motivation was part of the inquiry. \u201cA compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they will consider potential motives,\u201d White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest told"}

{"idx": "21445", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The two contests for the federal leadership, the NDP -- already started -- and the Liberal -- on hold -- give an opportunity to think political realignment in Canada.\nThese leadership races could be an opportunity for serious debate about proportional representation, to give every person an equal vote, and climate change, the most urgent issue humankind faces, and one where the majority in Parliament is at odds with the majority of Canadians.\nProportional representation would make temporary electoral alliances practical. We have little chance of getting significant action on climate change without one. As well, PR would result in more women being elected.\nThe proposed Liberal-New Democrat merger as the means to stop Conservative majorities has too many disadvantages. The parties are too far apart on too much. The demise of the Liberal Party is New Democrat wishful thinking at its worst. The Liberals have recovered from bad defeats before and the NDP fallen from better days, too.\nThe Conservative majority is the cause, and only cause, of Canada's disgraceful policy on climate change, earning us the \"fossil of the year\" award at international meetings. An electoral alliance with a commitment to a comprehensive climate action strategy, including Liberals, New Democrats and Greens, could change that.\n\u2022 Reverse the massive, expensive prison building program;.\n\u2022 Repeal the sentencing changes made to fill these prisons.\n\u2022 Institute a national childcare program.\n\u2022 Bring in a plan to end child poverty.\n\u2022 Make taxes fairer--remember the \"progressive\" income tax?\n\u2022 Reinstate the long form of the Census.\n\u2022 Address such environmental concerns as dying oceans and forests and declining biodiversity.\nThe first task would be for the three potential partners to formulate a core progressive program that would unite the 60.38 per cent of Canadians who don't want a Conservative government -- and do want strong action on climate. Most Canadians are not climate-change deniers and most want more done than either the current Conservative or previous Liberal governments have been willing to do, if less than hard-core environmentalists might want. A serious climate change commitment could draw in idealistic young people to the political arena for the first time.\nThe Liberals would have to get over their fear of a carbon tax (although we could oblige by calling it something else). St\u00e9phane Dion's \"greenshift plan\" was defeated without being understood. The principle was good, its presentation a fiasco. The NDP similarly must drop its \"axe the tax\" tactic, which cost it the last B.C. election. Jack Layton's excellent Climate Change Accountability Act gives a sound basis for a new start.\nClearly there has to be a process of policy building in both those major parties. Both have gone through such exercises before and can again. A majority government and a fixed election date give time.\nCompulsory voting, as in Australia, is sometimes proposed as the way to improve turn-out. The better way is to ensure that people's votes are not \"wasted,\" or perversely result in electing the party furthest removed from theirs in policy -- the case for Greens now fearing to elect Conservatives.\nProposals for proportional representation have been defeated in two provinces, and for reason, but getting it right should not be beyond us.\nMight we need a referendum? I am sceptical that any adequate climate action strategy will ever be adopted nationally, or survive if adopted, without broad public support. Usually right wingers, suspicious of government, are the advocates of referenda. Not so here. Indeed we need strong government"}

Inmates at minimum-security prisons can also get paperback books from any source, including family and friends.\nAt Florida\u2019s Coleman prison, the restrictions were to have taken effect on May 14 and would have mandated that prisoners file an electronic request including the 13-digit International Standard Book Number, according to the March 29 memo by the warden.\nThe memo was made available to Reuters by Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington advocacy group.\nThe Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a query about how many prisons had already adopted the books policy, nor to identify the private vendor or explain the reason for the price markup.\nIn January New York state prison officials began sharply limiting the books and packages that could be mailed to state prisoners.

The political impact could reverberate across the nation.\nA bilingual sign outside a polling center ahead of local elections in Austin, Texas, on April 28.\nNPR is taking a look at the demographic changes that could reshape the political landscape in Texas over the next decade \u2014 and what that could mean for the rest of the country.\nWithin a decade, Hispanics are projected to eclipse non-Hispanic whites as the largest race or ethnic group in Texas. It's a development that could someday shift the state's \u2014 or, given the size of Texas, even the nation's \u2014 politics.\nThe demographic change is in part because Hispanics in Texas are a \"young\" population compared to non-Hispanic whites. That means the largest age groups among Hispanics are under the age of 18, while the largest groups of non-Hispanic whites are around middle age.\nIn 2010, for example, there were 197,000 2-year-old Hispanics in Texas \u2014 50,000 more than non-Hispanic whites that age. In contrast, there were 190,000 50-year-old non-Hispanic whites \u2014 90,000 more than Hispanics of that age.\nOver the next 20 years, more and more Hispanics will move into labor force ages \u2014 prime reproduction years \u2014 and ultimately outpace other race or ethnic groups, said Lloyd Potter, a professor at the University of Texas, San Antonio, who serves as the state's official demographer.\nIn 2010, among the statewide population, Hispanics were already the largest group among all residents age 37 or younger. That age line will continue trending older, and the non-Hispanic white population will start to decline, fueling the trend.\nThe Hispanic population in Texas is younger than the non-white Hispanic population.\nUPDATE (7/11/13): Potter, the state demographer, clarified that 2023 is a conservative estimate for when the Hispanic population will become larger than the non-White Hispanic population. That estimate doesn't account for migration into the state. Other estimates predict the switch could occur as early as 2017, he said."}

That\u2019s why the Packers were correct to let go of Brett Favre to play Aaron Rodgers. It\u2019s also why the Bears\u2019 No. 1 priority is to make Jay Cutler play safer.\nMy favorite NFL Web site, coldhardfootballfacts.com, reports interceptions determine playoff success. Since 1970, teams that throw zero interceptions win 79 percent of their games and 55 percent with one interception. It drops to 31 percent with two interceptions, 18 percent with three. Teams that throw four or more are 1-41, and that one win is against another team that threw four.\nThat\u2019s why the Packers were correct to let go of Brett Favre to play Aaron Rodgers. The young and supposedly wild Favre threw fewer than 15 interceptions four times in his first six years in Green Bay and the Packers were 9-4 in the playoffs. But he threw 15 or more in each of the next 11 years and went 3-6 in the playoffs. Rodgers\u2019 average of 10 picks is half of Favre\u2019s rate from 1998-2008.\nIt\u2019s also why the Bears\u2019 No. 1 priority is to make Jay Cutler play safer. He was No. 2 in the NFL in interceptions as a Bronco and No. 1 as a Bear. The Bears will never go anywhere unless that stops. The easiest answer is an explosive dump-off receiver that can turn the easiest pass into a big gain, the way Percy Harvin helped Favre cut his interceptions from a league-high 22 last year to a career-best 7 as a Viking.\nCarlton Fisk was hailed as a steroids-battling hero on Chicago radio this week after telling the Chicago Tribune story that Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays averaged 18 home runs at age 39 while Barry Bonds hit 73.

{"idx": "21454", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In April, several members of Congress met with Kurdish, Christian, and Yazidi leaders at the Kurdish Mission in Washington to discuss the political, military, and humanitarian crisis and what could be done. The question of Kurdish independence lingered unspoken for much of the evening, but was at last broached. A Kurdish representative reiterated the admonition of Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, that the Kurds would give Iraq\u2019s government \u201cone more chance.\u201d The U.S. government, on the other hand, apparently has infinite patience. If the Kurds wait for America to give them its permission to seek independence, they are certain to wait a long time \u2014 a point conveyed at the April meeting.\nThe recent fall of Ramadi to ISIS saw more weapons sent by the U.S. captured by ISIS. According to a report by correspondent Jamie Dettmer, Iraqi Special Forces were the first to flee in the face of ISIS. In what is increasingly taking the form of a pattern, the U.S. government has supplied weapons to the Iraqi central government, only to see the Iraqi military\u2019s staggering incompetence result in the strengthening of ISIS. Where American blood was shed, the flags of ISIS are now firmly planted in the ground. Family members of soldiers killed fighting in Anbar Province cry out for justice. It is a cry shared by many in the region, very much rooted in the history of Western involvement in the Middle East.\nThe principal source of the problem is both simple and demonstrable and it is this: America\u2019s government clings to the notion that Iraq is a nation-state. It is not. It is essentially an arbitrary construct that unnaturally binds together peoples who are divided along lines of religion, ethnicity, history, language, culture, and even the most fundamental precepts of pluralistic democracy: a notion of the common good and common interest. This is the legacy of the 1916 Asia Minor Agreement, now referred to simply as Sykes-Picot, for the British and French diplomats who drafted it. When its secret terms were published by the Bolsheviks, the Arab leaders who had fought with the Allies to overthrow the Ottoman Turks regarded it as a bitter betrayal. A century later, it is still regarded in the Middle East as a symbol of Western perfidy. In Washington, policymakers cling to this fiction of Iraq. They do so at the expense of lives in the Middle East and the dishonor of American blood shed there.\nThough they were cynical, the British and French did not, to their credit, venture into the Middle East blinded by quixotic dreams of democratizing tribal societies. The impossibility of imposing pluralistic democracy on a tribal society cannot be overemphasized. This is at the very heart of America\u2019s failure in Iraq. Americans, whether policy wonks or laymen, seem incapable of comprehending what tribalism means in practice and why only post-tribal societies can sustain pluralism. (Until one understands this fact of tribalism, one cannot understand America\u2019s failures in the Middle East.) Put simply, America took the lessons of rebuilding Germany and Japan \u2014 both post-tribal societies \u2014 and applied them, improperly, in the Middle East.\nThe most immediate consequence of the Iraq fiction is that America cannot arm those who are actually willing to fight ISIS: the Kurds. This is because U.S. law forbids direct arm shipments to groups other than recognized governments. Shipments to the Kurds must go through the Iraqi government in Baghdad"}

He was the most three-dimensional justice with an often two-dimensional worldview. History will likely remember him as someone who was gloriously, powerfully on the wrong side of so many important questions. But history will surely remember him.\nAs a liberal you are certainly free to hate Scalia, and sometimes it seemed he worked overtime to earn your hate. He gloried in it. He wrote cruel, demeaning things about whole groups of Americans\u2014and even if you didn\u2019t belong to one of those groups, Scalia was the fifth vote on what many of us consider towering historic injustices, from Bush v. Gore to Citizens United.\nFor years and years, I told anyone who asked that the day the high court lost Scalia would be the day I quit covering it. On that day, which came Saturday, I knew the court was also losing everything dramatic and absurd and quotable, even as it lost its cartoon supervillain.

Scalia invited and welcomed and celebrated it. Toward the end of his career, he bemoaned the bitter partisanship of Washington, without acknowledging that he was as polarizing as those he deplored for being polarizing. In that way too he set the stage for this election cycle and the ideological battle that will rage to fill his seat.\nIf our next decision is meant to follow the course he set, we will reach out to him, and if we will not accept his direction we will have to grapple with him.

Carolina ended the regular season 14-4 in league, with Virginia and Miami, which lost to Virginia Tech on Saturday, finishing a game back. A No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament is still within reach for Carolina.\nWhat a week for Gabe York.

The performances followed his worst two-game stretch of the season, both Arizona losses. On Saturday, York nailed 9-of-14 from deep for a career high 32 points in his final home game, a 94-62 win over Stanford.

{"idx": "21466", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Monterey >> With the arrival of spring comes the arrival of the killer whales to Monterey Bay. An attack last week on a gray whale calf by a group of 17 killer whales signified the beginning of \u201ckiller whale season\u201d to many observers.\nThe killer whales (also known as orcas) found in this area patrol long stretches of coastline looking for their prey, which include seals, dolphins, and, when they can get them, gray whale calves.\nThose gray whale calves are really what drives the seasonal abundance of killer whales, according to Nancy Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch. Gray whales migrate from their winter homes in Mexico back to their summer feeding grounds in Alaska, and their path along the California coast takes them right through Monterey Bay.\nFor adult gray whales, the deep water of Monterey Bay doesn\u2019t pose a problem. But mothers and calves need the shelter of shallower water to avoid being vulnerable to attack.\nOne such attack happened sometime during the night before or early morning of April 5 \u2014 a group of killer whales separated a baby gray whale from its larger, more dangerous mother, and successfully killed it. After a whale watching boat discovered the carcass of a baby gray whale surrounded by feeding killer whales that morning, they marked the beginning of this year\u2019s bloody season.\nBlue Ocean Whale Watch owner, captain, and naturalist Kate Cummings says that she warns her passengers before a sight like that one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, but it\u2019s hard to watch at the same time. Passengers have very mixed feelings about it,\u201d she said.\nSome of her regular passengers avoid going out on the water entirely at this time of year. Others sign on for more trips, eager to see the enormous predators on the hunt.\nOver the past few years, \u201ckiller whale season\u201d has been active and predictable.\n\u201cLast year was pretty exceptional,\u201d said Black. One family group of killer whales, led by a distinctive-looking matriarch nicknamed \u201cEmma\u201d for the E-shaped notches in her dorsal fin, were involved in 12 attacks on gray whale calves last spring.\nAfter the end of whaling in Monterey Bay in the mid-1900s, the gray whale population was all but extinct. Over the past several decades of protection, it has recovered back to historic levels. Killer whale predation likely doesn\u2019t put a dent in the tens of thousands of grays that now migrate along the coast. But killer whales learn quickly, and pass information from generation to generation \u2014 some of the whale watchers and biologists around the area have noticed certain groups of killer whales increasing the speed and effectiveness of their attacks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a wild, raw thing to see,\u201d said Cummings. And this is just the beginning of this year\u2019s killer whale season. They\u2019re expected to stick around Monterey Bay, zig-zagging and patrolling the deep water, for at least the next few weeks."}

Produced in red, white, ros\u00e9 and now sparkling, they have been flying off the supermarket shelves for several years. The idea for GN wines came from a New Zealand company called Invivo, set up in 2008 by former school mates Tim Lightbourne and Rob Cameron. Cameron had worked as a winemaker with Villa Maria in New Zealand, while Lightbourne worked in marketing with brands such as l\u2019Or\u00e9al and Danone in Europe.\n\u201cWe caught up for a beer in London in 2007 and came up with the idea. Unlike many great ideas we actually followed through with it,\u201d says Lightbourne.\nThey knew Graham Norton enjoyed Sauvignon Blanc, and offered to supply him with their Invivo Sauvignon. A little later, they suggested to Norton that he become involved. \u201cHe has great enthusiasm and a great palate\u201d, says Lightfoot. \u201cHe will say \u2018I like this part but not that\u2019. He rejects some samples. He talks about what he would like in his wine, instead of leaving it up to a winemaker. It is quite a unique way of making wine. We are about to make the 2018; he will taste 8-10 samples and blend to his taste\u201d.\nThe whole process is filmed and put out on YouTube. \u201cThe wine is quite different to our style with Invivo (also available from SuperValu). We get good points from the critics and win trophies \u2013 we are proud of the quality and would happily put it up against any wine.\u201d Sales of the wine have tripled since 2015 and will top 3 million bottles this year.\nThe Sauvignon was followed by a ros\u00e9, a Shiraz from Australia and now a Prosecco. For this, the pair flew out to Italy and tried out eight different styles from various producers. Norton prefers the drier style. The wine has just been released in Tesco.\nAn exuberant fruit-filled Prosecco with refreshing red apples and pears. A great way to kick-start a dinner party, or with friends on a sunny evening.\nA classic Marlborough Sauvignon, with lime zest, textured mouth-watering green fruits and a lingering rounded finish. With some grilled scallops and a herby dressing, or a soft goat\u2019s cheese salad.\nA very moreish appealing wine with fragrant aromas, juicy ripe raspberry and black cherry fruits, a refreshing acidity, finishing just off-dry. By itself or with lightly spicy chicken, prawns or salmon.\nBig rich rounded ripe plum fruits with a sprinkle of spice. Perfect with that barbecued ribeye steak or burger."}

The new Space Command would be on equal footing with these.\nIt will require a new headquarters, as well as a commander and deputy commander, who will need Senate approval.\nMr Trump in June said he wanted to create a space force, which would be a sixth and entirely new branch of the military alongside the navy, marine corps, army, air force and coast guard. He insists that such a move is necessary to tackle vulnerabilities in space and assert US dominance in orbit.\nThe creation of a space force would also set off a turf war within the Pentagon, particularly with the air force, which currently is responsible for most space operations.\nMr Pence spoke to an audience in Florida, where he had been expecting to watch the launch of a SpaceX rocket carrying a new generation of satellite, ordered by the US Air Force, that is much harder for adversaries to jam.\nAdditional \"GPS III\", or third-generation, satellites will be launched in the coming years, creating a new constellation of the orbiting craft.\nThe air force asked for US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) for fiscal year 2019 for the programme.\nSpace plays a vital role in just about every aspect of modern warfare, with many military technologies reliant on a network of orbiting sensors and satellites, and the Pentagon has warned that countries such as Russia and China are working to build anti-satellite capabilities.\nTuesday's launch was scrubbed at the last minute due to an issue with some sensor readings, SpaceX said.

The fourth brigade combat team is preparing to deploy this fall.\nChambliss, who serves on the military personnel subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said earlier this week that Fort Stewart's deployment history and prime location along the East Coast make it \"desirable\" for the Army.\n\"There are a lot of good arguments as to why Fort Stewart is a good location,\" he said. \"Obviously, we have to see where it goes.\"\nHowever, officials at the Army post are remaining mum.\n\"The Army hasn't made a final decision at this point,\" said Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson. \"Pending that, we can't comment.\"\nBut U.S. Rep.

It escaped closure, and by 2005, another round of BRAC resulted in Fort Stewart and Hunter adding 6,000 soldiers.\n\"There's plenty of land, and look at all the military construction dollars we've received over the last decade,\" Tollison said. \"It seems like a perfect fit for another brigade to join what's already in place.\"\nTollison mused that the installation easily could handle as many as two more brigades.\n\"I think the future's bright,\" he added.\nThe impact goes beyond simply adding soldiers"}

Those of us who understand the true condition of Social Security\u2013and why Republicans wish to dismantle this essential and durable system of social insurance\u2013are fairly confident that truth can prevail. It helps that a coalition of progressive groups are making Social Security their top priority and that most major news organizations (the same ones Bush snookered on Iraq) have belatedly discovered the President\u2019s factual manipulations on Social Security (it would be disrespectful to call them lies). In any case, until this fight is won, no one can back away.\nBush\u2019s cruelest distortion lies in forcing the political system to confront the wrong problem. The crisis is not Social Security. It is retirement security in general\u2013Medicare most obviously, but also the medley of employee pension plans shrinking in value and the collapsed private savings of American households. All three are far more imperiled than Social Security, with its relatively minor and distant problems. All three will require densely complicated policy solutions and deep shifts in economic thinking.\nSocial Security, it is important to remember, is the bedrock guarantee that keeps millions of elderly people from destitution in their old age\u2013the basic floor people can build on, not a ticket to golden-age affluence. Social Security is the only income for one-fifth of retirees, and it is the principal source of income for two out of three retired Americans. When the other pillars of retirement security are weakening, it is especially irresponsible to tamper with it.\nDemocrats, or progressives at large if Democrats lack the nerve, should force a public debate to address all the elements of retirement security and should begin advocating solutions. Indeed, this is an opportunity for inventive social thinking that might restore the Democrats\u2019 faded reputation as the party of reform. Defending sound, long-established government programs is honorable work, but Democrats must go on the offense with their own perceptions of social and economic vulnerabilities and their own visionary solutions.\nAny discussion of the crisis appropriately starts with medical care. Medicare and its less popular stepsister, Medicaid, for the poor, both face impending financial shortfalls, driven mainly by relentless healthcare inflation. A rational analysis would observe that the two important aspects of healthcare financing\u2013for the poor and the elderly\u2013are now managed by government. It\u2019s time to take a deep breath and advocate a universal healthcare system that can confront the rising costs and wasted resources embedded in the entire system. The insurance industry was given its chance to do this in the 1990s and failed utterly, despite its intrusive regulation of doctors and patients. Symbolic half-measures by government will fail too. Americans at large are ready for real answers.\nThe pension crisis is more complex and also calls for big ideas. The deteriorating condition of corporate pensions is an almost daily political scandal\u2013though usually reported only in the business pages\u2013as companies dump retirees and workers. Unions have typically traded wage increases for better retirement benefits in contract bargaining, but when companies renege on the deal, the federal"}

That compares to 75 percent strongly yes and 15 percent somewhat yes in 2008.\nAnd 71 percent said it\u2019s very important for children to get vaccinated, compared to 82 percent in 2008.\nAll this indicates not that more people oppose vaccine, but that there\u2019s more doubt and questioning, Woolley said.\n\u201cWe feel that it is very important to take this seriously,\u201d she told a briefing.\nThe survey found that 45 percent of people do not think the public receives enough information from their doctors about vaccinations.\nHealth experts have been debating how to counter the ever more vocal influence of a small but determined group of people who oppose conventional vaccination.\nBut there\u2019s also a growing number of people who simply have questions, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who directs CDC\u2019s vaccine division.\n\u201cI was surprised at how many moms in my community had questions that I thought had been asked and answered,\u201d said Messonnier, adding that she has two young children herself.\n\u201cParents are inundated with information from social media, from their friends,\u201d she added"}
{"idx": "21476", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: As we come to rely more and more upon technology as a filter for our own life experiences, opportunities to bend reality abound. In theory, none of this is new. Ask anybody who has ever been on an online dating site and they will tell you what you see is not always what you get. Yet as technology plays an ever-increasing role as an intermediator for our daily experiences, those who control the technology can control our experiences. These changes have some significant implications for crime and social disorder in the 21st century.\nPhishing emails routinely take users to websites that appear to be genuine, but are in fact controlled by organized crime. Unsuspecting victims enter their personal banking details and are defrauded shortly thereafter. Pedophiles pretend to be teenagers, creating extensive fake online profiles in order to lurk in chat-rooms popular with young adults and to contact them. The creation of hundreds of thousands of blogs has turned the common man into a broadcaster, making it harder to judge the quality and veracity of the news. Is the story about the latest celebrity death real or is it rumor? The stories look real and official. Perhaps they are true? Of course one false story about a company\u2019s latest quarterly financials is enough to move markets and create a financial fraud costing victims billions of dollars.\nAs noted below, there are now a number of software applications that have been created to \u201cspoof\u201d or alter the caller identification on outbound mobile phone calls. While there are relatively benign uses of these technologies, (like playing jokes on other teenage friends), there can also be potentially deadly consequences.\nIn a phenomenon known as \u201cSwatting,\u201d criminals have been able to telephone police 911/emergency phone systems with spoofed telephone identities and reporting non-existent crimes resulting in the response of heavily-armed police SWAT units to various locations. In many cases, the offenders placed calls that appeared to come from legitimate addresses several states away and reported ongoing kidnapping or hostage scenarios in progress. Using these technologies, it was possible for a man in Ohio (USA) to use a spoofed phone identification to report a nonexistent hostage crisis, sending armed police bursting into the homes of innocent people.\nSpoofed phone numbers can also allow criminals access to the voice-mail systems of others. Since many mobile phone carriers do not require a password to enter one's voicemail box when calling from the account's associated phone number, a spoofed caller ID means criminals can listen to the phone messages of others without authorization. Valuable information could be obtained regarding pending business transactions, mergers and acquisitions and even personal medical data. Noted celebrities have also been accused of abusing this technology to gather gossip on rivals. From a social engineering perspective, telephone spoofing creates a powerful tool for the criminal mind.\nA spoofed telephone call to a company\u2019s IT-Department requesting a system password or the latest WiFi WPA key, is much more likely to be successful if the call appears to be emanating from within the company\u2019s own telephone infrastructure (internal to the company). Of course this particular technique is not new. Even 15 years ago, fax machines allowed their owners to enter any particular information they desired for identifying the machine and its originating phone number. What is changing however, is the pervasive use of technology and the widespread means to alter the user experience in real time.\nResearchers at Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab have done extensive research on human behavior in virtual spaces and have presented a number of techniques to alter in an instant how our virtual selves are presented to others.

{"idx": "21478", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Why do the men in some families go bald, reliably, generation after generation? It\u2019s not just bad luck. Rather, male-pattern baldness is a genetic condition affecting as many as 70% of men, and over the years different cultures have concocted an array of potential cures for it, from rubbing goose dropping into the scalp to a combination of molasses and oats that must be licked off the head by a cow.\nOf course, these \u201csolutions\u201d aren\u2019t likely to get you far and may expose you to far worse things \u2013 goose poop, anyone? But despite its prevalence, baldness remains a culturally sensitive topic. While some embrace their new look, others remain hopeful for potential solutions.\nThe better we understand male pattern hair loss, the more prepared we\u2019ll be to approach it rationally and calmly, whether in the pursuit of cure or acceptance. Here are a few key things everyone should know about male-pattern baldness. After all, you surely know someone affected.\nMale-pattern hair loss is easily recognizable, starting with the \u201cM\u201d-shape of the receding hairline. This shape will eventually shift, becoming just a horseshoe of remaining hair around the sides of the head. Though some men might choose to remove this remaining hair, it typically won\u2019t fall out itself since the hair on the sides and back of the head is resistant to the hormones that cause hair loss on top.\nDespite the easy to spot loss pattern, the age and rate of hair loss varies between men with male-pattern baldness. Typically, men whose relatives suffered early or rapid hair loss will also see those effects. It all comes down to heredity.\nDespite the stigma surrounding balding, each man greets hair loss differently. With male-pattern baldness, in particular, most men have some time to reflect on the fact that they will lose their hair and come to look like their relatives. They\u2019re part of a lineage.\nOf course, knowing that hair loss is coming doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any easier, which is why some men choose to have elective surgery to disguise hair loss and boost their confidence. This is particularly effective for men with male pattern baldness because, as noted, the hair on the sides of the head is resistant to hormone-driven loss.\nOne particularly popular approach to transplantation is known as follicular unit extraction (FUE). According to the professionals at MAXiM Hair Restoration, FUE is a simple, scar-free procedure and leaves the recipient with a natural looking head of hair \u2013 because it\u2019s their own hair. The original transplanted hair typically falls out within 4 weeks of the procedure, but after that, we see normal growth cycles.\nSome men see an advantage in going bald, especially when they start balding early. Though it can be embarrassing to have thinning hair when you\u2019re still in college, some young men find that it makes them look older when they get their first job, giving them an air of professional authority.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that there are plenty of famous men rocking the cueball look, including Dwayne Johnson, Michael Jordan, and Patrick Stewart. Some famous men even show off the distinctive patterns stemming from male-pattern baldness. John Travolta, for example, long displayed the receding hairline, as did Nicolas Cage.\nTreating male-pattern baldness isn\u2019t necessary, but if it\u2019s dragging down your confidence, then it becomes a problem. If male-pattern baldness runs in your family or impacts someone you love, know there are options out there \u2013 and no reason to be ashamed"}

Amen, Joan!\nWhat happens when our minds go over the edge?\nPsychosis occurs in about 3-5 percent of the population. It means losing touch with reality. A psychotic person might think we live on Venus, while a neurotic person knows we live on Earth\u2013 but can\u2019t accept it.\nPsychosis means a person has a twisted view of reality, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thoughts. Since the world can seem upside down, a psychotic person can become very agitated\u2014 restless and possibly violent. These erratic behaviors can cause all sorts of harm\u2014 both self-inflicted and to others.\nHallucination means sensing something that's not there. It's not ESP, like believing a ghost is around\u2013 it's hearing voices that aren\u2019t there (as in schizophrenia) or seeing bugs swarming across the floor (as in alcohol withdrawal).\nDelusions are pretty easy to explain since so many people are delusional. Think how many folks believe they're going to patent the next best thing or, like Joaquin Phoenix, think they're going to become a rapper.\n\u201cIdeas of reference\u201c refers to the false belief that remarks, news items, lyrics, etc. are meant specifically for the sufferer of the psychosis. Murderers who go on killing sprees sometimes believe that music or the media is telling them to do it. Ideas of reference isn\u2019t about being influenced by media; it's a false belief it's actually telling them what to do.\nThought disorganization occurs when random thoughts lead to bizarre behavior. The person can seem sane, but then suddenly do something irrational (although not necessarily aggressive).\nFolks around an acutely psychotic person often run for the hills because the psychotic one is revved up from anxiety and ready to explode emotionally. Psychotic persons sometimes know they're going mad and are thus understandably highly agitated.\nPsychosis occurs in mental illness such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder (kind of like a \u201cmini\u201d schizophrenia), and bipolar disorder. The mania of bipolar disorder can lead to delusions of grandeur (like \u201cI\u2019m going to write the next best-seller and paint the neighborhood all the same color\"). On the flip side, severe depression can cause psychosis.\nDrugs and alcohol, especially during withdrawal, can make a person psychotic. Extreme stress, such as an airplane crash or a breakup, can lead to a brief psychotic episode. Folks with a borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder are more prone to a psychotic break.\nCommonly, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease can lead to visual hallucinations and delusions, especially at night (this is called sundowning). It can be difficult to control agitated behavior when the psychosis hits.\nAntipsychotic medications to mood stabilizers can be very effective.

Architecture that was uncovered pre-dates the First Temple built by King Solomon.\nProf. Yosef Garfinkel announced on Tuesday the discovery of objects found in the ruins called Khirbet Qeiyafa, a fortified border city in the Kingdom of Judah adjacent to the Valley of Elah, less than 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem and five miles west of Gush Etzion.\nThe archaeologist and colleagues uncovered rich assemblages of pottery, stone and metal tools, and many art and ritual objects. The architecture and discoveries correspond to the biblical description of a local, organized group that observed the second of the 10 Commandments prohibiting belief in graven images.\nThe absence of cultic images of humans or animals in the shrines provides evidence that the local inhabitants practiced a different cult than that of the Canaanites or the Philistines.\nThis discovery is the first time that shrines from the time of early biblical kings were uncovered. The village of Khirbet apparently existed for only about 40 years and was violently destroyed.\nThe People of Israel conducted their lives according to a religion different from all other nations of the ancient Near East by being monotheistic and banning human or animal figures. The Bible describes this in detail.\nThe findings at Khirbet Qeiyafa also indicate that an elaborate architectural style had developed as early as the time of King David. The construction is typical of royal activities and indicates the establishment of a state and of urban life in the region in the days of the early kings of Israel.\n\u201cThese finds strengthen the historicity of the biblical tradition and its architectural description of the Palace and Temple of Solomon,\u201d Hebrew University stated.\n\u201cThis is the first time that archaeologists uncovered a fortified city in Judah from the time of King David,\u201d according to Prof. Garfinkel. \u201cEven in Jerusalem we do not have a clear fortified city from his period. Thus, various suggestions that completely deny the biblical tradition regarding King David and argue that he was a mythological figure, or just a leader of a small tribe, are now shown to be wrong.\nThe three shrines are part of larger building complexes, different from the style of Canaanite or Philistine cults, and Prof. Garfinkel pointed out the Biblical verse in the time of King David: \u201cHe brought the ark of God from a private house in Kyriat Yearim and put it in Jerusalem in a private house\u201d (Chapter 6 in the Second Book of Samuel).\nParts of the structures, such as the doors, help explain obscure technical terms in the description of Solomon\u2019s palace as described in the First Book of Kings 6.\n\u201cFor the first time in history, we have actual objects from the time of David, which can be related to monuments described in the Bible,\u201d the archaeologist said."}

Gen. James R. Clapper, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and current undersecretary of defense for intelligence, will be the next DNI. President Obama announced Gen. Clapper as his nominee Saturday, saying he must not fall victim to Washington politics.\nHe will replace retired Adm. Dennis Blair, who resigned after 16 months in the position following several disputes with other intelligence leaders and, in particular, the CIA.\nGen. Clapper\u2019s selection is a rebuke to senior members of the congressional oversight committees who had said they hoped Mr. Obama would nominate a civilian as his top intelligence adviser and someone with whom the president shares a personal relationship.\nGen. Clapper will be the fourth director of national intelligence since the position was created in 2005 to oversee and coordinate all 16 independent intelligence agencies.\nTwo former DNIs, John Negroponte and Navy Adm. Mike McConnell, have said Congress needs to fix the law to give the director more authority over the budgets of the 16 intelligence agencies.\nGen. Clapper, according to one senior intelligence official, has argued inside the government that the secretary of defense had veto authority over the office of the DNI with regard to military intelligence budgets. Eighty-five percent of the intelligence budget goes to military or Pentagon programs, such as spy satellites and electronic eavesdropping.\nIn his new job, Gen. Clapper may find himself making the opposite argument.\nGen. Clapper headed the National Geo-spatial Intelligence Agency between September 2001 to June 2006.

Bush had said Saddam Hussein was concealing, turned up no stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.\nWhether or not Iraq moved some elements of its weapons programs to Syria before the war remains a matter of dispute.\nTheodre Kattouf, the U.S. ambassador in Damascus in 2002 and 2003, said in 2006 that he did not believe Iraq sent material to Syria in the run up to the war.\nJohn A. Shaw, a senior Pentagon technology security official during the Bush administration, however, said he believed that some Iraqi weapons and materials were covertly shipped out of Iraqi factories with the help of the Russians.

About 3 million tons of dried-out sludge is subsequently mixed into agricultural soil each year.\n\"We wanted to look into the possibility of nanoparticles getting into the food chain in this way,\" said environmental toxicologist Paul Bertsch of the University of Kentucky. \"What we found really surprised us.\"\nSynthetic nanoparticles are about 1 to 100 nanometers in size (as small as some viruses) and made of silver, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and other substances. By virtue of their small size and stability, they can nullify odors, prevent food spoilage and absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation, among other feats.\nBut knowledge about their impacts to the environment is still in a state of infancy, Bertsch said.\nTo explore nanoparticle absorption in the food chain, Bertsch's team raised tobacco plants in a hydroponic greenhouse. While the plants grew, the team added super-stable gold nanoparticles to the water to mimic consumer nanoparticles in wastewater sludge.\nGold nanoparticles built up in tobacco leaf tissue, and tobacco hornworms that ate the plants accumulated concentrations of the nanomaterials about 6 to 12 times higher than in the plant.\n\"We expected [nanoparticles] to accumulate, but not biomagnify like that,\" said Bertsch, co-author of the Dec. 3 study in Environmental Science & Technology.\nPredatory microbes in a separate study, published Dec. 19 in Nature Nanotechnology, also built up concentrated levels of cadmium selenide nanoparticles after eating smaller microbes that ingested them.\n\"For me, it's really interesting to see two different models using two different nanoparticles arrive at conclusions reinforcing each other,\" said Patricia Holden, an environmental microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara who co-authored the microbe-based study.\nAt least five government agencies (EPA, FDA, NIH, NIOSH and NIST) host efforts to investigate nanotechnology's risks to health and the environment, and their funding is increasing each year.

Canada we didn't have access to before, but through this renegotiated deal it looks like there may be an opportunity to get in there.\nOlson says Minnesotans only consume about 10 percent of the turkeys grown here, the rest are shipped to other states and foreign markets.\nHe says there's a very good chance the bird on your Thanksgiving table was raised locally.\nWe still rank #1. We'll raise about 42.5 million birds this year. North Carolina is #2, followed by Arkanasa.

Ever wonder why law\u2014a trillion dollar global industry purportedly grounded in evidence, proof, and fact\u2014is so remarkably devoid of meaningful metrics for performance and results?\nBaseball is a numbers game. There\u2019s a metric for almost everything. Measures of individual performance\u2014home runs, runs batted in, batting average, earned run average, etc.-- have been around for more than a century. During the past few decades, a more advanced statistical arsenal\u2014often referred to as Sabermetrics\u2014has been used to evaluate players\u2019 impact upon team results. The purpose is to advance an objective knowledge of baseball and to provide a more reliable measure of player value. So, for example, on-base plus slugging (OPS) and wins above replacement (WAR ) have become key player metrics. Players with high WAR are prized because of their individual prowess and its impact on outcome. And while kids can still debate which of two players is better (Mantle or Mays in my day) and a measure of subjectivity remains, there is a plethora of objective data to support one\u2019s preference.\nBilly Beane, the cerebral General Manager of the small-market, low-budget Oakland A\u2019s, championed a new, data-driven paradigm for building rosters. He relied on metrics to identify undervalued talent, enabling him to assemble winning teams with low payrolls. His method helped dispel the myth that teams win with big payrolls. His metric driven approach came to be known as \u201cMoneyball,\u201d and it is applied inside and outside of baseball. Why not in the legal industry?\nImagine if the legal industry had metrics enabling buyers to retain legal talent based upon objective criteria\u2014relevant experience, skills, outcomes, peer and client evaluations, etc. These metrics could be evaluated with price to identify the appropriate cost: value blend for the individual matter or portfolio. This is critical because different matters have different value for clients.\nLegal providers and consumers have historically relied on pedigree\u2014not metrics--to identify quality. And pedigree--law school, firm, partnership--creates \u201creputation.\u201d Likewise, the reputation of a law firm often derives from founders or a few key partners, a form of \u201cexcellence by association.\u201d There is a conspicuous absence of objective measures for evaluating individual lawyers or firms. And while firms do use data for management, it is typically confined to internal financial metrics, not client helpful ones.\nProfit-per-partner (PPP) is the seminal metric of law firms, enabling them to retain star partners and to attract rainmaker laterals. But PPP has no bearing upon the quality of a particular partner or firm; the value or efficiency of service; results; or client satisfaction. PPP is a measure of equity partner profitability. Period.\nLaw also lacks generally accepted quality standards (though some are applied to service providers). It's feasible to establish such standards--something immensely useful, especially for buyers. And while some lawyers might bristle at a data driven approach to evaluation, it\u2019s the norm in many other industries. Example: five years ago I decided to have Lasik eye surgery. Naturally, I asked around for some recommendations. But I also studied the data: specialized training; how many procedures the doctor had conducted; outcomes; peer reviews; patient reviews; etc"}

Given the relative lack of attention paid to IPv6, this technique can bypass existing protection such as non-IPv6 enabled firewalls completely.\nIPv6 uses a completely different scheme of IP addresses, which effectively means that the concept of a network border no longer exists as it is possible to have a single IP address that will work anywhere in the world.\nThe hierarchy has been redesigned, says Lyne, so the danger is that businesses will implement IPv6 in much the same way they did IPv4.\n\"All they will succeed in doing is solving the problem of too few IP addresses, while opening up a host of security vulnerabilities and without getting any of the benefits such a massive performance gains from IPv6's ability to handle much bigger data packets,\" he says.\nWithout careful planning, Lyne warns that businesses could end up accidentally running IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, effectively nullifying security measures they have put around either protocol.\nLyne is critical of supporters of IPv6 for selling IPv6 only in terms of additional IP addresses and performance gains, instead of the inherent security benefits, such as internet protocol security (IPsec) which was originally developed for IPv6 and back-engineered for use with IPv4.\n\"IPsec, which is optional in IPv4, is an integral and mandatory part of IPv6, making man-in-the-middle attacks much more difficult for hackers,\" he says.\nEncryption is also mandatory, which automatically ensures a"}

Relax on board, and then step ashore to discover wonderful Cantabria in Spain's green north - a land of low-key resorts, ancient fishing villages and elegant seaside towns that is a world away from the sun-baked beaches and man-made pleasures of the Costas.\nLeave your local area by coach, and head to Portsmouth to board the Pont-Aven before her late afternoon sailing. The ship's excellent amenities and entertainment programme are a hugely enjoyable part of the holiday, so relax and enjoy them as you cruise south.\nAfter a day at sea, Pont-Aven arrives in Santander in the early evening. From here, it's just a short drive your hotel in the delightful Cantabrian coastal town of Suances. Part holiday resort, part working fishing village, Suances offers a small selection of shops, bars and fish restaurants, as well as a lovely sandy beach.\nSpend today exploring Suances, or join our included excursion and explore the region's beautiful eastern coastline. See attractive, coastal Laredo and visit Castro Urdiales - a traditional resort for the aristocracy in the 19th Century. The narrow streets of the old quarter have a special charm and boast a selection of taverns offering local specialities.\nToday we offer the chance to head inland on a wonderful full-day optional excursion into Spain's largest region, Castilla y Leon, and to beautiful, medieval Burgos. The legend of Spain's national hero, El Cid (who grew up here) is ever-present, and an introductory tour will introduce the city's countless historic landmarks - such as the magnificent UNESCO-listed gothic cathedral and the Miraflores Charterhouse. Afterwards you'll be free to explore the historic centre.\nOur second included excursion takes us to the stunning western coastline of Cantabria. Discover a landscape fringed by miles of fine white sand beaches and wide river estuaries, and visit exquisitely preserved, medieval Santillana del Mar, Comillas (known as the 'town of archbishops') and San Vincente de La Barquera, an ancient walled port built around a castle.\nToday's optional excursion will take us to breathtaking Picos de Europa National Park, with its jagged peaks, green pastures and spectacular gorges. You'll also have the opportunity to spend time exploring the region's historic capital, Potes, with its delightful old quarter, narrow streets and stately town-houses, all dominated by the 15th-century Tower of the Infantado.\nWeather permitting, we will also visit Fuente De, up the valley from Potes, for the chance to ride the cable car to the mountaintop and enjoy spectacular views (payable locally).\nWe'll say goodbye to Suances after breakfast, but before re-joining the Pont-Aven we'll enjoy a morning visit to elegant Santander. Relax in a cafe, or stroll through the lovely Pereda Gardens leading to the famous Bank of Santander.

California's Proposition 63, a gun control measure, passed in Tuesday's voting.\nThe way Chris Haggerty sees it, Proposition 63's passage Tuesday will make things more complicated for him and his customers.\nWhen a customer walks in to Olde West Gun and Loan to buy a box of ammunition, he pays the clerk and walks out with the ammo. Under Prop. 63, that transaction will require the customer to undergo a background check before the sale is complete.\n\"It'll definitely be an inconvenience on the consumer and the retailer, with more paperwork,\" said Haggerty, an employee at Olde West in Redding.\nHe wasn't very confident all the extra work will do much to prevent crimes committed with a gun.\n\"If what they want is to make it more of a hassle, then I believe it will be effective. If they want to prevent actual crime, then no, I don't think it will be effective,\" he said.\nThe measure received about 62 percent of the vote statewide Tuesday. However, 72.7 percent of Shasta County voters cast ballots against the measure.\nExcept for a few minor changes, the proposition is the same as SB1235, signed by the governor earlier this year, said Sarah Bastiani, manager of Bastiani Arms in Redding.\nIn addition to requiring a background check during ammunition sales, Prop. 63 also requires anyone with a high-capacity gun magazine \u2014 carrying more than 10 rounds \u2014 to turn them over to law enforcement.\nGuns with high capacity magazines have not been sold in California since 2000, Haggerty said. Prop 63 would require those who own high-capacity magazines to hand them over to law enforcement or face an infraction fine, he said.\nAlso under Prop 63, ammunition must be purchased through a licensed dealer, and requires lost or stolen firearms to be reported to law enforcement. Most of the provisions on ammunition sales go into effect Jan. 1, 2018.\nThe law also changes the penalties for gun theft. Currently, stealing a gun worth $950 or less is a misdemeanor. Prop. 63 would make all gun thefts a felony.\nBeginning in July 2019, ammo purchased out of state also cannot be brought into California without first having the ammunition delivered to a licensed dealer.\nThe ban on bringing ammunition into California will be a hardship on hunters, said Donn Walgamuth of Redding, an avid hunter and president of the board of directors for the California Deer Association.\nMany California residents hunt in other states, where they also buy ammunition, he said. But Prop. 63 will prevent them from bringing their ammo \u2014 including shotgun shells \u2014 back into the state, he said.\nWalgamuth said he didn't think the ammunition sales restrictions would prevent gun crimes.\n\"It's nothing that the criminals"}

This is down from -10 in the previous week, and is in the lower range of what Gallup has measured over the past year.\nThe latest index score is the lowest by one point since the first week of November 2015, but not materially different from most scores since then, which have ranged primarily between -10 and -13.\nLast week's -14 index score masks a period of falling and then rising confidence. After the index score registered -8 for April 2-4, confidence dropped to -18 for April 5-7 interviewing amid volatility in the U.S. stock market. By week's end, however, the index returned to -12 for Friday to Sunday, regaining much of the ground it lost before the midweek drop.\nFor the week ending April 10, the current conditions score of -6 is the lowest this component has recorded so far in 2016 -- down two points from the previous week. This score is based on 24% of Americans rating the current economy as \"excellent\" or \"good,\" and 30% rating it as \"poor.\" The economic outlook score took a more marked dip of six points from the prior week -- and is now at -22. This is the result of 37% of U.S. adults saying the economy is \"getting better\" and 59% saying it is \"getting worse.\" It is the worst score for this component since late August, though some recent scores have not been far off.\nAmericans' views of the national economy have been somewhat turbulent over the last several weeks, with confidence improving one week only to fall the following week. From a broad perspective, economic confidence so far this year has neither moved into a sustained period of positivity nor entered into a steady decline. Americans are confronted with presidential candidates using the economy as one of their talking points, mixed signals from national economic reports, volatility in the stock market and an apparent end of sub-$2 gas prices nationally -- all of which may be affecting their economic assessments.\nAmericans' cautiousness in their assessments of the economy may not be far off from those of economic leaders, however. Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen has been slow to raise interest rates, with some economists arguing Yellen has been overly cautious and has underestimated the economy's actual strength. Yellen's critics say the slow pace of raising rates will put the Fed at a disadvantage, with the possibility of increased inflation as the economy reaches its employment targets.\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted April 4-10, 2016, on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey, with a random sample of 3,542 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

He basically bought his way to success, offering a share of 100m yen (\u00a3720,000) to 100 randomly picked people who retweeted his post.\nThe Japanese billionaire\u2019s tweet blew past Wilkinson, receiving 5.2m retweets to date. Maezawa faced some backlash for his direct approach.\nSadly, good will can only go so far, and there seems to be a new normal when it comes to vitality: a celebrity sets down a marker (whether it\u2019s De Generes and her Oscars selfie, or Jenner\u2019s Instagram photo) which is then overtaken by a \u201chearts and minds\u201d campaign by an ordinary Joe.\nThen, like everything good, business comes in and ruins it. Maezawa offered a fraction of a percentage of his vast fortune as a barter to break records.\nConcerted efforts are required in public-wide campaigns to make posts go viral nowadays as social networks mature and develop more stringent business models.

This translates to $87.2 billion in wasted fuel and lost productivity, or $750 per traveler per year. But, by synchronizing traffic signals, municipalities can alleviate these issues.\nAccording to County News, the National Association of Counties\u2019 newsletter, in Los Angeles County, one of the most congested in the nation, the problems originate on the highways.\nOnce a highway becomes backed up, drivers push off onto surface streets, which weren\u2019t designed for heavy traffic flows. According to County News, a green light on one block will lead to a red light three or four blocks down \u2013 creating choppy traffic patterns, frustrated drivers, wasted fuel and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\nSo the county began looking for a solution. County News reports the Regional Traffic Signal Forum Program was formed in 1995 to address the problem, but it wasn\u2019t until recent technological developments occurred that the program really began to make headway.\nJane White, L.A. County civil engineer, told County News the key to signal synchronization is a microprocessor called a Universal Time Base Unit installed at each intersection. The unit synchronizes lights based on an atomic clock, and every intersection in a region is run on the same schedule.\nOne of the most recent communities becoming synchronized is the Coachella Valley region of California. The program, funded through the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program, will cost approximately $7.7 million, according to local paper, The Desert Sun.\nCiting numbers from the Institute for Transportation Engineers, The Desert Sun reports synchronizing signal timing can lead to fuel savings of up to 9 percent. The institute says each dollar spent improving signal timing saves between 15 and 20 gallons of fuel.\nAnd thanks to synchronization efforts in Los Angeles County, drivers have saved an estimated $468 million annually, according to County News.

Retail is booming, given the rise in domestic consumption. With Robinsons Retail Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial public offering planned for $800 million, the Philippine stock market is becoming more attractive to both foreign and domestic investors; it is up 27 percent, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stronger than any other market in Southeast Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (WSJ).\nMining is another area that promises to yield high investment returns, given that the Philippines is considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to be the 5th most mineral-rich country in the world for gold, nickel, copper and chromite worth over $840 billion\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Rappler). Goldman Sachs chief growth markets strategist Christopher Eoyang points out that unlocking this potential will depend on the flow of FDI to the mining industry.\nThe Philippine business climate is generally peaceful, with very few labor strikes, due to alternative dispute-resolutions (such as conciliation-mediation) made available by the Department of Labor. The Philippine government touts industrial peace as its comparative advantage against other countries in the region, pointing to only three labor strikes in 2012, compared to Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 857 strikes the year before (FT). In Bangladesh, about 500,000 workers went on strike during the summer of 2012, causing 300 factories to shut down (Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights).\nYet in 2012, the Philippines attracted a measly $2.8 billion in FDI, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Even excluding China, which had FDI of $254 billion in 2012, this performance is abysmal compared to other Asian nations. As shown in the graph above, most Asian nations had less than $10 billion in 2004. Three countries rose clearly above the rest by 2012 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Singapore, India, and Indonesia. The Philippines stagnated at the bottom of FDI over nearly the entire period.\nWhy is the Philippines lagging in FDI relative to its competitors? The economic strictures of the Philippine Constitution (Article XII) and the corollary protectionist laws that have emerged from them are key causal factors. Specifically, foreign ownership of property is restricted to a 40 percent baseline share in the Constitution, with minor deviations and adjustments in subsequent legislation. By imposing restrictions on foreign ownership, charter Philippine lawmakers believed they protected the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereignty from foreign encroachments. The thought was that by imposing barriers on foreign trade and investments and prohibiting controlling property rights of foreign nationals, domestic economic strength and independence would be achieved.\nKenneth Akintewe, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore, observes that family-controlled big businesses in the Philippines dictate the terms of business in the Philippines: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a real hesitancy to allow foreigners to come in and have a major say on how businesses are run.

The last and most prestigious award \u2014 which Dreamgirls certainly deserved \u2014 prompted me to think about how ironic it was that a movie based upon what music journalist Richie Unterberger called one of rock\u2019s greatest tragedies won an award associated with comedy.\nUnlike her celluloid incarnation, the real Effie White \u2014 Florence Ballard \u2014 never made a comeback after being kicked out of the Supremes. Instead of the popcorn ending that we all enjoyed in the theaters, Ballard fell into depression, drugs, and poverty. She died nearly destitute at the age of 32.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Dreamgirls isn\u2019t disrespectful of Ballard or of the legacy of the Supremes. In fact, Effie White is by far the most sympathetic character in the entire movie, and Condon and company have done her a great service by telling her story. Hudson, in a classy move, specifically dedicated her award to Ballard.\nI hope the Dreamgirls example I have just cited points out why we should all appreciate the recent rebirth of the Hollywood musical over the past few years. More than any other genre, the movie musical gives directors, actors, and even audiences incredible creative license. Unlike drama, like the recently lauded Babel or the films of Martin Scorcese and dramedies like Sideways, which connects with audiences by portraying realistic and identifiable people and situations, musicals allow us to throw reason out the window.\nThe basic concept of the musical \u2014 that people will spontaneously sing and dance in the middle of the street \u2014 allows creators and audiences to abandon the heavy load of \u201crealism.\u201d Instantly we accept carte blanche the fact that Gene Kelly would be overjoyed to be caught in a torrential downpour in Singin\u2019 In the Rain, that New York City gangs are experts at ballet-fighting in West Side Story, or that Bohemian writers and prostitutes in Belle Epoch Paris are astonishingly familiar with 1970s rock music in Moulin Rouge. All of it is no more outlandish than lightsabers or orcs.\nMusicals have the remarkable ability to take a plot that in any other format would be downright depressing and make it enjoyable to watch, all the while preserving the overall message. For example, the film Chicago is essentially a tale of murder, adultery and corruption. However, its flashy presentation and biting wit made the plot surprisingly digestible while managing to never lose the take-home point of the film \u2014 if you\u2019re good enough at manipulating people, you get much further in life than those who follow the rules.\nFor a while it appeared that the movie musical was gasping for its last breath of air. Eclipsed first by the counter-culture and cynical cinema of the late 1960s and 1970s, and then by the emergence of the music video, the great Hollywood musical appeared to be lost forever. Notable exceptions like The Blues Brothers and Evita were not enough to make up for mega-flops like The Wiz and Newsies which scared producers away from any more musical projects.\nI really can\u2019t pinpoint a concrete reason for the rebirth of musicals. It is just as hard to explain the appeal of musicals in the first place as it is to try to investigate their comeback. Perhaps in today\u2019s world"}

They followed Sidique Khan to his mother-in-law's home, made inquiries about his telephone, and listened to bugged conversations in which he talked about waging jihad.\nYet they failed to identify either man, and cut short their investigations after deciding that the pair did not pose as high a risk as other suspects under investigation.\nThe revelations led to calls for a public inquiry from bereaved families and opposition parties, and provoked MI5 into an unprecedented public defence of its role.\nDetails of the security service failings were made public on Monday after five men were convicted of plotting a series of massive blasts in the southeast of England using bomb-making techniques learned at al-Qaida training camps in Pakistan. It also emerged that one of the gang's associates, Kazi Rahman, 29, was jailed for nine years last year after he admitted a charge of trying to purchase weapons.\nOn the MI5 website on Monday, the security service published a detailed allegation-by-allegation rebuttal of its handling of intelligence in the run-up to July 7. Opposition MPs demanded an independent inquiry and called on John Reid, the home secretary, to explain why the government claimed in the aftermath of the July 7 attacks that the four bombers were not known to MI5. Mr Reid resisted the call, but said the all-party intelligence and security committee would look at the matter.\nJonathan Evans, the new director general of MI5, denied that the organisation was in any way complacent. \"The attack on July 7 in London was a terrible event. The sense of disappointment felt across the service at not being able to prevent the attack (despite our efforts to prevent all such atrocities) will always be with us.\"\nOperation Crevice began as an MI5 investigation into a suspect living in Luton, Bedfordshire, called Mohammed Quayyum Khan. The court heard that Quayyum - known as Q - took orders from a senior al-Qaida figure, Abdul Hadi. In February 2004, MI5 intercepted a phone conversation between two of Q's young associates: Omar Khyam, in Crawley, was talking to Salahuddin Amin, in Pakistan, about the different ingredients needed to construct a fertiliser bomb.\nScotland Yard was brought in to help with surveillance. Eventually, police and MI5 intercepted 97 phone lines, secretly searched property on 12 occasions and compiled 3,500 hours of surveillance tapes.\nAccording to evidence in the fertiliser bomb trial Quayyum, a part-time taxi-driver from Luton, sent Mohammad Sidique Khan to Pakistan for a terrorist training camp in 2003, and sent funds to jihadi militants in Afghanistan.

In comparison, 40% of North America\u2019s trade is with regional partners and the rate soars to 63% in western Europe.\nAside from red tape, poor infrastructure, especially roads and railways, is a key obstacle. Transport cost in Africa is more than 60% higher than the average in developed countries owing to the poor infrastructure.\n\u201cPolicymakers have to move beyond simply signing agreements that reduce tariffs to drive a more holistic process to deeper regional integration,\u201d the World Bank report said, citing an array of barriers that make Africa\u2019s borders \u201cvery thick\u201d relative to other parts of the world.\nThe international border running through Kinshasa-Brazzaville, Africa\u2019s third largest urban area, for example, is a huge bottleneck in trade between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), it said.\nThough the two cities are regional trade hubs, trade between them is \u201cpitifully small,\u201d said the report, co-authored by Paul Brenton and Gozde Isik.\nThe report notes that passenger traffic is about five time smaller than that between East and West Berlin before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nIf people traveling between San Francisco and Oakland, California, a similar distance, had to pay the same level of fees, they would pay between $1 200 and $2 400 for a return trip, it said.\nThe exorbitant prices largely stem from lack of competition in river crossing services granted to the countries\u2019 national operators.\nIn another example, the report said most traders on the border with the DRC and neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes region are women, who say they \u201croutinely\u201d encounter violence, threats, demands for bribes, and sexual harassment at the hands of customs and other government officials at the border.\nEven within the regional bloc the Southern African Development Community, barriers remain formidably high.\nSouth African supermarket chain Shoprite spends $20 000"}

On the other hand, the fighting spirit of immigrant workers, seen in the immigrants\u2019 rights movement itself, shows that they would be a great asset to organizing drives and labor actions, if only the problem of their legal status could be resolved. As this would strengthen labor\u2019s bargaining power, it would benefit all workers, immigrant or not.\nThis is a major reason why the leadership of the AFL-CIO, Change to Win and many individual unions has prioritized legislation to legalize the undocumented this year.\nHowever, organized labor does not control Congress, and big business has its own agenda, which includes securing a supply of cheap labor from which it can derive extra profits, and undercut the rest of the workers. Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have always pushed for the creation of new guest worker programs. Guest workers are legally in the country, but they are in a vulnerable position, because they can\u2019t change jobs when they are not satisfied with the pay or working conditions. To do so, let alone to go on strike, would invalidate their permission to be in the United States. There are many examples of employers treating guest workers as serfs or worse. Only undocumented workers are worse off.\nSo labor, as well as the many organizations that constitute the immigrants\u2019 rights movement, are faced with the dilemma that it wants legislation passed, which would legalize the undocumented and regularize the way that new working-class immigrants are brought into the United States, but faces the obstacle of the demand for guest workers by the corporations and most Republican and many Democratic elected officials.\nIn 2005 and again in 2007, legislation was introduced whereby, in exchange for legalizing the undocumented, with a \u201cpath to citizenship,\u201d a certain number of new guest worker slots (up to 400,000 per year) would be created. There would also be new enforcement mechanisms, and the people being legalized would have to jump through many hoops. Some unions whose plan of growth relies heavily on organizing immigrant workers saw the possibility of organizing 8 million newly legalized workers as worth the sacrifice of accepting the guest worker program. But other unions, and the AFL-CIO, would not support a bill which included more guest workers.\nIn 2009, The AFL-CIO and Change to Win, along with immigrants\u2019 rights groups, developed a model for legislation which would have legalized most of the undocumented while dealing with the issue of guest workers via a labor-business controlled body that would authorize new guest worker positions (or not), based on labor market statistics. Mechanisms were also included which would allow guest workers to eventually get permanent resident visas and so be able to move away from guest worker status to regular employment. This led to the Reform Immigration for America campaign, which most of labor and most immigrants\u2019 rights organizations supported.

It is the latest embarrassment for France, which for decades refused to face up to accusations of collaboration in the Holocaust during the Nazi occupation.\nThe tribunal in Toulouse ordered the state and the SNCF to pay a total of \u20ac62,000 (\u00a343,000) to the family for their deceased father, and to their uncle in recognition of the transportation of the brothers alongside their parents to the Drancy camp in 1944. The camp, which became known as the \"antechamber of death\" was a transit prison from which around 67,000 Jews were sent to the Nazi death camps.\nIn their ruling, the judges recognised the prejudice suffered by the victims and their confinement at the camp. They said their transportation amounted to an \"act of negligence of the state's responsibilities\" because the state could not \"obviously\" ignore the fact that transportation to Drancy would normally mean subsequent removal to a Nazi death camp.\nThe judges found that the SNCF railway company never voiced \"any objection\" about transporting such prisoners. The journeys were classified as \"third class tariffs\" despite prisoners being transported in cattle trucks and SNCF continued to ask for payment of the bills after France was liberated from the Nazis. But the judges did not uphold the plaintiffs' charge that the actions of the French state and SNCF amounted to crimes against humanity.\nMr Lipietz described the tribunal's decision as \"historic\". \"It's the first time in history that the state and the SNCF have, as such, been condemned,\" he told Agence France Presse.\nHis father, Georges Lipietz, was 21 when German soldiers arrested him, his 15-year-old half brother and their parents in the town of Pau, east of Toulouse, on suspicion of being Jewish. The family, of Polish origin, had been given French nationality a few years before.\nAt Toulouse they were put on an SNCF train to Paris, where they were transported in a cattle truck which held 52 people, with no sanitation and only one opening for air.\nIn a journey that lasted more than 30 hours, they were only given water once - by the Red Cross during a stop. They were held at the Drancy camp for three months and survived.\nAddressing the tribunal this month, Mr Lipietz said his father had been unable to speak to him about the journey. But he said his father, \"with tears moistening his wrinkled cheeks\", had described how French gendarmes guarding the camp had pointed their guns at children who went too near the fence. He said he had taken the case because his father wanted the French state and the SNCF to stand up and condemn what happened.\nMr Lipietz added after yesterday's ruling: \"The tribunal has recognised that the state and the SNCF did more than that what was demanded of them by the Germans\" concerning the deportation \"not only of Jews but also of Gypsies or homosexuals\".\nThe lawyer for the SNCF said yesterday that the company would appeal against the ruling.

Unsurprisingly, they don't seem ready to shift their strategy in Syria.\nMeanwhile, the White House is ratcheting up the rhetorical pressure on the Kremlin. \"I think what we should do is ask Russia, how could it be, if you have advisers at that airfield, that you didn\u2019t know that the Syrian air force was preparing and executing a mass murder attack with chemical weapons?\" said Trump's national security adviser, H.R.

He had more fantasy points than Demaryius Thomas, Kelvin Benjamin, Dez Bryant, DeAndre Hopkins, and Allen Robinson, who were all far more highly ranked in preseason draft lists. But here's where Pryor missed the mark in fantasy land ... he wasn't a consistent point producer. In fact, he scored around 33 percent of his points in two games.

No quarterback scored 18-plus fantasy points more times than Matt Ryan (12), which isn't bad when you consider he wasn't even drafted in countless leagues. Losing Kyle Shanahan does put a bit of a damper on his value, but Ryan is still a top-70 overall selection for 2017. ...

Andrew Luck ranked fourth in points, finished in the top 10 nine times and threw two-plus touchdowns in 11 of his 15 games. Now in his prime, Luck is the best young fantasy quarterback in the NFL. He'll be a borderline top-50 pick next season. ... Tom Brady averaged more than 21 fantasy points per game and would have been a top-five finisher had he not been suspended four games. He also scored 18-plus fantasy points in 75 percent of his starts, which is quite a solid total. Even at 40, Brady remains elite. ...

But he refused to plead guilty to something he said he didn't do. Instead, he spent years in detention, waiting for a trial that never happened.\n\"He was a child being locked up for 23 hours a day for nearly two years,\" Browder said. \"That's enough to destroy a man's mind, let alone a child's.\"\nBrowder said her son tried to hang himself at Rikers.

Its members include JPI, the Center for Children's Law and Policy, the Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators and the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform.\nToo often, advocates say, facilities use solitary as a catchall \u2014 a place to house young people who won't follow the rules or as a warehouse for kids with mental illness.\n\"People are increasingly seeing that the use of solitary confinement is a counterproductive approach,\" Schindler said.\nThat includes people like Christine Blessinger.

The Small Business Credit Survey reported improved financing success for applicants, with a larger share receiving the full amount of financing requested. It also found higher success rates for loan and line of credit applicants in 2017, compared to 2016.\nThe SBCS also reported an increase in applications to online lenders overall last year, with notably higher application rates among self-reported medium and high credit risk firms. According to Federal Reserve figures, 55 percent of the companies applying for credit asked for $100K or less in financing, and 75 percent requested $250K or less.\nSix of ten applicants most frequently sought credit for expansion, which is an encouraging sign for the economy. Other small business credit applicants borrowed because of cash flow issues and cost pressures that required an infusion of funding to pay for operating expenses, including wages, and refinancing costs.\nFirms sought financing most frequently at large banks (48 percent), small banks (47 percent), and online lenders (24 percent) with the rest turning to friends/family, nonprofits, private investors, and other sources.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the application percentages are inversely related to approval rates, according to figures from the monthly Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index, which tracks approvals and declines of small business loan applications. For instance, the SBCS reports that nearly half of applicants approach big banks first, yet they approve slightly more than one-quarter of funding requests (25.5 percent), according to the latest Biz2Credit findings. Small banks, which grant a little less than half of funding requests, were the next most popular source.\nAccording to the Fed\u2019s study, online (non-bank) lenders accounted for about one-fourth of applications, while they approve requests at higher percentages than traditional banks. This reflects the willingness of non-bank lenders to provide capital to firms with less than stellar credit histories. These borrowers include startups and companies that for one reason or another may have run into some financial difficulties. While banks frequently turn down applicants perceived to be of \u201chigher risk,\u201d these companies have found success in securing loans, lines of credit, or cash advances from online, non-traditional sources.\nSmall businesses generate the lion\u2019s share of jobs in the U.S. private sector economy.

While startups and firms with little credit history or substandard creditworthiness have faced some difficulty securing capital, there are more options available than ever before, and overall, lenders have been willing to provide resources that spur entrepreneurship in the U.S."}

The government\u2019s attempt to confront rampant deforestation led to a controversial 2006 logging ban that has been criticized for prohibiting indigenous communities from using forest they\u2019ve been living in for centuries (NT May 26, 2006).\nBut the sprouting reforestation efforts are a sign that Nicaragua may finally be seeing the forest for the trees, Schwartz said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to resolve this with coercion or repression alone; it\u2019s going to have to be with a change of conscience,\u201d Schwartz told The Nica Times in an interview in his Managua office.\nSchwartz also applauded Nicaraguan timber exporters who are looking to become certified for sustainable practices \u2013 another factor that\u2019s helping to mitigate deforestation. But not all is growth and greenery.\nNicaragua\u2019s expanding \u201cagricultural frontier\u201d \u2013 campesinos who clear forest cover to plant basic crops \u2013 continues to be the main culprit for an estimated 70,000 hectares of tree cover that are lost each year.\nThe deep-rooted agricultural tradition is clashing with new restrictive forestry laws, experts say. As a result, Nicaragua\u2019s protected areas are \u2013 ironically \u2013 experiencing some of the worst deforestation in the country.\nA recent GTZ study of satellite imaging shows that between 1987 and 2005, protected buffer zones surrounding national parks near the Caribbean coast saw more loss of forest cover than the surrounding unprotected areas.\nFor Schwarz, changing that culture is a must, or President Daniel Ortega\u2019s call to increase agricultural productivity could result in further deforestation. Experts note that increased agricultural production doesn\u2019t necessary have to threaten forested lands, considering Nicaragua has hundreds of thousands of hectares of idle arable land.\nFor GTZ\u2019s Centeno, whose previous government career was spent enforcing environmental laws with MARENA, Nicaragua\u2019s destructive farming practices are linked to an antiquated farming culture.\n\u201cThe campesino still dreams of having his house on his ranch with his cows. The culture is deep,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s also a culture with little regard for environmental costs.\nBut instead of trying to address the systemic problems, the government has opted for a total prohibition in the form of the logging ban, passed in 2006 to"}

Once you inquire as to what is required and the hiring manager provides a concrete answer, you could then share specific skills, experience and activities you engaged in that will enable you to succeeded in the new job.\n\u201cHow can I best help you?\u201d Who wouldn\u2019t want to hear that? That one simple sentence demonstrates to the manager that you care and truly desire to help.\n\u201cYes, I researched all about the company.\u201d Then, share some pertinent insights and knowledge that you gathered about the company. It shows that you did your homework and are interested in the company and not just haphazardly interviewing.\n\u201cYes, I read the job description thoroughly.\u201d Share your understanding of the job, its requirements and how you meet them.\n\u201cI checked out the LinkedIn profiles of people at your company to see their backgrounds.\u201d It may sound a little stalkerish, but interviewers want to know that you came to the interview prepared. By researching the company, it demonstrates your motivation, interest, intellectual curiosity, drive and sincere interest in the role.\n\u201cWhat times work best for you to conduct an interview?\u201d You want to demonstrate to the interviewer that you recognize it isn\u2019t all about you. You are going to be part of a team and are willing to work well with others.\nThere are other questions to ask and statements to make, but I think you get the message. The goal is to portray yourself as someone who wants to help contribute, has done your homework and arrives prepared. You want to avoid coming across as a prima donna demanding entitlements. Rather, you want to convey that you will contribute in a positive and meaningful way.\nYes, it is that simple. The hiring manager will view you as a breath of fresh air\u2014a person who is motivated, polite, professional and possesses the qualities and willingness to do the hard work necessary to succeed."}

The Tribulation will witness the emergence of the Illuminati-sponsored New World Order (NWO), the revelation of the Beast, and Pope Francis assuming the role of the \u201cFalse Prophet\u201d mentioned in The Book of Revelation.\nObama, according to conspiracy theorists, will play a relatively modest role in the Tribulation period as the predecessor of the Beast.\nThe exact date for the asteroid impact is often stated as September 24. The impact will be a signal to the ever-conspiring Illuminati to implement their socialist world government agenda. The upcoming Jade Helm military exercises are part of Illuminati preparation for the New World Order.\nAccording to conspiracy theorists, the governments of the world\u2019s leading nations are aware of the impending catastrophe but are keeping the information from the public to prevent mass panic while the elite prepare to survive the catastrophe.\nWhile most skeptics interpret the French minister\u2019s statement only as a warning to encourage nations to act at the United Nations climate conference to open in Paris, France, in November, 2015, conspiracy theorists interpreted the statement as a disclosure of impending catastrophe. And 500 days from May, 2014, ends in September 2015.\nPractically all versions of the end-time theory being circulated online agree that the event will be a climate catastrophe. But while most doomsday prophets agree that the climate catastrophe will be caused by an massive asteroid impact, there are some versions of the end-time theory based on other causes.\nThe website GunsAmerica also recently published an article in the form of a letter by Paul Helsinki. The article, widely circulated in the conspiracy theory blogosphere, titled, \u201cJade Helm Update: It\u2019s About Mass Extinction Event Coming 2015,\u201d claims that the impending catastrophe is the result of weather manipulation experiments by governments and that the Jade Helm exercises are part of preparation for the expected collapse of the global climate.\nOther doomsday theorists have suggested that the climate catastrophe could come through a volcanic winter due to eruption of the Indonesian supervolcano.\nA few believe that escalation of the U.S.\u2013Russia confrontation over Ukraine will lead to a nuclear war that will wipe out much of civilization.\nYet others speculate fancifully that the catastrophe will come through an event triggered by CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider Experiment.\nRegardless of what various conspiracy theorists say about how the catastrophe will come, they all agree it will come in"}

Perhaps, in Canmore \u2014 a town \"too big to be small\" that's also \"too small to be big\" \u2014 the announcement of a ban on jumping off the Engine Bridge is both.\nA new bylaw passed by Canmore council this month means that residents who participate in one of the town's longest standing traditions \u2014 jumping off the historic Engine Bridge into the Bow River on hot summer days \u2014 face the threat of a $500 fine.\nIt's a pedestrian bridge that was originally part of a railway spur line that served Canmore's coal mine a century ago.\nRocky Mountain Outlook editor Tanya Foubert, a longtime Canmore resident, spoke to the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday about how the bridge jumping ban is going over with residents.\nQ: Tell me about this new rule, what you think about it.\nA: It's an updated bylaw passed by council at the beginning of the month that replaces a previous bylaw. I do believe that within the perspective of the municipality, jumping from this bridge has been frowned upon or somewhat discouraged in the past. But with the new bylaw, it really sets it out in plain English: You can't jump from this bridge, and if you do, you could face a fine of up to $500.\nSo we are definitely seeing some reaction in the community about this change.\nQ: Is it about the $500 fine or just the prohibition?\nA: In Canmore, a lot of things have changed, even in the last 10 years, let alone the last 40.\nGrowing up here, for a lot of people, jumping from the Engine Bridge was one of those things you did as a kid. It was one of those rituals of childhood and summer. And with change, it feels as if our past is diminished or we're not allowed to do the same things we used to do \u2014 that the community isn't the same place that it used to be. It's just that feeling of nostalgia for the way things were and perhaps a simpler time, when you could jump from the bridge and into the nice cool water on a hot summer's day.\nQ: It is not just the bridge that falls under this new rule, but is it your sense that it's really the bridge that the rule was about?\nA: The way the wording is phrased, there wouldn't be any other town infrastructure you could jump or rappel from.\nQ: Has anyone ever been hurt?\nA: There is at least one instance in the past that I can think of, from covering the news here in town. But I think that that instance involved other layers of risk \u2014 risky behavior like alcohol and drugs and perhaps jumping into the river at night.\nQ: You can understand why a community would want to err on the side of caution, right? Obviously this rule did did not come out of nowhere. There had to have been some discussion and presumably one would think some consensus?\nA: Yeah, definitely they took a risk management approach. One of the things I've been saying about Canmore, in the last five years, is we're too big to be small and too small to be big.\nWe, as a municipality or administration, are growing. With the size of our community, you see additional resources being put into looking into perhaps unaddressed issues. Risk management around town on infrastructure and assets definitely could be one of those.\nAnd it's not the only spot that's kind of one of those fun summer water jumping spots.

They are maintaining their goal of opening 2,000 beds in campus settings by the end of 1992, but concede that finding five or six sites rather than two may make it difficult to meet that deadline.\nRather than providing a comprehensive array of drug treatment services at one site, as was the concept with the large campuses, the smaller centers would offer rehabilitation, education and job training to people who have completed drug detoxification programs elsewhere.\nThe top strategists of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's drug policy, including Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, said they would continue to search for sites for the 1,000-bed campuses, but they are not optimistic. ''I remain hopeful that we can find one, but I don't know if I'd say I'm confident,'' said Mr. Lundine, who heads the gubernatorial commission that first recommended the drug campus concept.\nAfter the panel, the Statewide Anti-Drug Abuse Council, recommended last November that the state acquire or build at least two treatment centers with campuses to serve 2,000 clients, Mr. Cuomo's budget proposed the sale of $80 million in bonds to develop two 1,000-bed centers, one in upstate New York and one close to New York City. Despite the severe budget difficulties the state has experienced since the proposal, administration officials said they hoped the Governor's budget for expanding drug treatment was not reduced in negotiations with the Legislature.\nThe campuses, which were conceived as a method of expanding the state's drug treatment capacity quickly, would provide only one-fifth of the 10,000 new residential treatment beds proposed in both Mr. Lundine's report and Mr. Cuomo's budget. But they proved to be the most novel, and thus the most highly publicized and widely debated, innovation in Mr. Cuomo's program to expand state-sponsored drug treatment, which was presented as the Governor's top policy initiative this year.\nMr. Lundine and Gary G. Fryer, the Governor's press secretary, sought today to downplay the substantive and political significance of changing the campus plan two months after it was included in the Mr. Cuomo's budget and less than three weeks before the Legislature's April 1 budget deadline.\n''There's nothing sacred about any of the proposals we made,'' Mr. Fryer said.\nThe debate within the administration about reducing the size of the campuses has been driven by politics as well as by policy.\nWith the looming of the budget deadline pressuring the administration to provide details about the proposed drug complexes, Mr. Lundine's office had been unable to find suitable sites. Hopes that the Federal Government might donate land or a center proved unrealistic.\nAnother obstacle was raised by Mr. Cuomo's appointment in December of Arthur Y. Webb as director of the State Division of Substance Abuse Services, which would operate the campus centers. Mr. Webb replaced Julio A. Martinez, who resigned"}

That, in turn, means lower power consumption and less waste heat in the data centers where these drives are designed to be used. Specifically, WD said the power used per terabyte drops 49 percent.\nThe lower turbulence also increases the drive&apos;s capacity because more platters can be squeezed into the 3.5-inch housing. Today&apos;s 4-terabyte models use five platters and top out at 4TB, but the Ultrastar He6 has seven platters and reaches 6TB of capacity. That&apos;s also useful for data centers where space is at a premium.\nHard drives are under competitive pressure from flash memory, which is faster and quieter but which costs a lot more per gigabyte.\nThe helium-based concept will be the basis for new designs that Western Digital has in the works to keep hard drives in the capacity lead with better areal density -- in other words, more bits per square inch of each platter.\n\"HGST&apos;s helium platform will serve as the main platform for new technologies like shingled magnetic recording (SMR) and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) where HGST will continue to push the HDD areal density envelope,\" Western Digital said in its announcement. \"The helium platform will also serve as the future building block for new, growing market segments such as cold storage, a space that HGST plans to address over the next couple of years.\"\n\"Cold storage\" refers to data that&apos;s needed only infrequently but that must be accessible relatively quickly -- not something like company e-mail archives and purchasing records that are dumped onto tape storage that&apos;s really slow but really cheap per byte.

Lower paying jobs in food and accommodation (+12,500) and retail sales (+9,700) have also seen sizable gains, said Hirsch.\nThe shift from higher-paying jobs in oil and gas toward the service sector and jobs dependent on government spending is troubling but unsurprising, he said.\nDoug Porter, chief economist with BMO Capital Markets, said Alberta\u2019s monthly job increase \u2014 the largest provincial gain in the country \u2014 was surprising.\n\u201cTrue, another wave of announced job cuts in the energy patch are likely to weigh in coming months, but the resiliency of overall employment in Alberta is truly impressive. We would again put this down to the fact that the province came into the oil price shock with very real labour shortages, and those shortages are being filled in a big way,\u201d said Porter.\nAlberta\u2019s 6.0 unemployment rate was the third lowest in Canada, tied with British Columbia and behind Saskatchewan\u2019s 4.7 per cent and Manitoba\u2019s 5.7 per cent. The Alberta government said the unemployment rate was unchanged from July because the labour force increased by 3,400 people while employment increased by 4,700. On an annual basis, full-time employment increased by 46,200 and part-time employment decreased by 5,200.\nNationally, the unemployment rate ticked higher, rising 0.2 percentage points to 7 per cent as a gain of 12,000 jobs was offset by more people entering the workforce. Prior to August, the unemployment rate had held steady at 6.8 per cent for six consecutive months, said the federal agency.\nThe job gains represented an increase in full-time employment, as 54,000 full-time positions were added in August, versus a decline of 42,000 part-time jobs.\nCompared with 12 months earlier, employment was up by 193,300 or 1.1 per cent.

At the time, the family lived a block from where Ryan's battered body was found in an Englewood lot on July 28, 1998, she said.\n\"He said, `I was told to watch your house because there was a threat on your family,'\" Crawford said.\nIn response to questioning by her family's lawyer, Andre Grant, she said the officer would not say anything more about the threat.\n\"A hit had been put on your family and [your grandson]?\" Grant asked.\n\"Whoever this person was wanted them out of the way, the whole family,\" she said.\nLawyers for the boy said the arrest galvanized the neighborhood against the boys.

People are probably thinking about jumping back on the bandwagon that so many, including myself, hopped off during last year\u2019s sophomore slump. But should you?\nBy now, everyone\u2019s either seen a highlight or read about Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte\u2019s 89-yard TD run against Oakland last Saturday in preseason.\nPeople are probably thinking about jumping back on the bandwagon that so many, including myself, hopped off during last year\u2019s sophomore slump.\nRemember, Forte has never rushed for four yards or more a carry, isn\u2019t much of a goal-line back and last year could only muster up double-digit points against the weakest defenses in the league.\nThat\u2019s excluding San Francisco in Week 10, when Jay Cutler was in check-down mode after the criticism he took for turnovers (yet somehow still managed to throw five picks in that game).\nForte did show some real burst, and even without that huge run last week, he still averaged five yards a carry (four carries, 20 yards).\nThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty with the third-year back, including his very suspect offensive line, his role with Chester Taylor as a potential handcuff and the fact that offensive coordinator Mike Martz\u2019s system isn\u2019t very run-happy.\nCBS\u2019 senior fantasy writer, Dave Richard, has a graphic charting Martz\u2019s passing dependence compared with the rest of the NFL from 1999-2008. Let\u2019s just say, Martz likes the forward pass considerably more than the rest of the NFL.\nAlso, Forte\u2019s game is predicated on wearing defensives down. He needs carries to do so, and judging by Marshall Faulk (averaged 237.4 carries with Martz from 1999-2003) and Frank Gore (240 carries in one season with Martz), Forte likely won\u2019t sniff the 316 touches as he had in 2008.\nForte hasn\u2019t had a season where he\u2019s had less than 258 carries.\nNot to mention, the Raiders were 29th in the NFL in stopping the run last year, so temper your expectations.\nI\u2019d still wait until after the third round to consider drafting Forte, and there are probably better options out there for you, depending on what positions haven\u2019t been filled.\nLast year, before Pix Six Weekly had a name, this column has had a common theme: It\u2019s all about the matchups.\nYou can take a peak at the schedule prior to draft day when thinking of a pick, but most of us don\u2019t take that into account because some players are match-up-proof.\nIt would be foolish to take a pass on drafting a guy like Chris Johnson because of a tough schedule. The Tennessee Titans and Houston Texans are tied for the most difficult schedule, based on 2009 opponents\u2019 records, according to ESPN.\nBut some of those fringe first-rounders\u2019 and sleepers\u2019 schedules could be the difference this year in taking a player high or letting him be someone else\u2019s headache.\nFor this week\u2019s Pick Six, I\u2019ll evaluate six fantasy players\u2019 schedule and see if they\u2019re worth the first"}

However Obama also told Fox News that he was still awaiting answers from Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. Answers to demands made by Secretary Hillary Clinton required to rectify the Israeli announcement, during Vice President Joe Biden's visit, on 1600 new apartments to be built beyond the old 1967 line (Green Line) in Jerusalem. Analyst David Essing is of the view the Obama administration is now pressing Israel for concessions that will not only persuade West Bank Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to participate in the proximity talks but to also jump-start the U.S. mediated negotiation once they get going.\nIt is now abundantly clear that U.S. President Barack Obama is demanding Israeli concessions not only to set right the Israeli insult of Vice President Joe Biden. Obama is exploiting the Israeli government's egregious gaffe by also insisting that Israel now make a serious concession with two goals in mind. First, to entice West Bank Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to participate in the proposed proximity talks to be mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell (without the renewed support by the Arab League, Abbas is unlikely to reconsider). Secondly, Obama apparently wants Netanyahu to offer a concession that will help jump-start the proximity format. Meanwhile, Washington has made clear that Mitchell will not even return to Israel until Netanyahu delivers. The heart of the matter is the volatile issue of Jerusalem which Israel declares as its undivided capital where it is sole sovereign, the Palestinians demand that eastern Jerusalem be recognized as capital of future Palestine. The U.S. has always sided with the Arabs saying it must be negotiated; Netanyahu and his Likud party categorically insist that it will never be up for negotiation. Some commentators have contended that Jerusalem is such a deal- breaker it should be left to the last issue in any Israeli- Palestinian negotiation.\nThe Interior Ministry announcement has in effect forced Netanyahu's hand. Rather than being left for the last nut to crack, it has been propelled to the top of the agenda and Washington is warning Israel of the consequences. Aware of what's at stake and the Iranian nuclear threat at the back of everyone's mind, the Prime Minister has been burning the midnight oil with the other other key cabinet members who make up the 'Big Seven'. Interior Minister Eli Ishai, the main culprit in the mess, is included by virtue of his being Shas party leader. The Maarive newspaper carries a banner headline 'U.S. Wants Ishai Sacked!' Netanyahu is very unlikely to comply because Shas would bolt the coalition and perhaps precipitate the fall of his government.\nState President Shimon Peres has hinted at one possible way out to satisfy the Americans. While stating the need to repair relations with the U.S. as soon as possible, Peres also noted that all Israeli governments since 1967 have built in the Jewish areas of Jerusalem beyond the Green Line. In other words, until now Israeli governments have refrained from housing projects inside the numerous Arab quarters of east Jerusalem. It should be noted that Ramat Shlomo, at the nub of the current confrontation, is located at the northern tip of 'Jewish' Jerusalem near the Jewish neighborhood of Ramot. It does not impinge on 'Arab' East Jerusalem. In light of this, was the wily State President advising Netanyahu to make a commitment"}

After closing down the marketplace, over $28 million in Bitcoin was seized. According to US prosectors, Silk Road accounted for over one million users who used the marketplace to purchase items which may not have been illegal, spanning from marijuana to fake passports and drugs.

The 72-year-old Bettles will goal umpire his 800th game of football on Friday afternoon as the Redan Lions take on the Ballarat Swans in round two of the BFL reserves competition at Alfredton Recreational Reserve. \"It's hard to put the feelings into words,\" Bettles said. \"I guess on one hand it is a big milestone but on the other on the field I've got to treat it like any other.\" This game will be a special for another reason other than Bettles milestone, as it will act as a tribute game for Ballarat Football club life member and former club games record holder Frank Segrave. Bettles was good friends with Segrave as the two would often cross paths within the football club. \"I knew Frank for years and I sort of feel honoured that I've been given the opportunity to umpire on Friday,\" Bettles said. Bettles first began umpiring in 1993 after seeing an ad in The Courier. \"I just read an ad in The Courier that said they were looking for umpires and I just thought 'I'm not doing anything in the winter, why not?' and I've been umpiring ever since.\" Some of the biggest changes over the years Bettles has seen haven't actually come on the field, rather they've come in his umpiring uniform department. \"We used to have the wide hat and the lab-coat - I remember we had one game down at the Eastern Oval and it was of course nice and windy. \"Those hats were always fairly difficult to keep on and I just remember walking out on the ground and the next thing I knew my hat flew off, rolled across the cricket pitch and when I picked it up it was black with mud,\" Bettles laughed. \"Another time I was behind the goals on a horrendous day in another one of our many umpiring hats - this one had a blue bill. \"The rain was coming down so heavily I was looking forward and blue water started dropping in front of my face, little did I know all the dye drained out of the hat and ended up on the grass in front of me.\" Other than the uniforms, the overall quality of the grounds teams are playing in currently were the next biggest thing Bettles has seen change. \"In some of the winters I umpired in over the years, I remember some of the (football ovals) out toward the Central Highlands could turn into mud which always made for interesting footy.\" Getting to this milestone seemed unlikely at points for Bettles, as two years ago he was struck by a life threatening case of pneumonia. Now, Bettles biggest worry is the weather ahead of game 800. \"I think it's forecasted for clear skies and a 21 degree day - I don't really have anything to complain about if that is the case,\" he said with a smile on his face.\nWHITE FLAG: John Bettles is ready to once again wave the white flags behind the goals on Friday afternoon.

Fitzpatrick -- situated along Alabama State Route 110 -- had a population of just 964, as of 2007. The quiet rural town was founded in the mid-1800s. Tourists who travel through Fitzpatrick are often attracted to the town's historical buildings and monuments, which date back to the late 1850s.\nTourists visiting Fitzpatrick will have to stay in neighboring towns like Shorter, Montgomery or Pike Road, Alabama. Shorter, about 14 miles north of Fitzpatrick, has a Days Inn. Union Springs, 15 miles east, is home to the Greenway Inn. Pike Road, about 15 miles west of Fitzpatrick, is home to the Scottish Inns and the Pine Lake Motel. Montgomery, a large city located about 20 miles west of Fitzpatrick, has dozens of chain hotels and independently owned hotels to choose from.\nThe region surrounding Fitzpatrick is home to a variety of restaurants. One of the more common types of cuisine served in the area is old-fashioned country-style cooking; guests craving fare like fried chicken and barbecue may want to visit restaurants like Union Springs' Hilltop Grill, Southern Comfort Cafe or Jerry's Country Kitchen. Guthrie's, in Shorter, is another local country-cooking spot. The area also has several restaurants that serve Mexican food, like Union Springs' La Azteca and Las Palmas.\nThere are many parks in the area around Fitzpatrick: Shorter has VictoryLand Greyhound Park and Winddrift Travel Park, and Union Springs has Farrior Ed Park. The Tuskegee National Forest -- which includes the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site -- is less than 25 miles from Fitzpatrick. The national park, covering over 11,000 acres in Macon County, offers camping, hiking, hunting, fishing and horseback riding opportunities to lovers of the great outdoors.\nHistoric buildings and monuments worth seeing in Fitzpatrick include the town's Baptist and Methodist churches. Fitzpatrick United Methodist Church -- sometimes called \"The Church of the Seven Sisters\" -- was erected in 1858 and founded by seven of the town's women; the building on Fitzpatrick Road was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1978, as well as the National Register of Historic Places. The town's small white Baptist church still stands, as well, though it is not as well preserved. The town's train depot -- which housed Fitzpatrick's post office until 1990 -- is another spot often visited by history enthusiasts.\nYapp, Ginger. \"Fitzpatrick, Alabama for Tourists.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/fitzpatrick-alabama-tourists-36885.html.

A series of criminal cases could increase pressure on lawmakers to act, these people said.\nSome federal law enforcement officials have also voiced concerns that announcing the cases, rather than keeping them under seal, could imperil ongoing investigative work or make it harder to catch suspects who might travel out of Iran, according to the people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations.\nHere we have several insiders effectively whistleblowing on the Trump DoJ that its national security investigations are being politicized to advance a hawkish policy agenda. Under a \u201cnormal\u201d presidency, this would likely be a major scandal, but under Scandal-a-Day Trump, it hardly registered notice.\nAll of these reports were 36\u201348 hours after the Post broke the story that the targeting of Iranian nationals was a deliberate political ploy by Trump to single out their alleged crimes for the entirely unrelated purposes of stoking a war panic, imposing harsher sanctions, and doing what the administration has long\u2014and quite openly\u2014wanted to do: get out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran Deal. But none of these reports mention this crucial piece of context, context that would put the sensational headlines about Iranians hijacking our precious pop culture assets into proper perspective.\nMost of the articles had a throwaway line explaining that Justice wasn\u2019t technically implicating the Iranian government, but it was heavily implied they were involved, with citations of the defendant\u2019s \u201clinks\u201d to the Iranian military, and one or two paragraphs devoted to previous Iranian and North Korean government hacks.\nThe Daily News skipped the caveat all together and strongly suggested the defendant was working on behalf of the Iranian government, writing he was a \u201cmember of the Iran-supported Turk Black Hat Security team\u201d and \u201chad worked on behalf of the Iranian armed forces to attack military and nuclear software systems, as well as Israeli infrastructure.\u201d The DoJ\u2019s reluctant admission that he had no connection to the government didn\u2019t merit a mention.\nClearly NBC editors realized this context was crucial. How many other people around the world have committed similar crimes? How many hacks of this nature are currently under FBI investigation? If the number is 100 and the Trump DoJ, under pressure from anti-Iran ideologues in the administration, selectively highlighted this case to paint a broader narrative, certainly this would put the story in a whole new light.\nThis isn\u2019t to necessarily blame specific journalists writing up the DoJ\u2019s press conference. It\u2019s possible they missed the Washington Post\u2019s report on political corruption at the DoJ on Iran. Certainly, no reporter can know all relevant reports all the time.

Can you blame me for thinking my summer might be ruined when Mariano Rivera went down and then David Robertson along with Michael Pineda, Joba Chamberlain and what has now been nearly two months of no Brett Gardner?\nWith the disabled list more crowded than a New Haven-bound Metro North train on a Friday at 5 and the heart of the order lacking power, it made sense to start getting worried about this team. After a 10-3 run here over the last couple weeks, the Yankees are tied in the loss column with the Orioles for first place in the division and have moved ahead of the Rays for the first time this season.\nIf Phil Hughes is going to throw quality starts on a consistent basis (and maybe throw in a complete game here and there), and Ivan Nova is going to follow suit (and maybe nearly throw a complete game here and there) then maybe the Yankees rotation is as good as people thought it could be before the season. But for as good as things are going, I don\u2019t know if people want to start counting on and relying on Hughes and Nova to consistently dominate, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that the Yankees can lean on CC Sabathia and Andy Pettitte. And this begs the question of where the Yankees be without Andy Pettitte? The answer: the past tense of a certain expletive.\nWhen Pettitte surprised everyone by announcing his return and accepting a minor-league deal for the same amount of money he\u2019s used to making in about two weeks of work I thought for that amount of money maybe Pettitte will go through the end of spring training and decide it\u2019s not worth it. But really I knew that Pettitte wasn\u2019t going to unretire and leave his family after a full year with them for what is an insignificant amount of money to him if he didn\u2019t have the desire to return and compete at the same level he did in the first half of 2010.\nIt\u2019s comical now that a little over two months ago Yankees fans were worried about who would come out of the rotation or go to the bullpen or go to Triple-A with seven starters for five spots. Everyone was excited about the idea of Pettitte returning and everyone enjoys a good comeback story, but there were plenty of people skeptical about how he would perform and whether or not it would be worth it to remove a young starter from the rotation and sacrifice developing young pitching for a 39-year-old who hasn\u2019t started since the 2010 ALCS. All of those ideas and notions seem ridiculous now that Pettitte has become the team\u2019s best starter (sorry CC).\nI never wrote a Goodbye piece for Andy Pettitte when he \u201cretired\u201d after the 2010 season, and thankfully I didn\u2019t (mainly because it would have been a waste of time and words given his comeback) since I\u2019m not good at saying goodbye, especially to members of the Core Four. Now I\u2019m just happy Pettitte isn\u2019t good at saying goodbye either."}

But as part of a package of concessions to Blue Dogs, the House Energy and Commerce Committee accepted an amendment that requires the HHS Secretary to negotiate rates with providers. That version of the plan will save only $25 billion.\nIn total, a public plan based on Medicare rates would save $110 billion over 10 years. That is $20 billion more than earlier estimates, a spokesman for House Speaker Pelosi said.\nSo a public option would save anywhere between $2 billion and $11 billion per year depending on whether or not it\u2019s based on Medicare rates. That\u2019s savings to the government, and it\u2019s based on the fact that the public option would lower the cost of insurance and the feds would therefore have to pay lower subsidies to low-income households buying coverage under the individual mandate. However, if the private plans lower their prices to compete with the public option, then everyone buying insurance would save money, not just low-income families, and the total cost savings to consumers would be much higher.\nIt\u2019s hard to say how significant this would be without seeing the actual CBO report, but in any case the point is clear: the public option saves money.

And Fatbrain.com, the online bookseller that has nudged the market forward by commissioning electronic manuscripts, reported that other top publishers are moving to post works through its service, MightyWords, which in the last two weeks filled 50,000 orders for essays by prominent authors like Pete Hamill and Doris Kearns Goodwin.\nThe question still remains whether customers will exhibit the same level of enthusiasm for electronic books when they actually have to pay for them. The MightyWords essays, for example, are free. And Mr. King's 66-page e-novella attracted a burst of 500,000 orders while some major online booksellers were giving it away without charge. That demand quickly tapered off after the first 48 hours that the title was posted on March 14, with orders far below Mr. King's usual sales of more than a million per title.\nBut even so, the horror meister cast a long shadow on the evolution of the e-book market because his work offered lessons on publishing in a new environment and greatly raised expectations about the immediate future among publishers in the United States and in Europe. Online booksellers like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com could not keep up with the pace of the initial orders. And it took less than two days for hackers to figure out how to break through security measures and to post the material on Web sites along with instructions enabling others to crack the software.\nLost in the wave of publicity about Mr. King's novella was another significant event that might have a greater impact on the nascent digital book market. Gemstar International Group in California and the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia announced a deal to plunge into the electronic book industry to create a mass market for digital reading devices with the aim of producing 500,000 of them this year.\nGemstar, which earlier in the year purchased NuvoMedia and another e-book pioneer, Softbook Press, is licensing its electronic book technology to Thomson, which will manufacture the devices in exchange for a share of revenues from books sold for reading on the minicomputers. Between NuvoMedia and Softbook Press, there are fewer than 15,000 of the electronic readers on the market and up until now these small companies lacked the clout and volume to persuade publishers to distribute many titles electronically.\nBut with the announcement of the Thomson alliance and the popularity of the Stephen King novella, he said that three of the nation's top publishers are now in final negotiations with his company to make available everything -- from new front list titles to perennial favorites from the back list. He declined to identify those companies. And he added that Gemstar is also involved in discussions with other manufacturers to build other brands of e-books.\nThomson, which makes TV sets under the RCA label, is working feverishly to design a lighter weight model with more capacity and functions that will be available for Christmas.

That was before the Thunder managed to keep star forward Paul George with a four-year, $137 million deal. The Anthony opt-in and the George signing, among other moves, put the Thunder at a payroll plus luxury tax bill of $310 million, the most ever.\nThe Thunder made a big splash by shipping Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Knicks to acquire the gifted scorer last September. The Thunder hoped that pairing Melo along with George and Russell Westbrook would lead to success in the Western Conference.\nThe result was, statistically, the worst season of Anthony\u2019s NBA life. He posted career lows in field goal percentage (40.4%) and points per game (16.2) as Oklahoma City only improved its record by a single game in 2017-18.

But Jammu today broke new grounds with an effigy of a momo -- Tibetan dumplings that have become a hugely popular street food.\nCarrying an effigy with the bizzare message \"Momo kills slowly\" written on it, Jammu's BJP legislator Ramesh Arora solemnly marched down street with a dozen followers this morning. The effigy of momo was then burnt with all ceremony.\nMr Arora had first made news with his warnings about momos a couple of weeks ago. That time, he had called it a \"health hazard\". In the intervening weeks, the danger level of momos appears to have gone up.\nSo how the dumplings -- which are flour casings stuffed with chicken, prawns or vegetables and mostly steamed can be fatal to humans? Turns out that the legislator's real objection is not to momos per se, but MSG or monosodium glutamate, which, he thinks, is added to the stuffing to enhance taste.\nAjinomoto (monosodium glutamate) used in the recipe for making Momos to enhance its taste is harmful to health and can even cause cancer. They have been found to be the root cause of several life-threatening diseases,\" Mr Arora was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust of India.\nA couple of decades ago, a pinch of MSG, widely known as ajinomoto, was a must-add in Chinese cuisine, whether it was cooked in restaurants or at home. But its use dwindled after it came be widely believed that the chemical carried health risks.\nMSG is not a banned substance but there are strictures on its use. The government can take action against any firm which uses MSG beyond permissible limits.\nThe website on Food Safety Helpline run by the food safety regulator FSSAI says, \"It is popularly believed that large doses of MSG can cause headaches, nausea and other feelings of discomfort collectively known as \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\", although controlled studies have failed to identify such symptoms. The USFDA, the premier regulatory body in USA, considers MSG to be \"generally recognized as safe\"."}

Although FindLaw Columnist Phillip Carter outlines four possibilities in an article for CNN, there are currently two leading answers to the question of where Saddam Hussein should be tried, and by whom.\nThe American government has been vocal in favor of trial by the Iraqi Governing Council's tribunal, developed for the purpose of prosecuting former Hussein regime officials. The argument for Iraqi jurisdiction is to put the power in the hands of the Iraqi people, those who have suffered most under Hussein's regime.\nOn the other hand, the fledgling Iraqi tribunal may have difficulty handling the complexities of such an intricate international case, or as one skeptical commentator put it, the Iraqi tribunal \"lacks the institutional competence and credibility to conduct such an important trial.\" Others complain that the U.S. endorsement of this option revolves around the possibility of the death penalty, which a UN-sanctioned tribunal would not permit.\nMany critical of the American-backed proposal instead favor trial by an International Criminal Tribunal. International human rights groups worry that the United States has selfish motives in mind. One column in the Edinburgh, Scotland EVENING NEWS suggested that such and international tribunal would seem less under American influence, stating that \"an international tribunal would inevitably mean Saddam citing, in defence, evidence that his conduct in the Iran-Iraq war was far from opposed by his Arab Gulf neighbours or the US.\" Another advantage to international trial would be involvement by other countries that have suffered greatly at the hands of Hussein, such as Iran and Kuwait.\nInternational tribunals have a varied history. The International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda \u0097 both set up within the framework of the United Nations are already underway. And more recently there has been the establishment of the International Criminal Court, set up as a completely new international organization. In each case precedents are being set for the trials of those accused of international human rights violations, but guidelines are still being written, and each of these cases has had to break a significant amount of new ground.

Get more stock trading tips from India Infoline.\nTrading is a gamble they say. And it is, therefore, one of the most common deterrents that keep people from trading in the share market. But in reality, trading is not as scary as it seems to be. If only you can avoid some of the common mistakes that traders usually do, you can steer clear into earning good returns.\nCan you write something on paper without a pen or pencil? Or can you repair your car without the right tools? Just like these are not possible, trading without using the right tools is also a big mistake. This becomes more important than the examples even because it\u2019s your own hard-earned money that you trade. Have good brokers to guide you, reliable trading software to assist you, some financial educational material to back you everytime you trade. The more you realize the value of these right tools and start using them, the profitable it might turn out to be for you.\nThere\u2019s a reason why you budget yourself everytime you get your salary. You note your expenses, liabilities, investments and distribute funds accordingly to each. Having it written helps you be more focused towards your goal, track your spending, budget your expenses and save better. Same applies to trading. Constantly recording your trading in your diary does contribute significantly to making you a good trader. You may or may not make money always but you can certainly review your trading patterns and improvise each time. So, don\u2019t get low about losses but rather note it as a lesson that you can learn from and avoid next time.\nMarket trading isn\u2019t limited to stocks today. It involves other securities such as options, futures, commodities and currencies too. Having a specialization helps you to approach the hot market segment with a pinch of salt. Knowing your speciality gives you an edge. It helps you plan your way around the risks and attract maximum profitable returns. Technical knowledge, interpretation of data, networking or timing the trade, choose your skill and master it in a way that it works in your favour.\nLosses, like success, have the tendency to multiply but at a faster rate. Hence, it becomes very crucial that you take measures to stop it when you have the chance. Stop-loss order is one such opportunity. You can stop the trade if your losses reach a certain threshold. This way you can stop its snowball effect and change it back to something that works more in your interest.\nDealing with money is more of an emotional gamble than economical. Traders earn or lose money all the time but what that\u2019s the idea of it. Money is important to everyone. For some it meant the safety of themselves or their family, to others it was security while for yet others it is a symbol of status and power. However, these perceptions are right in their way, losing money then could mean losing things related to it. Therefore, it is important how emotionally attached you are to it. Trade smaller trade sizes till you are sure of your emotional state. The better you are in control, the better trading decisions you would make.\nTrading is a good way to make some money in the market however, you need to play smart. Avoid the mistakes that people generally do and make the most of the opportunities at hand. Use your instinct along with your experience and market knowledge to earn good returns.

We already know that she'll have a significant role to play, but details are obviously under wraps for now.\nWhile we've been teased about how strong Captain Marvel will be in the MCU, Brie Larson gave some significant intel about exactly how big of a force she will be in the MCU.

Sure, the Mad Titan was able to rip a moon to pieces and throw it at the Avengers, but it sounds like Captain Marvel will be able to hold her own when it comes to interplanetary rumbles with planets and moons for weapons. It's possible that Brie Larson could be playing up the strength of Carol Danvers, but that seems unlikely. Why would you make something up about the ability to move a planet?\nBrie Larson has also recently talked about how strong the production of Captain Marvel has made her in real-life. The Academy Award winning actress says that her training and filming has made her much stronger than she ever realized. To prepare for Captain Marvel, Larson trained for nine straight months to build up her physical strength. When it comes to lifting weights at the gym, Brie Larson is killing it, saying, \"My highest right now is 215 pounds in deadlifts, 400-pound hip thrusts.\" It doesn't sound like anybody will want to mess with Larson or her fictional counterpart.\nAvengers 4 screenwriters have said that Captain Marvel and Ant-Man 2 will have large roles to play in setting up the film to end Phase 3 of the MCU, which makes even more sense now after Kevin Feige's comments. The Quantum Realm from Ant-Man is expected to be a huge factor in Avengers 4, while Carol Danvers' involvement was teased at the end of Infinity War.

After Monday&apos;s 1-0 win over Washington and Max Scherezer, in which Guerra tossed 7 1/3 shutout innings, he is 6-1 with a 2.93 ERA, 1.017 WHIP and 7.9 strikeouts per nine innings. Not too shabby for a guy who had pitched in just four major-league innings prior to the 2016 season (and had allowed three runs on seven hits).\nIn each of his first two starts with Milwaukee, Guerra allowed four runs in six innings. Since then, he has made 10 starts and allowed more than four earned runs just once (5 in 5 1/3 innings against the Dodgers on June 16) and has a 2.37 ERA and .190 opponent batting average during that span.\nAnd did we mention that Guerra is 31 years old?\nTurns out, Guerra is having one of the best rookie seasons by a starting pitcher who is at least 31 years old . . . well, ever.\nYes, it is hard to compare eras with pitchers. There&apos;s the Deadball Era, pre-integration, expansion, the Year of the Pitcher in 1968, steroid era and so on. A 3.50 ERA is not equal throughout the years.\nOne of the best ways to compare, however, is using ERA+, which compares a pitcher&apos;s ERA to the league average while adjusting to the pitcher&apos;s ballpark. An ERA+ of 100 is right at the average for that season while a lower number is worse and the higher the better.\nSince 1901 there have been 54 pitchers who were age 31 or older who made at least 12 starts in a season. Of those 54, only 11 have occurred since 1996 and the majority of those have been pitchers moving over from a Japanese league to the major leagues. Nine made their debut during World War II (1942-45) while 11 began their careers in the Deadball Era (pre-1920).\nAmong this criteria - pitchers who debuted at 31 or older and started 12 or more games - Junior Guerra is currently second all-time in ERA+."}

{"idx": "21688", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Will 2016 Be Altria Group's Best Year Yet?\nEven with its long history, this year could be a turning point for the tobacco giant.\nIn the stock market's history, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) holds a key place. Even among the many long-lived companies whose shares trade publicly, Altria Group stands out for its long track record of rising share prices and ample dividend income. Yet there's one key reason why 2016 could be a breakout year for Altria, and it doesn't have anything to do with tobacco. Let's take a closer look at why 2016 could be Altria Group's best year yet.\nTo be clear, tobacco will remain an essential part of Altria's overall success. Consolidation in the industry has helped Altria cement its leadership role atop the domestic tobacco market, and the company has seen market share for its two main brands climb. In the cigarette arena, Marlboro continues to perform well, and the Copenhagen brand of smokeless tobacco has also dramatically increased its share of that market.\nAlthough building and maintaining brand awareness takes effort and money, Altria's labors to sustain and build on its most valuable brands have generated huge rewards over the years. In light of falling overall cigarette volume in the U.S. over the past several decades, Altria's ability to raise prices for Marlboro and its other cigarette lines has been the way that the company has generating bigger profits. That game plan has worked well for years, and investors can expect Altria to stick with it for 2016 as well.\nYet the real game-changer for Altria in 2016 will come from the beer market. Anheuser-Busch InBev's (NYSE:BUD) anticipated takeover of SABMiller will create a colossus in the industry if it goes through, and both companies are optimistic that they can surpass regulatory hurdles and get a deal closed in the second half of 2016.\nThe result of the deal from Altria's perspective will be transformative. In exchange for its 27% stake in SABMiller, Altria will end up with about a 10.5% stake in the much-larger Anheuser-Busch InBev. Moreover, the tobacco giant expects to end up with $2.5 billion in cash.\nPerhaps most importantly, Altria will have a hand in the future direction that Anheuser-Busch InBev takes. Altria representatives will have two spots on the beer-maker's board of directors. That will help ensure the continued flow of income from Altria's investment in the company. In Altria CEO Marty Barrington's words, \"Altria will continue to participate in the global brewing profit pool as a large and significant shareholder in what will be the industry's largest company.\"\nWill the deal go through?\nSome investors have been nervous that the competitive impact on the beer industry would prompt regulators to block Anheuser-Busch from buying SABMiller. Part of the appeal for Altria is that Anheuser-Busch will become an even bigger global giant in the industry than it is now, so Altria won't want Anheuser-Busch to give up too much to get a deal done.\nNevertheless, Anheuser-Busch's plans include divestitures of SABMiller assets in certain countries in which the two companies now have substantial overlapping market share, including the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Italy.

Chasse Jr.\n: \"live exposure\" to mental health consumers and family members, role-playing scenarios and community collaboration.\n\"During our investigation, we spoke with advocates who desired greater inclusion, but were refused access to the curriculum and were not allowed to attend training sessions,\" the federal officials said.\nAssistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez found the bureau's tight control over the training unwarranted and ineffective. He urged the Portland police to set up what mental health advocates, retired and current Portland police have advocated for years: a select team of officers with unique skills to serve as the \"go-to\" police called out to de-escalate mental health crisis calls.\n\"There is growing evidence that a crisis team response is likely to result in a better outcome and reinforce public confidence in policing,\" Perez wrote to Portland Mayor Sam Adams.\nThe federal investigators also recommended such a team be led by a \"dedicated police-based crisis intervention coordinator.\" That appears to be a direct snub to the civilian mental health expert Leisbeth Gerritsen, who has led the police bureau's crisis intervention training under the past two chiefs.\nPortland police used to have the very type of specialized program that Perez is now seeking.\nFrom 1995 to 2006, the bureau had a crisis intervention team consisting of a select group of officers who volunteered for the work, reported to either an officer or a sergeant and invited mental health consumers to participate in their training. Bureau officials scrapped that and introduced a mandatory 40 hours of crisis intervention training for all officers by 2007.\nThe change came after the controversial 2006 death in police custody of Chasse, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Chasse was chased, then tackled by police after police thought he was urinating on a sidewalk in the Pearl District. He died from blunt force trauma to the chest.\n\"Expanding the training to all the officers was welcomed at the time,\" said Bob Joondeph, executive director of Disability Rights Oregon. \"I don't think anybody was clear about how effective it would be, but it was something.\"\nJustice Department officials argued the bureau can't expect officers to become proficient with a week's worth of training.\n\"The 40-hour crisis intervention training curriculum is not what makes a specialized crisis intervention officer an expert in handling mental illness calls,\" they wrote.\n\"While we commend PPB for training all officers on crisis matters,\" federal officials wrote, \"this approach assumes incorrectly that all PPB officers are equally capable of safely handling crisis situations and fails to build greater capacity among qualified officers.\"\nDuring the federal review, a Portland patrol officer told investigators that his job was \"to put people in jail, not to provide social services,\" the report said.\nClearly, federal officials said, this officer would not be the appropriate one to conduct a welfare check on a person with mental illness.\nThe Justice Department officials blasted the bureau for failing to allow community input on training curriculum, for preventing stakeholders from attending the crisis intervention courses, and for abandoning role-playing by officers during the class.\nBringing people with mental health problems into the crisis intervention classes could help reduce officers' fears of people with mental illness, the federal officials said.\n\"There does not appear to be good reason to deny reasonable access to a crisis intervention course\" to people with mental illness, family members, advocates or mental health workers, the review found. \"One of the most effective ways to address the stigma of mental illness is to increase direct exposure to people with mental illness.\"\n"}

Trump turned down a similar deal in December, forcing the 35-day partial shutdown that left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks and Republicans reeling. There is little appetite in Washington for a repeat.\nLawmakers tentatively agreed Monday night to a deal that would provide nearly $1.4bn for border barriers and keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on 30 September.\nThe agreement would allow 55 miles (88km) of new fencing \u2013 constructed using existing designs such as metal slats \u2013 but far less than the 215 miles (345km) the White House demanded in December. The fencing would be built in Texas\u2019s Rio Grande Valley.\n\u201cI hope he signs the bill,\u201d said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who joined other GOP leaders in selling it as a necessary compromise that represented a major concession from Democrats.\nThe appropriations committee chairman, Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, expressed optimism Trump would be on board.\nThe White House has long been laying the groundwork for Trump to use executive action to bypass Congress and divert money into wall construction. He could declare a national emergency or invoke other executive authority to tap funds including money set aside for military construction, disaster relief and counter-drug efforts.\nPreviewing that strategy last week, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take as much money as you can give us, and then we will go off and find the money someplace else \u2013 legally \u2013 in order to secure that southern barrier.\u201d He said more than $5.7bn in available funds had been identified.\nMcConnell, who had previously said he was troubled by the concept of declaring a national emergency, said on Tuesday that Trump \u201cought to feel free to use whatever tools he can legally use to enhance his effort to secure the border\u201d.\nThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, urged Trump to accept the package to avert another shutdown, calling the tentative accord \u201cwelcome news\u201d.\nBut the proposal was met with fury by some on the right, including Fox News channel\u2019s Sean Hannity, a close friend of the president, who called it a \u201cgarbage compromise\u201d.\nJenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, released a scathing statement saying she and others had been \u201choodwinked\u201d.\nThe hosts of the Trump favorite Fox & Friends, however, urged the president to agree to the deal and keep the government open, a relief to White House officials and congressional Republicans who had been nervously watching the roll call of conservative media voices, trying to predict where Trump would land.\nThe conservative representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and close ally of the president, said that if Trump did agree to the deal, he could be spared a \u201cconservative uproar because everyone expects executive action to follow\u201d.

Bayh, a 1951 Purdue grad who had been stopped by trains in Lafayette during his college days, was sympathetic.\nRiehle understood that the only way Lafayette had a chance to get Lafayette Railroad Relocation done was to get the project listed among 15 cities chosen for what were called \u201cdemonstration projects\u201d that could prove they were moving rails in the name of safety.

CGI events are a production of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\nEarlier this year, CNN and the Clinton Foundation engaged in some back-and-forth over how the charity had described the participation of host Jake Tapper in a June event. Tapper was slated to interview Bill Clinton and to moderate a panel discussion. After negotiations with the foundation people, Tapper did the Clinton interview, but not the panel, which was moderated by his colleague, Poppy Harlow.\nNo matter \u2014 the CGI-CNN relationship appears solid. In snaring the exclusives with Clinton, CNN elbows aside its big-time competitors in the television news business. All the major networks \u2014 CBS News, NBC News, ABC News \u2014 send the Clinton Foundation pitches for interviews or programming partnerships, says Craig Minassian, the Clinton Foundation\u2019s chief communications officer.

For starters, broadcasters who do the CGI circuit run extended advertisements for the foundation, as its logo serves as the set\u2019s wallpaper. On the substantive front, the Clinton Foundation sets the conference topics and robs its media partners of their customary suzerainty over panelists \u2014 a shared task under these deals.

{"idx": "21711", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: What is the supposed evidence that most Americans want cuts in Social Security, one of the most popular and successful domestic programs in the history of the federal government? A Washington Post/ABC poll that shows 81 percent of Americans \"see the country's Social Security system as headed for a crisis, and most think a major overhaul is in order.\" This argument -- that Americans think there's a crisis, so there must be one, and action must be taken -- would be hilariously moronic were it not so lamentably powerful. Pardon me for questioning the wisdom of Americans -- a majority of whom cannot name two members of the Supreme Court or find Iraq on a map -- but the relevant question for policy-makers should not be whether we believe Social Security is headed for a crisis but whether it actually is. Ideologues masquerading as nonpartisan truth tellers have been telling the public for years that Social Security won't be able to meet its obligations, and now that they've convinced Americans, the ideologues have turned around and cited that public belief as evidence that the program must be cut.\nBut Social Security is not in crisis. According to a 2010 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, Social Security spending will increase from less than 5 percent of gross domestic product today to about 6 percent in 2030 \"and then stabilize at roughly that level.\" Even that projection could be brightened by better-than-expected economic or population growth. That's precisely why Reid told MSNBC: \"Two decades from now, I'm willing to take a look at [Social Security reform], but I'm not willing to take a look at it right now.\"\nIf deficit hawks are really worried about those projections, they should look closely at the CBO numbers, which show that health care is a much larger problem than Social Security. \"If current laws do not change,\" the CBO writes, \"federal spending on major mandatory health care programs will grow from roughly 5 percent of GDP today to about 10 percent in 2035 and will continue to increase there-after.\" Ironically, it is the same Republicans fear-mongering about the deficit today who voted to expand those mandatory federal health-care obligations when they passed the Medicare prescription-drug benefit during George W. Bush's tenure. They also voted against the Affordable Care Act, which contained provisions intended to lower the cost of health-care delivery, especially in Medicare. So the supposed fiscal conservatives are 0-for-2 on correcting the potential future imbalances in entitlement programs, and the supposedly profligate Democrats are being lambasted for their unwillingness to agree to throw seniors out on the street.\nPart of what makes using polls as a cudgel to beat politicians so pernicious is that even on matters of opinion, not just on matters of fact about which the public is ignorant, they can create a false impression of the public will. Polls with simple questions have a way of collapsing people with very different ideas into categories so broad as to be meaningless or even misleading. Consider all those polls supposedly showing that a plurality of the public disapproved of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans claimed those numbers as evidence that the public shared their opposition to health-care reform, but a significant portion of those registering disapproval were actually liberals who thought the bill did not go far enough. Likewise, the Post poll shows that only 32 percent of respondents think we should reduce Social Security benefits for future retirees. Bolstering Social Security's solvency could just as easily mean lifting the cap on payroll taxes.\nPund"}

{"idx": "21716", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The most recent wave of public attention towards DeMott\u2019s actions began with former NXT wrestler Austin Matelson, who was a part of the company in 2013 under the ring name Judas Devlin. Speaking on Vendetta Pro Radio about a letter he filed with WWE higher-ups in 2013, Matelson accused DeMott of endangering NXT talent physically and mentally, including one incident where the trainer kicked a Mexican wrestler in the groin while making fun of his accent. DeMott also reportedly enjoyed telling a black wrestler to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d and, in a separate incident brought to light by female wrestler Terra Callaway, he also called a wrestler of Middle Eastern descent a \u201cterrorist\u201d at a wrestling seminar.\nIt appears that the culture of fear and retaliation that haunts NXT can be traced back to its head trainer. After all, he fostered an atmosphere under his rule where, for example, a strength and conditioning coach could photograph female talent\u2019s bodies and post them on his personal Facebook, with no consequences. That\u2019s according to an anonymous female wrestler who posted an account of her time at NXT on Reddit\u2019s Squared Circle wrestling forum, which also included the story of how an unnamed female executive (believed to be Jane Geddes) was transitioned and then fired for speaking up for the young women on the roster.\nThe fact that this is all happening in NXT is especially disappointing; for a variety of reasons, the developmental branch had been seen as the ideal of what WWE could be. Between engaging storylines, a stronger focus on actual wrestling acumen, and, especially, the (relatively) equal treatment of its female wrestlers on-screen, NXT has been lauded by critics and fans alike for revolutionizing how WWE does business.\nThat\u2019s not to say that everyone thought NXT was perfect; any fan of the brand knew that the talent on their WWE Network streams was, at best, slightly underpaid and, at worst, barely scraping by. Just for reference, rookie contracts at NXT can start at $25,000 plus accommodations, barely a livable wage for talent that has to cover most of their own costs as independent contractors. Even with that, wrestlers have flocked to be a part of it, and by extension, the world-famous Performance Center, where wrestlers train and hone their craft, all because of their passion for the industry.\nI lost everything for speaking up. I was the first. The warning to others.\nThat one man has ruined that passion in what is clearly more than just a handful of promising talent that could have contributed positively to the business of professional wrestling is a travesty. It\u2019s fair to say that forcing DeMott out was a breakthrough for anyone who believes that the workplace, no matter the industry, should not be a battlefield. That DeMott was a horrible choice to be in charge of the molding and teaching of young wrestlers should have been evident from his pre-WWE history. Side-stepping his actual wrestling career (the man performed under the name General Hugh G. Rection, after all), DeMott worked as a trainer for a variety of organizations before NXT, including WWE\u2019s own Deep South Wrestling developmental territory.\nThe horror stories of DeMott stiffing talent in the ring (which means hitting them for real, not in the practiced ways consistent with normal pro wrestling) and abusing them outside of it are not new.

Tebow has averaged better than 11 fantasy points per half in his last four extended stints, which is all the more reason to start him.\nTony Romo vs. Rams: Romo might be just 14th in fantasy points at his position, but I still consider him a valuable option in all leagues -- especially when he has a favorable matchup. This week he goes up against the Rams, who have surrendered the sixth-most fantasy points to QBs. That's good news for Romo, who should post a nice stat line.\nBen Roethlisberger at Cardinals: Roethlisberger hasn't been a reliable fantasy quarterback this season, but he's still a viable option when he faces a weak defense. That's the case here, as Arizona has allowed an average of more than 18 fantasy points per game to QBs.\nJosh Freeman vs. Bears (London): Speaking of unreliable fantasy quarterbacks, Freeman has been somewhat of a conundrum. He is coming off a terrific performance against the Saints, though, and this week's matchup against the Bears is a favorable one. Chicago's defense has allowed an average of nearly 19 fantasy points to signal-callers.\nMatt Cassel at Raiders: If you're in a deeper league and need a spot starter, Cassel is worth a look off the waiver wire. The veteran had his best stat line of the year in Week 5, throwing for 257 yards and four touchdowns against the Colts. Now he goes up against the Raiders, who have surrendered the fifth-most fantasy points to QBs.\nSleeper alert -- Colt McCoy vs. Seahawks: McCoy has averaged a respectable 15.3 fantasy points, and a matchup against the Seahawks makes him a legitimate starting option. Seattle has given up an average of close to 17 fantasy points per game to QBs, so don't overlook McCoy in leagues with 12-plus teams.\nMatt Schaub at Titans: It's tough to bench a quarterback like Schaub during the bye weeks, but he's been far less impressive without Andre Johnson.

I would argue that decades of neoliberal capitalism, initiated by Thatcher and exacerbated since the financial crash of 2008 by 10 years of Tory austerity have caused profound social changes to this country. Inequality has risen dramatically, prospects of finding a job with decent wages have shrunk for young people, schools and social services have been underfunded, youth centres and libraries have had to close. All this is much more likely to contribute to the rise in gang violence than the consumption of cannabis. As others have pointed out, if there were a real correlation between cannabis consumption and violence as Mr Hitchens hypothesises, then countries or areas with higher cannabis use would be experiencing higher numbers of violent crime. I have yet to see any evidence of such a correlation.\nWhat about prescribed drugs, like ssri, benzos etc? I don't think there are many studies associating violence with cannabis, but there are several with ssri and violent acts against themselves and others.\nCannabis: Maybe cannabis, opioids and etc., is a symptom of something deeper more sinister going on?

Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.\nThe question, though, is whether that rain will turn into a flood, and this week we saw some pretty big puddles forming. For instance, one way in which the global financial crisis could hit the technology industry is if big customers can't pay their bills to vendors and partners. Microsoft found itself in just that situation this week. Redmond is taking a close interest in the fate of bankrupt Washington Mutual, which, apparently, owes the software titan some dough that Microsoft would love to collect.\nThere aren't a lot of details on this story yet, and as far as we can tell WaMu seems to owe Microsoft the money -- and we don't know how much yet -- directly. We're sure that partners must be involved somehow, though, given that Microsoft makes the overwhelming majority of its revenue -- more than 95 percent -- through the channel. But even if there's no direct partner involvement here (and, as the dispute seems to involve software license fees, there might not be), we're wondering whether channel players are having to slink around customer sites in track suits carrying baseball bats and asking bewildered executives and business owners to pay up -- metaphorically speaking, of course.\nMost of RCP's readers are probably not dealing with the WaMus of the world, but those that are might want to start thinking about how they're going to collect from customers that are going belly-up -- or maybe start adjusting their budgets accordingly. And those that aren't should still be wary. This isn't the kind of trickle-down activity any economist wants to see, but it seems possible that big failures at the top of the corporate food chain could eventually hurt companies that generally work closer to the bottom -- especially given how interconnected the financial industry is with pretty much every facet of the American economy.\nThose economic tornadoes that are tearing through the financial industry might not be headed directly your way, but the wind and rain they carry could still make your front yard -- or your bottom line -- a heck of a mess.\nAre you worried about customers not being able to pay for your services? Are you making contingency plans in this economic crisis? If so, what kind? Let us know at lpender@rcpmag.com."}

It's a steambath outside, and Soul Jam's patrons are dressed accordingly, but he's wearing a neatly pressed white suit, a red silk shirt, buffed white suede shoes, and a gold crown. He looks and smells good, better than anyone else in the club.\nEveryone's happy to see Granville. They hug him, pose with him for photos, slap his back, and generally admire his presence. Granville, who is quiet and not usually showy, doesn't really seem to mind the attention, but he makes his way to a far corner of the room by the end of the bar and waits for people to come to him.\n\"I love the people in this neighborhood,\" he says. \"I been coming here a long time.

More gumpf last week about the precipitous decline of the VIX and how the \"Index of Fear\" has gone down to seven-year, pre-crisis lows.\nMaybe if I say \"Index of Fear\" enough times I can convince myself, and anyone reading this column, that it is a big, scary concept that really is so terrifying we should all run for cover when it ticks up or that we are set for eternal peace when it continues lower.\nTraders work in the Volatility Index Options (VIX) pit on the floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.\nThe truth is that the VIX is not an \"Index of Fear\" and never has been. It's a plain old measure of premium. Premium in option products that are a derivative of the equity market. A market which, apparently is at, or near, all-time highs in many cases.\nAs any option trader will tell you: Pretty much most of the time when markets go up, the volatility goes down and vice versa. The VIX DOES NOT lead the equity market, it follows it.\nI also read it is so low because either everyone is bullish about the stock market or they are being ridiculously complacent about the downside risks. Maybe this is part of the story but there is a bit more to it.\nVolatility indicators, of the which the VIX is just one, are also at such low levels not because everyone who is in the market is so complacent but more likely that they are so desperate. Desperate that is not to spend any money on downside protection because they are struggling to make money out of the multi-year rally in markets.\nThe truth is, as I have written before, so many money managers from hedge funds to pension funds have underperformed the indices they are investing in. Underperformed plain old vanilla longs. So the logic goes that if they then have to start paying out premium for protection this will further hit, what is in many cases, a pathetic performance.\nIn addition, with the ECB looking like it's throwing in the towel and set to pump the markets further, who in their right mind needs downside? Yeah right, good luck with that one.\nOne more reason for low volatility/VIX lies in the structure of the market players themselves now. Our good old friends the \"algo\" traders using high-frequency trading strategies jump on any movement in underlying stocks at the first opportunity.\nThe VIX is ultimately a measure of insurance. But too many potential players are being put off by the fact that, if the underlying equity market goes up, stays the same or even goes down a little, buying it is a lossmaking strategy. What a shame that most long players are still in the dark about how the VIX, volatility and options can boost their current meager returns.\nStill the dark is a place of fear.

Republicans kept control of the state\u2019s entire congressional delegation and picked up seats in the state House and Senate, piling on to their already sizable majorities.\nBut this continuity can hide ways in which this election season was different. From candidate filings in April through the primaries in June and into the general election in November, several long-standing patterns in Oklahoma politics were challenged or reversed.\nFirst, this year saw a big spike in the number of candidates running for office. There were 358 candidates who filed for state House and Senate seats this year, double the number from two years ago and the most since 2004. As a result, the number of uncontested legislative seats plummeted. On the House side, the number of districts in which voters were left without a choice in the general election \u2013 because one candidate ran unopposed or the race was decided in the primary \u2013 fell to 23 this year from 65 in 2014.\nSecondly, this year saw a rebound in voter turnout, reversing a steep decline in recent election cycles. Preliminary results show that 1.45 million votes were cast this year, a 10-percent increase from four years ago. As a sign of voters\u2019 enthusiasm, the number of early voters soared by nearly 30 percent compared to previous highs. And while this week\u2019s heavier turnout is attributable in part to interest in several high-profile and contentious state questions, Oklahoma also saw record turnout in March for the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries.\nFinally, while conservative candidates triumphed, on the seven state questions, voters were unwilling to support a straight ideological ticket. In particular, two measures placed on the ballot by the Legislature that had strong support from conservative organizations \u2013 the \u201cright-to-farm\u201d and repeal of the prohibition of state dollars for religion \u2013 lost decisively. Meanwhile, the voters strongly endorsed bold initiative petition measures to reform our punitive drug laws over the fierce opposition of law enforcement.\nUltimately, this election confirmed that in partisan contests in Oklahoma, party affiliation still trumps everything.

But by the afternoon, the streets near Ground Zero had turned into a highly policed battleground, with multiple groups dueling it out through opposing demonstrations.\nOne of the largest rallies, organized by the New York City Coalition to Stop Islamophobia, was staged near City Hall Park and drew both Muslims and non-Muslims in support of the Cordoba House Islamic center and mosque, often referred to simply as the Ground Zero mosque.\nPastor Terry Jones\u2019s unfulfilled pledge to burn Korans on Sept. 11 and Cordoba House Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf\u2019s first interview on CNN this week fueled the sentiment behind the protest. Several Muslims at the demonstration told The Daily Caller that while they\u2019re not scared by what they perceive as the increasing anti-Islamic rhetoric in America, their families overseas are expressing concern.\nSome speakers expressed stronger outrage over what they see as racism and intolerance among Tea Party supporters and those who oppose the Cordoba House.\nExpanding the term Islamophobia to include all immigrants was a common theme at the rally. Lucy Pagoada from the May 1st Worker and Immigrant Rights Coalition said that Muslims and all immigrants are under attack.\nOn West Broadway, a group similar in size to the anti-Islamophobia rally gathered to protest the Cordoba House project. The \u201cRally of Remembrance\u201d was hosted by the Freedom Defense Initiative and Stop Islamization of America. Featured speakers included Atlas Shrugs blogger Pamela Geller, Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, radio host Mike Gallagher, and two video messages from John Bolton, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and Andrew Breitbart, owner of BigGovernment.com.\nVera Loporcaro, a retiree from New York, was at the remembrance rally and said supporters of Cordoba House should back down and move the planned Islamic center elsewhere, just as Pastor Jones backed down and decided not to burn Korans as he threatened to do earlier in the week.\nRoman Shusterman, 29, said he was upset over pleas made by General David Petraeus, President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates this week to not ignite anger in the Muslim world by burning Korans.\nShusterman, an aethist, said he has to be Islamophobic because he feels threatened by what he believes might happen should Islam continue to grow and become the dominant faith in America.\n\u201cIf our government says to this pastor, who I happen to disagree with on his religion, that he can\u2019t have his freedom of speech because it angers Muslims \u2014 and if Islam becomes the predominant religion in America one day \u2014 then people like me will be executed,\u201d he said.\nOther demonstrations were being held down the street.

They tell me he's the poorest person they've ever met. Given the hardscrabble place where they've lived most of their lives, that comes down to pretty poor.\nAnd in his case terribly damaged. The victim of an abusive childhood, mental illness and a social safety net with more than one hole, he has several disabling health conditions, a prison record and the ravaged face of a man twice his age. But once a month he has 50 extra dollars to spend as he likes -- or so my friends thought.\nShortly before Christmas they learned that their $50 gift was actually a $43 gift, the reason being that the bank charges their beneficiary $7 to cash his check. My friends were incredulous, but a call to the bank confirmed that they had not been misinformed. The bank was taking a 14% cut.\nIt so happens my friends have a savings account in another branch of the same big bank. It earns them an annual percentage yield of .05% -- nothing compared with what it costs their destitute friend to access such luxuries as cigarettes, fish hooks and an extra load of wash.\nOnce they got past their surprise -- \"For years we've been subsidizing a bank!\" -- the couple had several questions. Why had their friend never told them this was happening? And why had it never occurred to them that this might happen?\nLike the questions, the answers are closely related. It never occurred to them that this might happen because, as solvent members of the middle class, the extortionate service charge was altogether outside their experience. Just as it was altogether outside their friend's comprehension that his penalty could count as news.\nIn fact, penalties and fines have been his life's reality for as long as he can remember. His adult son expects gas money to drive him to a pharmacy less than a mile from their shared apartment.

By 2050 the number of people aged 60 and over are projected to grow from 4.5 million to 13 million \u2013 20 per cent of the population.\n\u201cBoth the Government and civil society must prepare to meet the challenges and opportunities of a gradually ageing population. Policies and programmes need to take into account the increase of older people and their needs\u201d, says Janet Jackson, UNFPA Representative for Myanmar.\nHowever, Myanmar does have some significant advantages, according to a statement. Compared to many other countries in the region, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, its population is ageing at a relatively slow rate. In 2050, Myanmar\u2019s age structure will be similar to that of Singapore\u2019s today. The gradual change gives the country time to adjust as its older population grows.\nThe findings come from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Thematic Report on the Older Population, published by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population and UNFPA. The report shows that 22 per cent of people aged 65 and above still work. The majority of these work in agriculture, which is a physically demanding sector.\n\u201cThe data suggest that economic realities oblige many people to continue heavy manual labour into old age to survive. This underlines the need for adequate social services, protection mechanisms and policies that serve older people,\u201d says Janet Jackson, UNFPA Representative for Myanmar.\nMost people over 60 were born between 1925 and 1950. Their access to education was influenced by the times through which they lived. This is why illiteracy levels are high among older people (20.9 per cent). The number is much higher for women, and it varies across the country. In Shan and Chin, for example, only one in three women over 60 can read and write.\nAccording to the report, more older women (45.7 per cent) than older men (17.4 per cent) are widowed. This is because life expectancy is lower for men (60.2 years) than for women (69.3 years), and because women tend to marry younger. This could put older women at higher risk of isolation and deprivation, as they live out old age without their life partner. However, this is counterbalanced by the firm practice of older people living with their adult children. The marital status of an older person has very little effect on whether or not they live alone.\n\u201cWhile most people are able to grow old surrounded by an extended family, there are still many people who face old age alone. Myanmar needs to develop safety nets for old people, such as a universal pension scheme,\u201d says Janet Jackson, UNFPA Representative for Myanmar."}

I found my first Ash-throated Flycatcher. I went out this afternoon to explore the far western reaches of Taylor County thinking I could find several spring and summer birds by now. Most didn\u2019t pan out, and the wind picked up, as it so often does in March.\nNot that I\u2019m not complaining, but it\u2019s felt a little slow this week. Not quite winter, not quite summer. Almost spring\u2026 So, let\u2019s talk about that new bird I found, Ash-throated Flycatcher.\nAsh-throated Flycatchers have lemon bellies and pale gray throats. The back and crown are brown. The wings have a bright rufous patch. The crest is often raised, especially when the birds are excited or when they are responding to another Ash-throated Flycatcher.\nOne of the most distinct things about Ash-throated Flycatchers is their calls. Two calls are given most commonly, often described as ka-brick and ka-breeer. These sounds are ubiquitous in Taylor County from about April through early September.\nIn our area, the birds like mesquite grasslands, but this species is really a bird of the American Southwest and live in a wide variety of deserts and arid woodlands. From deserts at low elevations to juniper woodlands up to 9,000 feet, this species is pretty adaptable.\nAnd technically I lied. While it\u2019s true the birds don\u2019t normally occur in the Eastern U.S., each year very small numbers of them turn up when they seemingly get lost on their migration to Mexico and Northern Central America for the winter.\nOne of the requirements of Ash-throated Flycatchers is holes to nest in. They are secondary cavity nesters, meaning they do not make their own holes but instead rely on those from woodpeckers. They are also resourceful and can use metal fence posts, mail boxes, exhaust pipes of abandoned cars, and more that humans unknowingly provide them.\nI think one of my favorite things about Ash-throated Flycatchers is that they are a bird that always reminds me of home. I associate their sound and their angry raised crests with birding in West Texas. Listen for them the next time your out in mesquite woodlands or even a city park. It won\u2019t take you long to find one."}

What these communities have experienced since 1980, when Israel established the Elon Moreh nearby, is but one illustration of broader developments taking place throughout the West Bank. Their story is similar to that of hundreds of Palestinian communities on whose lands Israeli settlements were established.\nLike many Palestinian villages, \u2018Azmut, Deir al-Hatab and Salem developed in keeping with the geographical features of the area. Farmland, pasture and natural water sources serves as the mainstays of the local economy and as the basis for the formation of an entire culture that ties the residents deeply to their surroundings. The villagers employed mostly traditional dryland farming, cultivating olives and fruit trees, legumes and grains. They also raised livestock, relying on natural pasture stretching across the hilly expanses of al-Jabal al-Kbir (literally: The Big Mountain) and the surrounding valleys. For hundreds of years, the villagers largely subsisted off farming and shepherding.\nSince the 1967 occupation, Israel has employed various measures \u2013 official and otherwise \u2013 to cut off the villagers from their land and hand it over to settlers. The first step was the 1980 establishment of the Elon Moreh settlement on 127.8 hectares (1,278 dunams) of village land already registered as government property under the pre-1967 Jordanian rule. Just two years later, the Commander of the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) declared a nature reserve on some of the remaining land west of the settlement. This resulted in the creation of an area, far exceeding that of the settlement\u2019s jurisdiction, where Palestinians must receive Israeli permission for carrying out any development, construction, new cultivation, or pasturing livestock. In 1987, 170 hectares of the nature reserve were declared \u201cstate land\u201d, and an illegal settlement outpost erected there in 1998.\nThe next phase in the process of dispossession took place in late September 1995, after Israel and the Palestinians signed the Oslo II Accord. The lands of \u2018Azmut, Deir al-Hatab and Salem were divided into Areas B and C: most of the land already built-up at the time was designated Area B, while most of the villages\u2019 land reserves, farmland and pastureland were labelled Area C, remaining under full Israeli control. Ever since, use of the lands designated as Area C for practically any purpose \u2013 especially for building and development \u2013 is subject to Israeli approval, which is almost always denied to villagers. In so doing, Israel laid the administrative groundwork for separating the built-up areas of the villages from most of their farmland and pastures.\nIn 1996, Israel built a road connecting the settlements of Elon Moreh and Itamar, so that Israelis no longer had to drive through the built-up area of Salem. In this way, following up on the administrative groundwork laid out a year earlier, Israel laid out the concrete infrastructure to physically separate the built-up areas of the three villages from their farmland and pasture. In 2000, four years after the road was paved, the second intifada broke out. Ever since, Israel has forbidden Palestinians to use the road or even cross it.

As one of those interviewed, I described how watching my three dogs interact was soothing to me.\nNot only did my dogs help me relax, but also their unique way of interacting, sharing the spotlight and taking or following the lead, taught me much about how to successfully interact with people in my own life. At the time, I was running special programs for Montefiore Medical Center and private practices in Irvington and Chappaqua, New York. I instinctively knew the dogs\u2019 teachings were of significant help to me even though the health benefits of having pets were not common knowledge or fodder for research back then.\nFifteen years later, science has caught up with what so many of us instinctively knew: Pets help improve our health.\nToday, as I get ready to write my fifth book, still see patients in two offices four days a week, write articles, participate in media events, and even train physicians, the one thing that has kept me grounded and given me the proper perspective on my hectic life is always my dogs.\nWhile the wonderful dogs I had in 1996 are no longer here, a new generation of brilliant, loyal, loving, and funny dachshunds keeps me in line and teaches me how to be a better person. My health, which thankfully, is great because I follow my own advice and take supplements and bioidentical hormones, eat a balanced diet, exercise, and get eight hours of sleep, is even better due to the never-ending kisses and wonderful greetings I get at the end of every day from my dog family.\nNow research shows that unless you\u2019re someone who really dislikes animals or is too busy to care for pets, you will relieve stress and enjoy numerous other health benefits by having a furry friend.\nImprove mood. It\u2019s virtually impossible to stay in a bad mood when a pair of loving puppy eyes meets yours, or when a super-soft cat rubs up against your hand. A recent study found that men with AIDS were less likely to suffer from depression if they owned a pet.\nLower blood pressure. The most commonly used drugs to treat hypertension aren\u2019t as effective at reducing blood pressure as having pets around is. A fun study looked at groups of hypertensive New York stockbrokers given dogs or cats and found those with the pets had lower blood pressure and heart rates than those who didn\u2019t get pets. I bet many of those who didn\u2019t have a pet ran out and got one after learning the results of the study. They certainly would have been well-advised to.\nGet more exercise. Dog owners spend more time walking than non-pet owners, especially in urban settings. Owning a dog can be credited with increasing all the health benefits associated with increased physical activity. People who own pets know you cannot be too sedentary with them around.\nConnect socially. When we\u2019re out walking, having a dog (or a cat) with us makes us more approachable and provides a reason to stop and talk to other people. This increases the opportunity to stave off social isolation, which is a big stressor for many.\nHaving a pet isn\u2019t for everyone. For some, a pet can cause stress. However, for most of us, the benefits of having a pet outweigh any drawbacks. Having a furry best friend can reduce stress in your life and bring you support when times get tough.

But the young men with higher incomes wouldn\u2019t get subsidies, and the warning of a premium price shock for them might become a key exhibit in opponents\u2019 argument that Obamacare won\u2019t save Americans money over the long haul but would rather cost them.\nThe forecasts in the study are higher than most so far by allies and foes of the Affordable Care Act. But it is likely that some in the group will face increases. That\u2019s because the same new insurance market rules that will make coverage more affordable for older and sicker people will make insurance for young and healthier people more expensive.\nMost other studies have tried to estimate average premium increases, which have ranged anywhere from negligible to 85 percent and higher. This survey looks at individual examples in specific markets to show the itemized impact of the major Obamacare reforms.\nThe insurers estimated that a healthy 27-year-old man in Austin, Texas, who pays $54 a month for insurance this year would have a $153 premium if Obamacare\u2019s market regulations were in effect.\nThe pressure would be the opposite but more modest for top-tier plans covering an older, unhealthy woman in Austin. Her premium would drop by 40 percent, they estimated.\nBut the sharp increase for some is going to make it \u201chard to declare victory,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a persistent critic of the health law.\nThe survey asked insurers how the market reforms would affect policies for specific individuals and small groups in Chicago, Phoenix, Atlanta, Austin, Milwaukee and Albany.\nFour or more insurers answered the questions in all of the cities except Albany. It\u2019s not a scientifically representative sample, but it reflects calculations of companies that provide coverage to most Americans, Holtz-Eakin said.\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act counter: Look at the bigger picture.\nThe survey looks only at the estimated increase in cost to insurers, not consumers. It does not factor in the subsides that will offset the lion\u2019s share of the premium cost for those who make less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $23,400 in 2011."}

He says he found himself drawn to the female characters and their story arcs.\n\"I felt that they were allowed to have more developed personalities than a lot of the men in comics,\" Madrid says. \"A lot of the men had to be brave and fearless, and that was the extent of it, but women could have that and show more emotion.\"\nSince then, the San Francisco author has become a connoisseur of comic books and pop culture, especially when it's related to heroines. His first book was 2009's \"The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy and the History of Comic Book Heroines.\" In the course of researching \"Supergirls,\" Madrid discovered lesser-known heroines like Black Venus and Mysta of the Moon. That led to his latest book \"Divas, Dames & Daredevils: Lost Heroines of Golden Age Comics.\"\nAs a kid, Madrid says, his reference to powerful female characters produced in the 1970s was a part of the Women's Liberation movement.\n\"A lot of comics were trying to interject this whole feminism idea into comics,\" he says. \"It wasn't until much later when I learned more about comics that I learned the original heroines from the very early comics from the 1940s had started out very powerful, even more powerful than a lot of the ones I was reading.\"\n\"Divas, Dames & Daredevils\" looks at heroines that were powerful and adventurous in comics produced between 1938 and 1954 - which coincided with World War II.\n\"There was this whole attitude during World War II of everyone pitching in and having a hand in fighting the Axis and that includes women and even children,\" Madrid says. \"For women, a lot of them were stepping out of their traditional roles and in some cases filling the roles of men who have gone off to war, so there was this whole time period where women in the real world were able to do different things and be more independent.\"\nThat was before the Comic Code Authority was formed in 1954. \"A lot of what came out of the CCA was that women should be portrayed in what they considered to be more traditional roles, as wife, homemaker, mother and not really taking on heroic, adventure roles,\" Madrid says.\nMadrid introduces the reader to super heroines like Lady Satan, Amazona and the Blonde Bomber. He takes readers through their history and prefaces chapters with a summary of each heroine before showing us some of their original stories.\nIn choosing the heroines who made it into the book, he searched out characters who were very different than what we usually see in contemporary comics.\n\"The characters are really a snapshot of what the comic book industry was like when it first started at its inception,\" Madrid says.

{"idx": "21786", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When Jacob Schick patented the world's first electric razor he couldn't have imagined just how sophisticated today's electric shavers and beard trimmers would go on to become.\nThe best electric shavers fall into two categories: foil and rotary. A foil shaver has its blade covered by a thin curved piece of metal foil that glides over your face. A rotary shaver on the other hand is made up of three or four round heads that move in a circular motion around the contours of your face.\nFoil shavers are less powerful and harsh on the skin, ideal for those with sensitive skin who are prone to shaving rash. Rotary shavers are the right option for men with thick, coarse hair on their face, who need a little bit more strength in the trimming department.\nWith new technologies arriving every year, the male grooming market has become awash with innovation and with so many splendid shavers out there it can be hard to tell the wood for the trees, so we've clustered together the best electric shavers for men. From Philips to Braun, all the best beard trimmers on the market are here.\nThe latest addition to the Panasonic grooming range is the excellent ES-LV95. Everything about it screams performance - from the great big charging and cleaning dock to the shaver itself. It's a real behemoth.\nIt's a bit intimidating at first, particularly to the uninitiated. But, more importantly, it's really good, with very quick and accurate shaving, and several options. You can opt for a wet shave (and it's 100pc waterproof), or a dry one. The five blades give you a very tight shave, and the trimming function is just right for those who want to maintain some stubble.\nIt charges quickly and gives plenty of shaving time, and comes with a handy leather travel bag. A top addition to the Panasonic range, and to your bathroom.\nPhilips are considered by some to be the godfathers of the rotary shaver. Philishave became a byword for rotary shave in much the same way Hoover did for vacuum, or Sellotape for sticky tape, before the name was phased out by the company in 2006.\nDan Gregory of Man Made London recommends this reliable foil shaver. \"Foil shavers generally don't cause any skin rash or irritation\", he says.\nHe points to the multi-flex 3D head as a key feature because it allows the shaver to work around the contours of the face, chin and neck. Gregory is also a fan of the lock feature, which can help define clear lines.\nIdeal for those with a keen eye for design and an obsession for detail, the Philips Beard Trimmer 9000 is one of the most advanced ways to keep your stubble in order. Trimming with a laser guide, the Philips helps you achieve perfectly straight lines - even when attempting more complex styles.\nFeaturing 17 LED displayed lengths from 0.4mm to 7mm, the Philips offers good versatility, and its steel blades are also 100pc waterproof - perfect for quick cleaning. What's more, a dual-sided trimmer also makes it easier to shave those hard-to-reach areas.\nShave in the shower or in front of the mirror with this handy Remington foil shaver made to catch even the most stubborn of stray hairs.\nWith blades designed to lift pesky h"}

Following a wave of worker protests in the early 2000s, China faces a new round of cuts in coal mines, steel mills and other state firms, throwing millions of workers on the scrapheap.\nSuch veterans&apos; protests go back decades and are now facilitated by adept use of social media. The government censors information about them and veterans are highly reluctant to discuss their plight with foreign media for fear of being accused of disloyalty.\nThus far, however, their actions have borne little fruit. According to most accounts, the central government&apos;s response has been to fob them off on local authorities, who then fail to act on their complaints.\nThe authorities work to ensure some veterans are satisfied, thus keeping them from forming a united front, said Neil Diamant, a professor of Asian law and society at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, who studies the veterans&apos; issues.\nThey also arrest emerging veterans&apos; leaders, infiltrate the groups and monitor their communications, detaining large numbers if necessary, he said.\n\"So far, this has allowed them to muddle though.

It has been a long time since a G-7 or G-8 summit meeting achieved anything substantial.\nG-8 defenders will point to expressions of hope about climate change goals and additional aid for \u201cfood security,\u201d due Thursday and Friday. But honestly, these statements either could have been made at the deputy minister level or by the executive board of the World Bank.\nIt is tempting to roll your eyes and try to ignore the substantial cost incurred by all attending governments. Think jet fuel, security, distraction from serious problems. And add the budget hit to traditional news media \u2014 these companies are hard-pressed financially, but 3,000 journalists still apparently had to attend at great expense.\nBut it would be a mistake to ignore this meeting. The continuing failure of the group to play any kind of meaningful leadership role matters \u2014 it creates a vacuum at the center of the global economy. And this vacuum is filled increasingly by banks that regard themselves as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and, in the near future, will therefore act irresponsibly.\nFocus on this issue by thinking about the \u201cresolution authority\u201d that the United States executive branch is seeking from Congress. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated as plainly as possible in recent testimony before the Joint Economic Committee that the United States government needs a stronger legal basis for potentially taking over and winding down big financial companies.\nNo one disagrees with this \u2014 except perhaps some big financial companies, which would rather leave the door open to future bailouts.\nBut where are we on any kind of international agreement that would be the essential complement to a national legal authority (e.g., in the United States or Europe), by providing a framework for \u201cresolving\u201d the failure of a major financial institution with crossborder assets and liabilities? That is, which country winds down what and on which basis?\nIf you look closely, there is nothing approaching an agreement or even meaningful discussion within the G-8 on this issue.\nTo be clear, such an agreement should also include emerging markets and a wide range of countries. And you could argue that this should be taken up by the G-20, rather than the G-8 \u2014 which further points to the pointlessness of the G-7/G-8.\nThe bottom line is that despite all the financial agony and policy maker hand-wringing since the failure of Lehman Brothers in the fall, we are no more able to shut down large multinational banks now than we were then.\nWhen people proposed to manage the America\u2019s financial turmoil by applying Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-type procedures to large banks, we were told that the American government lacked the legal authority to do this.\nPerhaps this view had some validity, and hopefully Congress will grant all imaginable authorities in this regard. But the G-7 should be dealing with its part of the crossborder issues as a matter of urgent priority.\nIn 2007-08, the G-8 and member governments were asleep at the wheel. Now they are wide awake, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, and doing nothing to reduce the odds of another global financial crisis.\nMr. Sloan, Do you offer any solutions or simply criticisms?

That is too many. Jusuf Nurkic scored 17 of those points. That\u2019s also too many.\nIn particular, the Damian Lillard and Nurkic pick and roll was just killing the Jazz. That makes some sense: Lillard and Nurkic is a uniquely good pick and roll combination. But we\u2019ve just rarely seen the Jazz get beaten so repeatedly on one play \u2014 usually, they successfully make an adjustment.\nHere\u2019s the first assist from Lillard to Nurkic in the third quarter. You can see what the Jazz want to do: they want to have Rudy Gobert up on Lillard to prevent the shot, then have the weak side rotate over and help so that Nurkic can\u2019t get to the rim. Unfortunately, this time, Donovan Mitchell is too late.\nThe idea is that you want to have the help there early enough that they don\u2019t have a straight shot to the basket, and that\u2019s what Kyle Korver does on the second such play: he\u2019s outside of the restricted area when Nurkic catches the ball. But Nurkic just truck sticks him, and gets the basket. Also, Gobert is too slow to recover back to the paint here to help Korver out. If Korver flops here, he probably gets the offensive foul, but no such luck.\nAssist number three is here. Again, Korver makes it in time, but swipes down on the play and fouls Nurkic for the and-one. He\u2019s just not making a lot of impact on Nurkic\u2019s roll.\nAnd here\u2019s the fourth. This one\u2019s different: the Jazz have decided to drop their big to prevent this roll, but Nurkic beats Derrick Favors to the spot anyway and gets the easy layup.\nAgain, this is an extremely difficult play to stop. But the Jazz still could have done better. First, they could have kept Lillard locked over on the side, preventing him from using the screen at all. When they needed to be sure to bring the rotation quickly, and when they did, they needed Gobert to recover to the paint so they could get some help down there. When that rotation did arrive, it needed to be tougher, either standing ground or clearly drawing an offensive foul. And finally, after changing the defense to stop the roll, then Favors actually needed to stop the roll.\nObviously, this isn\u2019t everything the Jazz did poorly defensively. But it was indicative of their overall sloppiness defensively, which contributed to the loss.\nThat being said, overall, it\u2019s not as if the Jazz had a horrible defensive game. The defensive rating was 108, below average if only just. But the offense let them down by shooting only 21 percent from 3, making just seven of their 33 3-point attempts. Meanwhile, the Blazers hit eight on 18 attempts. If the percentages were equal, say, at 33 percent, the Jazz would have won by 14 points.\nThe Jazz outrebounded the Blazers 47-45, including a 13-8 advantage in offensive boards. The Jazz did turn the ball over more, 15 times to 12 times, but allowed just four fast break points while the Blazers had 9. The Blazers made threes, the Jazz didn\u2019t,"}

People believed him. Uncle Walter wouldn\u2019t lie, America believed.\nThus, when he gave his opinions, they had impact. One example was his report on the Tet offensive in Vietnam, which is credited with swinging the tide of opinion against the war.\nEven in his death, however, nobody has addressed how and why an otherwise obscure figure at the time was elevated to become the most prominent anchorman on television.\nClark was not only the editor of the Nation, he was also heir to the Clark thread fortune, a Harvard classmate and friend of John F. Kennedy, a buddy of Washington Post Editor Ben Bradlee and the manager of Eugene McCarthy\u2019s 1968 campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\nHe veered back and forth between politics and journalism seamlessly as an associate publisher of the New York Post, a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, vice president and general manager of CBS News and yet remained a fixture in Democratic Party politics throughout his career.\nClark wasn\u2019t the kind of man who would promote Walter Cronkite for the most visible job in journalism because of his press accomplishments alone \u2013 and his press accomplishments were noticeably meager.\nCronkite never graduated from college. He had entered the University of Texas at Austin, but left to take a part-time job reporting for the Houston Post. In 1939, he got a job at United Press and covered World War II.\nWhile working for UP, Cronkite was offered a job at CBS by Edward R. Murrow \u2013 and turned it down. He finally accepted a second offer in 1950, and stepped into the new medium of television.\nHe became the host of \u201cYou Are There\u201d in which key moments of history were recreated by actors. Cronkite was depicted on camera interviewing \u201cJoan of Arc\u201d or \u201cSigmund Freud.\u201d But somehow, he managed to make it believable.\nFrom that entertainment series, he went on to be named host of \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on CBS, where he was paired with a partner: a puppet named Charlemagne. In 1961, CBS named him the anchor of the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d \u2013 a 15-minute news summary anchored for several years by Douglas Edwards, thanks to prodding from a socialist activist who edited The Nation.\nJust a few years later, his commentaries on the Vietnam War were credited with turning the tide of American opinion against that conflict.\nAfter leaving his position with CBS, Cronkite\u2019s political activism and offbeat ideas had no restraints.\nIn 1989, Cronkite spoke to a dinner organized by People for the American Way, a group founded by Norman Lear.

The ruling comes after psychologists for the defense and prosecution recommended Hartman undergo mental health treatment.\nHartman has been nabbed in and near airports dozens of times and made it onto planes half a dozen times. She recently made it into the air on a flight from Chicago to London and was subsequently charged with felony criminal trespass and felony burglary.\nPortions of Hartman's mental evaluations read aloud in court Thursday included a long list of her mental health problems. Psychologist Christopher Cooper described Hartman as an \"intelligent woman\" and said she understands the charges against her. But, he said, Hartman suffers from major depression, delusions she is being persecuted and a \"preoccupation with media attention.\"\nHartman's mental stability was \"intermittent and appears to fluctuate day to day,\" Cooper said.\nProsecutors said Hartman tried to walk out of an interview room when she was left unattended during an evaluation and was seen trying to open locked doors at a jail health facility.\nHartman's public defender, Parle Roe-Taylor, has argued that Hartman doesn't belong in jail because she isn't violent and hasn't demonstrated she's a harm to herself.\nHartman will be evaluated every 30 days to see if she is deemed fit for trial.

And, when and by whom was it done?\nIn the apse the mosaic illustrates the Transfiguration as described in the New Testament, with Christ in a mandorla revealed to the prophets Elijah and Moses and to three apostles, John, James and Peter. At the top of the wall above the apse are two scenes from the Old Testament which occurred at Mount Sinai itself: Moses loosening his sandals before the Burning Bush and Moses receiving the tablets of the Law from the hand of God.\nWhat message was this mosaic meant to convey to the sixth-century pilgrim? Why was there portrayed in the church at Mount Sinai the Transfiguration which took place on another mountain, that of Tabor in Galilee, in addition to the two Moses scenes that took place at Sinai itself? These two latter scenes are placed very high up on the walls [see detail here; image courtesy Roberto Nardi, CCA] and do not immediately attract the worshipper\u2019s gaze, which is directed towards the apse. They are distant both spatially and temporally, the double meaning of the Greek word an\u00f4then, both \u2018from above\u2019 and \u2018from the past\u2019.\nClicking an image will open an enlargement.\nTO UNDERSTAND THE message of the Sinai mosaic we can do no better than read a sermon attributed to Anastasius Sinaites, said to have been a monk at the Sinai monastery in the seventh century. The sermon, whatever its exact date and authorship, was according to its text definitely delivered, not at Sinai but on Mount Tabor and explains at length the complementarity of the events at the two mountains. The Transfiguration in the New Testament was the fulfilment of Moses\u2019 incomplete vision in the Old. On Sinai Moses did not see God face to face; on Tabor he, Elijah and the three chosen apostles were able to see Christ in His divine glory. On Sinai there was a dark cloud, on Tabor a luminous one. On Horeb (Sinai) Moses said (in the King James version), \u2018I will now turn aside and see this great sight\u2019, which in the Greek of the Septuagint reads, \u2018Parelthon opsomai to horama to mega touto\u2019. Parelthon means literally \u2018having gone by\u2019. What did he mean by that? He meant \u2018after I have traversed my earthly life, after the period of the Law has gone by\u2019. Only then will the great sight of the New Dispensation be revealed on Mount Tabor, and Moses will be there to see it. Furthermore, the Transfiguration was only made known after the Resurrection, for Christ said (Matthew 17.9), \u2018Tell the vision (to horama) to no man, until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead\u2019.\nThe Sinai mosaic may be read to reveal further layers of meaning. Moses, for example, is shown growing older in age in each of the three scenes in which he appears. He is in his prime before the Burning Bush, grizzled when he receives the tablets of the Law and very old in the Transfiguration. True to Anastasius\u2019s formulation, he"}

And although English translations are slowly creeping into menus alongside the German and Polish entries, this remains one of the last corners of Europe where a British traveller is an exotic rarity.\nSummers in mountainous Spis are lazy and relaxed, and the fields and forests fill with hikers and mushroom pickers.

EFI-X(TM) is the only BPU (Boot Processing Unit) that provides a full EFI (Extended Firmware Interface) environment to a generic PC that still runs the limiting and antiquated BIOS firmware.\nWith EFI-X(TM), almost anybody with a regular PC (providing its hardware is part of EFI-X(TM)'s Hardware Compatibility List) will be able to run almost any EFI-based operating system (e.i., Mac OS X v10.5, Linux, Microsoft Windows Vista, Solaris, etc.) in native mode without the need for any virtualization software. Before the introduction of the EFI-X(TM) module, it was very cumbersome to install EFI-based operating systems on a typical BIOS-based PC; now, with EFI-X(TM), it's a matter of introducing the original factory DVD with the operating system, waiting a few minutes, and the user will be able to enjoy the operating systems of his choice.\nThe EFI-X(TM) is designed to allow easily installation of almost any operating system. From legacy BIOS operating systems like Windows XP to EFI-based setups like Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard and Linux, the EFI-X(TM) module handles them all. The process is seamless and non-intrusive. This means there's no emulation layer of any kind, and the host operating system interacts with the PC's hardware directly. With the EFI-X(TM) module, users don't have to patch their original operating systems nor do they have to worry about crippling their setup due to a system update from the operating system manufacturer.\nThe EFI-X(TM) module has been developed for more than two years in Europe. Its software code is proprietary of Art Studio Entertainment Media and was developed internally by the company. Today, the EFI-X(TM) module is made in Holland with the highest quality standards. When asked how the EFI-X(TM) idea was born, Davide Rutigliano, CEO of Art Studio Entertainment Media said...\"we wanted to fill a niche that nobody ever explored. The boot time of our PCs... Everyone focuses on what we do \"after\" the OS is loaded, but very few imagine how many things you can do at boot to enhance and ease our work on any OS.\" Rutigliano responded when asked about the target audience for the product...\"We address our products to an audience of overclockers, computer experts, people that love fiddling with their hand-picked hardware, and people that realize that the more expert you are about IT, the better your work, whatever it is, will be.\"\nSince its conception, the EFI-X(TM) module has been designed to go in the same direction as the other computer manufacturers in the market, and never against them. EFI-X(TM) has nothing to do with the \"hackintosh\" community and complies with the guidelines of the computer industry. Art Studio Entertainment Media is an independent company with no links to Apple Inc., Microsoft, or any other computer or software manufacturer."}

His eighth book, American Vandal: Mark Twain Abroad, will be published in March by Harvard University Press. The book may be preordered at Amazon.com or from Harvard University Press at customer.care@triliteral.org.\nAs his fame as an author and humorist grew, Mark Twain increasingly gained access to the most glittering palaces and persons in the world. It was a long step up from the muddy streets and ramshackle riverfront docks of his boyhood home in Hannibal, Missouri, but Twain viewed his ascent as little more than his natural due. He was, as he was fond of saying, \u201cnot an American, but the American,\u201d and during his many trips abroad he functioned as a one-man diplomatic corps, employing his characteristic blend of self-deprecation and understated wit on foreign people everywhere. \u201cMark Twain, known by everyone, liked by all\u201d was more than an advertising slogan on a wooden cigar box. It was a simple statement of fact, as everyone from the king of England to the lowliest railroad porter in Calcutta could attest.\nTwain\u2019s growing reputation as a humorist won him a post with the San Francisco Alta California as a roving travel correspondent, and the newspaper agreed to finance his voyage to Europe and the Holy Land aboard the steamship Quaker City, which was making the first prepackaged luxury cruise in American history. On June 8, 1867, Twain and 80 fellow passengers, most of them fundamentalist Christians from Ohio and other Midwestern states, sailed east from New York City on a five-month voyage. In the course of their journey, Twain and the other voyagers pitched anchor at the Black Sea port of Odessa, near Czar Alexander II\u2019s summer palace at Yalta. The czar, who recently had sold Alaska to the United States for a bargain-basement price of seven million dollars, invited the Americans to call on him.\nIn the wake of the Quaker City cruise and the best-selling book he wrote about it, The Innocents Abroad, Twain found himself increasingly sought after as a humorist and travel expert. He toured extensively, lecturing throughout the East and Midwest on \u201cThe American Vandal Abroad\u201d and identifying himself as a proud member of \u201cthe roving, independent, free-and-easy character of traveling Americans.\u201d California Sen. John Conness was actively exploring a diplomatic post for Twain as U.S. minister to China, the author told his mother in early 1868. \u201cThey want to send me abroad, as a consul or a minister,\u201d Twain wrote. \u201cGod knows I am mean enough and lazy enough now without being a proper consul.\u201d Convinced that he could make more money as a writer and lecturer than a low-salaried diplomat, Twain turned down the post, which went instead to fellow travel writer J. Ross Browne.\nTwain traveled back and forth to Europe several times during the next two decades, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by his family and friends. He found a particularly warm welcome in England, where he was taken up by the leading social, political and literary men of the day.

If the claims are true, this development will have far-reaching consequences for privacy and security in modern society.\nMike Burton, Professor of Psychology at Glasgow, and lecturer Rob Jenkins say they achieved their hugely-improved results by eliminating the variable effects of age, hairstyle, expression, lighting, different camera equipment etc. This was done by producing a composite \"average face\" for a person, synthesised from twenty different pictures across a range of ages, lighting and so on.\nAn \"average face\" produced from a typical rogues' gallery.\nWe modelled human familiarity by using image averaging to derive stable face representations from naturally varying photographs. This simple procedure increased the accuracy of an industry standard face-recognition algorithm from 54 per cent to 100 per cent, bringing the robust performance of a familiar human to an automated system.\nThe Glaswegian psychologists may be hot stuff at face recognition, but plainly aren't engineering types - an engineer who said he'd produced a system with 100 per cent reliability would be laughed out of the room. In this case the duo mean that their system got it right every time in their tests, not that they have actually increased its accuracy to 100 per cent.\nHowever, if they have genuinely achieved something above - say - three or four nines, that could be very significant. The British security hierarchy has recently called for the nation's wide but unconnected CCTV coverage to be upgraded, expanded and - most significantly - centrally accessible. Combined with reliable automatic face recognition, such a system would allow the location and tracking of individuals en masse. Provided they weren't wearing their hoodies up, of course, as one might expect in many cases.\nIn the end, the claim of 100 per cent accuracy is obviously an exaggeration - and that tends to diminish the credibility of the research. Still, the averaging technique could well give automated face-spotting software a boost nonetheless.

The purpose and effect was always to protect the environment,\u201d he told a panel of five judges.\nThe case asks the court to rule on the constitutional validity of the proposed amendments, which would require companies transporting hazardous substances through B.C. to obtain provincial permits.\nThe proposed permitting regime would order companies to provide disaster response plans and agree to compensate the province, municipalities and First Nations for any damages. If companies fail to comply with requirements, the province could suspend or cancel the permit.\nA five-day hearing began Monday and the Canadian government has not yet had an opportunity to present its arguments. It says in court documents that the proposed regime must be struck down because it gives B.C. a \u201cveto\u201d over inter-provincial projects.\nBoth Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley have said Ottawa \u2014 not the provinces \u2014 has the authority to regulate trans-boundary pipelines.\nAlberta, Saskatchewan, Trans Mountain Corp. and the Canadian Railway Association are among 13 parties that have filed documents in support of the federal government in the case.\nArvay acknowledged that B.C. Premier John Horgan said on the campaign trail in 2017, when his party was in opposition, that he would use \u201cevery tool in the toolbox\u201d to stop the Trans Mountain expansion.\nHowever, after Horgan\u2019s government took power, it received legal advice that it was constitutionally unable to stop the project but it could bring in environmental legislation, Arvay said.\nUnder questioning from the Appeal Court judges, Arvay acknowledged that the proposed permitting system could lead to a situation where the Trans Mountain pipeline would not be allowed to operate.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s really in the hands of the pipeline,\u201d he said, adding the corporation would be responsible for ensuring it meets the permit conditions.\nJustice Harvey Groberman challenged Arvay\u2019s assertion that B.C. must be able to enact laws to protect its environment from trans-boundary projects in case the federal government fails to do so.\nIf the federal government didn\u2019t regulate airplanes, for example, that could result in a disaster in the province\u2019s airspace, Groberman noted.\nArvay outlined a number of cases that he said have established legal precedent for B.C. to impose environmental laws on trans-boundary projects.\nOne such case was in 1899, when a court held that provinces and municipalities could require the Canadian Pacific Railway to keep ditches alongside its tracks clear of dirt and rubbish to prevent damage to adjacent properties, he said.\nHowever, Justice Lauri Ann Fenlon said the ruling didn\u2019t necessarily prevent the railway from operating if it failed to keep the ditches clear \u2014 unlike B.C.\u2019s proposed legislation.\nThe federal government has purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion.

For a more optimistic vision of the future of mobile phones, read our list of probable prophecies.\nHaptic technology was all the rage a year or two ago, and what did we get out of it? Touchscreens that buzz a little when you press them. Wow.\nThe next generation of touchy-feely gadgets won't be quite as underwhelming, if Intel has anything to do with it. The chip company just demonstrated the first system that can simulate different kinds of springs using miniature actuators and software. It sounds pretty esoteric but the applications are actually pretty cool.\nA phone equipped with Intel's virtual springs could give sight-free feedback on all kinds of things. Want to know how many texts or emails you have waiting for you without fishing your phone from your pocket? If you squeeze your mobile and it feels like a squidgy banana, your inbox is empty. If it feels like a rock-hard avocado, it's time you started ploughing through them.\nIntel's other sensitive device is a TV remote that knows who's holding it. Apparently, we all have slightly different ways of pressing the damn mute button when the ads start shouting, or making a little pointy movement when changing channels. Intel's intuitive remote can identify different family members and pre-select their favourite channel lists, volume and picture settings -- without having to be told who's commanding the box.\nLikely release date: Squeezable phone -- 2013. Personalised zapper -- 2012.\nWhen we reach the point when every phone in the world has a gorgeous 4.3-inch touchscreen, how are manufacturers going to persuade you to upgrade? Add another dimension of course. Mobile phones are likely to be one of the first gadgets to get good-looking autostereoscopic (glasses-free) 3D, thanks to new technologies just emerging.\nAll autostereo systems have one problem or another. Lenticular screens (as seen on Fujifilm's W3 camera) have annoying black bands, while parallax barrier displays (like Nintendo's 3DS) reduce the resolution and brightness. Even the very latest tech, a micro-lens film from 3M, suffers from having just a single 3D sweet spot.\nBut on mobile gadgets, none of these really matter. It's easy and natural to twist portable gadgets until the 3D looks its best, and you don't really need a 'Full HD' screen on something palm-sized anyway. Multi-dimensional mobiles will start with 3D menus -- imagine pushing an icon and seeing it sink down into the screen. Next up will be basic 3D games and shooting your own 3D memories on your phone, which merely requires a second tiny camera on board.\n\"Almost certainly we will see a plethora of autostereoscopic products in the handheld market,\" says Michael Bove, director of the consumer electronics laboratory at MIT. \"We don't know at this point whether or not phones or media players really need autostereo, but I applaud those hardy souls who are willing to bet their companies' future on there being a business, because we learn a lot from it.\"\nLikely release date: First autostereo mobile -- 2011.\nTake a brand-new Android handset, throw it on the floor and stamp on it.

Hers was a long journey toward healing and then hope.\nBut last week it took a dramatic turn that reveals much about Afghanistan and how dramatically the situation there is deteriorating these days. It shows how aggressively and successfully the Taliban is reasserting control of life in every corner of the country.\nIt\u2019s a turn that would leave a less hardy traveler on the road of life completely disillusioned, perhaps even bitter. But that\u2019s not Sally.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning of her journey.\nOn Sept. 11, Sally\u2019s tall, handsome, fun-loving son, Peter, 33, was on board the second plane that went into the twin towers. He was traveling for his work as a software engineer.\nAfter many months in the valley of despair that comes with losing a child, Sally caught a glimpse of sunlight that led her out of the darkness. She was pointed there by her late son\u2019s best friend, a Marine, who was serving in Afghanistan.\nFrom the war zone the Marine wrote to Sally, a reading teacher in the western Massachusetts town of North Adams, that Afghanistan needed her help as an educator. The students in the war-ravaged country, he informed her, desperately needed school supplies.\nSally answered the call. She began collecting school supplies everywhere she could and delivered them to Afghanistan. Her story touched many hearts. Eventually, she raised $250,000 and decided in 2006 to use the funds to build a girls' school in Afghanistan's Logar Province.\nIn the spring of 2007, I traveled with Sally on the day she got to see the school up and running for the first time. I was there to hear the girls giggling and shouting her name, surrounding her and thanking her. I was there to see the joy and hope in their faces that an American woman who lost her son in the Sept. 11 attacks would have such a big heart.\nI saw her son\u2019s English language version of the Koran carefully placed in a glass case in the principal\u2019s office. The family was nominally Catholic, but the closest thing it had to real religion was the Red Sox. Peter was born on the day the Sox clinched the pennant in 1967. But Peter had a passion for understanding all religions and he carefully marked certain passages of the Koran that Sally had donated to the school.\nThe village elders in Logar Province who watched over the school hosted a lunch for us. Sally had gotten to know them through repeated trips to Afghanistan during the fundraising for and then construction of the school. There was Haji Malik, a tall, gentle-mannered man with a thick beard and traditional Afghan dress. And there was his younger brother, Katal Khan, who actually looked much older, with a thicker and more gray beard and deep lines in his face.\nBetween them, these two patriarchs of the tribe in this small village in Logar had 14 daughters who were studying in the school that Sally built.\nAfter we spent the day visiting with students, the elders hosted an elaborate meal for us in their family compound next to the school.

It has been a substantial rally and has many market players feeling relieved, although we only have recouped losses back to around Dec. 17.\nDespite this recent strength there were only 45 stocks hitting new 12-month highs on Tuesday, which is good illustration of how much damage has been done since the top was hit around the first of October. There is a very long way to go to put this market back to where it was.\nThe longer this rally lasts, the more comfortable market players are that the worst is over. The thing that has been most unusual about this corrective action is that it hasn't had a clear catalyst. There was much talk about trade wars with China, a hawkish Fed and the possibility that the economy was slowing. The only really concrete negative issue was the weak earnings and revenue guidance from Apple Inc. (AAPL) . Other than that, there has been little to confirm the very ugly fourth-quarter action.\nThere are still bears who believe the Dec. 24 lows will be visited again. They have a negative view of the big picture that includes a weak economy, an ineffective central bank, political chaos and excessive valuations. It is the same pessimistic view that the bears have held for years, but they now feel the action of the last three months confirms their thinking.\nIf we respect the price action the proper way to proceed at this point is to assume that the December lows will hold and that an uptrend is underway. The healthiest thing that could happen would be some pullbacks and consolidation rather than straight-up moves, but the market seems to take delight in doing what will challenge the most people.\nThere are plenty of market players who raised substantial cash in December and are now struggling to try to put it back to work, but they don't want to chase too much in case there are some pullbacks and retests.\nThe best advice I can give at this time is to focus less on overall market direction and more on individual stock selection. When the market corrected, stocks moved in tandem because the selling took place mostly in big baskets. All stocks were punished to much the same degree, which means many were unfairly treated.\nNow that a bounce is taking place we are starting to see pockets of individual stocks outperform. Stock pickers are looking for those names that are the most mispriced. In addition, earnings season is fast approaching and there are sure to be a crop of new winners as the numbers are posted.\nIt is never easy to navigate a market that goes straight down and then straight back up, but if the worst is truly over then we will see more opportunities to enter individual stocks as this develops further.\nTrading the indices is a different matter, especially if you have a shorter time frame. The indices are now very extended and there is risk of a \"sell the news\" reaction to headlines. However, as we saw on Tuesday, there are some dip buyers lurking and they went to work.\nIt would be much easier if the market pulled back and consolidated its recent big gains, but if it was easy it wouldn't be so potentially lucrative.

This year, the first day of the Jewish New Year, September 16, corresponds with the opening hours of the killings.\nI met you in 1982. I was working as a nurse at a hospital in Sabra. I arrived after Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, soon after Israel refused to allow food, water, and vital medications into the besieged city. I was there as a humanitarian. Morally, I could not stand by and be silent while the destruction of a city and the killing and maiming of its people occurred.\nFollowing the assassination of the newly-elected president of Lebanon in mid-September all hell broke loose. I listened as Israeli planes broke the sound barrier over the camps, heard continuous heavy artillery fire, and stayed away from shattering windows.

I cared for hundreds of terrified refugees seeking the safety of the hospital. I tried to comprehend the throat-slitting gesture the women made.

Many of the militia were using walkie-talkies. At one point, the soldiers lined us up against a bullet- ridden wall and pointed their rifles at us. After several minutes, they put their rifles down and marched us out of the camp.\nThey led us up a street to an abandoned UN building. In the courtyard we saw parts of IDF uniforms, discarded army rations and recent editions of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.

It came before the Iranian Revolution and the Polish Solidarity. It was never spontaneous, as some wrongfully claim. Were it so, it would have replicated itself every year or day for the causes of the uprising never ceased to occur! The public strike by the Sudan Civil Service, the army officers and soldiers\u2019 rebellion, and the well-organized confrontations between tens of thousands of unified demonstrators and the government regular forces could never have been spontaneous. October was a fresh, creative, and most promising revolutionary initiative.\nNothing stops revolutions from occurrence. Despite the notorious colonial ventures of the French republics in our third-world nations, the French Revolution was only put into a form of sustainable control by regular democracy and capitalist growth at home. What stopped the succeeding American Revolution was the sustained democracy and capitalist development. By the same token, nothing will stop revolutions from occurrence in third world countries other than regular democracy and sustainable development, whether socialist or capitalist.\nOctober was a legitimate product of a highly calculable process of political change in which both objective and subjective conditions were insistently inviting the uprising. The street was determined, unionized, and supported by progressive parties. The middle-class strong parties, the Khatmiya and Ansar, were already alienated with some of their distinguished leaders, for example Ismail al-Azhari and al-Imam al-Siddig al-Mahdi, harshly persecuted by the military leadership of the state. The South was burning with revolution led by strong leaders, especially William Deng and the SANU politicians and the Anya-Nya.\nForeign relations were shaking with conflict across the borders, deteriorating with the African neighbors who never ceased supporting the African southern Sudanese, and falling apart with the Liberation Movement of the Arab nationalist regimes led by Nasser. The tone of the time was disturbed by the Cold War Era, vigorously disputed by the Liberation Movement supporters especially the Sudanese Communist Party and its historic alliance with trade unions, professional associations, the non-aligned movement, and the Nkrumah striving for an anti-neo-colonialism AOU that later on emerged a few years after the Sudanese Glorious October.\nRevolutions never come about by military decree \"to install a Socialist State by a single-party-single-candidate\" tyranny, as the Ja\u2019far Nimeiri military junta and his Arab nationalist young officers tyrannically imposed in 1969. Nor would any revolution materialize with the Nimeiri\u2019s twin, Omer al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi\u2019s primitive politics in the service of a false Islamic Caliphate. Revolutions occur with highly sophisticated calculations, struggles, and determination by the largest sections of the populace who would cease to see their fortune in the existing regimes and then break daringly into the streets to manifest their will and to change power relations for social justice and the good life - a huge massive movement to which any band of rulers would have to give up to stand powerlessly before the just and fair trial for all their evil deeds.\nThe October Revolution, as Sudanese love to call it, was not fully executed"}

We went for the Toto's Delight sandwich ($6.25), a pumped-up grilled cheese with chicken, avocado, onions, peppers and bacon bits. It was the right decision.\nThe hard tacos are another excellent choice ($2.99). Shredded chicken or asada-style beef is tumbled with sharp cheese before being placed in the tortilla with lettuce and salsa. The whole thing is deep-fried for an authentic flavor and texture.

When he says he read a lot of Bukowski in his early 20s, both poetry and fiction, you believe he drew strength from Chinaski\u2019s defeats, and that\u2019s why, when the producers offered him Factotum, he hesitated out of respect, and maybe even reverence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Henry Chinaski, not about Bukowski, even if it\u2019s a very thin line,\u201d Factotum\u2019s director Bent Hamer (Kitchen Stories) insists. \u201cAnd I think one of the main keys to approach the character was the understanding of not trying to find someone that fits very well into the clich\u00e9 of Bukowski, because I think that\u2019s the most visible thing about him \u2026 It\u2019s so easy to stick to that. But still, when Matt Dillon was mentioned, he was surprised. I was surprised.\nBut she also managed to scuttle Dillon\u2019s plan to ignore the man Bukowski was in his portrayal of Hank since, as she pointed out, Chinaski was really just Bukowski \u2014 an idealized version, maybe, but Bukowski nevertheless.\nAnd Linda Bukowski \u2014 \u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d Dillon says \u2014 found this trait in Dillon, too. So he went back to the character-building drawing board, forced to accept that \u201call roads go back to Bukowski.\u201d He studied old footage in order to wed Bukowski to both Chinaski and, if one gauges the actor correctly, to a bit of the idolized version of Buk that helped Dillon evolve into manhood.\nIn other words, Matt Dillon has grown up. Maybe even gotten a bit old, maybe even a little defeated \u2014 as were, he says, Chinaski, and Bukowski himself."}

Some do a Frankincense (spiritual) gift, a Gold (want) gift, and a Myrrh (useful) gift\u2013in addition to a stocking and a Christmas Eve gift (which is traditionally new pajamas in many families).\nSome children receive one special toy or other item from Santa and then receive books, board games, and clothes from their parents. (Activity-type gifts seem to be popular for young children. Receiving things that they can do will help keep them busy and happy during colder weather or time at home during vacation).\nSome parents find that their children receive abundant gifts from relatives and that Christmas feels overly-abundant if they do anything beyond \u201chelping Santa.\u201d But these parents often still feel the need and the desire to give their children something themselves (rather than just via Santa). In this case, it can work well to give children coupons for special time or activities with mom or dad or a \u201cFamily Fun Jar\u201d (see ideas below) rather than just adding to the pile of toys. This approach is spelled out on Saren\u2019s blog here.\nI know there isn\u2019t one \u201cright\u201d way to do this, but I love how deliberate and uncomplicated these suggestions are.\n(2) Simplify the gift-giving among extended and immediate family members.\nWith large families, especially, it can get expensive and time-consuming to purchase gifts for everyone. Many families have met this challenge by drawing names among siblings, cousins, in-laws, etc. and focusing on inexpensive handmade gifts (that actually make the giving process more meaningful). Another idea is to do a group family service project or group activity (like attending a cultural event or a nice homemade dinner) in place of the traditional gift-giving.

Those moments spent in the kitchen, surrounded by the smell of bread baking, meant the world to me, and my teachers loved the bread.

Maybe too easy.\nZelle, a service that allows bank customers to instantly send money to their acquaintances, is booming. Thousands of new users sign up every day. Some $75 billion zoomed through Zelle's network last year. That's more than twice the amount of money that customers transferred with Venmo, a rival money-transfer app.\nBut the same features that make Zelle so useful for customers, its speed and ubiquity, have made it irresistible to thieves. Hackers and con artists have used the system to steal from victims \u2014 some of whom had never used Zelle or even heard of it until someone used it to clean out their bank accounts.\nInterviews with more than two dozen customers who had their money stolen through Zelle illustrate the weaknesses that criminals are using in targeting the network. While all financial systems are susceptible to fraud, aspects of Zelle's design, like not always notifying customers when money is transferred \u2014 some banks do; others don't \u2014 have contributed to the system's vulnerability. And some customers who lost money were made whole by their banks; others were not.\nFor the banks, Zelle is a big \u2014 and must-win \u2014 bet on where money is headed. As consumers become increasingly accustomed to splitting dinner checks, paying for their coffee and hailing an Uber without touching paper money, banks are rushing to stake their claim on the wallet of the future.\nIn recent years, apps such as Venmo (which is owned by PayPal), Popmoney, Square Cash and Apple Pay made digital cash transfers quick and simple. Banks were falling behind. So they joined up to create a rival product, run by Early Warning Services, a Scottsdale, Ariz., consortium that is jointly owned by seven large banks.\nLast June, Early Warning introduced Zelle. It is built directly into each bank's mobile app, making the system easy to use for customers \u2014 or thieves who gain access to their accounts.\nThe scale of the problem is hard to pinpoint, because Zelle is fairly new and banks do not report much data about it. But banking analysts say they have seen some alarming incidents.\n\"I know of one bank that was experiencing a 90 percent fraud rate on Zelle transactions, which is insane,\" said Genevieve Gimbert, a partner in PwC's financial crimes unit. Most banks have strong authentication and fraud-detection controls for Zelle, she said, but some \"just implemented it without any protections\" like two-factor authentication and user-behavior monitoring.\nZelle said the problem was under control.\n\"There are very few incidents,\" said Lou Anne Alexander, Early Warning's head of payments. \"When there is a problem, we and the banks are proactive. It's not something we're putting our heads in the sand about.\"\nEighteen banks in the United States, including most of the biggest players, are using Zelle, and 70 more are in the process of setting it up. Collectively, they connect about half of the traditional checking accounts in the United States. Cash transfers within the network often take place within seconds \u2014 much faster than on most of its rival payment services. That has made it more difficult for banks to halt or reverse illicit transactions.\nSecurity is a cornerstone of Zelle's marketing"}

If Lomachenko does not fight Mikey Garcia, promoter Bob Arum will chase a bout against Campbell in London.\nLomachenko defended his WBA and WBO lightweight belts on Friday night with a brutal stoppage of Crolla 58 seconds into round four. Lomachenko (13-1, 10 KOs) saw off the mandatory challenger for his WBA belt with ease, nearly ending it late in the third round knocking the British fighter into the ropes. Referee Jack Reiss allowed the fight to continue, and Lomachenko finished it shortly after the break with a right hand that dropped Crolla face-first onto the canvas.\nThe Briton looked badly hurt, but Matchroom officials later confirmed that Crolla had suffered no broken nose or ribs, and had not been taken to hospital. He had been outclassed (34-7-3), Lomachenko having planned to take on Richard Commey in a three-belt unification fight, but an injury to Commey's hand had forced this contest.\nLomachenko is now turning his attentions to Campbell.\n\"We are both Olympic champions from London 2012, and it would be a great fight,\" he said. \"I love the noise the British fans make and how much they love boxing.\" Promoters Top Rank have already spoken to the O2 Arena about potential dates.\nLomachenko headlined here at Staples Center for the first time in his brief professional career, and a raucous crowd of 10,101 filled the lower bowl for his biggest showcase yet. The Ukrainian has developed a significant fan base in the Los Angeles area, where he lives and trains. If a fight were to take place in the UK, Lomachenko's return may well be treated as a homecoming.\n\"I loved fighting at the Olympics in London, and it is a great place for boxers because the fans understand and love the sport,\" he added. \"I want Mikey Garcia, (but) I want to unify titles,\" Lomachenko said. \"That's my goal. I want historic fights.\"\nPromoter Arum told Telegraph Sport: \"Vasyl sees Campbell as the number one challenge in the lightweight division because he follows what his father believes.

Taking Lomachenko to the UK would be brilliant, as he is worthy of being a global star.\"\nLomachenko's profile has grown exponentially in recent years after headlininh at Madison Square Garden, in Macau and other Los Angeles-area venues before his step up to Staples. Lomachenko's next fight is likely to be even bigger, whether as a unification bout or a showdown with one of the other lightweight greats of this era.\nIn the co-main event, longtime super middleweight champion Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ramirez remained unbeaten when his light heavyweight debut against Tommy Karpency was stopped by Karpency's corner before the fifth round.

The ballerinas giggle and jiggle, but with a little coaxing from their instructor, they assemble in a line with their heels touching in first position, their tiny palms pointed inwards, before finally bending into a group plie. Ziadeh rewards them with a loud \"bravo\".\nIn this first specialised ballet centre to open in the West Bank, Palestinian children in Ramallah are being taught the essence of an art that originated in the Italian Renaissance and was further developed in France. Once a week for one hour, the girls some as young as three are instructed to bend, flutter, kick and hop - as gracefully as possible.\nThe city of Ramallah has recently become a hub for cultural activities. Before Ziadeh opened her centre, ballet classes were only offered by a local church. In addition to the traditional dabkeh dance, taught widely in the West Bank, some centres have also started offering modern dance, zumba classes, and yoga.\nLocated at the top of a building in the old part of the city - with roads pocked by potholes and small markets selling vegetables and meat - Ziadeh's ballet centre is simple yet spacious, its walls bare except for a few pictures of pointe shoes and smiling children, its windows showing a panoramic view of Ramallah and letting in abundant Middle Eastern sunshine.\nZiadeh opened her studio two years ago after many months of giving free classes to children at summer camps and churches. \"These classes were my litmus test,\" she said, as she sat down after an hour of flouncy flutters to Snow White and Swan Lake. \"I saw that many people were interested and their kids were enjoying it, so I decided to open up my own place.\"\nThe opening of the ballet centre is part of a renewed cultural renaissance in the West Bank.

But the benefits are completely wiped out if, like most of the British population, they add milk, researchers reveal today.\nTea has long been thought to have health benefits for the heart and in the prevention of cancer. But researchers from Germany, writing in the European Heart Journal, suggest that their findings about milk ought to lead to an urgent reassessment of the effect of tea on cancer prevention.\n\"Since milk appears to modify the biological activities of tea ingredients, it is likely that the anti-tumour effects of tea could be affected as well,\" said one of the authors, Verena Stangl, professor of cardiology at the Charit\u00e9 hospital, Berlin.\n\"It is essential that we re-examine the association between tea consumption and cancer protection to see if that is the case.\"\nThe team suggests that tea drinkers who usually add milk should drink it black for some of the time. Flavonoids in tea, called catechins, are thought to be responsible for its beneficial effects on the heart. The study found that a group of proteins in milk, called caseins, interacted with the tea to reduce the concentration of catechins.\nThe researchers measured the effects of drinking black tea, tea with milk and plain hot water on 16 women volunteers. Regular tests on the brachial artery of the forearm for two hours after drinking showed that black tea promoted dilation of the blood vessels. \"We found that ... the addition of milk completely prevents the biological effect,\" said the lead author, Mario Lorenz, a molecular biologist.\nFurther tests in rats produced the same results. It could explain why Britain, a nation of tea drinkers, does not appear to enjoy protection from high rates of heart disease, say the authors.\n\"The well-established benefits of tea have been described in many studies,\" said Prof Stangl.\n\"Our results thus provide a possible explanation for the lack of beneficial effects of tea on the risk of heart disease in the UK, a country where milk is usually added.\"\nJune Davison, cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said the study highlighted the importance of looking at interactions between foods, but added that having a cup of tea could be helpful if it allowed people to relax.\n\"Leaving milk out of your tea is far less likely to help protect your heart health than other measures, such as taking regular exercise, avoiding smoking and eating a healthy balanced diet,\" she said."}

Victims of domestic violence have been kicked out of their homes after calling 911 for help. When tenants complained that a landlord had locked them out, police wrongly informed them that it\u2019s a civil matter.\nA report from the Office of Police Conduct Review and interviews with tenant lawyers reveal a shadow eviction practice that\u2019s an end run around legal protections for tenants, conducted through secret messages to landlords and neighborhood leaders and intimidating \u201cnotice to vacate\u201d letters from landlords to tenants.\nCouncil Member Phillipe Cunningham said the report is \u201cscandalous,\u201d and has pledged to overhaul the 28-year-old \u201cconduct on premises\u201d ordinance that set out the rules for handling problem rental properties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harming vulnerable renters and also it\u2019s not addressing chronic criminal behavior,\u201d said Cunningham, who has convened work groups involving 30 city staff and five community groups to revamp the code.\nThe police department suspended its enforcement of the ordinance two months ago and reassigned Luther Krueger, the crime prevention specialist who ran the program in recent years. Police did not make Krueger available for an interview.\nPassed in 1990, when crack houses were a neighborhood menace, the conduct on premises ordinance was intended to force landlords to help shoulder the burden for law enforcement. The city trained landlords to use the threat of eviction as a primary tool of dealing with trouble. Offenses as minor as underage drinking could prompt the city, at the discretion of Krueger, to mail a notice of violation to the landlord. The landlord then had 10 days to respond with a plan to correct the problem. Often, the plan was simply to kick the renter out.\n\u201cThe notices that get sent out to landlords as a result of some kind of criminal activity on the property can lead to a notice to vacate, which is a more subtle version of an eviction,\u201d Imani Jaafar, the director of the Office of Police Conduct Review, said in a May presentation to the City Council\u2019s Public Safety Committee.\nEnforcement of the ordinance has fallen most heavily on poor tenants of color, the investigation found. The city sent 478 notices of violation to rental properties in north Minneapolis between 2012 and 2016, primarily in the Jordan, Willard Hay, Folwell, Hawthorne, Webber-Camden, McKinley and Near North neighborhoods.\nBy contrast, the ordinance was applied only 16 times in that period in southwest Minneapolis.\nCourt-ordered evictions number more than 3,000 per year in Minneapolis, but the actual number of tenants removed from their homes outside the legal process is probably double that number, according to lawyers at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid.\nThe main way that happens is through \u201cnotices to vacate,\u201d a threat to evict that many tenants comply with voluntarily because they don\u2019t know their rights or want to avoid an eviction on their record, according to the report.\nThose letters can be triggered by an e-mailed \u201caction alert\u201d from police about an arrest or a police call involving someone at the address."}

All that was missing from Mr. Obama\u2019s celebration was the old \u201cIcky Shuffle\u201d end zone dance.\nThis no doubt came as a bit of a shock to voters since the economy has been sickly for a long, long time. As recently as this fall, half of Americans were saying that the country is still in recession.\nConditions have improved in the last six months for sure, with growth accelerating, inflation low and stable, hiring picking up and gas prices tumbling.\nStill, if things are as good as the White House says they are, why do we feel so bad? Why are we collectively so worried about the fragile future of our nation?\nOne answer is that the conventional statistics of economic conditions for families aren\u2019t measuring the real hardships families are facing today. Is there anyone on this continent, who really thinks that the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent?\nThe $1 trillion growth gap. This economic recovery is the slowest in 50 years. If we had had the same pace of improvement since June 2009 when the recession ended as in an average recovery, national output and incomes would be more than $1 trillion larger today. In other words, we would have about $10,000 more income per family than we do.\nThe raiseless recovery. It\u2019s been 10 years since Americans in the middle class got a pay raise that kept pace with inflation. Median income households today make $1,500 less than they did even since the recession officially ended. The recession really hasn\u2019t ended for half of all families.\nThe myth that inflation is dead. By looking at what middle-income families have to buy \u2014 food, energy, tuition and health care \u2014 prices have been running two to three times the official rate. Low gas prices recently are helping, but health costs are rising again \u2014 despite the Obamacare promise to bend the cost curve down. Oops.\nInequality is worse. President Obama has made closing the gap between rich and poor his highest priority. Guess what? The Gini coefficient (as measured by the Census Bureau), the left\u2019s favorite measure of income inequality, rose each of Mr. Obama\u2019s first four years in office, breaking all-time highs in both 2011 and 2012, and it remains high.\nWhere are the new small businesses? According to an analysis by the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, the rate of business creation dipped to just 0.28 percent of all adults in 2013. It\u2019s been since 2001 that business creation rates were this low. The latest available data from the Census Bureau (2012) shows business creation only slightly rebounding from the recession lows.\nThe American dream goes bust. A 2014 Pew Research Poll found only 34 percent of Americans think their children will be better off than they are. This pessimism contrasts sharply with Mr. Obama\u2019s rosy scenario.\nThe debt has grown by $7.3 trillion. When Mr. Obama entered office the national debt was under $11 trillion. Now it\u2019s more than $18 trillion \u2014 more than $120,000 for each worker. It will be $19 trillion when he leaves office.

Battery lives, that is.\nGoogle backed up the battery life benefits of \"dark mode\" on operating systems and apps in a presentation during the company's Android Dev Summit on Thursday.\nDark mode is an option that changes the overall color theme of an operating system or app to the color black. It's long been associated with better battery life on devices, especially mobile devices. Nevertheless, the benefits of dark mode are now officially endorsed by Google, one of the most influential tech companies in the world.\nIn one piece of data, Google showed how dark mode can use 43% less power at full brightness than \"normal mode\" in the YouTube app, which uses a lot of white.\nFunnily enough, Google acknowledged that it had made a mistake in encouraging app developers to use the color white for their apps, including Google's own apps. Unfortunately, it's led to an inconsistent experience on mobile devices. You can turn on dark mode for the Android operating system and various apps that offer dark mode, but other apps that don't offer dark mode will use color white as the main color theme.\nThe battery-saving effects of dark modes are also more apparent on OLED displays, which most top smartphones use these days, compared to more traditional LCD displays.

Despite having great insurance and selling their house to compensate for the loss of Gorsegner's income, the medical debt alone topped $25,000.\nSo like many other Americans coping with the high cost of cancer care, the Gorsegners got help from Internet crowdfunding.\nGrosegner was initially hesistant to take money from others, but agreed to letting a work friend post Natalie\u2019s story on DonationTo.\nDonations began to pour in from friends and strangers alike, raising $13,000 and covering more than half of their medical expenses.\nThere are no statistics on how many patients use crowdfunding to pay for medical bills, but anecdotally, those in the cancer world say it\u2019s on the rise.\nThere are all kinds of medical pleas on sites like YouCaring.com, FundRazr, GoFundMe, GiveForward and Indiegogo. Cancer is a notoriously expensive disease, with research suggesting that families fighting the disease are twice as likely to go bankrupt. Many families, even those with health insurance, struggle to pay the high medical deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Under many policies, these expenses alone can exceed $10,000 with a serious illness.\nStill it can be hard for families to turn to friends or strangers for help.\nMeghan Morgan, a single mom who runs a dog walking business in Portland had no choice. Just two weeks after her 13-month-old son Henry was hospitalized for inoperable neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer, she was facing $40,000 for the room alone\u2014 not including the cost of his chemotherapy, surgery and other treatments. Her insurance will likely cover much of that, but she can\u2019t even afford the $5,000 deductible on her policy. And without being able to work, she has no way to cover day-to-day expenses like food, rent, and car repairs. After Meghan's cousin set up a page, Help Henry Morgan, on GoFundMe, they have reached more than half of their $20,000 goal.\n\"I definitely am so grateful,\" said Morgan,\"because I know I am going to need help, whether I like it or not.\"\n\"I definitely am so grateful, because I know I am going to need help, whether I like it or not.\"\nSome sites charge a flat fee, usually a 50-50 split between credit card costs and the sites operating costs.

{"idx": "21920", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Federal Government's recent announcement that Serco will be delivering some of the income support system, Centrelink, is another blow to core public services that serve some of the most disadvantaged Australians.\nAlan Tudge, the Minister for Human Services, said that this move is to deal with the long waiting times many people are subjected to when trying to get in touch with Centrelink, despite denying they are an issue at all. Myriad inquiries have found that getting through to Centrelink is difficult and that existing problems worsened after the robo-debt debacle.\nThe Community and Public Sector Union's National Secretary Nadine Flood is, unsurprisingly, not impressed. 'The Turnbull Government has cut and cut and cut at Centrelink, and is now trying to use the appalling service standards it has caused as justification for privatising a critical public service,' she said in a statement.\nHow adding a private company to human services delivery will solve some of the considerable problems with the current Centrelink system seems hard to understand. Long call waiting times are, in part, caused by a reduction in staff and a reliance on inexperienced, casual staff to fill short term demand. The CPSU says that over 5000 staff have been cut from the Department of Human Services over the last few years, despite an increase in the number of people receiving income support.\nPeople contact Centrelink when something has gone wrong, or when there has been a big change in their lives; they lose their job, get sick or injured, have a baby or end a relationship. Encounters with Centrelink come with big feelings and lots of vulnerability.\nAustralia's highly targeted income support system means that eligibility is mostly for people at the bottom of the economic pile. Being poor is often hard, terrifying and demoralising. Finding ways to survive, keep a roof over your head and to get medication can be a daily struggle. The social security system is meant to be a safety net; instead payments are so low, and the compliance regime so harsh that it is becoming a barrier for people to get work at all.\n\"The social safety net is not some kind of shopping centre, where everyone has the ability and capacity to go and select the right widget for their individual needs. Applying these kinds of market ideologies to a core public service is a laughable absurdity.\"\nIntroducing competition to human services is supposed to improve efficiency and give people greater choice. How either of those could apply to Centrelink is baffling, given that the agency has a natural monopoly on managing the income support system. Welfare recipients are now 'consumers', just out shopping for their Newstart Allowance, I guess. Who delivers government functions is now irrelevant, as long as users exercise their magic choices.\nBut the social safety net is not some kind of shopping centre, where everyone has the ability and capacity to go and select the right widget for their individual needs. Applying these kinds of market ideologies to a core public service is a laughable absurdity, if it were not actually happening.\nThe Harper Review says 'designing markets for government services may be a necessary first step as governments contract out or commission new forms of service delivery, drawing on public funds.' Serco has been awarded $51.7m of public funds to manage part of a service that has no competitors. The Review goes on to say that these kinds of contracts will 'both empower consumers and improve productivity'. Right.\nThese kinds of ideologically blinkered approaches to marketisation should not be applied to core public services, such as the social safety net.

So Musselman called the same play \u2013 Five Down \u2013 nearly every time down the floor. Breuer scored 40 points that day and the Wolves lost by 10.\nThe Wolves were just getting started and I saw so many, many more losses. Before they went and won 47 games and made the playoffs last season, my winning percentage in my first 14 NBA seasons on the beat was .293. That\u2019s worse than the career winning percentage of Kurt Rambis, one of a long list of Wolves coaches I covered that includes Sidney Lowe, Jimmy Rodgers, Randy Wittman, Kevin McHale, Rick Adelman, Flip Saunders, Sam Mitchell and now Tom Thibodeau.\nI remember, too, the night in Oklahoma City when Kevin Love made seven three-pointers, scored 51 points and J.J. Barea (there\u2019s a name from the past) had a triple-double, but the Wolves lost in double overtime after Russell Westbrook scored 45 points and Kevin Durant scored 40.

Washington's Patrick Ramsey has a 77.7 quarterback rating with 12 touchdown passes and eight interceptions.\nBottom line: The Redskins need the ball to be effective, but the Panthers have an excellent ball-control offense.\nIntroduction: If St. Louis quarterback Marc Bulger struggles as he did last weekend against Baltimore, don't be surprised to see veteran Kurt Warner get some playing time.\nPlot: The Rams failed to generate much offense against the Ravens but still scored 33 points. Coach Mike Martz cannot count on that happening against the Bears, who have the least penalized defense in the NFL. With 17 fumble recoveries and 12 interceptions, the Rams are tied with Kansas City for most takeaways. In last week's 12-10 loss at Detroit, the Bears had 199 yards in offense.\nBottom line: As long as Bulger can get the ball to Torry Holt, who leads the NFL with 66 catches for 1,099 yards and nine touchdowns, the Rams should be in good shape.\nThe line: Chiefs by 6.\nIntroduction: The 1972 Miami Dolphins should be concerned about the 9-0 Chiefs, who are getting solid play from quarterback Trent Green and big plays from their defense.\nPlot: Kansas City leads the NFL with a plus-18 turnover advantage. In his last four starts, Green has thrown for eight touchdown passes and one interception. Kansas City's Priest Holmes leads the NFL with 14 touchdowns rushing. The Bengals have won three of their last four games, including last week's victory over Houston. Cincinnati running back Rudi Johnson has gained 317 yards and scored four touchdowns in his last three games.\nBottom line: If the Bengals can shut down Holmes, the Chiefs may be in for a tough battle.\nThe line: Browns by 6.\nIntroduction: The struggling Browns have lost three games in a row, and the Cardinals have not won a road game in more than a year.\nPlot: Cleveland Coach Butch Davis has continuing problems with the Browns' passing game.

For instance, Central Bank of India's 90-180 day deposit rates were cut from 8 per cent per annum to 7 per cent while the rates of the special deposit scheme (555 days) was cut from 9.6 per annum to 9.25 per cent.

Our strategic stakes in the country remain high. A total withdrawal \u2014 the infamous \"zero option\" \u2014 would be seen as a sign of divine favor and counted as a strategic victory by the Taliban and al-Qaida. It would also encourage the reawakened al-Qaida movement in Iraq and its twin in Syria, as well as extremists in Pakistan. It would cause chaos as Afghanistan enters a new electoral cycle that will end Karzai\u2019s tenure in 2014.\nBut the fact that Afghanistan is preparing for its first ever peaceful change of leadership is emblematic of the progress we have made. Yes, there is corruption, brutality, and bad governance, but in 2001, there was no government at all. Now there are fledgling institutions that have grown enormously after three decades of war. Afghan security forces that were less than 100,000 when I went to Afghanistan in 2005 now total 350,000. They have stood up well during their first year leading combat operations, but major gaps in developing essential support services and logistical infrastructure remain. This is not surprising, as we only began building these service forces in 2010; our military never expected to finish training them before 2016. But it is precisely because we need to finish building and fielding these forces that we need a few years more of essential mentorship. This residual force (somewhere between 8,000 and 12,000 troops) would represent less than 10 percent of the forces we once deployed to combat; a modest investment for the stakes involved. Retaining this small force to train the Afghans is essential to secure Afghan political support for the even smaller U.S. counterterrorism force that we need for our own security.\nWith the NATO combat mission coming to an end in December, we have sought a new legal basis for our troops to stay in the country after 2014, the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA), although we could remain with our current Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), so long as neither we nor the Afghans withdraw from it. NATO, however, must have a new agreement, especially as the current mission is tied to U.N. resolutions. The assumption was that the NATO agreement would follow and be patterned after the BSA, but now both agreements are stalled. The BSA has been endorsed by an ad hoc assembly of 3,000 Afghans, the upper house of the Afghan parliament, numerous Afghan political leaders, and tribal delegations, striking proof that we have not worn out our welcome.

I had to help my cousins; they were crying.\"\nWhile Lebanese citizens have faced the risk of this nightmarish holdover of war since 2006, the start of the Syrian civil war five years later marked a new era of suffering.\nFour million cluster munitions were dropped during the last days of the 2006 Israeli war on Lebanon, an estimated one million of which did not explode.\nNow, in southern Lebanon, it is estimated that 704 hazardous sites remain, spread across 15.23 square kilometres.\n\"Why isn't south Lebanon clear of unexploded ordnance?\" asked Bekim Shala, director of the demining non-governmental organisation Mine Action Group (MAG)'s operations in Lebanon. \"It's very simple: It's the funding.\"\nWhile international attention following the war with Israel brought some financial support for Lebanon in the conflict's immediate aftermath, the funding soon slowed.\nFor MAG, the organisation leading demining efforts in Lebanon, its work was necessarily laborious but sustainable in the initial years after the war.\nBut in 2011, the influx of Syrian refugees to Lebanon changed that.\n\"I thought that this would be an opportunity to clear up the ordnance, as the refugees are also affected. But no, we've started losing funding as a result,\" Shala told Al Jazeera.\nWith the highest per capita concentration of refugees in the world, Lebanon has been one of the focal points for humanitarian aid since 2011. Even though the relief effort is facing its own financing struggles, funding for projects that predate the Syrian war has been hit even harder.\n\"I think that the Syria refugee issue is being prioritised over everything else,\" Shala said. \"Although we are on the [UN's] Lebanese Cris"}

{"idx": "21969", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Nothing quite prepares you for the rough-cut diamond that is \"Precious.\" A rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, this shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story of an obese, illiterate, pregnant black Harlem teen circa 1987 is one that you hope will not be dismissed as too difficult, because it should not be missed.\n\"Precious: Based on the novel 'Push' by Sapphire\" will challenge you, but it will also move you as it rocks between the horrific realities and escapist fantasies of 16-year-old Claireece Precious Jones (impressive newcomer Gabourey Sidibe), with a life so besieged that a mother's rage and a father's rapes are what passes for love.\nAt first glance there is little that seems precious about Precious, whose 330 pounds and constant scowl is cross-the-street intimidating. But then filmmaker Lee Daniels, who is known for producing tough films on tough subjects -- \"Monster's Ball\" and \"The Woodsman\" among them -- is not about to go soft on this story.\n\"Push,\" poet/performance artist Sapphire's first novel, was a sensation when it landed in 1996 for its graphically told story of the verbal, physical and particularly the sexual abuse experienced by Precious, who narrates in such fractured English that at first it's like another language.\nWorking with screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher, Daniels has lightened the story a few shades by creating many fantasy sequences not found in the book, which is not to say they've made \"Precious\" easy to watch, just easier.\nIn a no-child-left-behind world, Precious was lost long before she could be left. No self-esteem to speak of, she tries for invisibility. At school it's easier, no one is really interested. At home, she's got a soul-destroying nightmare of a mother who has made Precious her project. Played to fearless and godless perfection by Mo'Nique, Mary spends her days in front of the TV while hurling a steady stream of invective -- along with the occasional frying pan -- in her daughter's direction.\nHope should not exist in all that despair, but Precious turns out to be an odds-defying storm that batters the emotions, shakes the soul and still manages to put a silver lining on the blackest of clouds in ways you might not have thought possible.\nWhen the school counselor discovers Precious is pregnant, the story begins its painful descent into the world of America's underclass. There is no safety net for Precious -- her family, social services and the educational system have all failed her.\nLike the book, the dialogue is graphic and politically incorrect. Precious' first child, a daughter, is called Little Mongo, because of her Down syndrome. When the teenager finds one of her teachers is a \"straight-up lesbian,\" she says so before going on to list all the things homosexuals haven't done to her. With Mary, meanwhile, it's not so much the words themselves that shock, though it sometimes seems her vocabulary doesn't extend beyond four-letter words, but the molten lava underneath them.\nFortunately for us, Precious has a very rich and playful imagination.

One recent survey estimated that 40 percent of biomedical papers by Chinese scholars were tainted by misconduct. Funding bodies there have in the past announced efforts to crack down on fraud, including clawing back money from scientists who cheat on their grants.\nWe\u2019ve long called for sterner treatment of science cheats, including the possibility of jail time \u2014 which, by the way, most Americans agree is appropriate. But we can\u2019t support the Chinese solution. Even if we didn\u2019t abhor the death penalty (which we do), the punishment here far outweighs the crime.\nYet if extremity in the name of virtue can be vice, it serves as reminder that science fraud is, simply put, fraud. And when it involves funding \u2014 taxpayer or otherwise \u2014 that fraud becomes theft. Think about it the same way as you would running a bogus investment fund or kiting checks. So, jail for major offenders \u2014 yes. Execution \u2014 no.\nOne objection to our position here might be that financial criminals typically don\u2019t kill anyone \u2014 directly, at least. If you drain my bank account or steal my 401(k), I\u2019m still alive. A scientist who cheats on a drug study could, at least in theory, jeopardize the health of the people who take that medication, with potentially fatal consequences.\nBut the reality is quite different. In the United States, at least, drug approvals hinge on data generated from many scientists or groups of researchers. They never rest on a single person. So unless everyone involved in a study is cheating, a fraudster\u2019s data would stick out if they strayed too much from the aggregate. Ironically, then, to succeed, a would-be fraudster would be most successful if they made their bogus results look like everyone else\u2019s \u2014 thus diluting their influence on the outcome of the trial.\nREAD NEXT: Should science fraudsters have to serve jail time?\nAnd stopping short of capital punishment, jail time for fraud would itself be a big change. According to our own research, only 39 scientists worldwide between 1975 and 2015 received criminal penalties for misdeeds somehow related to their work. However, some of those cases didn\u2019t involve research directly but instead related to incidental infractions, such as misusing funds, bribery, and even murder facilitated by access to cyanide.\nAnd in the United States, fewer than 2 percent of the 250-plus cases of misconduct over the same period reported by the Office of Research Integrity resulted in criminal sanctions. Most of the time, fraudsters earn temporary bans on federal research funding, with some dusting themselves off after a timeout and getting back in the game.\nSo there\u2019s room to strengthen penalties without taking the draconian step of invoking the death penalty. Some of that may requiring rewriting relevant statutes, to give agencies overseeing research funds more authority. And we acknowledge that not everyone thinks criminal sanctions are a good idea; some have said that such sanctions would only encourage fraudsters to double down on attempts at denial through lawyers, and might even dissuade colleagues from blowing the whistle. That\u2019s certainly possible, but it\u2019s not as though investigators\u2019 close rate is so high at this point anyway.\nThis article is reproduced with permission from STAT.

We are, if the stereotypes can be believed, exuberantly macho yet easily wounded, supremely capable but too often incompetent, highly rational and still somehow prone to emotional whims. Put all these qualities together and we can be, on occasion, a little exasperating.\nNone of this quite explains the sport of golf, but it does perhaps account for my wife\u2019s reaction when, as I strolled across a parking lot at McMenamins Edgefield, a 74-acre resort in the Portland suburb of Troutdale, I called her up and told I was about to play 12 holes.\nOnce, she might have been correct. For most of my life, I considered golf a pointless diversion for foolish, middle-aged men with no other outlet for amusement. Then, two years ago, I spent an afternoon in the Black Hills of South Dakota, whacking golf balls across a field with my friend Mike Ray, and something awakened in me. Golf, I realized, was not about forging business relationships or escaping from your family for a morning, but about rediscovering your inner 6-year-old \u2014 the one who likes to hit things with sticks, and hit them hard.\nStill, I despaired of ever golfing for real. Too expensive, I figured, and besides, what course would let an unskilled fool like me on the green?\nBut out in Portland, an old friend, Kirk Jones, suggested we take TriMet public transportation to Edgefield (2126 Southwest Halsey Street, Troutdale; 800-669-8610; www.mcmenamins.com). Once upon a time, this estate east of the city was the Multnomah County Poor Farm, where debtors were sent to raise livestock, grow fruit and vegetables and milk cows. In 1962, it was converted into a nursing home, and in 1990 it entered a new phase of life when it was purchased by McMenamins, a Pacific Northwest chain of almost 60 hotels, pubs and entertainment complexes that stretches across Oregon and into Washington.\nEdgefield is a microcosm of this empire: there\u2019s a cinema and an amphitheater-like lawn for concerts (Death Cab for Cutie, the Decemberists and Gipsy Kings are all playing this summer). The spa, Ruby\u2019s, has a popular soaking pool, and there\u2019s a glass-blowing workshop where I watched the fascinating process of turning raw glass into hideously ugly trinkets.\nAll of this is centered on the century-old Georgian-style manor house, where guests stay \u201cEuropean-style\u201d\u2014 that is, in cute, clean, affordable rooms with bathrooms down halls decorated with murals that illustrate the lives of the poor farm\u2019s former residents. My $50 single room was named for William Wallace, an elderly Portland ice cream vendor whose debts sent him to the farm back in 1913.\nFor me and Kirk, however, the fascinating history took a back seat to the par-3 golf courses that surround the manor. There are two threading through the estate\u2019s vineyards, vegetable gardens and outbuildings. Oddly, one has 12 holes, the other 20, but at $1 a hole, they\u2019re well within the budgetary reach of this Frugal Traveler.\nA golf trip to Edgefield invariably begins with a stop at the clubhouse,"}

Screen Rant learned that Disney was considering Blunt for Jungle Cruise only yesterday, but it's now being reported that the Edge of Tomorrow star has closed a deal to appear in the film opposite 'The Rock'. Johnson is starring in the movie as a 1920s riverboat captain who goes on a wild adventure across the world, after he teams up with a scientist (Blunt) in search of a magical cure.\nThe Johnson/Blunt pairing is a far cry from the duo of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen that Disney had originally announced for Jungle Cruise, back when an earlier iteration of the project was formally announced in 2011. That's far from the only change that the film has gone through over the past seven years, what with Jungle Cruise now being helmed by Jaume Collet-Serra (a filmmaker best known for having directed four different Liam Neeson action/thrillers) and drawing from a script that recently got a rewrite by one of the most prolific screenwriters in mainstream Hollywood at the moment.\nVariety is reporting that Blunt is now set to star opposite Johnson in Jungle Cruise, drawing from a script that Michael Green rewrote from an earlier draft penned by Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne (the uncredited writers on Star Trek Beyond). Production on Jungle Cruise is slated to get underway this May, with the filming locations including Disney's sound stages in Atlanta. UPDATE: Omega Underground is reporting that Jungle Cruise is also expected to shoot on location in Hawaii, with production taking place from May 7 through to August 17 under the working title Elixir.\nGreen is coming off a year in which he either wrote or cowrote no less than four (mostly acclaimed) films, including the grisly Wolverine drama Logan, the gory Alien prequel Alien Covenant, the moody Blade Runner sequel Blade Runner 2049, and the Agatha Christie adaptation Murder on the Orient Express. The writer also co-created the American Gods TV show for Starz and is now working on a script for the Orient Express sequel Death on the Nile, as well as the comic book TV show adaptation Y: The Last Man for FX.\nBlunt hasn't been slacking of late either and has a voice role in this March's animated sequel Sherlock Gnomes, as well as live-action roles in the horror/thriller A Quiet Place (which her husband John Krasinski directed and costars in) and Disney's upcoming sequel Mary Poppins Returns. Jungle Cruise also marks Blunt's third time collaborating with the Mouse House after her roles in the musicals Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns.\nAll things considered, Jungle Cruise is shaping up to be a worthwhile action/adventure, based on the creative talent involved on both sides of the camera here. Could this be the movie that finally gives Disney the new Pirates of the Caribbean-esque franchise it's spent the last several years trying to find, via would be franchise starters like John Carter and The Lone Ranger?\nJungle Cruise doesn't have an official release date yet. We will let you know when that changes."}

It also said it would reduce the number of smartphone models it would release in an effort to boost profits.\nQuestion marks have been raised over the future of Sony's smartphone business amid the Japanese giant's massive restructuring project, which has seen its personal computer arm and TV division being spun off.\nIn September, CEO Kazuo Hirai insisted to CNBC that Sony needed to remain in the smartphone business. However, at a briefing earlier this year, the company head said he would \"not rule out considering an exit strategy\" from the smartphone business.\nThis would have significant implications for the company, with analysts highlighting that such a move would see Sony lose a large part of its consumer-facing side of the brand.\nThe Xperia Z4 looks very similar to the previous Z3 model, but has an aluminium case. It has the same 20.7-megapixel rear-facing camera and comes in four different colours. Like many smartphone players, Sony is finding it difficult to differentiate on design, analysts said.\nThe phone will be available in Japan in the middle of the year, but Sony gave no further details on price, worldwide availability or a specific launch date. The company's mobile unit brought in 9.3 billion yen ($78 million) in operating income in the third quarter of 2014 -- making it one of the company's smallest units by that metric.\nThe latest device pits the Japanese electronics giant against rivals Apple and Samsung, following the latter's release of its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones. The high end of the market is dominated by these two players, while the mid-to-low end has seen the likes of Xiaomi become a major player. To date, Sony has been unable to get a solid foothold in any one of these segments.\nIn an effort to combat this, Sony released a mid-range smartphone called the Xperia M4 Aqua at Mobile World Congress in March, as an increasing number of consumers seek high-spec devices at lower price points.\nWith the Z4, Analysts said Sony was focusing on retaining its existing mobile customers.\n\"Sony appears to be focusing more on keeping the customers it already has versus trying to capture new customers,\" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight told CNBC by email.\n\"The Z4 will tick the boxes for customers that previously owned a Z-series device, but will be a tough sell to new customers given the dominance of the Apple iPhone and attractive new devices from Samsung, supported by an eye-watering marketing spend.\""}

She openly feuded with a fellow Liberal in the region, Pierre Gigu\u00e8re, who saw his riding of St-Maurice get merged into Laviolette, leaving him without a seat in the legislature.\nAt the time, Boulet said she was not planning to leave the riding for Gigu\u00e8re and would run again in the October election. Premier Philippe Couillard had to step in and say Boulet would be the candidate.\nOn Monday, Boulet changed her story, saying she has given it a lot of thought in recent weeks and decided she has given her all. She said she might have spoken a bit too soon when she said she would stay for another four years.\n\u201cToday, I can leave saying mission accomplished,\u201d she said.\nLater, commenting on her departure at a separate event, Couillard said it\u2019s clear now that the party owes Gigu\u00e8re a chance to run in the new riding, which is now called Laviolette-Saint-Maurice.\nThe Mauricie region will be a key battleground for the election with all the Liberal seats targets of the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec.\nBoulet said it was not a factor in her decision, but her brother, Jean Boulet, is expected to run for the CAQ in the neighbouring riding of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\nVery popular in the region, Boulet was first elected in 2001 and has served in various capacities including employment minister and transport minister.\nShe is a former president of the annual Festival Western de St-Tite.

Jerry Brown\u2019s new budget proposal includes a boost in funding that will have an impact on every student who is attending school in the Golden State. This increased investment in education, coupled with a state budget proposal that is nearly balanced, offers hope that our state is on a path toward economic stability if Gov. Brown and the Legislature will also address key issues that are holding back our economy.\nThe Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce is delighted to see an increase in appropriations for the California Community College, California State University, and University of California systems. We applaud the increase in Cal Grant funding levels to reflect increased participation by California Dream Act eligible students and Gov. Brown\u2019s commitment to limiting student fee increases.\nWe also commend Gov. Brown for putting forth a higher education agenda that is focused on improving the quality of California\u2019s higher education system with reforms to enhance the delivery of instruction and decrease the time it takes to complete a degree. As the sponsor of SB 1143, which led to the creation of the California Community College Student Success Taskforce, the Chamber is particularly supportive of alignment changes like the five-year phase-in of reforms to provide higher education with fiscal incentives to focus on the completion of a degree or certificate rather than enrollment alone.\nGov. Brown has recommended Proposition 98 funding of $56.2 billion for 2013-14, an increase of $2.7 billion over revised funding levels for the 2012-13 year. This new funding will allow districts to improve classroom instruction by expanding teaching and support personnel, and by investing in facilities and instructional materials.\nCalifornia was a leader in education for decades and it\u2019s time to rededicate ourselves to that same leadership role. We envision 2013-14 as the beginning of new investments in strengthening and restoring half a decade of cuts in education, early childhood and development programs. We pledge to Gov. Brown and the Legislature our support for the priorities included in his budget and we encourage our members to express their individual support as well. California\u2019s future is dependent on the quality of the education we are providing to the students in our schools. So too, is the future of the businesses that our members own and operate."}
{"idx": "21996", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country?\nI\u2019ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil.\nIn fact, the implication from this historically unusual tale is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan and his team have been doing such a great job cracking down on excessive deductions claims, especially from business. Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.\nIt\u2019s funny but we economists have been cheering the rapid improvement in the Budget, which is hovering close to surplus for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis. But such a present comes at a cost. It\u2019s hurting income growth in the hands of consumers, which has affected things like retail spending and business investment, so the economy has been growing slower than expected.\nEarlier this week, we hailed the latest fiscal headline, which was good news for the Government and showed that their taxman, Mr Jordan, was a real goer.\nThis is how CommSec\u2019s Craig James reported the turnaround for the Budget: \u201cIn the twelve months to November 2018, the Budget deficit stood at $1,816 million (less than 0.2 per cent of GDP) and down from the $2,345 million deficit in the year to October.\nThis RBA concern that the taxman is doing too good a job was relayed to us at the recent Housing Industry Association conference by the Assistant Governor of the RBA, Luci Ellis.\nThe AFR reports that Ms Ellis said taxes paid by households increased by 8%, while gross income going to households was up by only 3.5%. And as wages growth is 2% at best, you can understand that the ATO, along with energy companies, is making it harder for Aussies to shop until they drop!\nThrow in the tougher lending standards imposed on banks, which are hitting property investors and small businesses pretty hard, and you can understand why the Oz economy is slowing down.\nThis sets up the Government next week to be able to give us tax cuts that won\u2019t simply be seen as an election giveaway or bribe. It also means that Labor\u2019s Bill Shorten can even top the Government in his Budget reply and eventual pitch to voters before the May poll.\nHowever, Bill has to seriously think about the timing of his economy-hurting measures, such as changes to negative gearing, imposing a higher minimum wage (which he\u2019s calling a \u201cliving wage\u201d), taking away income from retirees who live on tax refunds from franking credits and any other policy that might have looked acceptable in a strong economy.\nThat\u2019s what impressive future leaders would say now. I hope they\u2019re up for it.\nHome > The Experts > Peter Switzer > Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country?"}
