It was a source of livelihood for fishermen, a fortuitous space for pirates, a bridge to other countries for travellers, merchants, diplomats, and armies.\nPeople were constantly aware of the risk that travelling by sea involved. They feared corsair attacks and the aggression of unknown species lurking in the depths.\nYet no threat was worse than the possibility of experiencing a terrible storm where the sea turned into a formidable voracious colossus which could engulf whatever and whoever dared to face its deadly rage.\nPeople in distress were generally left to deal with their own fate. Ironically it was often faith which led to their survival.\nHistorical sources describe how people created ingenious ways of dealing with these dangers by formulating different ways to guarantee a safer voyage, habitually intermingling religion with superstition.\nOne of these practices in Malta involved the production of sacred coins which could be thrown into the sea to calm down the troubled waters. Indeed, sailors were urged to buy these coins, which were made out of blessed white candle, a day before Easter, since failure to do so was believed to bring bad luck. On the other hand, local fishermen are known to have written a secret prayer which only the eldest of them knew and which only they could recite in order to protect their boat from the threat of bad weather.\nAlthough hundreds of years have passed from these experiences, nowadays we still have the opportunity to witness the ordeal that our ancestors went through while out at sea. We have many of these testimonies in the form of ex-voto paintings, which show the eventful moments of people in distress at sea saved by their faith.\nSadly, although we have lost many of these ex-voto paintings along the years, mainly due to improper storage and poor conservation methods, we still find various examples in numerous chapels, churches, sanctuaries and museums around the island. Among these, we find 183 maritime ex-voto paintings in the sanctuary of Our Lady of Tal-\u0126erba in Birkirkara, and another 64 in the sanctuary of Our Lady in Mellie\u0127a.\nAnother interesting collection of ex-voto paintings is found at the \u017babbar Sanctuary Museum. Unfortunately, from the original collection of 300 maritime ex-voto paintings, today only 85 remain. However, as \u0120u\u017ceppi Theuma, Secretary of the \u017babbar Sanctuary Museum Commission tells me, the museum is proud to possess the oldest maritime ex-voto painting in Malta, but which as yet is still undated. The next dated ex-voto painting in this collection goes back to 1631, as the inscription on the painting clearly shows. Moreover, this particular painting manifests the full interpretation of the initials V.F.G.A., which is generally found on these paintings. These letters stand for Votum Fecit et Gratiam Accepit, which means, \u201ca promise was made and grace was given\u201d.\nEx-voto paintings vary in style and artistry, since they cover various periods of time and also because they were donated by people from different levels of society and not everyone could afford to engage the best painters.

Bid too little and you lose out to a rival. Bid too much and you take a bath on the deal \u2014 and likely earn a prompt, derisive slap to your stock price as soon as you announce it.\nThe main challenge is figuring out how much the target firm is worth. Of course, any business valuation is fraught with uncertainty. But when it comes to acquisitions, that risk is compounded by information asymmetry: The target firm usually knows more about its own market and assets than the would-be buyer does.\nTo find out, she and Stephen Stubben of the University of Utah analyzed more than 2,400 deals between 1990 and 2010, measuring stock appreciation for buyers and sellers as an indicator of the profitability for each side. Their study found that when a target firm has high-quality financials, the acquirer benefits \u2014 although at the expense of the target\u2019s shareholders.\nFor entrepreneurs dreaming of a lucrative buyout, is good accounting actually bad business?\nIn any merger, the combination of two companies is supposed to be worth more than the sum of the parts. That would be true, for instance, if they can share overhead, thus lowering overall cost. The value of such synergies is the total benefit of the deal, to be divided between the two sets of shareholders. How the pie is carved, however, is determined by the deal price.\n\u201cThe acquiring company should pay no more than the value of the target firm plus the synergies,\u201d McNichols says. The target firm, of course, would accept nothing less than its own stand-alone value, though it usually has a higher reservation price below which it won\u2019t sell. Within those limits, there\u2019s a range of mutually acceptable prices favoring each side in varying degrees.\nThe problem is, acquiring firms can only guess where the limits are because they don\u2019t know how much the target\u2019s assets are really worth. That they often get it wrong and pay too much, at least in the judgment of the stock market, is well documented: The dirty little secret of mergers is that the acquiring company is often likely to lose value after the deal is announced.\nGood accounting information mitigates that effect. By reducing uncertainty, it lets suitors estimate the target firm\u2019s value more precisely and bid closer to its reservation price.\nTo test their prediction, the researchers had to solve the tricky problem of grading the quality of financial statements. Trying to evaluate each firm\u2019s accounting decisions would be impractical, but they realized they could do it empirically, by measuring how well its numbers in one year predict cash flows in subsequent years.\nStubben offers a simple example: \u201cTake an industry that\u2019s inherently volatile, where sales vary wildly from one period to the next. Looking only at that, an outside investor would have a hard time guessing what next year\u2019s revenue will be.\u201d But the companies themselves have private information; for instance, their sales reps might report that demand is weakening.\nSo the researchers devised a two-stage analysis: First, they ran statistical regressions of target-firm cash flows on prior accounting data to gauge the quality of their accounting. Then they looked at stock returns for targets and acquirers at the time the deals were announced and regressed them against accounting quality and a slew of control variables, including market risk and firm characteristics.\nThe results are striking: From 1990 to 2010, the average"}

He was also referring to renewed efforts by China to restore its protected wetlands.\nChina and Africa since 2015 have been working on intensifying the production of energy and natural resources throughout the continent. Last year, at a summit the two sides agreed to figure out ways to make it more green.\nBut Sebunya said Europe stands out more as a natural partner with Africa in terms of shared culture, language, history and religion, when compared to China.\n\"How many Europeans are Africans on the continent? What a huge advantage compared to China who is coming to the continent with no ties,\" he said.\nUltimately, Sebunya said it was up to Africa to determine its own path, noting that some 70 percent of the population is under 30 and that investment in its leadership is paramount.\nHis comments hinge on a renewed emphasis from Europe to engage with Africa, amid global jockeying of the continent.\nThey also follow a two-day ministerial meeting in Brussels between the EU and Africa as part of larger effort to further secure a continent-to-continent partnership.\nThat meeting was a follow-up of an Africa-EU summit some 14 months ago in the Ivory Coast's capital city, Abidjan, where youth had been a central theme.\nYouth organisations that at the time had been scheduled to talk at the summit were sidelined, prompting rounds of criticism from civil society.\nThe biggest outcome in Abidjan instead appeared to have focused on migration and joint-efforts to evacuate trapped migrants in Libya following TV reports of open-air slave markets.\n\"Migration is probably the field where our cooperation has produced the most striking results since last year,\" said the EU's foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini, also last week.\nThe EU wants cooperation with Africa to expand beyond migration in what it describes as a partnership of equals.\n\"We are ready to work together to turn all of our bilateral agreements into a continent to continent free trade agreement,\" said Mogherini.\nPart of those EU efforts is to make private investments in Africa less risky.\nAfrica has since announced its own efforts to create an African continental free trade area before the end of the year.\n\"It is a continent that has come of age and partnership that needs to come of age,\" said Richard Sezibera, co-chair of the African Union."}

The short answer is \"yes.\" When it released its third-quarter earnings report, Welltower confirmed that its quarterly dividend will rise by a penny per share in 2017. However, since Welltower recently announced a major repositioning of its portfolio, the question of whether another increase will be announced in 2017 or not becomes a bit more interesting.\nWelltower recently announced a $0.87 quarterly dividend rate for 2017, which translates to a yield of 5.5% based on the share price as of this writing. The November 2016 dividend payment represents the company's 182nd quarterly payment in a row.\nAs far as dividend increases go, Welltower has a solid, but not flawless, record. There have been a few occasions when the dividend was reduced or kept the same, as you can see in the chart below. However, it's important to mention that even when including the bad years, Welltower's dividend has been increased at a 5.7% annualized rate over the past 45 years, an impressive track record.\nCAGR = compound annualized growth rate. Image source: Welltower investor presentation.\nWhat's more, Welltower's current payout represents just 76% of the company's expected funds from operations, or FFO, for 2016. This implies that even if Welltower's profits don't rise at all from the current level, there is significant room to raise the payout in 2017 and subsequent years.\nAlong with its third-quarter earnings report, Welltower announced a major repositioning of its portfolio, which includes an expected $3.3 billion worth of property dispositions during the fourth quarter.\nThe plan is to sell $1.9 billion of long-term and post-acute-care properties, following the healthcare REIT industry trend away from healthcare properties heavily reliant on government reimbursement programs and toward private-pay assets. For example, fellow healthcare REIT HCP, Inc. (NYSE:HCP) recently spun off its long-term-care properties into a newly created REIT known as Quality Care Properties with a similar goal in mind. In addition, the company is disposing of $1.2 billion worth of senior-housing properties as part of the $3.3 billion total.\nIt's easy to understand why Welltower is doing this. For one thing, $1.7 billion of the properties are operated by Genesis Healthcare, and Welltower wants to diversify its tenant base. The move will also take Welltower's private-pay revenue mix to 92.4% of the total, up from 89.4%, and will drop the company's leverage ratio from 39.5% to 34.4%, adding to its financial flexibility.\nWhile I applaud this move, from a dividend-increase standpoint, the obvious concern is that this reduces the number of properties generating income for Welltower. Without examining the income Welltower generates from each individual property in its portfolio, a quick estimate is that the $3.3 billion in properties set for disposal represent about 8% of Welltower's total enterprise value.

FBI bomb experts said the amounts in the Aldawsari case would have yielded almost 15 pounds of explosives - about the same amount used per bomb in the London subway attacks that killed scores of people in July 2005.Aldawsari entered the U.S. in October 2008 from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to study chemical engineering at Texas Tech, then transferred in early 2011 to nearby South Plains College, where he was studying business.

The Boston Celtics learned this lesson early on, as they watched both Kevin Garnett and Jermaine O\u2019Neal collect technical fouls during the preseason after reacting to a referee\u2019s whistle, or lack thereof.\nA recent matchup between the Lakers and Suns saw a perfect example of this system. Forward Lamar Odom was fouled by Hedo Turkoglu as he was going in for a layup in the final minutes of the fourth quarter. The referees missed the call, but didn\u2019t miss Odom\u2019s loud reaction and served him with a technical that sent Steve Nash to the line. The momentum was lost for the Lakers, and they went on to lose the game by five points.\nIn Boston, a Lakers loss is normally celebrated, but this incident goes beyond the time-honored rivalry. Is the referee\u2019s elevated authority affecting the game? How do you think the refereeing has gone so far this season in the NBA?\nYou could see the positive side of this recent decision by Stern, since a player\u2019s reaction \u2014 which can be obnoxious to watch \u2014 can have a drag effect on a game. That effect was one of the primary reasons behind Stern\u2019s new rule.\nOr you could see the negative side of the decision, which pertains to the heightened level of authority given to the refs. Sure, they\u2019re in charge of calling the game, but giving out a technical \u2014 which then results in a free throw \u2014 after every complaint is just as time consuming.\nThen there\u2019s the issue of ticky-tack fouls, which seem to be worsening with every season. Stern\u2019s \u201cRespect the Game\u201d movement seems to be triggering more whistles than ever before, leading to a longer lag during the game than a player complaining about a call.\nBasketball is a game of movement, transition and speed, and slowing it down to avoid a few hissy fits seems like a counterproductive move.\nWhat do you think about the NBA referees this season?

Since Nutmeg usually only soars on Saturdays and Sundays, good weather during the week is worse than useless\u2014it's a cruel taunt.\nBut blue skies are what we had all week, and finally I couldn't bear it. On Wednesday I emailed Jeff Driscoll, my instructor and asked if he felt any inclination to chuck work and meet me Friday morning. Hallelujah: He agreed. My quest for my gliding certificate was back in gear.\nWe both got to the airport right at 9am, and sat down on the clubhouse porch to review all the things I have to know for the oral part of the examination\u2014rules of thumb for figuring out how fast to fly in a headwind, the difference between an \"accident\" and an \"incident\" when making a report to the FAA, and a hundred tips and procedures for flying better and more safely. By noon, we'd covered a lot of the material I'd have to know for the oral part of my certification exam, and the day was looking better and better, with fluffy cumulus starting to pop in the blue sky over the field. The wind was also starting to pick up, and the windsock shifted and lifted, indicating a ten knot breeze coming from the west.\nJeff helped me take the canopy cover off the Schweitzer 2-33 and we used a golf cart to pull it down the eastern end of the field. The wind was blowing briskly now, which in a sense was good\u2014it would mean we'd need less of the runway in order to lift off\u2014but it also promised turbulence, especially at low level, as the air moving over the tree tops got stirred around like a stream passing over rough cobbles. Sure enough, we had a wild ride as we climbed up to altitude, with the tow plane bucking and dropping as it plunged through lift or sink, and us in the glider following suit as we passed through the same patch of air a few seconds later.\nIt had been a couple of weeks since I flew in a glider, and it had been even longer since I'd flown the sluggish (but bulletproof) 2-33, and I felt like I'd lost all finesse. As Jeff asked me to run through some of the maneuvers I'd be expected to perform on the check ride, the aircraft didn't respond as I expected to, and I constantly had to try to correct small mistakes. The thermals weren't on my side, either. As I searched through the sky looking for lift, all I found was varying degrees of sink.\nThen we hit it. Boom! The aircraft shook and the variometer tweaked up to a 400-feet-per-minute climb. I banked into a turn, lost the lift, then got it again. Around and around and around I went, fighting to keep the airspeed constant and the turn level, around and around and around. Before long we were up above the height at which we had released from the tow plane.\nNow that we had lots of altitude, we also had lots of time to practice maneuvers. One of the more pulse-raising ones that Jeff had me do was entering spins. In a spin, one of the wings stalls before the other, causing the glider to plummet toward the ground nose first, rotating as it falls.

Gov. Newsom should order regulators to shut it down immediately.\nOn the campaign trail, Gov. Newsom also expressed opposition to \u201cfracking and other unsafe oil operations.\u201d Fracking, along with other forms of extreme extraction, like cyclic steam injection or acidizing, sends a high-pressure, toxic chemical soup underground, putting California\u2019s precious aquifers at risk. Families living near this dangerous drilling have been sounding the alarm for years because they are concerned that their water is being contaminated by carcinogens like benzene.\nThese frontline families urgently need courageous action from the governor. He can start by taking sensible action to protect families from the health dangers of conventional drilling. This means instituting a 2,500-foot buffer zone between oil drilling operations and sensitive areas like homes and schools. Such action would be life-changing for thousands of Angelenos who live just a few hundred feet \u2013 or less \u2013 from active oil wells.\nStatewide, there are nearly 8,500 active oil wells within 2,500 feet of sensitive sites like homes, schools and hospitals. A safety buffer zone is a good first step the governor can take on the way to banning harmful practices like fracking and phasing out all drilling.\nFinally, Gov. Newsom can show true climate leadership by keeping his promise and announcing a plan to move California off fossil fuels. If he set his sights on 2030 as a deadline, he would be in line with scientific consensus and national calls for a Green New Deal.\nGov. Newsom\u2019s plan should ensure that renewable energy is truly clean, which means solar, wind, geothermal and existing hydroelectric. His plan must not include dangerous nuclear power or dirty energy sources like biogas and biomass. It must also include a fair and just transition for workers and affected communities. This includes the development of renewable energy in low-income communities, as well as programs to transition the state\u2019s existing fossil fuel workforce and members of underserved communities to good green jobs.\nGov. Newsom has all the authority he needs to take these urgent steps now. If L.A. can move off fossil fuels onto renewable energy, all of California can follow. The future of our state \u2013 and our world \u2013 demands big vision and bigger courage."}

The vast majority of them had nothing to do with Enron Corp., the lucrative Andersen client that turned out to be a cesspool of financial fraud, but they were sent to the unemployment line.\nIn 2005, theU.S. Supreme Courtoverturned the guilty verdict against Andersen, criticizing the government's prosecution of the case. By then, it was far too late to put the firm back together.\nThe fallout from Andersen's demise changed how the Justice Department tackled white-collar crime. Instead of prosecuting companies like Andersen, \"deferred prosecution\" became the standard response to wrongdoing at going concerns. Those agreements enable companies to avoid indictments \u2014 for many the equivalent of corporate death penalties \u2014 in exchange for cooperation and reform. They work like probation without the guilty finding.\nThat's far better for innocent employees, who don't necessarily become collateral damage. But there's a question about whether the Justice Department as a result of the Andersen case got gun-shy about prosecuting corporate leaders who are guilty of wrongdoing.\nWhat's often forgotten is how a once-proud firm found itself at the mercy of federal prosecutors in the first place.\nIn the beginning, Andersen was a watchdog. Founder Arthur Andersen made the firm's name stand for something nearly a century ago, when he refused a client's demand to approve a ledger that falsely inflated profits. For decades thereafter, an auditing opinion from Andersen was the gold standard for corporate books and records. If Andersen said the numbers were solid, then investors, bankers, regulators and the public at large could count on it.\nOver time, greed corrupted Andersen. Its leaders became more devoted to collecting hefty fees than keeping books straight. Clients paid a fortune for Andersen's consulting services, making its basic function of auditing into little more than an afterthought. The firm's most experienced accounting technicians, the sticklers who maintained its principles, saw their status plunge in the partnership's hierarchy. As Enron ran wild, Andersen's Professional Standards Group proved too weak to intervene. Money had trumped honest services.\nEnron's executives were able to lie about their business performance and prospects because Andersen went along. When the lies caught up with its client, instead of admitting its failure to safeguard the public trust, Andersen engaged in a cover-up. Its employees shredded not just a few Enron-related documents, but box after box, day after day, for a period of weeks.\nThe Enron debacle followed a series of debacles at Andersen, which had bungled audits atWaste Management Inc.and Colonial Realty Co., to name but two prior scandals that cost investors dearly.

Cubans, like everywhere in the world, first and foremost highlight events of the outgoing year.\nFor example, the official Granma daily reviewed major events or accomplishments of 2017. Domestically it was the successes in the health sector. Internationally, among others,it was the ongoing efforts in favour of Latin American/Caribbean integration and cooperation such as ALBA, the Venezuelan resistance and the Trump move to recognize Jerusalem. While the youth communist daily Juventud Rebelde hailed the 70,000 youth participating in voluntary work, and the international Youth and Student Festival in Sochi, it also did deal with 2018. It pledged to focus on the 90th anniversary of Che\u2019s birthday, June 14. The revolutionary youth, through its prestigious regular contributor Graziella Pologotti, wrote that one of the peaks for 2018 will be the 150th anniversary of the October 10 1868 revolt against Spain as the precursor of the 1959 triumph. This piece was reprinted on Cuba Debate. The workers\u2019 weekly Trabajadores featured a special front page contribution by the president of the Instituto de Historia de Cuba, Rene Gonz\u00e1lez Barrientos. He painted a picture of all the 1868 focal points while suggesting that the 2018 climax will be the commemoration of the 1868 initiation of the Manuel de C\u00e9spedes-led rebellion for independence and the eventual end of slavery. The historian provided readers many of the memorable features of the War of Independence. In my telephone discussions with Cuban friends on the 31st of December and January 1st regarding 2018, they manifested a desire that the revolutionary tradition continues.\nThus, looking at 2018 from the perspective of the Cuban Revolution, while the April 19 new legislature that will among other important responsibilities also elect the new president will constitute but one more event in its long history going back to 1868 and since then to 1959. By asserting this, does mean that I am underestimating the historical significance of April 19, 2018? No. However, this stance allows us to prepare for a new ideological and political offensive against the Cuba Revolution.\nWhat is the content of this? We saw a preview of this in December last year. Ra\u00fal Castro, in the habitual closing session speech to the last session of the current legislature, notified in almost casual ways that the convocation of the new legislature and thus the election of the next president has been postponed to April 19 when Ra\u00fal will not be seeking a new mandate. However, he dealt with in some detail (the length depending on the theme), with many topics that normally whet the appetite of the international mainstream media: Irma recovery successes and challenges, municipal elections voter turnout results, foreign debt payments,"}

So I think I&apos;m ... too aware of my body, so it feels like my words and my body sometimes separate and they don&apos;t mesh together.\nI think I first started talking about anxiety and depression in my work as sort of a way to write myself out of my own head. Like, it was at a time when I was sort of in a rut and struggling with them in a real way, so I was feeling creatively blocked, and I was like, \"Well, if this is all that&apos;s going on with you right now, maybe just try writing about that.\"\nSadness and laughter to me feel linked in a weird way, in that it almost feels like once you get to the end of one, you sort of start entering the other one.

As Dame Sally Davies poignantly highlighted in your report (Experts issue new warning on overuse of antibiotics, 27 March), \u201cthe importance of clean water, sanitation and vaccination must not be forgotten to avoid infections occurring in the first place\u201d. This point, alongside the critical role of hygiene, is absolutely key.\nThis is already a global health emergency, with 844 million people lacking access to clean water and 2.3 billion without safe, private toilets. In developing nations almost 40% of healthcare facilities do not have a water supply, 19% do not provide adequate sanitation and 35% do not have soap and water to sustain good hygiene practices. Without these basics in place, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings becomes almost impossible. So it is no surprise that hospital-acquired infections are the third major driver of antimicrobial resistance globally.\nDiarrhoea, pneumonia and cholera are often preventable through basic improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. When they strike, the pathogens that cause these infections are commonly treated with antibiotics, and are becoming increasingly resistant to available drugs.\nAntibiotic use to prevent diarrhoea could be cut by 60% in India, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil simply by improving people\u2019s access to water and sanitation, and improving hygiene behaviours. Disease outbreaks are harder to control when sanitation is poor and there is no clean water.\nYet progress on delivering water, sanitation and hygiene is too slow, and not sufficiently threaded throughout the efforts to tackle this looming antibiotic crisis. World decision-makers must acknowledge the pivotal role that water, sanitation and hygiene play in preventing infection and reducing the spread of resistant pathogens, before the next global health crisis hits. Investment in all three elements of water, sanitation and hygiene must be prioritised, and coordinated with other efforts to address the rise of antimicrobial resistance, globally, nationally and locally.\nAs the old adage goes, prevention is better than cure. Never have those words been more true and more urgent.\n\u2022 Your report makes a strong case for concern about the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. But it ignores the elephant in the room \u2013 or rather, the pig and the chicken. The developed world still uses a lot more antibiotics than developing countries, and the vast majority of these are fed to animals on factory farms. Though not taking antibiotics for a sore throat can help extend the usefulness of current antibiotics, changing the way we produce meat is much more important.\nPlant-based meat from new cutting-edge companies like Beyond Meat and Moving Mountains is both delicious and sustainable, and doesn\u2019t require any antibiotics. And clean meat \u2013 actual animal meat grown outside of the animal, with no antibiotics necessary \u2013 is rapidly approaching price competitiveness, thanks to the efforts of companies like Memphis Meats.\nMoving quickly to plant-based and clean meat is the best thing we can do to avoid pandemics of antibiotic-resistant superbugs."}

One more helpful tip; don\u2019t wear all black or all white and limit patterns.\nThere\u2019s nothing better than a great backdrop but where to start?

At that point, it\u2019s best to ask your family what background they would like the most. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that while the backdrop is an integral component of your family photos, you don\u2019t want it to be too busy and take away from the most important part of the photo: your family.\n3. Don\u2019t be afraid to get a little creative \u2014 and have some fun!\nWagner says it\u2019s good to capture serious photos with people posing and smiling but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get a little creative, too. Why not add some props or action shots? \u201cIt\u2019s good to get the serious shots out of the way first and then you can get silly and have some fun,\u201d she says. Some of the best photos are during candid moments and when families are enjoying themselves, laughing and having fun, there is more opportunity for these special moments to be caught on camera. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to laugh and joke.

{"idx": "38044", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Given a large fortune by one lover, Harriet Howard ditched him and used it to help her new lover return to France, get elected president, and fund the coup that made him emperor.\nPARIS\u2014There are several different ways to look at Harriet Howard, who was born in 1823 as Elizabeth Ann Haryett, a boot maker\u2019s daughter in England, and died in 1865 as the Comtesse de Beauregard in France.\nHarriet Howard may have been looked at as a courtesan, a mistress, a dazzling hostess, even a fallen woman, but one of her lovers made her fabulously rich, and with her money she made another lover the Emperor of France.\nShe was one of those people who stood out from her early surroundings as brilliantly as a pink diamond on green baize. Her parents were comfortable, puritanical provincials in Norfolk, England, who wanted her to read the Bible and stitch embroidery. But from an early age \u201cLittle Bess\u201d became a very accomplished equestrian (and this at a time when women rode sidesaddle so as not to compromise their certifiable virtue). She was also a voracious reader, especially of poetry, and particularly of Shakespeare. As a girl she wanted desperately to go on stage, and at the age of 15 ran away to London with that in mind.\nBut she must have known, even in her middle teens, she had enormous powers of attraction. She was becoming that rare \u201ckept woman\u201d who kept her men, at least as long as she wanted them.\nWe have no direct account of Howard\u2019s skills in bed, but in the mid-19th century, when many a lady was afflicted with the vapors and shrank from physical activities of any kind, Howard was remarkably fit and energetic. She was a passionate devotee not only of riding but of hunting, and the first man she lived with, who kept her in considerable opulence from the time she was 15, was a famous jockey who had once won the Grand National, England\u2019s most famous steeplechase.\nGiven the course of Harriet Howard\u2019s career, it\u2019s hard to imagine her as the very passive character, and sometimes the scheming but ignorant lady of low virtue, sketched in numerous histories. It seems more likely she knew how to teach her high-headed colts their manners. But there\u2019s only one more or less authoritative account of her life, and while it tries to be corrective, it\u2019s not, or at least not quite.\nBooks about daring women who enjoyed their lovers and shattered norms were potential bestsellers, but had to squeeze into the space between prurience and prudery.

This development poses a latent existential threat to both Russia and China because of the US\u2019 obvious intent to preemptively neutralize their nuclear second-strike deterrents and indefinitely coerce them into strategic concessions through nuclear blackmail afterwards. Understandably, both Great Powers are now compelled to counter this development, and while they might be able to do so creatively and on the cheap to a certain extent (especially if they combine their efforts), it\u2019s nevertheless unavoidable that they\u2019ll have to pour enormous financial resources into most of their responses.\nRussia is comparatively less capable of committing huge sums of money to this over the long term than China is, and therein lays the structural vulnerability that the US will seek to exploit in its risky gambit. President Putin promised in his reelection campaign nearly a year ago that the focus of his fourth and final term in office would be on revitalizing the Russian economy, having assured his compatriots that their nation\u2019s defense is now secured after revealing their country\u2019s hypersonic missile advancements at the end of a keynote speech. It was strongly implied that some of the billions of dollars that have been invested in the military over the past few years would be rerouted into public works projects and other socio-economic endeavors to retain Russia\u2019s competitiveness in the emerging Multipolar World Order, but now Trump is threatening those plans by forcing Moscow to participate in the New Arms Race.\nThe US\u2019 ultimate strategic gambit can therefore go one of two ways \u2013 in the \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario for America, Russia doubles down on its military-industrial commitments and the strategic partnership with China even if it can\u2019t afford the costs and ultimately ends up as a \u201cjunior partner\u201d to the People\u2019s Republic by the time everything is over, while the \u201cbest-case\u201d scenario sees Moscow \u201ccompromising\u201d with Washington in some respect or another in order to relieve the US\u2019 military pressure on Russia and allow the country to refocus on revitalizing its domestic economy in exchange for decelerating the pace of its strategic convergence with China. The latter scenario is actually \u201cWhat The US Really Wants From Russia\u201d, as the author wrote last spring, and it\u2019s now clear that the New Arms Race is a risky means to that possible end.\nThe decision was evidently made a year or two ago to go forward with this plan, and everything that the US has done since then has been an attempt to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d the strategic situation in this direction.

{"idx": "38057", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Was the Czechoslovak economic reform successful? There is no simple answer to this seemingly simple question. The preceding section showed that in spite of many delays caused by opposing conservative forces, the reform movement succeeded in dismantling the command system in all important economic areas. It was also highly successful in convincing the Czechoslovak society - including the ruling elite - of the superiority of market socialism. In the years 1967-9 this idea was generally accepted and the first practical steps leading to the revival of the market were accomplished. It is, of course, possible that this process would not have continued smoothly and that the reform would have been reversed even without the invasion.\nThere are at least two reasons, however, for believing that such a development would have been very unlikely. First, the experience of Yugoslavia and Hungary shows that reform may continue uninterrupted in the absence of direct foreign interference. Secondly, the aversion to the Soviet-type command economy and the determination of Czechs and Slovaks to disassociate themselves from it were extremely strong. Even in the post-invasion political situation it took three years before the idea of reform was abandoned and the command system finally rebuilt. Judged purely by the internal situation, it is possible to say with a certain degree of confidence that the Czechoslovak economic reform would very likely have been successful in transforming command system into market socialism. How well the new system would have worked is another matter.\nIt is nevertheless true that in a broader sense both the economic and political reforms were unsuccessful. They failed because the Czechoslovak reformers went too far without recognizing the limits imposed on them by 'international realities' and consequently provoke invasion of the Warsaw Pact armies.\nIt is not very difficult to understand why Soviet leaders decided to crush the Czechoslovak Spring. Less obvious are the reasons which led to the internal success of the reform. They will be discussed in the following two sections."}

A popular theory is that Rey will build herself a double-sided lightsaber using the kyber crystal and broken pieces from her old one.\nA double-sided lightsaber is a perfect progression from a staff, her weapon of choice before she ever picked up a lightsaber. It fuses the weapon of her past with her future as a Jedi.\nRey also happens to possess the sacred Jedi texts, which surely contain helpful information on how to build a lightsaber.\nBeing a talented mechanic will also come in handy as she constructs her new weapon.\nAfter Finn's defection in The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren asserted during a heated conversation with General Hux that Supreme Leader Snoke and the First Order would be better served by a clone army than by Stormtroopers.\nTheir inability to capture BB-8 on Jakku and Captain Phasma's failures on Starkiller Base and the Supremacy will have done nothing to change Kylo's mind about the First Order's soldiers.\nNow that Kylo is the Supreme Leader, he can make his wish come true by replacing the Stormtroopers with clones.\nA significant enough time jump between The Last Jedi and Episode IX could allow the Stormtroopers to be phased out and completely replaced by clones, the opposite of the Empire's quick transition from clones to Stormtroopers after Revenge of the Sith.\nThe Poe Dameron comics have caught up to the current timeline of the sequel trilogy, even showing Leia and the other Resistance survivors aboard the Millennium Falcon directly following The Last Jedi.\nThe issue Poe Dameron #27 depicts Leia as"}

{"idx": "38069", "prompt": "Continue the following text: This is the first of two editorials on consecutive days concerning the underfunded state employees' pension system and the steps necessary to repair it.\nApproaching the 2009 fiscal year, Connecticut's Democratic-controlled legislature and its Republican governor, M. Jodi Rell, faced a worsening fiscal outlook. Gov. Rell didn't want to raise taxes to fix it. Democrats did not want to cut programs.\nInstead, they mortgaged the future - again.\nBetween fiscal years 2009 to 2011, the state deferred paying $315 million into the pension plan for state employees, according to numbers provided by the current administration. The legislature and Gov. Rell did this despite knowing the pension plan was grossly underfunded and that putting off the payments would make the situation worse and end up costing taxpayers more in the end.\nThis has been the sorry history of pension plans in Connecticut and in many other states, a legacy of trading short-term gain - avoiding tax increases, increasing spending and mollifying state labor unions - for long-term pain. Because in the long term, when the inability to meet promised pension obligations becomes too obvious and immediate to ignore, someone else would be running for office. So went the mindset.\nThis was certainly apparent in the mid-1990s when Republican Gov. John G. Rowland reached a deal with state employee unions to lower state investments in the pension system. The approach held the lid on taxes, but it was not remotely prudent fiscally. The numbers only worked because of unrealistic balloon payments cooked into the deal about 35 years later - $3.3 billion in 2029 and $4.5 billion in 2030 - the latter number more than half the entire budget at the time Gov. Rowland struck the pension agreement.\nA 2012 state report estimated that decisions to reduce pension contributions below actuarial requirements have totaled about $1 billion since the late 1990s.\nAs outlined today in the first of a three-part series on the state's troubled pension system by Day Staff Writer Johanna Somers, the list of causes for the awful state of affairs is long. Retired Connecticut state employees receive the highest pension payments in the nation, but make employee contributions below the national average. Those in many state occupations can retire younger than can workers in the private sector, meaning pension pay stretches out longer. Overtime pay in closing years of service boosts the pay numbers on which the state bases pension payments.\nThe result is that as of 2012 the Connecticut State Employees' Retirement System was funded at 42.3 percent, roughly half of the 80 percent expected of a reasonably healthy pension plan, leaving Connecticut behind only Illinois in terms of underfunding pensions.\nTo his credit, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, after his election in November 2010, did take steps to improve the situation. A renegotiated contract with state unions increased the retirement eligibility age for many state employees. It terminated former agreements that allowed the state to contribute less than actuaries recommend. It also requires all state employees to pay into their retiree health care fund.\nThe governor and legislature set up a state pension contribution plan that eliminates the balloon payments created in the Rowland years and, theoretically at least, would reach the 80 percent goal of ratio to assets around 2025.\nYet the rosy outlook is dubious. State contributions into the pension plan are set at $1.27 billion"}

It would appear that, here, the transition is the trick to this,\" Alexander said.\nDIRDC executive director, portfolio coordination, and research, Gayle Milnes, responded by saying the future success of autonomous vehicles in Australia will come down to the interplay of different technologies and how they will play out, rather than explicitly infrastructure.\n\"Infrastructure Victoria have done some very good work around these issues, looking at possible futures ... and how the mix of shared vehicles versus privately owned vehicles, automated vehicles, not-so autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and hydrogen vehicles might play together,\" she explained.\n\"They do draw some conclusions from that. There are some things that seem to be actions that you could take now that would be 'no regrets' like certain maintenance of roads and common road signing, et cetera.\"\nWhere planning is concerned, Milne said there is also the option of developing a range of different environments and different policy options or tools, such as lane preferencing, and that it isn't just the infrastructure element.\n\"The solution for Melbourne, for example, could be quite different to the solution for a regional centre like Wagga, for example. So it is likely that we are going to have to see how those different technologies play out or anticipate how those different technologies play out and think through what policy instruments you might use in the different types of environments. So it is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all thing,\" she added.\nDIRDC was asked when Australians could expect a driverless vehicle to be in place.\nFocusing on a tram due to it being flagged as the most plausible mode of autonomous transport, Roland Pittar, DIRDC's Office of Future Transport Technology general manager, said conditional automation -- that is not full automation in all circumstances -- is probably something that will be available around the early to mid-2020s, but that would still require drivers to operate in more complex traffic environments.\nThe Office of Future Transport Technology was established in October. For a cost of AU$9.7 million, the new office is charged with the responsibility of preparing for the arrival of automated vehicles.\nThe office will work alongside state and territory counterparts, positioning itself in a leadership role, to make sure future transport technologies are implemented in a \"more successfully and responsibly\" way.\nSpecifically, the office is expected to consider future infrastructure needs, ensure automated vehicles are safe, make sure cybersecurity safeguards are in place, and support Australian businesses in taking advantage of new commercial opportunities.\nIt hopes to make the regulatory settings \"workable\" and nationally consistent, ensuring that they fit with emerging United Nations regulatory developments and are consistent with related Commonwealth policies and laws -- including those relating to privacy and data use.\nThe state of New South Wales is preparing for a future of work underpinned by autonomous vehicles, smart highways, and regional hubs.

It's otherworldly.\"\nThe exciting part of Towns' versatility is he projects to be a traditional NBA big man. In Kentucky, he acted as a defensive anchor and mostly scored around the basket. In today's NBA, some players have similar size as Towns, but don't have the skills of big man, so their versatility can't be used as a weapon at center.

A doctor who happened to be seated nearby shot me up with an epipen. The train made an emergency stop in New London where the paramedics were waiting. I was shivering crazily, which was better than the bullets I'd been sweating moments before. The doc told me it was the adrenaline. I kept apologizing. I couldn't believe I was making a scene on the Quiet Car.\nThe paramedics came in and took my blood pressure. They were moving to get me on a stretcher. I told them I could stand. They told me I could not as my blood pressure was such that I would likely faint. So they hauled me up and off, got me to the hospital, ran some oxygen through my nose and put an IV in my arm. When I got the hospital the doctors took great care of me. Two points: First, my theory of assholes clearly should be revised; the kindness of strangers is always amazing. Second, America, whatever its flaws, is very often amazing in its efficiency and compassion. It did not escape my mind that in some other place I might have died.

Montava \u2014 which means mountain sun, according to the Ute Indians \u2014 comprises about a third of the total 2,500-acre subarea.\nThe land, west of the Budweiser plant, is bordered by Richards Lake Road on the north, extends south of Mountain Vista Drive and west to Poudre School District's future high school site within the city's growth management area.\n\"It's the final frontier for Fort Collins,\" said Cameron Gloss, city planning manager. \"Growth over the last several decades has been to the southeast. The last remaining area is really the northeast.\"\nAnheuser-Busch put the site on the market after it no longer needed the property, said Moss, owner of HF2M. The undeveloped land provides a blank canvas for a project that could include housing, commercial, industrial and retail space, along with a city park and transit hub.\nMontava's master plan would likely incorporate agri-urbanism that includes elements such as working farms and community gardens, multifamily and single-family housing, and a community commercial center.\n\"Our challenge is to create a true next-generation community that honors the reputation of one of America's greatest cities,\" Moss wrote, explaining the vision behind Montava.\n\"Fort Collins is one of the most unique and desirable cities in the country, and Montava will be designed to reflect the same values and qualities which are already inherent in our city.\"\nIts design will emphasize housing that is affordable to most Fort Collins residents, favors \"pedestrians over cars, front porches over garage doors and a way of life that hearkens back to times when life was simpler and richer,\" he said.\nPlans are in their infancy, but if Moss goes ahead with the project, it could take between 10 and 20 years to develop. The land alone could cost between $25 million and $30 million.\nMoss declined to put a price tag on the entire development or on how many homes it could accommodate because there is no definitive plan yet.\nHe has enlisted the help of Bruce Hendee, former assistant city manager for sustainability; Angie Milewski of BHA Design; and DPZ, an internationally recognized planning firm to help forge the path forward.\nThe project wouldn't get underway for at least a year.

Now a court must decide whether immigrants can be forced to learn the language and adopt Western mores.\nAfter three-and-a-half years of legal wrangling, there's still no end in sight. At least officially, the case centers on \u0080290.70 ($392). The K. family, thus identified to safeguard its privacy, is made up of ethnic Turks living in Germany. They claim that the state owes them the money. But, in reality, it's a matter of principle.\nThe questions at the heart of the dispute are: Can immigrants be forced to learn German? Can people who decline such an offer be denied welfare benefits? Or, viewed from the other perspective, can immigrants who live off state benefits refuse to integrate into society, or can they live as a group as if on an island and free of societal obligations?\nThe case of the K. family is typical of the problems German authorities face in dealing with immigrants from countries such as Turkey who don't want to integrate.\nIsmail K. had just turned 19 when he came to Germany. It was 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. He left behind the hardship, rigid moral values and ironclad hierarchical structures of a world whose rules have remained an internal part of him to this day. His extended family lived in a tiny village in eastern Turkey. As the head of the family, his father decided which of his sons went to school, for how long, when it was time to marry and what jobs they would have. His mother looked after the children, managed the household and generally saw to her husband's needs.\nOn his arrival in Germany, Ismail K. sought political asylum, claiming that Turkish authorities had falsely accused him of belonging to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). His application was initially turned down, and for a while he faced deportation. But the case dragged on and on.\nK. moved to a small town near Limburg an der Lahn in the western state of Hesse, where he married a woman from his village who had followed him to Germany. By the time he was finally granted political asylum, in 1996, the couple already had four children. Since asylum seekers aren't officially allowed to work, the family had been forced to live off welfare for many years. This hurt K.'s pride. After all, in his traditional mindset, the head of the household is responsible for providing for his family. He was therefore keen to live up to expectations.\nIn 1999, the naturalized immigrant started a pizza service. Business was good at first, and K. was in his element, just as he had always imagined. Now he was the one giving the orders, while relatives and acquaintances manned the pizza ovens and delivery vans.\nBuoyed by his success, K. took out bigger and bigger loans, and eventually opened a large pizza restaurant, convinced that his customers would now come to him. But the plan failed, and people stayed away. Even his delivery service lost customers to competitors who undercut his prices.\nIn 2006, the dream of running a successful business was dead. The restaurant went bankrupt, and K. was left with a mountain of debt. The would-be entrepreneur was convinced he had failed in every way: As a businessman, as a family bread-winner and as a shining example for his children. Although still in his mid-30s, he was sometimes found staring into the distance. \"Ever since he went bankrupt"}

Or put enough edges on the amorphous to make it measurable?\nThe first step, obviously, is to remove any barriers by giving workers the time, permission and freedom to be creative.\nThat feels like an explicit invitation to innovation.\nSecond, establish an employee experience that encourages workers to accept that invitation and put it to good use.\nOur data show there's a link between workplace engagement and creativity, and everyone recognizes the link between innovation and market share.\nGallup's research-driven strategies can help companies design an employee experience that leverages those links -- and gets the best ROI from the employee imagination.\nOnly 29% of workers strongly agree that they're expected to be creative or think of new ways to do things at work.\nWhile we're all capable of finding new ways to help our company succeed, we may not put in much effort, or feel welcome to, unless creativity is expressly required.\nAnd when workers have an idea for a better way to do their job or come up with market-moving products or services, they should be publicly recognized.\nIt's flattering to be applauded for a good idea -- and even if that idea won't work, someone else's iteration of it can lead to big things.\nConsider Play-Doh, for instance. First manufactured by a soap company in the 1930s, Play-Doh was sold as a wallpaper cleaner until an employee's sister-in-law had a more creative idea: Call it a toy and market it to kids. Hasbro acquired the brand in 1991, and now Play-Doh is one of its best-selling products.\nMost ideas aren't going to be the next Play-Doh, but managers should make it clear that observing, thinking, making connections -- basic creativity -- is part of every employee's job role and will be a factor in their performance development.\nExecutive leaders often schedule creativity into their calendar because building vision and strategy -- a very creative endeavor -- is part of their job.\nBut lower-level employees need to justify their time with discernable results. Which may be why 35% of workers say they're only given time to be creative a few times a year, or less often.\nEven when employees strongly agree that they're expected to be creative, only 52% of them say they're given time to do so every day.\nPeople with \"creative\" jobs, such as artists and writers, often say that good time management promotes creativity.\nMaybe discipline makes their creativity a more accessible resource or helps them organize their thoughts. Maybe putting edges on creative time simply reminds them to ideate -- real-world work can seem more demanding than blue-sky thinking.\nWhatever the psychological process, scheduling time for creativity ensures that it happens, shows that creativity is a cultural value to the organization and gives managers something tangible to measure.\nThat last part can be tricky.

Chief Dennis Edwards, supported by city administration and the Local 101 firefighters union, asked councilors to change the city charter to allow him three deputy chiefs instead of two.\n\"Over the years, we keep expanding our mission.

Councilor Jay Fosle was opposed.\nCurrently, Edwards has a deputy chief administrator, who is also in charge of emergency management, and a deputy chief of operations below him. He had hoped to elevate a training officer position to a deputy chief of training position.\n\"With a more robust training program, that will make our firefighters more efficient, and they'll be able to do their job safer,\" the chief said. \"And in turn, that makes the public safer because when the firefighters are safe and efficient and well trained, that's where they can help the public the most.\"\nHe said the new position would not have an impact on the fire department's budget.\nIt's not the end of the road for the deputy chief of training position, however.

But experts say the high-profile rejection of Citigroup\u2019s pay package may inspire investors in other companies to speak up.\nOn Tuesday, Citi\u2019s shareholders rejected a compensation package for senior executives that would boost chief executive Vikram Pandit\u2019s 2011 pay to $14.0 million from $1. It was by far the most prominent company to be voted down by shareholders under the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 98% of pay packages were approved last year, says Glyn Holton, the executive director of the United States Proxy Exchange, a shareholder rights organization.\nAlthough Citi\u2019s board is under no obligation to honor what amounts to a nonbinding rebuke, the move may still encourage more investors to resist pay packages they feel are out of line with the company\u2019s performance, analysts say. \u201cShareholders should really feel motivated to recognize that there are severe issues at corporations,\u201d says Holton. The move could lead to changes in the way other banks reward their executives going forward. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing greater empowerment of shareholders,\u201d says Fabrizio Ferri, a professor of accounting at Columbia Business School.\nTo be sure, a widespread shareholder uprising is unlikely, experts say. The votes, in general \u201cdon\u2019t have much teeth,\u201d so most pay packages will likely continue to get high marks as investors reject only the most extreme packages, says Ralph A. Walkling, executive director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Drexel University\u2019s business school. \u201cIt\u2019s the egregious situations where pay is totally out of line with performance that get rejected,\u201d says Walkling.\nWhile there have only been a few cases of investors rejecting pay packages, substantial numbers of no votes pushed some companies to change their practices, says Ferri. Some companies responded to investors\u2019 requests for pay structures that are linked to rising profit levels as well as share prices. Others removed provisions that reimbursed taxes on severance packages and other perks, he says. \u201cIt clearly puts pressure on the board to respond to the negative publicity,\u201d says Ferri."}

And normally, Republicans claim to be strong defenders of the Constitution.\nFor some reason, though, the idea of giving consumers the choice to participate in a court of law \u2014 a right enshrined in the Seventh Amendment \u2014 leaves some GOP legislators quaking in their loafers.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a resolution introduced in both the Senate and House on Thursday.\nWhen you get a new bank account, credit card, payday loan or auto lease, there\u2019s a lot of fine print. Often, the fine print says that if the company harms you \u2014 say, charges you a questionable hidden fee, blocks your ability to access your own money or opens a sham account in your name without your knowledge \u2014 you can\u2019t sue it in court.\nInstead, you have to resolve the dispute outside the court system, bound by a decision made by a private individual rather than a judge or jury. Sometimes this private individual, called an arbitrator, is selected and paid by the very company that you believe ripped you off.\nAnother consequence of this fine print \u2014 called a \u201cforced arbitration clause\u201d \u2014 is that it prevents you from bringing or joining a class-action suit against the company that harmed you. That\u2019s true no matter how many other people were victimized by the exact same company, even if they were victimized in the exact same way.\nWells Fargo, for example, opened millions of fake accounts in the names of unsuspecting customers. But because these consumers had other accounts that included forced-arbitration clauses, Wells Fargo repeatedly tried to use this fine print to block class-action suits over those bogus accounts.\nTens of millions of Americans are bound by these forced-arbitration clauses, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The vast majority don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve signed away their rights until something goes wrong. Removing the ability to join a class-action suit is a big deal. Joining others who have been harmed is often the only sensible strategy if the harms are small but widespread.\nOnce upon a time, Congress recognized that the proliferation of mandatory-arbitration clauses was a problem.\nAs part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, Congress gave the newly created CFPB the authority to ban or limit forced arbitration in connection with consumer financial products or services, though the law said the agency had to do a study first.\nSince then, the CFPB has conducted two studies examining the prevalence of these clauses, and their effects on consumers and the financial system. After an extended comment period, the agency issued a final rule this month saying such clauses can no longer be used to block class-action suits.\nConsumers can still go through arbitration if they wish. But they also now have the option of banding together with other consumers if a lot of people have been hurt similarly.\nIn other words, the CFPB gave consumers more choices.\nWhich, again, sounds like something Republicans should support.\nInstead, on Thursday, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, announced legislation to kill the CFPB rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to nullify executive-branch regulations by a simple majority vote, so long as they act within 60 legislative days.\nThe Trump administration also appears to be developing a Plan B, should Congress not act in time.\nNote that the CFPB\u2019s rule only applies to financial products and services, since those are what"}

He's a man quick to find a doctor for someone's sick grandmother or hold a fundraiser for a local firefighter battling cancer.\nThis Joe Biden is the son of a car salesman who lost nearly all his money and moved his family from Scranton, Pa., to a hardscrabble neighborhood in Delaware. As a boy, Biden struggled to overcome a bad stutter and the nickname Joe Impedimenta.\nAs a 29-year-old freshman senator-elect, he lost his wife and infant daughter in a car crash that also severely injured his two young sons. The tragedy almost caused Biden to abandon his political career. And for years afterward, he took the train home almost every night from Washington to Delaware to be with the boys as they grew up.\n\"I tell people that you get to know Joe Biden the closer you get to Wilmington, Del. And when you see him with his family, then you know the man,\" said John Marttila, a longtime friend and advisor who worked on Biden's first Senate campaign in 1972.\nBiden's family was at the core of his first run for office. His sister, Valerie, ran that campaign, as she has each one since. His brother headed the fundraising operation. His mother and father sat in on most of the strategy meetings.\nBiden was challenging a popular incumbent Republican who maintained a huge lead in the polls in a year that would sweep Richard Nixon to his second term in the White House.\nThe campaign had so little money to advertise, Marttila recalled, that Biden's army of volunteers had to get mailers to voters by walking neighborhoods around the state. But Biden eked out a victory.\nA month later, as he was in Washington interviewing candidates for his office staff, the fatal accident occurred. His wife and three children had been out shopping for a Christmas tree.\nBiden didn't want to take his Senate seat, said Ted Kaufman, another longtime friend who worked on that campaign and would serve as Biden's chief of staff for 22 years.\nWaiting for his sons to recover in the hospital, Biden wrote in his 2007 memoir, \"Promises to Keep,\" he would take long walks around the seedy neighborhoods nearby. \"I liked to go at night when I thought there was a better chance of finding a fight,\" Biden wrote. \"I was always looking for a fight.

The meetings, members have said, were the first time most of the group ever had the chance to meet other young people who identified as both LGBTQ and Muslim.\nThe council, which is made up of people age 16 to 24, is part of the larger nonprofit Advocates for Youth, which works to ensure that all young people have access to accurate and age-appropriate information about sexuality and sexual health. They began wondering how they could help build that sense of community for other young Muslims.\nThose conversations inspired the council to create the #MuslimAnd social media campaign last fall as a way for young Muslims to share their stories.\nKhan and a colleague began developing the guide by interviewing fellow council members about their teenage experiences and asked them to look back and suggest things they felt would have been helpful to teens like them who are currently in high school.\nThat\u2019s why the new brochure features extensive quotes from LGBTQ Muslims in their teens and twenties. Topics covered include consent, finding the vocabulary to describe yourself and community resources.\n\u201cOften what we hear from young Muslims: First off, LGBTQ Muslims are thought to not exist,\u201d Khan said, adding that those messages often come from Muslim family members. Meanwhile, young Muslims also face Islamophobia or a misunderstanding of Islam and its tenants about sexuality from the larger LGBTQ community.\nNoor Pervez was one of the young Muslims who found the Council and a larger Muslim community through the #MuslimAnd campaign.\nPervez\u2019s connection to the #MuslimAnd campaign also inspired him to help with the brochure. Growing up in Texas, \u201cMuslim representation for youth in general and queer youth in particular were almost nonexistent,\u201d he recalled. He hopes that the brochure will lead other young Muslims to find much needed information.\nVideo Description: South Asian person talks while lying down on a \ud83e\udd44 pattern pillow.\nOne way allies and educators can best support the LGBTQ Muslim community is to develop an understanding that aspects of the mainstream LGBTQ experience may not be always be feasible. Khan and her colleagues found that coming out to one's parents and community members does not always work for many young Muslims, who often grow up in environments where discussions about sexuality and relationships outside of marriage are highly discouraged.\n\u201cIt can often further isolate young Muslims when they they think, \u2018Oh, since I could never possibly come out to my parents right now that means that I can\u2019t be queer,\u2019 and that further invalidates their identity,\u201d Khan said.\n\u201cWe want that section to affirm young people that really if you don\u2019t tell anyone or if you tell the whole world, you are still queer and you are allowed to be that way,\u201d she added, referring to a section of the brochure about coming out.\nBut Khan and other activists add that the progress the community has made with regards to LGBTQ issues should be acknowledged.

Take precautions now to ensure your pipes and water supply remain in good order throughout the winter.\nIf you have leaking pipes or faucets, hire a plumber now to fix the problem. Leaks in moderate weather become much bigger problems once temperatures drop below freezing.\nPrepare your pipes with insulation, which provides the first line of defense against freezing. Insulation tubes from a hardware store should provide effective protection. Pay particular attention to pipes in unheated areas, those that have frozen in previous winters and pipes that have been repaired in the past year.\nIf your outdoor water faucets have a separate shut-off valve, close the valve, open the spigots to drain the lines and leave them open until spring. If your faucets have a back-flow prevention device, be sure to disconnect it so that the water drains from the line.\nFill any exterior cracks or holes with spray foam insulation and caulking. Do the same with openings around outdoor faucets or hose bibs. This blocks cold air from coming in along the pipes, and it saves energy at the same time.\nIf you spend your winters in a different home, make sure you prepare the home you leave behind for bad weather. Vacation homes can suffer major damage if a frozen pipe springs a leak; you might not notice the water damage for months.\nA burst main water line can wreak havoc when left unattended for months at a time. To prevent this from happening, turn off the water meter yourself using the meter key, or hire a plumber to do so properly. Open all of your faucets and valves to drain the pipes. Then, turn off the water using the shut-off valve inside your house and leave the faucets open.\nWater can hide out in plumbing fixtures, so be sure to address those. Disconnect and drain your washing machine hoses and dishwasher drain lines. Drain all spray attachments and shower heads. Turn off the water heater and drain the tank entirely. Finally, flush your toilets and remove excess water from tanks and bowls.\nDespite your best efforts, you may end up with frozen pipes anyway, so have a plan in mind for that event. First, close the main shutoff valve to prevent any leaks. Then find the source of the freeze. If one or two faucets don\u2019t work, the freeze is between the split from the main line. If none work, it\u2019s near the main water line. To thaw a pipe, Wrap the pipe in a towel doused with hot water, or warm it with a hair dryer on the lowest setting. Never use a flame.\nKeep your plumber\u2019s emergency contact info handy in case you run into a problem you can\u2019t handle alone.\nWinter is also a good time to review your emergency kit, which should contain (among other things) one gallon of water per person per day in the event of emergency or loss of water supply."}

Today is another big bump in the road for Quickflix, though, and it may well be the last: the company has been placed into voluntary administration and might be dismantled.\nAfter several months of company restructure, Quickflix today announced to the ASX that voluntary administrators from Ferrier Hodgson had been appointed to steer the business \u2014 and the statement says that streaming competitor Stan is largely to blame.\nThe reason for that is that Stan owns a significant portion of shares in Quickflix, which it bought for $1 million in 2014 in a fire sale from HBO \u2014 the original owner of the shares, which it exchanged for a $10 million investment in Quickflix alongside the commencement of a sell-through agreement that was the start of Game of Thrones' easy online availability in Australia.\nWith a significant stake of preferential shares, Stan's ownership acted as a disincentive for any other investors to come on board, and despite Quickflix's significant restructuring the company has been unable to attract any other investment. To pay out its stake, Quickflix's ASX announcement says that Stan wanted either $4 million cash or $1.25 million and the entire Quickflix subscriber base, as well as a promise not to compete on Quickflix and Stan's current territory of subscription video on demand.\nQuickflix's quandary means that the company is effectively stuck in a stalemate, unable to raise new funds or to pay its dues to Stan and Nine Entertainment. Quickflix's administrators \"intend to operate the... business as usual with customers and new customers unaffected\", though, and Quickflix's New Zealand business remains unchanged. The future for the company, though, is unclear \u2014 but it does effectively mean that the streaming playing field in Australia narrows down to Netflix, Stan, Presto and a few smaller contenders."}

The worktop is tidy, everything looks organised.\nIt's Saturday lunchtime and just two tables of two are occupied in the 24-cover dining room. Although the kitchen is visible by those who trouble to peep in en route to the world-class loos, the chef could have worn pyjamas and a top hat and few would have registered it. It mattered that he didn't.\nThe hood does not make the monk, but if a chef is prepared to take trouble over the small things on the quietest service of the week, it's a reasonable guess that he'll take pains with the large things, too.\nAnd so it proves. Lunch \u2013 19.95 for three courses and 16.95 for two \u2013 brings three choices at each stage. It's not the cheapest in an area well provided with tourist trade cafs, tea shops and food pubs, yet it flies higher than most of the local competition.\nIt is not simply the quality of the ingredients or the skill in deploying them but the imaginative resource that informs the whole process. Plenty of places in the Dales offer starters featuring smoked salmon; how many trouble to smoke the salmon themselves?\nHow many would fashion a small tartare of it with beetroot and arrange it on the plate next to a raisin and caper comp'te to set off the lightly smoked slices and a lovely little slab of the sweet-cured fish?\nThis is modern English cooking of a high order and it is small surprise to learn that it is the work of an experienced chef. Jon Vennell ran the kitchen for 10 years at Haley's Hotel restaurant in Leeds and spent some of his early years training in Switzerland.\nWhen Charles Flood decided to opt for a new career in gardening after nearly 20 years at the roadside restaurant, Vennell bought it, revised the traditional, self-effacing interior and opened for the late summer trade.\nThe dining room is now lighter and simpler but hardly a decorative statement.

Never afraid to do something no one else had tried, MacLennan left the union movement more than four years ago to become a senior manager for a major oilpatch construction company.\nMacLennan was always a Liberal, and, in case you missed it amid the buzz about the Progressive Conservative leadership race and all the Tweets about the Alberta Party leadership, the Alberta Liberals are choosing a new leader too.\nOutside Liberal circles, however, up to now there's been very little public engagement with the effort to replace Opposition Leader Dr. David Swann, who never caught on with the public. This lack of interest is a sign of the depth of the trough into which the Alberta Liberals sank during Swann's uninspired leadership.\nReasons now include the widespread assumption -- most likely correct -- that after the next general election the Wildrose Alliance will become the Official Opposition. Plus, there's the fact leadership of the eight-member Liberal caucus is mainly of interest to people whom the public know of, but aren't particularly thrilled about.\nStill, it would be a mistake to rule the Liberals out completely. After all, even if the Wildrose Alliance becomes the Official Opposition, Liberals will continue to play an influential role among the parties of the centre and moderate left.\nThe thing to remember about the Liberals is that while they are the perpetual victims of their \"damaged brand\" (hence the rise of the Liberal-like Alberta Party), and haven't seemed to have what it took to challenge the governing Conservatives since Laurence Decore was at their helm in the 1980s and 1990s, they have a determined base that just won't vote for anyone else.\nThe most recent Alberta polls show that this is true. So, no matter how you cut it, there will always likely be a few Liberals in the Alberta Legislature.\nMoreover, if voters fail to cotton on to the Alberta Party, as even that group's enthusiasts must recognize is a possibility, where are disillusioned Alberta Partiers to drift but back to the Liberals?\nWhich is another way of saying that, for all its troubles, leadership of the Liberals is still a prize worth fighting for.\nThe trouble is, as noted, most of the names of potential leaders being bandied about so far are present or former Alberta Liberal caucus members -- nice folks, capable local politicians, hard workers for their constituents, but no one that's going to set the world afire.\nPerennial Edmonton-Centre MLA Laurie Blakeman, now justly famous for demonstrating the political verities of Alberta using fruits and vegetables, is the only candidate officially in the race. Not so many days ago she was musing about running for the Alberta Party leadership.\nHowever, Blakeman will soon be joined by others.

That range represents a slight decrease from Mac sales of 2.3 million in Q2 2008, but these days \"slight decrease\" sounds pretty good. As with recent quarters, Mac desktop sales are dropping the most, but sales of some notebooks may actually have grown compared to the same period last year.\nNow on to iPhones, iPods, and Apple TVs. Oh my. Munster has iPod sales pegged at 9 to 10 million units, a drop of either 15 or 6 percent from the Q2 2008 iPod sales of 10.6 million. The product mix of iPods sold is also expected to shift towards cheaper models, although there could be surprises. iPhone sales are still expected to rise, and Munster's predicted figure of 4.4 million would represent growth over both Q2 2008 and Q1 2009. Last but not least, the Apple TV should sell \"three times\" as many units as it did in Q2 2008 for a whopping total of nine or so units this quarter.

For the past couple decades there has been an on-going technological revolution. Twenty Years ago few would have imagined that today\u2019s society would be walking around with pocket sized computers capable of fulfilling most of their entertainment, personal, and business needs. In fact, today\u2019s society is constantly bombarded with endless forms of media. A 2017 creative trends report by Tongal shows that every minute 200,000,000+ emails are sent and received, 2,500,000 pieces of content are shared on Facebook, and 215,000 photos are published to Instagram.\nThis influx of information has created a new generation that is less susceptible to traditional advertisements and marketing strategies. An obvious example of this is the increasing want for ad skipping, which is due to consumers declining attention span that now stands at eight seconds, according to the Tongal Report. Now the pressure is on for brands to produce relevant messages that captivate consumers.\nBut what do consumers want?\nIt\u2019s obvious that most consumers, especially millenials and generation X (the \u201cYouTube Generation\u201d) don\u2019t want ads at all. But according to the study, if tailored the right way, it is very possible to reach younger generations. Here are a few key takeaways from the report.\nAs it turns out, consumers want to discover content, not be interrupted by it. They defined \u201cgood\u201d advertising experiences as those which can be skipped. In addition to skippable ads, consumers are seeking authentic content that not only entertains, but informs.\n67% agreed they\u2019re more likely to watch branded video if it\u2019s educational.\n97% said it was important that branded content has an entertaining storyline, the most cited attribute.\n51% said they agreed/strongly agreed that featuring real people makes them more likely to watch a branded video.\nOnly 30% said a celebrity or influencer makes them more likely to watch a brand\u2019s video.\n26% said that the inclusion of influencers or celebrities would not make them more prone to watch the content.\nAnother huge factor in creating watchable content is the content creator. When working with freelance creatives, understand that they\u2019re most motivated by their own passions\u200a\u2014\u200anot the money. Twenty-six Percent of creatives surveyed said the biggest motivator in choosing whether to take on a branded content project is their personal passion for the brand or assignment, followed by the freedom to create around their own vision (24%). Only 18% said money was the number one factor.\nIn addition to the information listed above, brands should keep a close eye on Google\u2019s YouTube, which still reigns as the number 1 place for consumers to discover video content. And don\u2019t forget about Facebook, as it has been innovating quickly and ranked third (above Amazon and Hulu) in Tongal\u2019s research of top video platforms.\nAnd If the rise of Netflix has proved anything, it\u2019s that consumers will hand over their hard-earned cash to experience great content. According to the Tongal, the death of non-paid viewership has been exaggerated, so don\u2019t be afraid to invest in growing audiences around your content organically. Consider \u201cThe LEGO Movie,\u201d which reflects content marketing at its very best. Ask yourself, if your brand had a show, what show would you create?\nTongal is the independent creative network that helps brands tell stories and engage today\u2019s audiences more"}

This is a bridge to get from point A to point B, and point B in this case is going to be we're just not going to kick the ball off anymore...

Mueller and his team issued no indictments against Donald Trump or anyone in the Trump administration for conspiring or coordinating with the Russian government\u2019s 2016 election interference. Is it significant that the first version of the story Sunday afternoon by Mark Mazzetti and Katie Benner avoids that ubiquitous charge, \u201ccollusion\u201d?\nWill this be the final word on \u201ccollusion\u201d? Unlikely.

With the release of the Mueller report suggesting no further indictments regarding Russian interference, \u201ccollusion\u201d is suddenly a bad word.\nBut if, as the Times now tell us, \u201ccollusion has no legal definition,\u201d didn\u2019t Trump have a point?\nAnother May 2018 story was quite confident in its \u201ccolluded\u201d terminology.\nMock an investigation into whether your campaign colluded with a foreign government to swing the election as a \u201cphony cloud,\u201d a \u201ctotal hoax,\u201d \u201cfabricated and politically motivated,\u201d a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and an \u201cartificial Democratic hit job\u201d that \u201cmakes the country look very bad\u201d and serves as \u201can excuse for losing an election that they should have won\u201d -- and also claim that the Democrats were the real colluders.\nThe president and his allies are continuing to label the investigation an overreach -- Mr. Trump prefers to refer to it in all caps as a WITCH HUNT -- and have kept the bar for wrongdoing very high.

{"idx": "38138", "prompt": "Continue the following text: JOEL Selwood excels even at suspensions. Not reported in his football lifetime until Monday, he will miss Geelong's next four matches after his striking case failed at the AFL Tribunal last night. The Cats are unbeaten in the post-Ablett era, but their resilience and resourcefulness will be tested in matches against St Kilda, Adelaide, Essendon and West Coast.\n''Bitterly disappointed,'' Geelong football manager Neil Balme said. Selwood said nothing. An appeal is unlikely.\nSelwood was reported by the match review panel for an alleged strike that cost Hawthorn opponent Brent Guerra a perforated eardrum late in Saturday night's MCG epic. He pleaded guilty to the strike, but sought to have its gravity downgraded from intentional to reckless, which - if successful - would have mitigated his sentence at two matches.\nTribunal members Emmett Dunne, Wayne Henwood and Stewart Loewe deliberated lengthily. It is a matter of conjecture how those deliberations unfolded, but it is easy to imagine that Selwood's defence might have foundered on two points.\nOne was this declaration from Selwood. ''You have to take into account what time of the game it is,'' he said to the tribunal. ''Two minutes to go, game in the balance. You do anything to help your side win. That's the way I play. That's the way I always will play.'' As a defence, it could have been viewed as a double-edged sword.\nThe only available video evidence, a long-range shot from behind the Punt Road goals, was sketchy. In it, Selwood makes for space on the half-forward flank, but is blocked by Guerra, who goes to ground. ''I've never, ever - never, ever - struck anyone intentionally in my life,'' Selwood said.\nSelwood's counsel, Peter Murdoch QC, asked the tribunal to note that Selwood's arms were by his side as Guerra fell. From this, Murdoch suggested that Guerra might have lost his footing because his perforated eardrum had unbalanced him, ''not because of some blow inflicted by Mr Selwood''. Here was the defence's other soft spot: Selwood already had pleaded guilty to striking.\nSelwood said that - intent on the game - he was not looking at Guerra, did not know at the time that he had struck him to the head, and did not know that he had fallen. Television footage shows Guerra being assisted from the ground, wincing in pain. Hawthorn's medical report said Guerra had complained of ''dizziness, hearing disturbance and ear pain'', and was briefly stunned. He has since been seen by an ENT surgeon and cleared to play this week.\nAFL legal counsel Jeff Gleeson said that for what he called an ''unremarkable jostle'' to lead to hearing loss made for inconsistency in Selwood's evidence.\nSelwood said that he had started playing football at eight-years-old and had never been reported or suspended in any competition. Murdoch said that because of his unblemished record and his reputation as a fearless, but fair ball player, he ''should be taken at his word''. Tribunal chairman David Jones also made particular note of Selwood's clean record.\nSelwood's original penalty was four matches, reduced to three because of his good record. If successful last night, it would have become two. Instead, the four stands. When it was confirmed, Selwood"}

{"idx": "38140", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: No one can argue that innocent people have served time in jail because they were wrongly convicted or, worse, wrongly accused and then wrongly prosecuted.\nWhat can be argued is the best way to fix the problem.\nThe state Legislature approved legislation before the end of the legislative session to create an 11-member State Commission on Prosecutorial Misconduct that was signed recently by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to investigate alleged misconduct against district attorneys and their prosecuting attorneys. It is a bit troubling, first, that the governor signed the legislation based on a wink and a smile with legislators to reopen the legislation when the state Legislature is back in session to amend several provisions that may be unconstitutional in the law that was passed. It would be preferable for the legislation to be correctly written and phrased before it is signed by the governor.\nSecond, the commission places blame for wrongful convictions on only one part of the court system. The University of Michigan\u2019s National Registry of Exonerations indicates there have been 12 wrongful convictions reversed this year in New York state. Most of the cases are in the New York City area with several possible contributing factors in each case. Causes include five instances of mistaken witness identification, four instances of inadequate legal defense, seven instances of official misconduct and eight instances of perjury or false accusation. If the goal is to make sure no one is wrongly convicted, one can argue that Cuomo\u2019s commission only tackles one-third of the problem by focusing solely on prosecutors and not on all four groups involved in prosecutions \u2014 prosecutors, judges, police and defense attorneys. Did judges make poor decisions because they are hearing too many cases or because they are simply bad judges who don\u2019t understand the law? Should defense attorneys be held responsible for poorly crafted legal defenses? Where false accusations were made, were they by police departments and, if so, where is that commission? Cuomo\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct commission papers over the multitude of reasons people are wrongly convicted by focusing its attention solely on prosecutors.\nThe devil is in the details, which are still to be finalized, but it would seem there should be some guidelines as to which cases make their way to the commission and a consequence to lawyers who commence frivolous misconduct allegations at the expense of taxpayers and the court system.\nFinally, prosecutors have every right to be upset with the possible composition of the commission. It would be easier to back such a commission if there was some assurance that it wouldn\u2019t fall prey to partisan politics. As we have seen with the Moreland Commission, it\u2019s easier to disband watchdog groups than to have investigations hit too close to home. What happens, then, when the prosecutorial misconduct commission finds fault with a prosecutor who is friendly with a governor of either political party? Would justice be served, or politics? What happens if a prosecutor who is an outspoken opponent of state policy is the subject of a series of unfounded misconduct complaints?\nThe commission is going to happen unless it is struck down as unconstitutional. We hope that it is constructed with nothing but fairness and justice in mind. It is imperative that the panel be non-partisan. District attorneys, elected by a majority of the registered voters in each county, should not be able to be removed from office for anything other than gross misconduct."}

Now, it's leaning toward the explanation that it was the people,\" said Dan Seligson, spokesman for Electionline.org, a nonpartisan election reform research group.\nIndeed, three touchscreen machines were misprogrammed at one South Miami precinct, but Miami-Dade County Manager Steve Shiver said no voters were turned away.

The so-called \u2018society flats\u2019, which adhere to modern-day building bye-laws, were built way back in the 1980s when nobody could\u2019ve imagines the car population in the capital would reach such levels that people would even resort to shooting to corner the space for their vehicles. So, residents of these apartments also put their cars on the side of the road. This is a permanent parking, excepting business hours. Thus, the wide road continues to witness increasing traffic congestions during rush hours \u2013 even as the footpaths (where they can be demarked) are clear.\nAs a result, a part of the crores of rupees spent in building this road stands wasted. The authorities might have built it smaller and saved money. The encroachment on the road must be removed, and it is difficult to imagine any argument against this solution. But in Delhi, or for that matter any Indian city, the authorities firstly do not notice the problem. If noticed, each of them thinks this problem comes under somebody else\u2019s jurisdiction.\nAnd, yet, removing encroachment itself is never an insurmountable challenge. When the authorities want to do it for some reason pressing for them, they go ahead and do it. Running parallel to this road barely a couple of hundred metres away is National Highway 24, which is expanding on its sides as part of Delhi-Meerut Expressway project, and notwithstanding Delhi\u2019s notorious multiplicity of authorities, they all have joined hands and razed several building to grounds within days.\nThis area, covering half-a-km radius of the landmark Mother Dairy plant, tells you why chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is trolled on social media for wishing to turn Delhi into London.\nWhy this much recurring London-Paris dream of our politicians remains only a dream can be best understood in the framework of the \u2018Annual Survey of India\u2019s City-Systems\u2019, published by Janaagraha, the Bengaluru-based policy campaigner organisation, only last week.\nThus, in the survey ranking, all Indian cities score 0.0, whereas London and New York both score perfect 10.0 each.\nTurn to page 8 of the Janaagraha survey for detailed explanation of each parameter, and where Indian cities stand (New York and London uniformly score close to perfect ten)."}

Despite Voyager 2's close flyby, the composition of the atmosphere remained a mystery until now.\nThere's a lot of really smelly stuff wafting around Uranus.\nThe clouds in Uranus' upper atmosphere are composed largely of hydrogen sulfide, the molecule that makes rotten eggs so stinky, a new study suggests.\n\"If an unfortunate human were ever to descend through Uranus' clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odiferous conditions,\" study lead author Patrick Irwin, of Oxford University in England, said in a statement.\nBut that wayward pioneer would have bigger problems, he added: \"Suffocation and exposure in the negative 200 degrees Celsius [minus 328 degrees Fahrenheit] atmosphere, made of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane, would take its toll long before the smell.\"\nIrwin and his colleagues studied Uranus' air using the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS), an instrument on the 26-foot (8 meters) Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. NIFS scrutinized sunlight reflected from the atmosphere just above Uranus' cloud tops \u2014 and spotted the signature of hydrogen sulfide.\n\"Only a tiny amount remains above the clouds as a saturated vapor,\" study co-author Leigh Fletcher, from the University of Leicester in England, said in the same statement. \"And this is why it is so challenging to capture the signatures of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide above cloud decks of Uranus. The superior capabilities of Gemini finally gave us that lucky break.\"\nThese infrared images of Uranus' two hemispheres were taken with the Keck telescope in July 2004. The planet's north pole points down and to the right.\nNeptune's clouds are likely similar to those of Uranus, the researchers said. The big difference between the clouds of these two \"ice giants\" and those of Jupiter and Saturn probably trace to the worlds' formation environments: Uranus and Neptune coalesced much farther from the sun than the two gas giants did.\n\"During our solar system\u2019s formation, the balance between nitrogen and sulfur \u2014 and hence ammonia and Uranus's newly detected hydrogen sulfide \u2014 was determined by the temperature and location of [a] planet\u2019s formation,\" Fletcher said.\nThe new study was published online today (April 23) in the journal Nature Astronomy."}

In addition, Fletcher sat down with Torchetti today for the first time since the season ended.\nFletcher said last week that Torchetti was \"definitely a very serious candidate.\"\nPart of the reason for meeting with Torchetti, despite the obvious discussion about whether his vision for the future aligns with Fletcher's vision, was to deconstruct what happened with the team down the stretch as Fletcher begins the intel and analysis phase of the offseason.\nBut as much as Fletcher said last week he's in no rush to hire a coach, the timetable clearly was accelerated once Boudreau was fired Friday by the Ducks.\nThe last time Boudreau was unemployed, that lasted two days. And with the Wild and Ottawa Senators the only two current teams looking for coaches besides Anaheim, Fletcher had to get a move on it. Boudreau indicated to the Orange County Register's Eric Stephens today that he doesn't want to take a break and does hope to coach another team next season.\nPer sources, Fletcher received that permission from GM Bob Murray and touched base with Boudreau, although a formal in-person interview has not yet taken place.\nIt is very likely that Ottawa, which has also interviewed Mike Yeo, has also sought and received permission as well.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple conversations,\u201d Boudreau told the Orange County Register. \u201cI can\u2019t delve into it right now. Let\u2019s put it this way, this is why my voice is so bad. I couldn\u2019t talk at all Sunday. I\u2019ve been on the phone all day Friday and Saturday. For 15 hours a day, it was pretty crazy.\"\nBoudreau, like Yeo, has a year left on his contract (which is why permission must be granted).\nSpeaking of that, it's believed on that same phone call with Murray, Fletcher asked about the status of Ducks assistant coach Paul MacLean. I've been led to believe Fletcher has yet to receive permission to talk with MacLean. If that's true, it likely means MacLean, the former Senators head coach, is a candidate to replace Boudreau in Anaheim. That would make sense since MacLean was Murray's hire in the first place.\nIn addition, as I reported in my Boudreau piece in Saturday's paper here, sources told me that Fletcher did plan to contact Randy Carlyle. I don't know if that contact has been made yet with the former Ducks and Maple Leafs coach.\nBoth Boudreau and Carlyle live in southern California, so if Fletcher's planning a trip there, he could conceivably kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."}

Unlike so many of his competitors, he had not been trying to discipline himself into the role of president since adolescence. For good and ill, he had fewer inhibitions about what he\u2019d say. His verbal incontinence leads him to lie and mislead. But it also led him to be candid in a way that some voters clearly enjoyed. The campaign playbook can be rewritten every election cycle by the winners. Barack Obama\u2019s digital outreach was hailed as genius, because he won. Trump\u2019s ability to command free media and his repetitive sloganeering from the podium at his rallies were credited for his success.\nAmerican governance is less amenable to this kind of revision. And in office, Trump\u2019s inexperience is more and more exposed. Was anyone surprised that in a battle of political will with Nancy Pelosi, a political lifer and the daughter of a Baltimore mayor, Trump got the short end? You shouldn\u2019t be. This inexperience, combined with unusual and disruptive staff turnover at the White House and slow hiring throughout the executive branch, means that Trump has had trouble imposing his will on the political process. He\u2019s had trouble even grasping the political dynamics at work.\nSome Republicans should be grateful for Trump\u2019s inability to impose his will. He\u2019s depended on the Federalist Society to help him choose and vet judicial picks that keep his electoral coalition intact. In his first years in office, the Republican-led Congress worked on its own preexisting agenda. It spent time trying and failing to do a direct repeal and replace of Obamacare. Then it moved on to tax cuts. Trump\u2019s contribution to that debate was to set targets for the overall corporate tax rate. This was hardly the \u201cworker\u2019s party\u201d that he promised.\nNow, as Democrats take control of the House and gear up for their 2020 primary, Trump has been left in a desperate scramble. His signature campaign promise was a \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d along the southern border. As Ann Coulter can\u2019t help but remind him, not a single brick has been laid. By wasting two years of unified control of the government, he leaves himself in a very weak position when a future opponent points out that he is unable to make a deal.\nDonald Trump invited the public to see him as responsible for the longest government shutdown in history. He threw a gauntlet down and asked Democrats to battle him in a test of will. But when New York airports started turning away flights, he caved and promised another future test of political will \u2014 that he is also likely to lose.\nHis lack of discipline also allows established interests to run around him. Trump called for a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. (They had no congressional mandate to be there.) But America\u2019s leading policymakers did not want to give up the American mission in Syria, and so have delayed, or even redesigned, it so that the same mission can be carried out with only a technical conformity to the president\u2019s wishes. Trump announced a policy, but diplomats are telling allies and other actors in the region that the policy is still being formed. In this way, Trump\u2019s presidency isn\u2019t just unsuccessful, but risky. His lack of personal discipline results in a lack of leadership, inviting an on-the-ground emergency that could potentially spill over into a legitimacy crisis for the U.S. government.\nOn a policy level, Trump\u2019s presidency is now firing blanks: Lots of noise, but nothing targeted"}

Clinical trials using Cas9 clippers to fix genetic defects are just beginning, so it will be years before Crispr-based cures could potentially reach the world.\nBut Crispr tech could actually be showing up in your doctor\u2019s office way sooner. Not to treat what ails you, but to diagnose it.\nToday, Doudna joined with researchers from her lab at UC Berkeley and bioinformaticians from Stanford to launch the first commercial Crispr platform for detecting disease-causing DNA. Called Mammoth Biosciences, the startup is developing point-of-care diagnostic tests that work by using Crispr to pick up bits of genetic material circulating in your blood, spit, or urine\u2014say, a few copies of Zika virus left behind by a mosquito, or some mutations in a cancer cell shed from a tumor.\nThey\u2019re not the only scientists working on this new Crispr capability, but they are the first to finance a company for its use. \u201cThere are these really amazing biosensing properties of Crispr that people hadn\u2019t realized for a long time,\u201d says Trevor Martin, Mammoth\u2019s CEO and one of its five co-founders. \u201cBillions of years of evolution have given us these incredible proteins, which science is just beginning to characterize.\u201d Their goal is to use those properties to design diagnostics for the frontlines of outbreaks and in hospital emergency rooms, places where patients don\u2019t have days to wait to send samples off to labs for testing.\nOne of those incredible proteins is Cas12a, formerly known as Cpf1. In a paper published in Science in February, Doudna and two other Mammoth co-founders, Janice Chen and Lucas Harrington, showcased how Cas12a could accurately identify different types of the human papillomavirus in human samples. Like Cas9, Cas12a latches on to a DNA strand when it reaches its genetic target, then slices. But then it does something Cas9 doesn\u2019t: It starts shredding up any single-stranded DNA it finds.\nSo the researchers decided to hack that hunger for nucleotides. First they programmed Cas12a to chop two strains of HPV that can cause cancer. They added it, along with a \u201creporter molecule\u201d\u2014a piece of single-stranded DNA that releases a fluorescent signal when cut\u2014to test tubes containing human cells. The samples that had been infected with HPV glowed; the healthy ones didn\u2019t.\nMartin wouldn\u2019t disclose which Crispr systems Mammoth would be using, saying only that the company is confident in the technology it has exclusively licensed from UC Berkeley. And because patent applications are secret for the first 18 months after they\u2019re filed, there\u2019s no good way to know exactly which Crispr system Mammoth is working with. But with Chen and Harrington and Doudna all coming on board, all signs point to Cas12a.\nThat could potentially present a problem, since the Broad Institute\u2019s Feng Zhang filed gene editing patents on Cas12a back in 2015, and licensed them to Editas Medicine for its work pursuing human therapeutics.

For instance, as Thailand is an important manufacturing base for auto parts, the government should support the industry\u2019s foundations to add value to and make the most of the high-speed train.\nThe Thai government is to build four high-speed rail lines \u2014 Bangkok-Chiang Mai at 745km (costing Bt229 billion), Bangkok-Nongkhai at 615km (Bt201 billion), Bangkok-Rayong at 221km (Bt72 billion), and Bangkok-Padang Besar at 982km (Bt297 billion).\nNext articleHealthy exercise \u2013 Does that include sexercise?"}

What is this stuff that Wegmans calls the hottest trend in beverage?\nKombucha is a fermented tea beverage that many people say make them feel good.\nWegmans says it's the hottest trend in beverage.\nMeet Rochester's kombucha brewers: Timbucha, RocBucha, Katboocha and more.\nMore kombucha makers are coming soon.\nA cloudy home brew made with a floating, gelatinous disk used to be a beverage found mostly among the hippie and health-conscious crowd. Now, kombucha is a burgeoning part of the craft beverage industry and Rochester-area entrepreneurs are jumping in.\nIts sales have skyrocketed in part because it contains bacteria believed to be beneficial to the gut, and many enthusiasts profess that it cures various ailments and generally makes them feel better. There's little scientific data to back up these claims, though, and a few people have experienced adverse effects, though these may have come from home brews.\nKombucha is a beverage that dates back centuries and is thought to have originated in China. A sweetened tea is fermented by using a SCOBY \u2013 an acronym for Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast \u2014 the rubbery disc that sits atop the tea during fermentation.\nThe end result is a fizzy brew that has a vinegary tartness and undertones of yeast and tea. It tastes somewhat akin to a non-alcoholic, sour beer. Many producers put their own spin on the flavor by adding fruit juices, herbs and other flavorings, sometimes during a second fermentation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hottest trend in beverage right now,\" said Joe LoMaglio, a group manager for non-alcoholic beverages for Wegmans.\nWegmans started carrying kombucha about a decade ago. In the early stages, the grocery store chain carried about 12 different items; that has grown to more than 70 in all. In the past two years, kombucha sales have grown at a double-digit rate at Wegmans, LoMaglio said.\nKombacha sales in the U.S. grew 44 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to Genevieve Lee Aronson, vice president of communications for the Nielsen Company. Kombucha Brewers International, a trade association, predicts that kombucha will be a $1.8 billion business by 2020.\nThe largest growth is coming from what the organization calls accidental entrepreneurs \u2014 people who started making kombucha at home and then decided to start making it commercially, said Hannah Crum, president.\nThese are the kind of entrepreneurs leading the way in the nascent kombucha brewing movement in Rochester.\nA neighbor gave Jesse Horning a gelatinous disc that looked a little like raw chicken, along with two versions of directions for making kombucha, so she started brewing it in 2014.\nHorning got more and more precise with her batches to better understand and replicate the process. She eventually moved her operation to a back room at Avvino, the Brighton fine dining restaurant where she worked. The Rochester Institute of Technology graduate in her mid-20s would go into work early or stay late to work on her batches. Owners Janine"}

More than 5,000 New Jersey children each year are found to have above-average lead contamination. In 2012, about 1,043 of them lived in New Jersey\u2019s seven southern counties, especially Cumberland and Atlantic counties.\nThousands more \u2014 mostly minority children in impoverished city neighborhoods \u2014 are at risk. Lead is found in old paint chips and dust, playground soil and even some imported candies.\nBut since 2004, the state has steered at least $53.7 million into its general treasury instead of its Lead Hazard Control Assistance Fund, as required by the law that created the fund, according to the Office of Legislative Services, a bipartisan arm of the Legislature.\nThe 2004 law allotted 50 cents for every can of paint or other type of coating sold. The money \u2014 $7 million to $14 million a year \u2014 was supposed to fund a loan and grant program to remove lead paint from homes and rental units.\nNot spending $100 on a home inspection \u201cwill cost you tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands (of dollars), for every child who\u2019s poisoned\u201d and needs treatment, according to Ruth Ann Norton, president and CEO of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, a nonprofit based in Baltimore that aims to stamp out childhood lead poisoning.\nWith $50 million, lead poisoning could be prevented in thousands of children, according to advocates. State legislation that would provide $10 million to the nearly empty fund has gone nowhere. A previous bill died in the state Assembly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another horrible example of the governor taking money that was designated for an important purpose and putting it in the general fund,\u201d said Arnold Cohen, senior policy coordinator at the Trenton-based Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.\nThe nonprofit network includes more than 250 affordable housing and community development corporations, individuals and other organizations that support the creation of affordable homes, economic opportunities and strong communities.\n\u2022The state lead fund has rarely been funded.

Among adults and teenagers, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida) noted that the risk for using drugs increases significantly in periods of changes, particularly of transitions, from one social environment to another. Nida is an attached institution of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nAmong adults, the most commonly noted high-risk changes include the loss of job and separation between spouses. However, other factors had been found significant as well. For instance, social group pressure is also prominent in initiating adults, who are otherwise drug-free, to experiment on drugs with friends.\nThe social context of drug use parallels that of the familiar drinking group culture among Filipinos. Especially on Fridays, going out with the \u201cbarkadas\u201d after work keeps the stresses of the week forgotten and the joys of earning money and spending it begins. Sometimes, when the idea of using drugs is introduced in the group and most of the people in the group agrees, those who do not agree will have a hard time deciding between using the drug with friends or standing up and walking away. Group pressure is as powerful among adults, even among married adults, as it is among teenagers. Sometimes, drug use, like alcohol use, can become a social escape from economic problems. And it is a mistake to assume that those who make more money have lower financial needs.\nAmong teenagers, the most commonly noted high-risk changes include parental separation, particularly when one parent leaves the family to stay in another residence; transfer of residence, which is often associated with losses of friendships in school and in the neighborhood; transfer from school to another; and transition from elementary through middle school, which usually involves a change of school or a new set of classmates.\nBeyond these changes in the adolescent social environment, this age group may also further increase their risks to use drug with the increase in their amount of risk-taking behavior or activities. The edginess of risk-taking may be associated with a sense of euphoria that they may find in the use of drugs. Since control judgment in the brain often matures between ages 21 and 25, teenagers are prone to be tempted at experimenting with drug use but without the cognitive stability needed in judgment control. Thus, they will end up getting addicted to this illicit substance.\nThus, it is crucial that parents know their teenagers\u2019 activities to protect them from these temptations until they are old enough to make the right choice."}

The bank can cut its trend-setting rate as a way to lower the costs of borrowing and stimulate economic activity.\nThe bank, which has been on a rate-hiking path thanks to the stronger economy, has said it expects its benchmark rate to eventually settle somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent, about two percentage points lower than where it was in the early 2000s.\nAnother concern about the current framework, Wilkins said, is that lower rates may entice Canadians and investors to take on excessive risk \u2014 leaving the economy exposed to the ups and downs of financial cycles. Long-running low-rate conditions have encouraged Canadian households to amass record levels of debt.\nShe said the Bank of Canada is conducting research on alternative frameworks, including a higher target for inflation and a more flexible, dual mandate that would extend the bank\u2019s focus to also incorporate labour and other economic indicators.\nThe work, which is an effort with the federal Finance Department, is underway in the lead-up to the Bank of Canada\u2019s next five-year renewal of its inflation-control agreement with the government. The next renewal is set for 2021.\nThe bank will also look at how it can strengthen the options at its disposal when it comes to \u201cunconventional\u201d monetary policy tools, she said.

But for years, police and fire officials have largely ignored or underused it, Controller Ron Galperin said.\nTo illustrate just how siloed first responding agencies had become, Galperin analyzed the 2017 La Tuna Fire, the city's largest fire in a half-century. Fire and police officials sent out hundreds of messages on social media, the LAPD Nixle system and Twitter. However, not one message was sent on NotifyLA.\nThe public isn't using the system either. The need to opt-in to receive alerts has kept the system from wider public acceptance. Fewer than 200,000 have subscribed to alerts in a city of nearly 4 million people. Not exactly critical mass.\nOn top of that, when alerts are received, they're often in English and not duplicated in Spanish or other languages that Angelenos speak.\nOnly four messages from NotifyLA sent since its 2014 inception were in Spanish, and none were in other popular languages like Korean, Chinese, Tagalog, or Armenian. For comparison, the emergency notification system used by Los Angeles Unified School District communicates in five languages.\nThe problem was not a lack of interest in communicating with people who don't speak English. It's just that the messaging software does not accommodate other languages easily, L.A. Fire Department Chief Deputy Al Poirier said.\nThe city is switching to a new digital platform to address those issues, he said.\nWHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED?\nLeaders of the police and fire departments now agree that they need to unify their messaging behind NotifyLA.

Depending on where the emergency is happening, following the local police and fire departments on Facebook and Twitter may be your best bet.\nAnother option is signing up for LAPD's Nixle, which will get you all the public safety alerts in your area.\nAnd to cover your bases, you can still opt in to NotifyLA alerts.

{"idx": "38178", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE standards) have had a profound effect on what Americans drive, and where cars are produced. Steel has yielded to (more expensive and flimsier) aluminum and plastic parts in cars, so that hitting something at 4 or 5 miles per hour inflicts a huge amount of damage on the part that we still call a \"bumper\" even though it breaks or falls off at the slightest provocation, causing expensive damage. And smaller, flimsier cars are by the laws of physics, more dangerous to drivers and passengers.\nCars are only the beginning of the implications of this change in fundamental policy. The so-called \"alternative\" energy sources, as well as battery-powered cars, are premised on twin grounds of saving petroleum and preventing the release of CO2. Recognizing that hydrocarbons are abundant, not in shortage, helps refine the decisions to impose expensive electricity on consumers as purely based on the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis.\nThe new energy reality, thanks to fracking, is taking a while to be expressed in words and investment plans, but it will change the shape of what we drive, where we get power, and what products the American economy excels in producing. We are already seeing German chemical companies moving some production to these shores, to take advantage of far cheaper power (Germany's green restrictions have driven up power costs there significantly) and the secure availability of feedstock.\n\"It's like saying, 'I'm a big old fat guy, and food prices have dropped \u2013 it's time to start eating again,'\" said Tom Kloza, longtime oil analyst with the Maryland-based Oil Price Information Service.\nI expect we'll see the fleet on our roads start to change slowly, as auto-producers adapt to the new reality. It might even be possible that chrome trim and bumpers that actually work will make a comeback.\n1956 Chevrolet Impala (photo credit: Bull-Doser via Wikimedia Commons)."}

Two hours later, her body temperature was still nearly 106 degrees.\nWhat is the appropriate punishment for a doting parent who is responsible for his child's death? A judge eventually spared Kelly a lengthy term in prison. Still, it is a question that is asked dozens of times each year.\nSince the mid-1990s, the number of children who die of heat exhaustion while trapped inside vehicles has risen dramatically, totaling around 340 in the past 10 years.\nOne reason is a change that parent drivers made to protect their children after air-bag deaths of children peaked in 1995: They put them in the back seat, where they are more easily forgotten.\nAn Associated Press analysis of more than 310 fatal incidents in the past 10 years found that prosecutions and penalties vary widely, depending in many cases on where the death occurred and who left the child to die, parent or caregiver, mother or father.\nMothers are treated much more harshly than fathers. Although mothers and fathers are charged and convicted at about the same rates, mothers are 26 percent more likely to do time. And their median sentence is two years longer than the terms received by fathers.\nDay care workers and other paid baby sitters are more likely than parents to be charged and convicted. But they are jailed less frequently than parents, and for less than half the time.\nCharges are filed in half of all cases, even when a child was left unintentionally.\nIn all, the AP analyzed 339 fatalities involving more than 350 responsible parties. July is by far the deadliest month, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total.\nA relatively small number of cases \u2014 about 7 percent \u2014 involved drugs or alcohol. In a few instances, the responsible parties had a history of abusing or neglecting children. Still others were single parents unable to find or afford day care.\nMany cases involved what might be called community pillars: dentists and nurses; ministers and college professors; a concert violinist; a member of a county social services board; a NASA engineer. And it is undisputed that none \u2014 or almost none \u2014 intended to harm these children.\n\"When you look at overall who this is happening to, it's some very, very, very good parents \u2014 might I say, doting parents,\" says Janette Fennell, founder and president of Kids and Cars, a nonprofit group that tracks child deaths and injuries in and around automobiles.\n\"But no one thinks it's going to happen to them. I think people are lying if they say that there wasn't one situation in raising their child that, 'There but for the grace of God go I.'\"\nThe AP's analysis was based largely on a database of fatal hyperthermia cases compiled by Fennell's organization. The AP contacted medical examiner's offices in several states where this most often occurs, and the group's numbers coincided almost exactly with recorded hyperthermia deaths.\nSome of these children crawled into cars or trunks on their own, but most were left to die by a caregiver.

I flipped to the Cubs just in time to see Heyward crush a fastball for a walk-off grand slam. There were so many discordant things about that moment. That Heyward hadn\u2019t been pulled for a pinch hitter, as we\u2019ve grown accustomed to seeing. That Heyward had delivered. That the left-handed-hitting Heyward had homered against a left-handed pitcher.\nInto the right-field bleachers it went, and into orbit Wrigley Field went.\nI was not aware that Heyward had that kind of power. Oh, there had been rumors, but those had been from years back, when he was in Atlanta.

Heyward and a record? Are you kidding?

This piece is an extension of that study and incorporates the departure of White House Counsel, Don McGahn. Once again, I relied on the National Journal\u2019s series \u201cDecisionmakers.\u201d (Published at the beginning of each administration from Reagan through Obama, this special issue identifies the most influential aides to an incoming president.) An inventory of these many positions revealed that twelve were mentioned in every single edition (I call these \u201cTier One\u201d positions), and presumably reflect the \u201ccr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u201d within the ranks of presidential advisers.

This office has been aptly described as the \u201chub of all presidential activity\u201d. Facing the prospect of a Democratic House after the midterm elections and a subsequent onslaught of oversight investigations, such an electoral result has the capacity to overwhelm the office. The White House Counsel\u2019s office is responsible for formally responding to congressional subpoenas, preparing administration officials for testimony, and fulfilling document requests, amidst myriad existing duties. Staff members shift to crisis-mode while the president\u2019s agenda gets sidelined. Adding a degree of difficulty for the current administration is the skeletal nature of the current White House Counsel\u2019s office. According to the Washington Post, this office typically operates with 50 lawyers and is now down to 25, including the loss of four of its five key deputies.\nHiring additional lawyers before the midterm elections could prove to be a challenge, but recruitment should be Mr. Cipollone\u2019s top priority.

{"idx": "38197", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: This installment of the Purple Duck Storeroom series clocks in at 13 pages, 1 page front cover, 2 pages of SRD, leaving us with 10 pages of content, so let\u2019s take a look!\nWell, before we do \u2013 many of you will know already that I\u2019m a pretty big fan of Downtime-rules, crafting and the like. But the matter of the fact is that not all campaigns will take to these rules to the same extent; indeed, there are campaigns where time is of the essence or where, within a vast dungeon-complex, establishing a crafting base, keeping it secure, etc., represents a complication that is simply not desired by either group or GM. As a person, I am firmly in the camp of believers that this can be a truly awesome and evocative experience\u2026but I absolutely understand why quite a few groups dislike the notion.\nIt is for said groups that this system was created. To craft an item without spending the normal labor time, a character with an item creation feat can pay 1/10th of its market price in craft points (minimum 1, rounded up). The character also must pay 1/2 the item\u2019s market value in GP and once these are spent, the item is finished the next day. The rationale is that the character had been working on the item for a while and only now has finished it. Anyone helping in the creation of items can contribute craft points \u2013 characters with the appropriate craft feat can contribute full craft points, while those that lack the respective feat can only contribute them on a 2 for 1 basis \u2013 for every 2 points spend, they pay for 1 craft point.\nMagic items require a Spellcraft check versus DC 5 + CL; failure of more than 5 on this check results in a cursed item. You may reduce craft point cost by spending more time on an item \u2013 for every 100 sp worth of work as per the Craft skill, you decrease the craft point cost by 1.\nA handy table provides some examples for items made with this system and their respective costs. Beyond these, the pdf provides Craft DCs Redux \u2013 quarterstaffs and slings or casting plaster would be very simple DC 5 items, for example, while e.g. alchemical dragons or CR 16+ traps would be extremely intricate at DC 35. The system is very simple and easy to grasp and 2 sample examples help illustrating the use of these DCs.\nThe question obviously remains \u2013 how do you get craft points and prevent them being spammed like crazy? Well, a 1st level character has 100 craft points and every subsequent level nets the new level times 100 additional craft points. Creatures of Int 3 or higher also have craft points as though their HD was equal to the level. Creatures too dumb to Craft (less than Int 3) don\u2019t get craft points and familiars, eidolons etc., i.e. all class feature creatures, don\u2019t get craft points. A handy table collects craft points gained by level and total craft points accumulated. And yes, the ardent reader may have noticed that the limitation imposed on craft points means that there is a kind-of-but-not-really crazy prepared flexibility inherent in the rules presented \u2013 though whether you perceive that as a bug or feature depends, ultimately, on your own stance.\nNow obviously, this necessitates a closer look at the item creation feats and indeed \u2013 the pdf does take a look at them \u2013 including the creation of technological and psionic items, with a handy table providing the number of craft points the"}

Boy Camara played its lead role in the 1971 CCP production and returned onstage for Tales of the Manuvu six years later. Reyes recalls lines and lines of eager audiences gradually filling the theater up to the farthest aisles, waiting for a taste of good ol\u2019 storytelling done in a brave blend of dance, rock opera and everything in between.\nReyes\u2019 production comes back to us four decades after the curtains were first raised. Having opened last March 22 \u2014 with the original singers Celeste Legaspi and Boy Camara reprising their roles along with Ding Mercado \u2014 Tales of the Manuvu runs until March 31, the last hurrah of BP\u2019s 49th season. For those of us who caught the different productions showcasing the versatility of the company dancers, the season was a thrilling ride, going from the charged medieval highs of Carmina Burana to the delicate world of fair Verona. This time, Tales of the Manuvu refreshingly returns us to familiar ground. Like listeners of old gathered around a glowing fire, we witness a retelling of the Manobo tribe\u2019s creation story: how gods brawled, how man took shape, how worlds transformed. Every culture has its myths, but to hear them told through rock is a real feast.\n\u201cI was doing a lot of Filipino stories,\u201d says Reyes. \u201cMost of them were very heavy drama, like somebody\u2019s always going to get killed or castrated.\u201d When she finally decided to do something light but with an equally local character, the result was Tales of the Manuvu. When she read the Manobos\u2019 folk tales in an article by Arsenio Manuel, she felt that they would make good material for a new ballet piece.\nEach night, a set of three singers \u2014 who play the voices of the characters \u2014 narrate the story. The beat shifts with the scene. A fast, dynamic rhythm, like the pulse of a world quickly waking, introduces us to the Manobo legend. The music turns gentle, slow, and humming in the tender moments when the first man and woman are created. The two dancers, as though discovering what their bodies can do for the first time, follow small endearing movements and then shift to larger strides that command space onstage. In the latter part comes the familiar \u201cNoong Unang Panahon.\u201d This now-iconic melody marks a pivotal part in the myth when men were changing, nature was becoming less benign, and the gap between land and sky was expanding.\nTales of the Manuvu may be a creation story, but as a season ender, it\u2019s also a tribute to the many worlds that Ballet Philippines has helped shape. For five decades now, it has created a breeding ground for talent and collaboration. The show, as it is, celebrates creation. Where dance meets rock and myths are set to music, it clearly makes a case for how brave worlds are born in theater.\nTales of the Manuvu runs until March 31 at the CCP Main Theater.

The series continues with the San Diego Chargers.\nA better question is \"what's not changing?\" The San Diego Chargers finally blew up the tag-team of general manager A.J. Smith and head coach Norv Turner, replacing them with ex-Indianapolis Colts executive Tom Telesco and former Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy. Ex-Arizona Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt will take over play-calling duties as the offensive boss. McCoy and Whisenhunt both cited the opportunity to work with quarterback Philip Rivers as a primary reason for landing in San Diego. John Pagano stays on as defensive coordinator, though he will be charged with overseeing a rebuilding effort.\n\u00bb RG Louis Vasquez: The one bulwark on an offensive line decimated by injuries and ineffectiveness, Vasquez is highly regarded by NFL scouts. Turning 26 this offseason, he will join the Buffalo Bills' Andy Levitre as the top guards on the market.\n\u00bb CBs Quentin Jammer/Antoine Cason: Clearly in the decline phase of a rock-solid career at age 33, Jammer is coming off his second consecutive subpar season. Cason struggled in coverage at times, but came on strong at the end of the season. He could command as much as $5 million per year on the open market.\n\u00bb OLB Shaun Phillips: Turning 32 in May, Phillips is nearing the end of the line after racking up 69.5 sacks in nine seasons with the Bolts. With San Diego's minimal salary-cap space, he could join former coach Norv Turner in Cleveland while easing the transition to Ray Horton's 3-4 defense.\nTake a look at the best photos from the San Diego Chargers 2012 season.\nOther key free agents: LG Tyronne Green, DE Vaughn Martin, DT Aubrayo Franklin, RB Ronnie Brown, K Nick Novak.\nThe No. 1 priority is overhauling an offensive line that had Rivers under pressure throughout the 2012 season. Both guard spots and left tackle must be addressed in the next couple of months. Tailback depth is a concern with Ryan Mathews coming off surgeries to both clavicles in the past eight months. The defense has promising talent up front, but needs an infusion of youth at linebacker and in the secondary.\nEight starters are due to reach unrestricted free agency; the majority will be moving on. Restricted free agent Danario Alexander will likely be retained via a first-round tender after emerging as Rivers' go-to receiver in the second half of the season. The Chargers can't afford to dump free-agent bust Robert Meachem, as his $5 million salary is fully guaranteed and would count $10.625 million against the cap if the receiver was released.\nLeft tackle Jared Gaither is a poor bet to return after alienating teammates with his reported malingering in 2012. Expect early-round draft picks or veteran free-agent additions at tackle, guard, and cornerback."}

The troops are also building a headquarters for themselves.\nBut the revelation of U.S. military personnel so close to the 19-month-old Syrian conflict suggests an escalation in the U.S. military involvement in the conflict, even as Washington pushes back on any suggestion of a direct intervention in Syria.\nIt also follows several days of shelling between Turkey and Syria, an indication that the civil war could spill across Syria's borders and become a regional conflict.\n\"We have a group of our forces there working to help build a headquarters there and to insure that we make the relationship between the United States and Jordan a strong one so that we can deal with all the possible consequences of what's happening in Syria,\" Panetta said.\nThe development comes with the U.S. presidential election less than a month away, and at a time when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has been criticizing President Barack Obama's foreign policy, accusing the administration of embracing too passive a stance in the convulsive Mideast region.\nThe defense secretary and other administration officials have expressed concern about Syrian President Bashar Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons. Panetta said last week that the United States believes that while the weapons are still secure, intelligence suggests the regime might have moved the weapons to protect them.

He was 89.\nHe was elected as the state's 35th governor in 1982 when a massive absentee voting campaign edged him just ahead of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.\nAs governor from 1983 to 1991, Deukmejian ran a law-and-order administration, expanding the state prison system, bringing the left-leaning California Supreme Court to the center and supporting tough, anti-crime legislation.\nSteve Merksamer, who worked with Deukmejian in the attorney general's office and later as his gubernatorial chief of staff, described the former governor as \"decent, humble and gracious\" and someone who \"demanded honesty and integrity.\"\nDeukmejian's greatest moment, he said, was his advocacy for California to divest from South Africa during apartheid, a move that was controversial at the time.\n\"This was an act of enormous political courage,\" Merksamer said.\nDespite a few notable exceptions, Deukmejian made his opposition to new taxes and increased government spending a focus of his political career. His favorite phrase was \"commonsense,\" which in many cases translated into \"cut\" or \"stop.\"\nHe earned the nickname \"The Iron Duke\" from his Republican supporters in the Legislature for his resistance to spending increases and his willingness to veto spending proposals.\n\"He had a very short agenda, which in terms of a governor is not all that bad,\" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. \"Basically, to not increase taxes and to deal with law enforcement, and he did it.\"\nAfter he eliminated a $1.5 billion deficit, Deukmejian declared in a State of the State address that he had \"taken California from I-O-U to A-OK.\"\nBut his reputation for prudent fiscal management was based in part on the robust national economy of that time. In the final months of his administration, a nationwide economic slowdown eroded state tax receipts, leaving his successor, Pete Wilson, with a deficit greater than the one Deukmejian inherited from Democrat Jerry Brown.\nDeukmejian led the largest prison expansion platform in state history, said Merksamer.

A report claims the superstar couple wanted to shoot a music video at Buckingham Palace, but their request was denied. Gossip Cop looked into the story.\nThe outlet, however, doesn\u2019t provide a single piece of proof to back this narrative up. Gossip Cop suspects it was manufactured only because of reports last month that claimed Beyonce and Jay-Z were rejected when they requested to film at the Colosseum in Rome. It seems the publication is mimicking that storyline and subbing in another historic venue.\nBut Gossip Cop spoke with a Buckingham Palace spokesperson, who laughed off these claims as untrue. The palace does have a filming policy, such as mandating that \u201crequests must be received at least one month before the preferred date of filming,\u201d but it seems this is one application that was never received. It should also be noted that the tabloid has a history of spreading phony allegations about all of the parties involved here.\nIn March, for example, there was a whole cover story about Queen Elizabeth abdicating the throne so Prince William and Kate Middleton could become king and queen. Just one month later, she formally endorsed Prince Charles to lead the Commonwealth. Also in March, the magazine wanted readers to believe Beyonce was considering kicking Jay-Z off their \u201cOn The Run II\u201d tour. Meanwhile, only days ago the couple started the second leg of the concert series without a hitch.\nIn another recent flub, Gossip Cop observed that a full year had passed since the outlet falsely claimed Beyonce and Jay Z were on the brink of a divorce.

The package also includes the provision of a node (optical termination box) from Luminous Networks allowing businesses adjacent to metropolitan area networks (MANs) to connect to the fibre ring.\nThe package is a managed solution that includes the provision of fibre into offices in Ireland and the US with a virtual private network between the two countries.\nSmart Telecom was formed when founder Oisin Fanning raised \u20ac2.5m in private equity funding, which he used to buy the prepaid call cards business of Switchcom for \u20ac600,000. Fanning went on to acquire the phonebox business of Alphyra for \u20ac2.4m as well as a further 600 payphones from Esat BT, which divested itself of this business for a sum of \u20ac1.2m.

A further 100 jobs are to be created in Cork following the lighting of the MAN there.\nThe company in recent months revealed plans to use the Cork metropolitan area network (MAN), the largest of the 19 MANs being created by the Government, to connect with the 28 main business parks around Cork. The company has already established a network node, or point of access, at the National Software Centre in Cork.\nSmart has also signed a contract with ESB Telecom to connect the Cork MAN with its own 120km fibre optic network around Dublin, using ESB\u2019s \u20ac50m 1,300km network that connects with 11 of the 19 proposed MANs.

Sounds good on the surface, but dig a little deeper and it has actually been a challenging opportunity. I am filling the shoes of a longtime broker beloved by his agents who has chosen to retire.\nPeople\u2019s responses to change are varied, but tend to lean towards the apprehensive and fearful side of the spectrum. I\u2019ve had to find myself reassuring agents that their world is not crumbling around them and that all will be well as I help them build and grow their business.\nDuring this exciting and interesting week I had the opportunity to spend several hours with an agent I have been trying to recruit. Her story reminded me of the principle of abundance and the power behind it.\nThis agent got her license four years ago. Yeah, right as the market was heading south, she jumped into real estate with both feet. She actually feels that she was lucky to get in when she did. As agents around her were complaining about the market, she didn\u2019t know any better and just went to work.\nShe found an interesting niche in the market by partnering with the local high school\u2019s sports programs. Armed with her love of photography, she started attending games and taking high-quality photos of the kids as they competed. She would then post these to her website and make them available free of charge to the kids and their parents to use. In addition, she supported the sports programs, sponsored the snack shack, and even created special books for the seniors containing their highlights. Both the kids and their parents love her; in fact, many of the kids call her mom!\nThere is a very powerful lesson in that statement. Not that I was trying to intimidate her with the thought of us competing against her, but she knew, without a doubt, that there was plenty of opportunity out there and that the pie was big enough for both of us. Immediately, I knew I needed to have this agent in my office, simply for her attitude of abundance.\n1. You have to give before you get. You wouldn\u2019t go to your bank to withdraw money you hadn\u2019t already deposited, would you? So many agents think the business owes them something, when they haven\u2019t made the necessary deposits. This agent made tremendous deposits in her community, and they\u2019ve paid handsomely. She closed 33 transactions last year \u2014 just from the high school group!\n2. \u201cBe a baker, not an eater.\u201d This quote is from Guy Kawasaki and takes the pie concept to a new level. A baker knows he can make more pies \u2026 an eater thinks there is only one pie. There\u2019s freedom in believing that you can bake more pies. You increase your choices and opportunities with this outlook.\n3. \u201cIn the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.\u201d Albert Einstein knew a little something about facing challenges and finding solutions. The agent I am hoping to recruit is actually trying to create difficulty and change to find opportunity. She just let go of her assistant and team and is looking to make a change, all for the purpose of resetting and finding new opportunities.\nGoing through a change myself, I found the lessons she reminded me of to be both timely and helpful. I hope it struck a chord with you as well. Now get busy baking!"}

But the profits of developers who had invested in townships on the basis of the old law might take a hit.\nPrecious property: The Mumbai skyline. Developers who built townships based on the old law are expected to take a hit on profits, as exemptions were granted on condition that they develop basic infrastructure.\nExisting developers will have to compete with new realtors who will not only benefit from buying land at softer prices following more land being available in the market but also have the benefit of the local government taking on the cost of infrastructure such as roads, water supply, sewage lines and electricity distribution lines within townships, said Kumar Gera, chairman of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India, a lobby representing real estate developers. The cost of new infrastructure could make a difference of up to 20% of the project cost, he said.\nAccording to a recent report on integrated townships by real estate consultant firm DTZ, 12 townships are being planned in Mumbai and Pune on a total of 8,053 acres. Typically in Mumbai, land costs are between 50-80% of total project cost depending on the area, with the interest costs an additional 12-13%.\nAcross the state, about 17,000 acres of land is expected to be released into the market on account of the repeal of the Act. While upmarket locales in Mumbai such as south Mumbai, tony suburbs such as Bandra, Khar and Santa Cruz have little vacant land, the repeal is expected to trigger development in surburbs, such as Kandivali and Malad in the west where land lies vacant, and Thane and beyond among the central suburbs. It would also release land in tier II cities such as Pune, Nagpur and Nashik.\nMany planned townships are likely to benefit from the repeal of the law as they are still at the clearance stage, said Anuj Puri, chairman Jones Lang Lasalle Meghraj, a real estate consultancy firm. Under the state\u2019s laws, developers were granted exemptions to build on land meant to be acquired under the Act, if they promised to develop basic infrastructure in the area.\n\u201cThe newer townships will benefit from softer land prices and quicker take-off time. This could put pressure on the (existing) developer\u2019s margins in two ways: his own costs will remain at previous levels while his neighbour\u2019s will have come down. But he will still have to compete to give a better product,\" said Puri.\nStill, the existing townships will benefit from the repeal as the developers no longer have to wait for government clearances, shortening project execution time by as much as year and saving on interest.\nFor instance, Mumbai based developer Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd\u2019s (HDIL) new township at Kharadi on the outskirts of Pune will be completed six months to a year ahead of time. \u201cThat will be a saving for us as the time lag between buying land and getting ULC clearance was around six months to a year,\" Hari Pande, HDIL\u2019s vice-president for finance, said.

And what better way to kick it off than to create a spring garden at home?\nIf you'd like to get your hands dirty, but your personal finances are tight, check out these five tips for creating a budget-friendly spring garden.\n1. Make your own compost: Creating your own compost is a great way to save money, according to the University of Illinois Extension. Purchase or build a small wooden bin and add coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable waste, some twigs, grass clippings, leaves and a bit of dirt. Don't add meat or dairy products to your compost heap -- although, a small amount of used egg shells can be good for the soil. Keep your compost slightly moist and turn it with a shovel once per week.\n2. Get plant seeds for free: Check out the websites Freecycle and Craigslist for free plants, and visit HeirloomSeedSwap and Seed Savers Exchange, which host seed swaps. Do some research at your public library or on the Internet to see if there's a local garden club you can join or plant exchange you can participate in. And, you can also use seeds from the fruits and vegetables you buy to eat.\n3. Reduce pesticide use: Karen Bussolini is a lifelong gardener, garden photographer, writer, speaker, NOFA-Accredited Organic Land Care Professional and an eco-friendly garden coach. She says you should \"plant flowers that attract beneficial insects and let them do the dirty work of pest patrol while you enjoy their beauty. Any daisy-shaped flower and most herbs will feed pollinators and tiny insects that consume pests.\"\n4. Use a rain barrel: A rain barrel is a great way to reduce your gardening water bill, according to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. However, it needs to be more involved than just sticking a garbage can out back next to your garden. Place one under your downspout so it collects more rain, and get a spigot that you can connect to a hose. You can likely find a decent one on eBay for about $50.\n5. Get your soil tested: Where I live, soil can be tested for just $3, so instead of paying $50 for a testing kit, check the diagnostic or extension services tabs on your county's website. This information can help guide you in the right direction when choosing plants for your garden. You can also find out what additives you may need to improve your soil's quality.\nOnce your garden is up and running, give it the same love and care you did when you created it. Get the kids involved with weeding and write out a watering schedule if you don't have automatic sprinklers. Saving money on a spring garden is great, but only if you put in the proper maintenance time.\nDavid Scott is a homeowner in Georgia who writes about home improvement, DIY projects, frugal living and green initiatives."}

By directing attention to the birds, Jesus challenges His followers to consider the folly of anxiety (Matt. 6:26).

Nationally, cities like Chicago that have become so-called sanctuary cities enacted similar rules to the ones that agencies across the entire state of Vermont are required to adopt.\nAll local law enforcement agencies were supposed to incorporate the core parts of the policy by July 1, which includes refraining from asking about a person's immigration status, said Rick Gauthier, executive director of the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council.\nState lawmakers left the adoption of some aspects of the policy, such as disregarding federal requests to detain undocumented immigrants until they can be picked by immigration authorities, up to the discretion of municipalities. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to cancel all federal funding for cities that enact policies of non-cooperation with federal agencies.\nBurlington police Chief Brandon del Pozo said he had concerns about the state mandating a policy that would put local law enforcement at odds with federal requests.\n\"Before we codify non-cooperation as a matter of policy, we need to understand what's at stake,\" he said.\nDel Pozo said the city's existing bias-free policing policy contains the essential elements of the state's model policy, making implementation a low priority for the department. Though the department has missed the state's July deadline, del Pozo is confident his department will update its policy in the coming weeks.\nWill Lambek, an organizer with Migrant Justice, a group that advocates for the rights of undocumented workers, disagreed with del Pozo's assertion that Burlington's current policy contains all the essential elements that the state mandates. He pointed to a section that says city police will refer undocumented foreign nationals to relevant immigration authorities only if they're suspected of conduct that's criminal in nature. That, he said, would encompass most of the people with whom the police interact.\nOn Tuesday, Eileen Blackwood, the Burlington city attorney, told a three-member committee tasked with studying how to make the city welcoming to immigrants that there are several proposals in Congress to strip federal funding from sanctuary cities, but it's unknown how the proposals will fare. She also said it was unlikely Trump would be able to block funding through executive action.\nGrand Isle County Sheriff Ray Allen said he isn't worrying about how his department's adoption of the full policy may bring them into conflict with the federal government when the administration changes. If something changes, they'll deal with it.\n\"I'm very comfortable with the entire policy,\" he said.\nLambek, whose group advocates for the rights of undocumented immigrants and had a hand in crafting the state's policy along with the Vermont Human Rights Commission and the Criminal Justice Training Council, praised the policy as one of the strongest in the country but noted that much of the enforcement of immigration law goes beyond local or state control.\nIn Chittenden County, Winooski and South Burlington are also discussing sanctuary city status and what that means, especially in the context of a Trump presidency.\nBurlington's special committee \u2014 consisting of City Council President Jane Knodell,"}

Clinical trials are testing psychedelics to curb anxiety, alcoholism, depression; help autistic adults become more pro-social, and enhance the mystical experience for all users -- the list goes on. It all began in the 1950's, when LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) were studied for their therapeutic benefits. Some of the research hot-spots included Prague, London, Boston and the unlikely town of Weyburn, Saskatchewan.\nPsychiatrist Humphry Osmond was a transplant from England to Saskatchewan. The charismatic renegade had little respect for the traditional tools of his trade like psychoanalysis or electro-shock. So Osmond and his team eventually attained 50 \u2013 90% success rates using LSD-assisted therapy for alcoholics -- putting Canada on the map for psychedelic psychiatry. It was also Osmond who coined the word \"psychedelic\".\nBut in the early 1960's, drugs like LSD and psilocybin found their way out of university labs and onto the street -- and their value as medicine was lost as their status as protest and party drugs emerged.

It manipulates binary code the way it has been programmed to do. Computers of this type will become faster and more powerful for a time, but there are already signs they are approaching limits in both hardware and software. Even without these limits, digital computers of any conceivable power will have difficulty accomplishing seemingly simple tasks. A big machine capable of running a space mission fails completely when asked to pick a face from a crowd or to drive a robot across a room full of obstacles. These sorts of problems have already been solved in nature, in an infinite variety of ways, by the associations of neurons directing living creatures. The next big jump in computing, potentially as important as the jump that created the programmable electronic computer, must be inspired by biology.\nIf the past is any guide, this will probably not occur in the likely places - the major hardware or software companies. The original electronic computer was hatched not by the big electronic firms of the time nor by the banking or insurance businesses that first profited from its development, but in an obscure corner of the military-industrial complex, by a group with lots of money and an urgent need to solve artillery trajectories. It may be that the successor to that type of machine is gestating far from the hotbeds of computerdom, in an obscure corner of the chemical business: a field called process control.\nA modern chemical plant is among the most complex of structures, involving acres of pipes, tanks, reactor vessels, distillation columns, valves, and compressors. In this it compares to other complex artifacts, such as telecom nets, computers, and power grids. The difference is that these others are susceptible to what systems people call linear control: turn the volume knob on your stereo, and you go smoothly from barely audible to ear-splitting. Electronics is like that, and though there are nonlinearities in electronics, engineers are clever enough to compensate for them and render them nearly worthless. But at the heart of every chemical plant are reactor vessels and distillation columns; reactions take place there that are nowhere near linear. Not only are chemical reactions nonlinear, but they are dynamically nonlinear: changes in heat and pressure have hard-to-control effects on outputs of usable stuff; plus, each batch has a kind of memory.\nMost of us have had domestic experience with such reactions. Consider the omelet. You start with an inedible mix of protein and fat. You add heat and air to this mix in precise amounts. At a certain moment the last increment of heat and air, indistinguishable from those that have proceeded it, produces a perfect omelet. That's nonlinearity. The dynamism is seen in the omelet's memory. If you let it go beyond the perfect point, there's no way to bring it back to perfection by, say, cooling it. You have to throw it away and start over. Although chemical engineering has been a science for a century or so now, it is still a lot more like cooking omelets than the people who run chemical companies would like.

{"idx": "38261", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Kenya or Somalia: Who owns the sea?\nFor years, Kenya and Somalia have argued over where their maritime boundary in the Indian Ocean runs. The International Court of Justice in The Hague could now decide who owns the sea, a decision that will only suit one.\nA narrow triangle off the coast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean, about 100,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles), is the bone of contention between neighboring Kenya and Somalia. Both countries want the area because it supposedly has a large deposit of oil and gas, but it's not clear to which country it belongs.\n\"The position of the boundary is a gray area,\" said Timothy Walter, a maritime border conflict researcher at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in South Africa.\nFor Kenya, however, the boundary is quite clear. It lies line parallel to the line of latitude. That gives Kenya the larger share of the maritime area and it has already sold mining licenses to international companies. But Somalia disagrees.\nThat does not seem to have worked - at least from the Somali perspective. In 2014, Somalia sued Kenya at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. The court represents one way of solving border conflicts in maritime areas if bilateral or regional attempts fail.\nIn disputed cases, a temporary boundary is drawn along a line that is at the same distance from both coastlines, if there are no physical obstacles to this. A test period is then implemented to see if this boundary is fair to both sides or if it benefits or disadvantages one or the other.\nKenya's government, however, is sticking to its preferred border demarcation. For nearly 100 years, it had considered this line to be its border, the government wrote.\nSince Kenya and Somalia had agreed to settle the dispute out of court, Kenya appealed to the court in 2015 opposing the litigation. The court now wants to hear both sides, beginning Monday and will then decide whether it will initiate proceedings.\nIf court proceedings are opened, then the decision on the border will be binding. Walker thinks that a court case is a high risk for both states. \"If the court should decide in favor of Somalia, the Kenyan border would shift dramatically,\" he said.\nThis could lead to a dispute over the maritime boundary with Kenya's southern neighbor Tanzania, which could in turn have an impact on Mozambique, Madagascar and South Africa.\nA compromise is possible, of course, at least in theory: \"Both countries could share the area and the mining of raw materials,\" Walker said. He said there is a good example in West Africa, where Nigeria and the archipelago of Sao Tome and Principe teamed up to produce oil.\nBut for Somalia and Kenya, Walker does not see any chance. \"Both countries do not want to make any compromise when it comes to their own sovereign rights. That can change, of course, but at the moment, it looks like an either-or decision,\" he said. Walker estimates that the decision will be made next year.\nOverall, experts like Walker are observing a growing trend for states, especially in Africa, to take an interest in setting their maritime borders. Walker calls it the \"end of the sea-blindness.\"\n\"Most African states lack a substantial navy or a coastguard and many conflicts have spilled over land boundaries or land borders. So historically, there has always been a focus on what is happening on land. Now, that's changing because what we can see more and more is the resources from the sea are"}

Billy Graham reports that, if there were one thing he could go back and do differently, \"I ... would have steered clear of politics.\" Pope Francis has suggested that, in today's contentious cultural climate, the Catholic Church must find a \"new balance\" between its spiritual and political missions, lest its moral foundation \"fall like a house of cards.\" And Russell Moore says today's church leaders should focus on being \"winsome, kind, and empathetic,\" realizing that although \"we are involved in the political process, we must always be wary of being co-opted by it.\"\nThere are insights in each of these claims, each coming from leaders of tremendous influence. But what enduring norms should guide Millennials who want to be Christians first and citizens second\u2014and yet take seriously the amazing privilege of shaping our nation's future? The question is often about how hard to strive, how to tilt public policy or an election in one direction rather than another.\nToday's college grads should think in terms of a decades-long engagement with civic and political life, even if it often seems broken. What principles can guide the way?\n1) It depends in part upon your calling. If God gives you a passion for public life, elections, and policymaking, this is a clue. We sorely need wise, godly public engagement\u2014especially when so many people in the policy arena fail to see value in life beyond politics (family, church, and civil society), or fail to perceive the reality of the future kingdom, as Rev. Graham reminds us.\n2) To vote well, we need to be informed about the issues shaping our future. In America today we face unprecedented federal debt and entitlement liabilities. A fundamental divide exists between statist and civil society approaches to poverty. Millions of Americans differ on the social issues\u2014especially life, marriage, and religious liberty. Christians need to think through these issues carefully, and consider how their vote impacts real people over time.\n3) Subsidiarity and solidarity help guide the way. Whenever possible, we are called to work on problems at a local level, having compassion for the vulnerable. This is especially important for those working in Washington, and those vocationally engaged in the battle of ideas. These guidelines from the Center for Public Justice can help guide our thinking, and whenever possible we should ground our best ideas in personal relationships at the local level.\n4) Economics impacts everyday life more than we often think it does. I've seen this first hand in work on AEI's Values & Capitalism project, which engages directly with Christian college students and professors. On many of these campuses there is widespread misunderstanding about the relationship between biblical principles and the economy. Wiser thinking can and should guide us\u2014and a new 32-page Economic Wisdom publication offers practical, enduring insights that can inform any of us as citizens.\n5) So should we pull back? This strikes me as the wrong question, falling prey to the \"all or nothing\" fallacy, which makes either an idol of politics or recommends full withdrawal from political engagement. A preferable question is to ask: How do we rightly engage the public square in ways that recognize Christ as Lord of all, including politics as well as all other human institutions? Those whose true identity is in Christ are free to plod steadily, consistently, and humbly"}

But it may have an inventory problem brewing.\nGM's dealer stocks in the U.S. have risen significantly during 2016, with much of the increase coming in the past few months. While crosstown rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) has been cutting production to clamp down on dealer inventory, the General continues to churn out vehicles at a high rate. This raises the risk that it will have to make even sharper cuts next year.\nDealer stocks for GM vehicles are rising rapidly. Image source: The Motley Fool.\nGeneral Motors ended 2015 with lean inventories in the U.S. Its inventory totaled 630,950 vehicles, equivalent to 61 days of supply. Most automakers would consider that an appropriate level.\nHowever, GM sells a large number of pickup trucks. (Year to date, pickups account for more than 30% of GM's U.S. vehicle deliveries.) Due to the vast number of configuration options available for pickups, it's usually prudent to carry more inventory to increase the chances that prospective buyers will find what they are looking for. Yet GM had only 60 days of inventory for pickups at the end of 2015, well below historical levels.\nAs a result, General Motors made a conscious choice to increase its inventory this year. Its U.S. vehicle stocks bottomed out just below 630,000 units at the end of January and then rose at a moderate pace over the next six months. By the end of July, GM's U.S. inventory had reached 682,170 units, or roughly 66 days of supply.\nThe increase in GM's dealer stocks was relatively modest through July. However, in the last three months, inventory has soared.\nGeneral Motors recently reported that it ended October with vehicle inventory of 834,201 units in the U.S. This means that production has outpaced sales by an average of 50,000 units per month over the past three months. GM now has 84 days of supply in inventory, compared to 75 days of supply a year earlier.\nTo be fair, there are always seasonal ebbs and flows in production and sales. Vehicle inventories usually decline during the last two months of the year. Last year, the drawdown in GM's U.S. inventory during November and December totaled 75,770 vehicles. The General needs to reduce its inventory by at least this amount in the next two months to enter 2017 in a good position.\nFord is reducing production. What about GM?\nGeneral Motors isn't the only automaker facing rising inventory as U.S. auto sales growth grinds to a halt. Ford has also built up too much inventory for multiple product lines in 2016. As of the end of June, Ford's U.S. dealer stocks had reached approximately 728,000 vehicles, up from 611,000 units a year earlier.\nSome of that increase was planned, as inventory of the new 2015 Ford F-150 was still very tight in mid-2015. However, some of the increase was unexpected, and so Ford moved quickly to reverse the buildup. During Q3, Ford reduced its U"}

Most email trackers use an \"invisible\" web beacon \u2014 usually a small white pixel \u2014 to track email. When you open an email with a beacon in it, your computer accesses the image file, which is then reported to whoever is tracking you.\nMost of these services can tell you a lot more than just whether or not an email has been opened. They can tell you when and where it was opened, and how many times. They can tell you if multiple people \u2014 or at least multiple IP addresses \u2014 opened the message. Some, like Mixmax for example, can tell you if the files you sent have been downloaded, or the links you included have been clicked, too.\nEmail tracking was for most of its history pretty much confined to the world of marketing. The majority of the email trackers out there \u2014 some of which have been around for over a decade \u2014 were initially built for salespeople. customer relationship management (CRM) is a software industry worth billions of dollars, and the ability to measure the impact and engagement (industry terms for attention spent, basically) of the emails you send is a big part of it.\nBoomerang is an email scheduling app that also offers optional read receipts, a feature that is growing in popularity, with usage up 14% in the last year.

You also get cloth upholstery in stripey blue and a wide front license plate mount. These are things that any German taxi driver will recognize and summarily ignore but their uniqueness here is noteworthy.\nI wasn\u2019t kidding about those German cabbies, as this car is set up as kind of a cheap-seats Benz, one that might take you from FBB to the Hotel Alexanderplatz without fuss. The mill is an OM602, a 2,497-cc normally aspirated SOHC five-cylinder that pumps out 90 horsepower.

A concern for technical accuracy and proper placement was evident throughout the evening. But the dancers were also aware that ballet is an art of the stage as well as the studio, and they performed with theatrical assurance.\nThe New Jersey troupe, founded in 1958, has its headquarters in West Orange and is a resident company of Kean College in Union and the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn. Several influences have shaped its style. Carolyn Clark, its director, has danced with American Ballet Theater. Its artistic advisers include Eleanor D'Antuono, a former leading dancer of that company; Edward Villella, a former star of the New York City Ballet, and Leonid Kozlov, a former member of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow who is now a principal dancer of the New York City Ballet.\nMr. Kozlov staged Soviet versions of two 19th-century pas de deux originally choreographed by Marius Petipa. Rosemary Sabovick and Viorel Berinde gave a crisp, clear account of ''Satinella.'' Mr. Kozlov was guest artist in ''Le Corsaire.'' His pirouettes were exciting, and both he and Lori Christman, his partner, made sure that this flamboyant pas de deux never grew hammy.\nThe evening's most striking dramatic performance was that of Sally Ann Mulcahy in ''Le Combat,'' William Dollar's ballet about a duel between a Christian and a Saracen warrior during the Crusades. When the Saracen's helmet is removed, the knight is revealed to be a woman. Mr. Dollar uses outstretched arms to symbolize lances and prancing and galloping steps to indicate that the dancers are on horseback.\nLooking fierce and taut, Ms. Mulcahy commanded the stage, proving a formidable opponent to the elegant Shi Hui, who portrayed the Crusader who came to realize that he loved her. Elie Lazar, Robert Remington and Darren Redick were fine as other knights.\nTwo works showed off the company as a whole. Vicente Nebrada choreographed ''A Dance for You'' as a cascade of solos, pas de deux and ensembles for five couples to rippling waltzes (played by Paul Suits) by Teresa Carreno. The ballet rambled a bit, but each variation was neatly constructed and the dancing was lucid.\nRobert North, an American choreographer who has worked extensively in England, set ''Let's Go South'' to jazz and blues recordings. It resulted in a romp, a rather self-consciously jolly one, unfortunately.\nThe music was often more gritty than the choreography. When in an attempt to invest the ballet with a touch of seriousness, Mr. North ended a pas de deux with what looked like a murder, the violence was out of keeping with the tone of the work as a whole. In other scenes, the dancers wiggled and capered charmingly; Jerome Vivona's brio was especially notable."}

It's hard to picture the person who serves us a club sandwich for lunch or bread sticks before dinner not knowing where their next meal is coming from or how they will feed their children when they get home.\nBut the reality is that many tipped restaurant workers \u2013 the bartenders, waiters, waitresses and hosts at the local Olive Garden or neighborhood burger joint \u2013 are struggling to make ends meet. They're surrounded by food, but they struggle to feed themselves and their families.\nFor tipped workers, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a lifeline. Unlike other minimum wage workers, tipped workers haven't seen their federally mandated wage increase since 1991 when it was increased by a meager 4 cents to $2.13 an hour.\nIn fact, tipped restaurant workers are twice as likely to need the support of SNAP as other working adults with one in seven restaurant workers using the program to help put food on the table.\nThe modest support of just $1.40 per person per meal that SNAP provides makes a real difference in the lives of millions. It is one of the most effective anti-poverty programs we have in this country, lifting 8 million Americans out of poverty every year, including 4 million children.\nIt's outrageous that so many in the restaurant industry have to turn to SNAP for support, but that is the unfortunate reality until our elected leaders end the two-tiered wage system and ensure that these workers, over two-thirds of whom are women, make a living wage and see improved working conditions.\nNot only are Republicans in Congress doing nothing to improve wages, now they have proposed to strip food stamps, a critical support, from millions of people across the country, including thousands of tipped workers.\nUnfortunately, U.S. House Republicans have ignored the historically bipartisan nature of the Farm Bill, which funds SNAP and is renewed every five years, and instead made partisan cuts to this vital program that helps 42 million Americans afford groceries.\nIt's difficult to understand how Republican leaders in the House of Representatives can justify cutting $17 billion from this program after voting for a $1.4 trillion tax giveaway for the very wealthy and large corporations that blows a $1.9 trillion hole in the budget. In fiscal year 2017, SNAP and other food assistance programs cost the U.S. about $70 billion.\nThe GOP tax bill significantly cut the corporate tax rates, which benefits many of very companies that pay their workers so little they have to turn to SNAP to put food on the table including the restaurant industry.\nThe cost of keeping SNAP funded and taking care of workers who don't make enough to support themselves or their families is a drop in the bucket compared to this huge tax giveaway.

The Great Khali in January 2015, the academy is the base for Continental Wrestling Entertainment (CWE), the Indian version of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the American pro-wrestling behemoth that\u2019s known for its edgy entertainment and exaggerated characters.\nWhat began as a training academy \u2014 with the CWE ring hosting the weekly Saturday night fights \u2014 has over the years evolved into a touring event, with pro-wrestling shows being held across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. But the growing popularity of CWE and pro-wrestling, with the format slowly acquiring a cult following in parts of the country, is in large measure due to its online avatar \u2014 the videos on social media platforms such as YouTube.\nThe group\u2019s latest video, uploaded on February 22 and titled \u2018CWE family shows anger on terrorism acts at Pulwama Jammu\u2019, has a four-minute tirade by a wrestler in police uniform urging \u201crevenge\u201d. The video has been viewed 1.3 million times, with abusive comments from both sides of the border.\nLike with WWE and its brand of American nationalism, Khali\u2019s version rarely strays from the \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative, with plots revolving around the Indian \u2018hero\u2019 bashing and overpowering the Pakistani \u2018villain\u2019. This concept of strong protagonists defending a nation\u2019s pride against evil foreigners in simulated contests, which are part-performance, part-sport, is as old as pro-wrestling itself.\nBut unlike in the US, where years of WWE have spawned an audience that is ready to debate problematic plots, in India, pro-wrestling, though hugely popular, remains largely a mock-sport shorn of any intellectual pretence, a pursuit whose viewers are not rushing online to debate political correctness.\nThe videos themselves are hardly subtle. But then, subtlety has never had a place in the world of professional wrestling. What matters are the eyeballs \u2014 and CWE is getting its share of those. CWE\u2019s YouTube channel has over 1.5 million subscribers, with each video averaging close to a million views.\nSpread across eight acres, the two-storey CWE academy trains 150 wrestlers, who are put up on the second floor of the building. There\u2019s a gym and a mess, and in one corner on the ground floor is Khali\u2019s office, the walls of which are covered with photographs of the WWE alumni posing with prominent personalities, including PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump.\nIn the"}

But on Tuesday, the Kardashian matriarch finally broke her silence on the issue, the Mirror reports.\nRob Kardashian sparked some controversy when he started dating Blac in January on account of the fact that the exotic performer is the mother to 3-year-old King Cairo with her ex, Tyga, who is dating Rob\u2019s sister Kylie Jenner. After learning about the relationship, Khloe kicked Rob out of her house. Since then, Rob\u2019s relationship with his sisters had been on shaky ground.\nRob seems to have patched things up with his Kardashian sisters right on his 29th birthday, as they were seen attending his birthday bash during the weekend. Khloe was the only one unable to attend due to an illness (or, at least, that\u2019s what she said). Blac Chyna also didn\u2019t attend, which proves that all is not well between her and the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know too much about their relationship. I haven\u2019t really seen her that much and I don\u2019t know her as well as everyone else. She seems like a really nice girl but I just haven\u2019t been around her,\u201d Kris said.\nKris Jenner says that she\u2019s thrilled with the progress Rob has made in terms of his health and general well-being.\n\u201cHe is doing really, really well. He is trying to be healthy and get in shape and he is also working on a couple of projects,\u201d she said.\nRob Kardashian went into hiding from the spotlight since struggling with deep depression and obesity after being diagnosed with diabetes two years ago. Rob chose to live in seclusion for the better part of two years since then.\nSince he hooked up with Blac earlier in the year, Rob appears to have turned his life around. Blac reportedly motivated the 29-year-old reality star to visit the gym on a regular basis and to maintain a healthy diet. Rob appears to have slimmed down, not to mention that he looks happier than ever.\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna haven\u2019t been exactly shy about expressing their love for each other in public, as they were seen numerous times indulging in some major PDA. On February 18, the pair were spotted making out while leaving a doctor\u2019s office in Beverly Hills. In fact, Blac and Rob stopped right in front of photographers and started kissing each other as if no one else was around.\nTheir PDA moments extend to social media as well, as the couple shared some of their tender and intimate moments on Instagram.\nEven with Blac Chyna helping turn Rob\u2019s life around for the better, the Kardashian sisters appear to be not quite ready to welcome her into the family. Rob finally getting to meet his sisters on his birthday, however, is a good start. Even if they don\u2019t openly admit it, his sisters must be grateful for everything Blac has done for their brother.\nSince he started living as a recluse two years ago, Rob Kardashian hasn\u2019t appeared in a single episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. But now that he has Blac in his life, Rob seems ready to be in the limelight again, as he is reportedly setting his sights on starring in a new KUWTK-style reality show with Blac, as reported in the Daily"}

The study, published by Cell Press in the January issue of the journal Cancer Cell, provides a solid framework for investigation of future targeted therapies that may improve the near uniformly fatal prognosis of this devastating cancer.\n\u201cPrevious work has established that gene expression profiling can be used to identify distinct subgroups of GBM,\u201d says senior study author, Dr. D. Neil Hayes from the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cHowever, the exact number and clinical significance of these was unclear.\u201d Dr. Hayes and colleagues at UNC Lineberger expanded on previous GBM classification studies and used expression profiling techniques to comprehensively analyze hundreds of GBM patient samples. The group was able to reliably identify four distinct molecular subtypes of GBM tumors.\nThe researchers, part of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, then went on to perform a unique integrative analyses across multiple platforms to look for defining characteristics associated with each subtype. Their findings were quite striking, implying that there are distinct types of GBM and that each one is associated with a specific molecular process. \u201cWe discovered a bundle of events that unequivocally occur almost exclusively within a subtype,\u201d explains Dr. Hayes.\nThe researchers also report that the nature of these events indicate that the underlying disease process for each subtype may involve distinct cells of origin at a specific stage of differentiation. This is finding has potential clinical significance as determining the cells of origin of GBM is critical for establishing effective treatment regimens. Clearly, given this new information, it makes sense that some drug classes would be expected to work for some tumor subtypes and not other. In support of this conclusion, Dr. Hayes\u2019s group found that response to aggressive chemotherapy and radiation differed by subtype.\nSignificant work on this project was shared by TCGA researchers, Dr. Roel Verhaak of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Boston and Dr. Katie Hoadley of UNC Lineberger and the Department of Genetics at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Teammate Karl Goehring made 65 saves, a tournament record that, like the game, has endured.\nIn the tournament hailed as Minnesota\u2019s signature high school sports stage, the game \u2014 before nearly 17,000 fans and a statewide television audience \u2014 still commands a certain reverence from players of that era, now in their late 30s, coaches and the sport\u2019s followers.\nApple Valley\u2019s Chris Sikich got a hug from teammate Matt Skogstad during the 1996 Class 2A final. , a victory over Edina that came the same day as the Eagles\u2019 five-OT victory.\nGoehring, who went on to star at North Dakota, enjoys annual questions about the game. Hockey players from Apple Valley to Anchorage have asked former Eagles center Chris Sikich to see a tape of it.\nThough his team lost and was victimized by a controversial no-goal play, Duluth East coach Mike Randolph upholds the game\u2019s place in history.\nDuluth East, the defending state champions, was favored to repeat, led by high-scoring forwards Dave Spehar and Chris Locker. Apple Valley, meanwhile, had lost only one game all season. A combined 18 players from those teams went on to play Division I college hockey.\nGiven the chance to relive the night that began on March 8, those players do not tire of answering questions.\nPlaying the game was another story.\nApple Valley\u2019s Brad DeFauw needed intravenous fluids at the hospital after the game. Breathing so hard between shifts left him unable to consume enough water. Locker started to go into shock and needed help removing his equipment.\nThe back-and-forth game intensified in the third period when Apple Valley\u2019s Erik Westrum, who went on to play for Minnesota and professionally, completed a hat trick to give the Eagles a 4-3 lead.\nHat tricks were Spehar\u2019s specialty, having accomplished them in five of his six state tournament games.

It was redundant evidence that Lynch runs with a determination, instinct and toughness that rivals anybody in the game.\nBut I\u2019m not sure Lynch\u2019s effort was the greatest amount of hustle on that play \u2014 his teammate, receiver Ricardo Lockette, blocked at least four Cardinals over the course of about 70 yards.\nLockette has been a special-teams ace, but his blocking ability as a receiver has gone without appropriate comment. This wasn\u2019t about great technique but unsurpassed effort. This was a display of want-to that will endear him to every teammate and coach, even if it\u2019s not the stuff of headlines.\nRookie receiver Paul Richardson also had a good block on that play, in addition to making five catches that appear to be earning him the trust of Wilson whenever he\u2019s under pressure.\nRichardson is speedy but slight of build, so his ability to contribute as a blocker is a largely unseen benefit. Of course, when everybody sees the effort Lockette puts out, nothing less is expected of the rest of the crew.\nAt the line of scrimmage, reserve center Patrick Lewis stepped up front and center, taking over for Max Unger snapping the ball and making the line calls.\nLewis is an intelligent and funny guy who has a degree from Texas A&M but is obviously eager to keep working in the NFL. He has bounced around on practice squads enough that he\u2019s learned to screen calls on Mondays and Tuesdays, when transactions usually take place involving guys on the roster fringes.\nBut line coach Tom Cable liked how Lewis handled himself in action in the first Arizona game, and gave him the start on Sunday. Backup Alvin Bailey also was an injury replacement up front, going at left tackle for Russell Okung.\nThey all did well enough that the offense picked up a franchise record 596 yards. And against a Cardinal defense that had been holding teams to 17.4 points a game, the Seahawks rang up double that total.\nAnd the Cardinals, who nailed Wilson for seven sacks in the first meeting this season, came away with just one on Sunday.\nWhen passing out credit after the game, coach Pete Carroll cited the efforts of the coordinators, Dan Quinn (defense) and Darrell Bevell (offense), for making \u201cthe greatest halftime adjustments of all time\u201d to get the team to stop being penalized. It seemed like he was joking a bit, as a backhanded critique of his team\u2019s 10 first-half penalties. But the truth is, they only had one in the second half.\nSafety Earl Thomas also cited a coach\u2019s effort afterward. Thomas said that every play the Cardinals ran on Sunday night, secondary coach Kris Richard had prepared them for during the week.\nKnowing what to expect, the Seahawks defense held the Cardinals to a scant 29 rushing yards and an ineffective 216 passing yards.\nPart of the defensive success can be attributed to pressure from the front line, including tackle Jordan Hill.

Despite that, attending charter schools improves special needs students\u2019 test scores and college readiness.\nKevin Welner, a professor of education at University of Colorado Boulder, says charter schools cherry-pick students because they need to demonstrate academic success to stay alive and get funding.\nIn a two-year study, Welner identified 14 different ways in which charter schools can shape enrollment. They range from steering families away, not advertising the school in high-need neighborhoods, setting conditions for enrollment as well as counseling students out, or in other words urging parents to find a different school for their child.\nLauren Rhim, executive director at the National Center for Special Education in Charter Schools, said new and small charter schools can indeed face struggles in serving special needs students. But she insisted that similar problems exist in the broader public school sector.\nIn the case of Nico, who started a pre-K program when he was 3, a charter school initially looked like a good option.\nAfter public school officials in D.C. offered to place Nico in a self-contained classroom in his neighborhood school, his family decided to try a charter school called Bridges, which had a reputation for being inclusive. After one year, Nico was moved into a general-education classroom and fell in love with it. Using a special communication device, he would repeat the names of his favorite classmates.\nBut toward the end his third year at Bridges, the school insisted that Nico would have to spend more time in a self-contained setting because of limited resources to support him in a regular classroom, the family said. They are now thinking about relocating.\nPaula Evans, chairwoman of an advocacy group that specializes in Nico\u2019s condition, called Angelman syndrome, says his story fits a familiar pattern. Only an estimated 15 percent of children with the syndrome in the United States have a full-time inclusive placement, 20 percent are placed in self-contained classrooms and 50 percent study in both environments.\nMichelle Lerner, spokeswoman for District of Columbia public schools, said she cannot comment on individual cases, but said the district strives to provide an inclusive environment for students as long as their needs are met. Bridges declined to comment.\nHoerst insists it is Nico\u2019s fundamental right to study alongside other children."}

The chancellor and top city officials, for their part, vowed that the aggressive policies pursued by Ms. Rhee would continue, even as her boss, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, departs after losing a Democratic primary contest to Vincent C. Gray.\nWhile Ms. Rhee, at an Oct. 13 press conference, described her imminent departure as \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d she also said Mr. Gray, who now serves as chairman of the District of Columbia Council, had a right to choose his own schools leader. Both she and the presumptive next mayor described her resignation as a mutual decision.\nMs. Henderson, who currently serves as deputy chancellor, will be able to retain the chancellor\u2019s current leadership team, Mr. Gray said. He has not decided when he will name a permanent chancellor, a spokeswoman for him said.\nThe district is a moderate-size system, serving 45,000 students, but it has received a crush of nationwide media attention under the stewardship of Ms. Rhee, who was appointed by Mr. Fenty in 2007. The chancellor pushed for several innovative and controversial changes, including a new contract with the school system\u2019s teachers that includes pay-for-performance measures. The chancellor also closed low-performing schools, and secured the authority to fire underperforming central-office workers.\nTest scores have improved under Ms. Rhee\u2019s tenure, and student enrollment has stabilized after years of decline. But many of her most high-profile decisions focused on personnel. Earlier this year, she moved to fire 241 teachers for failing to meet various performance standards. Some of those teachers had earned low scores on the district\u2019s teacher-evaluation system, known as IMPACT, created by Ms. Rhee. That system rates teachers on several factors, including their ability to produce gains in student achievement, as well as observations by administrators.\nThose actions made Ms. Rhee a national star, and the subject of often-glowing media and public attention. But her agenda angered some of the district\u2019s parents and teachers, who saw the chancellor\u2019s approach as brusque and arrogant. Mr. Gray had raised concerns about Ms. Rhee\u2019s management style and policies as a member of the Council.\nThat message seemed to resonate with District of Columbia voters, who ousted Mr. Fenty in the Sept. 14 mayoral primary.

Because of this, I think it\u2019s very important that historical sites give thorough and relatively unbiased information on these Wars that contain so many hard-learned lessons in military decisions and conduct as well as cross-cultural interaction. In this part of my project I tried to identify where the sites were commemorating the conflict thoroughly and accurately , and where sites could use more work in order to better commemorate this conflict.\nI ended up working on both primary sources and site visits at the same time, so these posts are going to come right on top of each other. It\u2019s been really interesting looking at primary sources because I\u2019ve been able to get more of an idea of the Wars from different perspectives. Granted, all of the accounts were written by Americans; however, quotes from different sources at least give an idea of the Seminole attitude, as well as the experiences of American settlers including women, and individual American soldiers \u2013 all of which are important to look at for a complete look at the Wars. I\u2019ve been looking at a variety of sources \u2013 narratives written for the public, letters between American politicians and generals, General Taylor\u2019s account of the 1838 Battle of Okeechobee, a FL General Assembly resolution, and the original Treaty of Moultrie Creek from 1823. All of these have provided an interesting perspective as to how the players in these Wars viewed the events and people involved in them."}

Although only a single case was recently diagnosed in Northern California's Alameda County and is no threat to human health, more than 1.1 million birds have been lost to VND in Southern California since May 2018, with additional cases confirmed just this past week. The poultry experts are urging preventative action to limit any further spread of this deadly avian disease. Spread of VND to California's Central Valley could be catastrophic to local economies, farming communities and backyard poultry enthusiasts.\nCalifornia is home to more than 100,000 backyard chicken flocks, and Northern California houses 95% of the state's commercial poultry industry. Effects of this disease are equally devastating to backyard poultry and commercial flocks and pose a risk to the food supply, state economy and many Northern California communities that depend on poultry and egg production.\nThe VND outbreak has prompted strict quarantines across Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties and $45 million in emergency funding from the USDA. In the first week of April, VND was detected in Arizona and is believed to be linked to the current California outbreak. The last major California VND outbreak in 2002/2003 cost nearly $170 million to eradicate. Nearly four million birds were depopulated.\nDr. Annette Jones, California's State Veterinarian, reinforced the importance of a collaborative approach, increased vigilance and biosecurity in stopping spread of Virulent Newcastle Disease. \"In partnership with Foster Farms and the California Poultry Federation, we are bringing together some of the best minds in the poultry industry to provide the latest information to owners and give them useful tools and tips to safeguard birds and report concerns,\" said Jones, who urges people to call the Sick Bird Hotline at 866-922-BIRD (2473).\n\"Although Foster Farms flocks have not been affected, our commitment as veterinarians is to ensure that all birds are protected,\" said Robert O'Connor, DVM of Foster Farms, one of the workshop speakers. \"That is why, along with the California Department of Food & Agriculture, the California Poultry Federation and UC Davis, we are sharing our knowledge and experience with backyard poultry enthusiasts. We all have a part to play in keeping our flocks safe and containing this deadly avian disease.\"\nFoster Farms, the family owned poultry company based in Livingston, Calif., and the California Poultry Federation (CPF) hosted the workshop to increase public awareness and provide access to critical resources. The seminar covered standard biosecurity measures, signs and symptoms of VND, and resources available to backyard poultry owners should birds become sick. Organizers issued an infographic outlining steps to prevent VND and encouraged participants to share the information on social media.

There\u2019s no universal example of a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment.

Or could the creation of ideas that matter \u2013 the ones that answer questions not even asked \u2013 be a far messier and more chaotic affair? Might ideas have not just one but many, many parents?

Most center around what is next for the rebuild that many thought could not happen in New York, and if it was all worth it.\nThe fans still showed up and still cheered at the few highlights to the bitter end, content to grab a free T-shirt or watch Mitchell Robinson finish off a lob as another loss was etched into the standings.

Will they take David Fizdale\u2019s relentless positivity for another season when what they see doesn\u2019t match the words? It is a true test and one that will become clear very quickly.\n1. Who\u2019s on the way?\nThe Knicks went through a nightmarish season trying desperately to keep an eye on this summer, when they would have cap space cleared and the chance to remake the franchise .\u2002.\u2002. again. Garden chairman and principal owner James Dolan has said he believes stars are coming, and nearly everyone around the league thinks the top prize \u2014 Kevin Durant \u2014 is headed to New York. The memory of this season will fade quickly if the Knicks can land a pair of max-contract stars from this deep free-agent class.\n2. Did the player development work?\nThe Knicks threw a trio of rookies \u2014 Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson and Allonzo Trier \u2014 into the deep end, giving them huge minutes and often starting and starring roles. That is a pretty good formula to challenge the worst season in franchise history. But the Knicks hope Knox now will ease into a complementary role alongside stars, no longer required to create so much for himself. And most of all, they hope Robinson can expand his offensive game and become a complete defender rather than just a shot-blocker.\n3. Can the last vestiges of Phil Jackson survive?\nFrank Ntilikina is not actually the last player from the misery that was Jackson\u2019s tenure as team president; second-round pick Damyean Dotson is. But Ntilikina is the painful reminder of what went wrong, the lottery pick who was selected to head the triangle offense. Jackson is gone, as is the triangle, and Ntilikina has gone through two seasons of trying to find his place among the Knicks. He still has some regard around the league as a defensive-minded guard with great length. But his shooting is erratic, he is a marginal offensive player in a league in which point guards flourish on that end, and his confidence often seems shot.\n4. Is it time to go?\nThe Knicks gave opportunities to a handful of discarded former lottery picks, and it produced mixed results. The common denominator for Emmanuel Mudiay, Noah Vonleh, Trey Burke, Mario Hezonja and Henry Ellenson is that all were lottery picks by other teams and are on expiring contracts. Burke already is gone, packaged in a trade, and the rest are likely to be headed elsewhere"}

Sometimes people can't distinguish a food allergy from other conditions such as lactose intolerance or gluten sensitivity, which don't fit the medical definition of an allergy.\n\"There are a lot of misconceptions about what a food allergy is,\" says Dr. Virginia Stallings, a board-certified nutrition pediatrician at the The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the chair of the committee that wrote the new report.\nOne scenario is this: A parent of a young child introduces a new food \u2014 say, milk \u2014 into the diet, and then notices the child has an upset stomach or other symptoms of gastrointestinal distress.\nThe parent may suspect a food allergy. But, perhaps, these are signs of lactose intolerance \u2014 a completely different condition.\n\"The reason food allergy symptoms are often confused with other [conditions] such as lactose intolerance is because there's an overlap in some of the symptoms,\" Stallings explains.\nAn allergy is an immune response to a food or other substance that is normally harmless. Common symptoms include hives and swelling or GI distress. Food allergies can be life threatening. Lactose intolerance, on the other hand, means a person can't easily digest the natural sugar found in milk. And, as the American Academy of Pediatrics points out in this FAQ on the topic, \"while lactose intolerance can cause a great deal of discomfort, it will not produce a life-threatening reaction such as anaphylaxis.\"\nAdding to the confusion, food allergies can be complicated to diagnose.\n\"We do not have an optimal diagnostic tool. There isn't one skin test or blood test\" that can accurately determine whether a person has an allergy to a specific food, says Stallings.\nStallings says if parents recognize clear signs of allergic reactions, such as swelling lips or difficulty breathing, they should seek emergency care.\nBut, often times, the symptoms are milder. In these cases, rather than self-diagnosing an allergy, families should see an expert, such as a pediatric allergist. The National Academies of Sciences \"committee really does recommend that people seek more expert advice,\" Stallings says.\nLots of families jump to conclusions about food allergies before being tested. \"We unfortunately see kids avoiding a food unnecessarily because of some fear of a potential allergy,\" says Bruce Lanser, who directs the pediatric food allergy program at National Jewish Health in Denver.\nLanser says the gold standard test used to diagnose a food allergy is known as an oral food challenge. Under medical supervision, patients eat small amounts of the food they may be allergic to. \"We start with a small amount of food and slowly give increasing doses up to a full serving,\" Lanser explains. If the patient has a reaction during the test, \"we obviously stop and treat.\"\nLanser says he tests many of his patients once a year to see if they've outg"}

{"idx": "38347", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Gawker Media asked a New York bankruptcy court on Tuesday to allow it to investigate the connections between billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the lawyer representing former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and other lawsuits.\nThe motion of discovery seeks documents and testimony from Facebook board member Thiel and his investment firm Thiel Capital, as well as financial agreements between Thiel and Charles Harder, the high-profile Hollywood attorney who has brought numerous legal claims against Gawker in recent years. The wide-ranging request for information draws heavily from FORBES\u2019 reporting on the litigation Harder is involved with, and could pave the way for a potential lawsuit against Thiel on the grounds that he intentionally harmed the business, said a source familiar with the situation.\nIn May, FORBES broke the news that Thiel had secretly bankrolled former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s invasion of privacy lawsuit against Gawker. Hogan was awarded more than $140 million in damages from the case, forcing Gawker and its founder Nick Denton to file for bankruptcy protection. That eventually led to the sale of Gawker media\u2019s online properties to Univision Communications in September for $135 million.\nIn addition to seeking approval for discovery, Gawker\u2019s lawyers also filed motions on Tuesday to dismiss lawsuits brought by two of Harder\u2019s other clients, Shiva Ayyadurai and Ashley Terrill. A bankruptcy lawyer for Gawker, which is now a corporate shell following the sale of its assets to Univision, declined to comment. Harder did not respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Thiel declined to comment.\nA day after FORBES revealed Thiel\u2019s involvement in the Hogan case, he admitted to funding multiple lawsuits against Gawker to the tune of $10 million. Beyond the Hogan case, Thiel did not say which cases he backed in an interview with The New York Times, and the details of his arrangement with Harder have since remained hidden.\nMultiple sources that spoke to FORBES in June said that Harder never had direct contact with the billionaire and did not know who was funding Hogan\u2019s until FORBES broke the original story of Thiel\u2019s support of Hogan\u2019s suit in May. Using a bankruptcy procedural motion called Rule 2004, Gawker\u2019s lawyers are attempting to discern the relationship between the lawyer and his financier by seeking access to any financing arrangements, communications and planning documents between Harder and his firm and Thiel and his associated entities.\n\u201cMr. Thiel is an individual who is not a creditor and who reports say is driven to a greater or lesser degree by a desire for revenge and the aim of putting the Debtors out of business,\" read Tuesday\u2019s motion, which referred to a 2007 Gawker story that discussed Thiel's sexual orientation.\nBeyond the Hogan case, FORBES has reported deeply on the connections between Harder and the myriad legal threats facing Gawker. Primarily an entertainment lawyer, Harder was involved in bringing a class action suit brought by former interns against Gawker. FORBES confirmed that Thiel\u2019s money was also used to fund the case, which was later dismissed.\nTuesday\u2019s motion also asks the court to approve discovery into Scott Sonnenblick, a partner at the New York-based M&A law firm Linklaters, who FORBES reported had contacted former Gawker employees about a takeover of the company earlier this year.

The agreement is on the heels of GigaSpaces' announcement of version 6.0 of its flagship data grid and caching platform, expected in September.\nThe GigaSpaces infrastructure platform includes software for messaging, business logic, and data management. Developers can write a high performance data processing application and distribute the application across multiple servers for real-time analytics, avoiding the latency involved when accessing remote databases.\nUnder the Microsoft partnership, GigaSpaces' Enterprise Data Grid will run on Microsoft's Compute Cluster Server (CSS) 2003, which is an enterprise grid designed to schedule and manage hardware and software utilization. Microsoft's Excel 2007 spreadsheet will serve as the front-end to a centralized repository of data and business logic run over multiple servers. The joint solution also supports Excel Services and User Defined Functions, according to GigaSpaces.\n\"You'll have GigaSpaces on the server side maintaining the data, and we do it in memory so it is extremely fast, scaling it out to as many machines as needed to handle the number of users that are trying to access it,\" says Geva Perry, chief marketing officer of GigaSpaces. \"So you essentially get Excel on the front end with a centralized repository for the data and business logic but with the scalability and performance that you need.\"\nFor developers, version 6.0 of the GigaSpaces platform means a new name and friendlier APIs. \"There was a branding issue, we needed to separate the company name from the product name,\" explains Perry. Now dubbed the GigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform (XAP), the software is designed to support extreme transaction and real time analytic processing in environments that require scalability without changes to the applications. Extreme processing is predominantly used in insurance, telecommunications and financial services, in areas such as algorithmic trading, where machines handle transactions in milliseconds or less.\nThe new programming model in GigaSpaces XAP supports plain .NET and C++ objects. \"There will be a GigaSpaces plug-in in Visual Studio but that's a little further out,\" says Perry.\nJava developers will be able to use the Spring Framework to write POJO (Plain Old Java Objects). The existing APIs -- JavaSpaces, JMS, JDBC, and Jcache -- are supported in the new release.\n\"Unlike a traditional middleware where you have to write to a certain API that works with that middleware, in our case, you don't,\" says Perry. \"Interacting with our product is external to your business logic.\"\nThe Microsoft and GigaSpaces joint solution follows Oracle's acquisition of data grid provider Tangosol, Inc., announced in April."}

About 16% of Americans age 15 and older participate in sports or exercise activity on an average day, according to a newly released survey from the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report provides new insight into who\u2019s doing what kind of physical activity and for how long.\nFrom 2003 to 2006, researchers called more than 60,000 people and asked them to recall how they used their waking hours the previous day. Those who reported doing some kind of exercise (9,387 of them) were likely to have similar demographic factors such as geography and education levels. People living in the Pacific region of California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Alaska were 50% more likely to participate in physical activity than were people in the eight states of the South Central region, which stretches from Texas to Mississippi and as far north as Kentucky. Twenty percent of those on the West coast reported exercising vs. 13% for the South Central area. At 18%, the Mountain and New England regions also had a higher-than-average share of exercisers.\nSchooling seemed to play a role, too. People with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree were more than 50% more likely to get physical activity on any given day than were people with a high school diploma, with 23% of college graduates saying they exercised compared with 14% of those with some college or an associate degree, 11% of high school graduates and 10% of those with less than a high school diploma.\nWalking was by far the most popular activity overall, with 30% of people saying they engaged in it, followed by 13% who reported lifting weights as their exertion of choice. Basketball was the favorite team sport, with 5% of people who exercised on a given day citing hoops as their activity. Each gender had its own general preferences, with men far outnumbering women in favoring football, basketball, golf and soccer and women showing much greater participation in yoga and aerobics. But the sexes closed the gap in activities such as swimming, surfing, water-skiing and bowling, which saw nearly equal representation from both men and women, according to the survey.\nInterestingly, the majority of people who said they exercised did so for roughly the amount of time that government experts recommend for adults: 30 to 59 minutes. Twenty-nine percent reported clocking in that amount of time, compared with 25% who did an hour to nearly an hour and a half worth of physical activity. And having a job wasn\u2019t an automatic deterrent. The number of employed people age 25 to 54 who exercised on a work day peaked at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., with the majority squeezing it in between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. On weekends, however, the peak time was a more sleep-friendly 10 a.m.\nFor many people, regular, brisk walking is among the easiest and most effective exercise regimens.

But it\u2019s far from perfect.\nAndroid Wear - which is Google's wearable operating system - has something of a complicated history, but after nearly four years in existence the platform is starting to move in the right direction. Which is good news for the future of wearable tech.\nRather than traditional tech companies trying their hardest to get a grip on design, fashion brands are taking it on, and it's resulting in some varied and attractive results. Just look at the likes of the Fossil Q series or the latest Michael Kors watches.\nOne of the most recognisable fashion brands, of course, is Diesel. Its latest smartwatches - including the On Full Guard, reviewed here - join those from the like the aforementioned companies, and offer something distinctive looking as part of your fashion wardrobe. But is it a genuinely great smartwatch, or an over-complicated piece of wrist jewellery?\nUnsurprisingly, the On Full Guard looks very Diesel. That's to say, it's big, bold and has an almost unrestrained look.\nIts case measures a fairly hefty 48mm x 54mm, which, again, means it's pretty big by smartwatch standards. Some will find it too big, but for us it wasn't too dissimilar to analogue watches we've been used to wearing for some time. This heft is built on a 12mm thick chunk of stainless steel, so feels really solid.\nMost of this lump of steel on our model was kept to its natural silver colouring, brushed to finish. In contrast, the bold bezel around the screen is black, and has four striking \"arms\" that reach around the edges. Like the case, it's brushed to finish, apart from a slim polished chamfer on the inside.\nInterestingly, it's not quite as polished and minimal as a dress watch might be, but you could wear the On Full Guard with most outfits and get away with it. The black and silver colouring is classic enough, and the leather strap is a simple affair. Stitching is colour-matched to the soft-touch leather, while the brushed metal studs at the top of each strap and the clasp matches the body's finish.\nDespite it not being designed for sports use whatsoever, the On Full Guard is built to survive the elements. With IP67 water and dust resistance, you'll be fine to wear it in virtually any weather. The product name is certainly fitting, then.\nThe right edge of the watch features four physical controls: three buttons and a rotating ring around the middle button. This rotating ring can be used to scroll through your notifications - which can be handy if you're unable to use the touchscreen - but is still a bit fiddly to use given the protruding metal frame.\nOther button functions are fairly limited. The top button is used for activating the animated effects that you can add to the screen, while the bottom one is a shortcut to get to the app search/download screen. As for the middle button, that's the one standard control across all Android Wear watches. Press it once to go to your installed apps, or go back home if you're in another screen; long-press it to launch Google Assistant for voice control.\nNone of the On Full Guard's buttons feel particularly solid or clicky. The top and bottom ones do have a slight click when pressed, but the middle"}

Management of the grizzly bears is slated to be turned over to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming by late July, federal officials said.\nThe states will then issue a yet-to-be announced number of hunting permits each year, while ensuring the that the park's overall population does not fall below 500. If the Yellowstone population dips below 600, all hunts and removals will be halted until the population increases.\nThe decision comes more than a year after the US Fish and Wildlife Service first proposed lifting the restrictions, finding that the park \"is at or near its carrying capacity for the bears.\"\nHowever, critics derided the move as premature and said the bears still have a significantly diminished population overall.\n\u201cDelisting the grizzly ignores the objections of scientists and tribal leaders who have raised concerns over the irreparable harm to tribal sovereignty and self-determination throughout the delisting process,\" Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. \"Silencing tribal voices to benefit trophy hunters and the livestock industry is wrong and unconstitutional, and will ultimately end up in court.\"\nThe move to delist, which does not affect threatened grizzlies in other areas of Idaho and northwestern Montana, was derided by tribal groups who said the federal government failed to seek adequate input.\n\"The Fish & Wildlife Service promised us that it would conduct full and meaningful consultation with us but it turns out, those were only empty promises,\" Ben Nuvamsa, Hopi Bear Clan and former chairman of the Hopi Tribe, said in a joint statement with other tribal leaders. \"Many tribes have joined in partnership to oppose the delisting. As sovereign nations, they are all entitled to full and meaningful consultation.\"\nMore than 100 tribes have signed a treaty opposing hunting grizzly bears, which they consider to be sacred, for sport.\nGovernment agencies have been trapping and killing dozens of Yellowstone-area grizzlies for years, but lifting threatened species protections will open hunts to the public \u2014 something wildlife advocates argue the bear recovery is too tenuous to withstand.\nYellowstone grizzlies were briefly removed from the threatened species list in 2007, but a federal judge ordered a return of the protections two years later, citing threats to their food supply.\nGrizzlies once ranged across most of North America, but the bears now occupy just 2% of that original territory.\nAdult grizzles are very territorial and can be massive: Females weigh up to 400 pounds, while males can tip the scales at nearly twice that.\nThere is no estimate for how many bears roam outside Yellowstone's 19,300-square-mile zone, but as the population"}

Southwest Flight 1380, which took off from New York bound for Dallas with 144 passengers and five crew members aboard, made an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday after an engine on the Boeing 737-700 ripped apart, killing bank executive Jennifer Riordan, 43. Southwest said it was accelerating its existing engine inspection program and conducting ultrasonic inspections of fan blades of the CFM56 engines on all of its the 737 jets.\nThe airline said it expects to complete the inspections within 30 days. Minimal flight disruptions may result, it said. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said on Tuesday at the Philadelphia airport that a preliminary investigation found an engine fan blade missing, having apparently broken off, and that there was metal fatigue at the point where it would normally be attached. Sumwalt said the investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete.\nIn August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed.\nFlight 1380 took off from New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport at around 10:27 a.m. and was diverted to Philadelphia about 20 minutes later. The engine on the plane\u2019s left side threw off shrapnel when it blew apart, shattering a window and causing rapid cabin depressurization that nearly pulled a female passenger through the hole, according to witness accounts.\nOne passenger was taken to a hospital in critical condition and seven people were treated for minor injuries at the scene, Philadelphia Fire Department spokeswoman Kathy Matheson said. Riordan\u2019s death was the first in a U.S. commercial aviation accident since 2009, according to (NTSB) statistics.\nRiordan was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to a Wells Fargo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nShe was on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: \u201cGreat business stay.\u201d Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children."}

Edinburgh also has a Writers Museum, though, and a couple of literary pub crawls, which propels it to No. 1.\nNumber 7 and 8 are the two U.S. cities that made the list: Portland, Ore., and Washington.

{"idx": "38371", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Can Tim Geithner Lead the Economy Out of Its Mess?\nGeithner's tax foibles probably won't derail his bid to replace Henry Paulson at Treasury. Republican and Democratic Senators, a number of whom have reiterated their support for Geithner in the past week, are likely to vote to confirm him as early as Thursday. Still, Hook and other tax experts say that if Geithner hopes to lower his April 15 bill in the future, he has some legitimate options \u0097 even if he lands the high-profile Treasury Secretary job. What follow are some filing tips for Geithner, as well as common tax traps he should avoid.\nGeithner spent the past few years as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and made nearly $398,000 in 2007. Hook estimates that before deductions Geithner could owe as much as $130,000 in federal and state taxes for 2008, assuming his income last year was the same. On top of that, he will owe nearly $19,000 in property taxes on his 3\u00bd-bedroom home in Larchmont, N.Y. \u0097 an upscale suburb north of Manhattan \u0097 where he lives with his wife and two children.\nSince Geithner certainly has an office at his Fed job, he can't claim his home as a place of business. But if he telecommuted, he could write off a portion of the cost of his computer and other gear needed to run the largest branch of our nation's bank from home. To get the deduction, though, Geithner, on the basis of his salary, would have had to spend at least $8,000 on home office equipment. But that shouldn't be too tough. If you are the head of the New York Fed, a 73-in. high-definition television ($3,000 and up) to watch CNBC is a legitimate business expense, right?\nThe Secretary of Treasury job is not a position that finds you. Presumably, Geithner did some high-level networking and even flew out to Chicago a few times to meet with Obama in order to land the nomination \u0097 not to mention the trip to Washington for the confirmation grilling. Good news, Tim. According to Barbara Weltman, editor of the popular tax guide J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax, all those trips are tax deductible. So we hope you saved your receipts. The IRS will let you write off a third of the amount of your job-search expenses as long as you land a job in your usual field. And since Geithner reportedly has held more than one meeting with current Treasury Secretary Paulson in the past year, it is safe to say he is staying in the same line of work. One thing to watch out for, Tim: expenses must be reasonable in the eyes of the IRS. So if you flew first-class to Chi-Town, you are probably going to be able to expense only a portion of your ticket.\nThere's a catch in write-offs, however. Because of his high income, Geithner will most likely run afoul of the dreaded alternative minimum tax (AMT). Among other things, the AMT applies to people who would be able to use deductions to reduce a large portion of their federal income tax. The idea of the AMT is to make sure wealthier types pay their fair share. State income taxes and property taxes are federal-income-tax deductions. And since Geithner pays nearly $45,000 in those two taxes,"}

Rather than take premises on the periphery of the city where most of the big hi-tech parks are located, it went for high-profile offices in the heart of Bangalore.\nThe budget for establishing the operation was US$180 million (NZ$270 million).\nThat\u2019s not surprising, given that IT now earns 20% of India\u2019s total export income.\nAgrawal had achieved his target of 1,000 hires within 18 months. \u201cWe\u2019ve focused on infrastructure, and today 70-80% of the Unisys skills base is represented.\n\u201cInitially, we ate our own dog food, serving Unisys\u2019 internal needs.

A few weeks ago Ireland were an irresistible force, enjoying such critical acclaim that back-to-back Six Nations grand slams seemed possible. Early last month it was England who were basking in the light, to borrow Billy Bragg\u2019s classic line, of the 15 fame-filled minutes of the fanzine writer. And now? The 2019 Six Nations music is stopping with Wales gloriously on top.\nIf anyone should know how swiftly things can change, it is Warren Gatland\u2019s newly crowned champions. As their previous captain Sam Warburton has pointed out, the last time they won a grand slam, in 2012, they went on an eight-Test losing streak. And Ireland? Anyone emerging from hibernation would struggle to equate the legendary green giants who knocked over New Zealand in November with the little green men so badly beaten in Cardiff.\nIt makes the achievement of Wales, with their 14 successive Test wins and second position in the World Rugby rankings, all the more impressive. Not for them the boom and bust model so prevalent elsewhere; Alun Wyn Jones, Josh Navidi, Hadleigh Parkes and Jonathan Davies have been rock solid throughout. If the 2019 World Cup was kicking off next month, Gatland\u2019s men would be genuine contenders.\nThere are still six months, however, for everyone else to regroup and refocus for Japan. Rarely, too, has the spirit of Lazarus been so strong in top-level rugby. This year\u2019s Six Nations began with Wales recovering from 16-0 down at half-time to beat France. When Scotland stood under their posts trailing 31-0 at Twickenham on Saturday evening, anyone suggesting they would shortly go 38-31 in front would have been quietly led away to the nearest secure unit. As with England, should their World Cup prospects be judged on the first half or the second?\nPerhaps the only sure thing is that, consistency-wise, every team in Europe should use Wales as a benchmark. The greater the pressure the more it suits them; the louder the baying Principality Stadium crowd the more surely they respond. For all that England have scored 24 tries in five games \u2013 the second\u2011highest tally in Six Nations history \u2013 when the crunch came they morphed into malfunctioning Maybots.\nJust as in Cardiff the flat-track bullies did not like it up \u2019em. What price, too, Eddie Jones\u2019s pre-match guff about Wales being \u201ctired\u201d? The more Scotland poured forward, inspired by the outstanding Finn Russell and his alert lieutenants Ali Price, Sam Johnson and Darcy Graham, the more helpless England\u2019s game-shapers appeared. Brawn is perfectly fine but, in tight spots, brain and composure are also essential.\nWould England have been reeled in from 31-0 ahead, for example, with Alun Wyn Jones or Kieran Read at the helm? To see Jones hauling off his captain, Owen Farrell, was to have it officially confirmed that England had lost the plot. Farrell, in theory, should have been the ideal man to boot a Scottish revival back from whence it came but, as with Johnny Sexton, this has been a turbulent few weeks for him.\nFor Jones to float the theory that English rugby is still scarred by the national\u2019s team\u2019s psychological disintegration at their own 2015 World Cup was equally revealing.

Mr. Newman's contribution came from the profits of Newman's Own Inc., the Westport, Conn., food company established in 1983 by the actor and his longtime friend and neighbor, the author A. E. Hotchner. Since its inception, all of the profits from the business have been donated to charities and other nonprofit organizations.\nThe company began as a lark for the two men, with Mr. Newman producing a batch of salad dressing in his basement. Their office was equipped with pool furniture from Mr. Newman's house, and they did not expect anyone outside of Westport to be interested in the product. But the company quickly grew into a multimillion-dollar venture and expanded its product line to three kinds of dressing, spaghetti sauce, microwave popcorn and lemonade.\nThis year, the company's profits reached $8.4 million, and much of it has already been given away.\n\"It's total recycling,\" Mr. Newman said yesterday. \"We think that the people who support our little cottage industry would appreciate it. It's their money, and it's being used for things that we think they'd like.\"\nMr. Newman added that as a part-time resident of New York for 30 years, he liked giving to the Neediest Cases: \"Having taken as much as I have from the city, it's nice to be able to give something back.\"\nSince the 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases began in November, more than 4,000 people have contributed to the fund, and $2,403,286.23 has been raised. The money is distributed to seven charities to assist the sick and the poor. The New York Times pays for the drive's overhead.\nThe $150,000 gift from Mr. Newman was recorded yesterday and raises the total to $61,380.08 more than was raised at this point in last year's campaign. The donation is one of several large gifts that the fund has received in recent weeks, and the influx of checks has compensated for a start-off figure that was lower than last year.\nThe Neediest Cases Fund begins its drive every year with money that has been sent in since the close of the previous campaign, along with money from trusts and bequests. When the Neediest drive began last month, the fund had about $200,000 less than the previous year, because of a dropoff in bequests and a decline in the interest rate for its trust accounts.\nMr. Newman and Mr. Hotchner began contributing to the Neediest with a $20,000 donation in 1983, along with thousands of dollars in gifts to other charities. Their decision to give away all their profits from the food business came shortly after they sold their first batch of dressing.\n\"Paul told me that it would be tacky for the two of us -- a writer and an actor -- to keep the money,\" Mr. Hotchner said.\nEarlier this month, the two"}

Or perhaps you\u2019re battling it out for third place or even fifth place like some leagues do. Either way, if you are playing this week you want to send out the best lineup possible and that becomes more difficult with the way some studs have morphed into duds over the past few weeks. I will address a wide variety of players, telling you what you should do with them this week; so buckle up!\nWe have to start off with the reigning MVP and perennial first round pick, Peyton Manning. It is now three straight games that Manning has failed to impress, posting less than 300 yards in each (less than 200 in two of them) and failing to top two touchdowns in any of those games. As addressed in the Future of Fantasy podcast, I do not think Peyton is 100 percent healthy. This is pure speculation on my part and I admit I could be completely wrong, but if you had a healthy Manning would you limit him to only 20 pass attempts? We all know about him getting intravenous fluids during last week\u2019s game and having a thigh injury, but seeing him toss up a couple of wobbly passes is not the Peyton Manning we all know and love. His struggles have brought down Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 value, as he has only seen nine total targets in the past two games, a number he has often surpassed in individual games this year. As I said in the podcast, I find it hard to envision a scenario in which you bench either Sanders or Manning purely based on upside, but expectations should be lowered. View Manning as a low end QB1 this week and Sanders as a low end WR2. The Bengals have been great against QBs this year, ranking in the Top 5 fewest Fantasy points allowed to the position foe both the season and over the past month, but Manning always is a threat to put up 300 plus yards and multiple scores. However, if he worries you, you could plug in Matt Ryan, Tony Romo or Ben Roethlisberger over Manning this week.\nYou know things are rough in Chicago when the Bears bench the highest paid QB in the league (Jay Cutler) for Jimmy Clausen. While it is a big blow to those who have been rolling out Cutler every week, it also hurts those that got to the big dance with Matt Forte, Martellus Bennett and Alshon Jeffrey (perhaps his garbage time TD got you this far). Clausen will not sling the ball with the success that Cutler has, and it is hard to see him having better chemistry with the starters. Forte was already worrying owners, as he goes up against the vaunted Lions defense, which held him to just six rushing yards and six receptions for 52 yards on Thanksgiving. He falls into the RB2 discussion but it is hard to envision a scenario in which you sit him. As for Jeffrey and Bennett, both will likely struggle to match their production with Cutler. Bennett falls to low end TE1 category, while Jeffrey will likely struggle to see the volume of targets he has been accustomed to, dropping him into the WR2 category. I do like Marquess Wilson as a sleeper for those in deeper leagues or desperate for a WR, as he likely has practiced the most with Clausen and the two likely developed some chemistry (although, I highly doubt I like him more than Drew Dinkmeyer).\nJordan"}

That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts, and also buy time by putting a hold on the claims.\nChapter 11 reorganization represents \"the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders,\" Richard Kelly, chairman of PG&E's board of directors, said in a statement.\n\"The Chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.\"\nState officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a blaze in Northern California in November that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.\nIn addition, state investigators have blamed PG&E power lines for some fires in October 2017. Authorities are also looking into the cause of a blaze that destroyed thousands of homes and killed 22 people in Santa Rosa last year.\nCalifornia law requires utilities to pay damages for wildfires if their equipment caused the blazes \u2014 even if the utilities weren't negligent through, say, inadequate maintenance.\nPG&E, which is the nation's largest utility by revenue and is based in San Francisco, said it is giving the required 15 days' notice that it plans to file for bankruptcy protection.\nIt said it will continue working with regulators and stakeholders to consider how it can safely provide energy \"in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.\"\nThe announcement follows the resignation of chief executive Geisha Williams a day earlier.\nIn a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the liabilities it faces from 2017 and 2018 wildfires could exceed $30 billion, not including punitive damages, fines and penalties.\nThe largest bankruptcy filing on record by a utility was Energy Future Holdings Corp. in 2014, which had $49.7 billion in liabilities in today's dollars, according to an analysis by Kevin Kelly, director of publications at S&P Global.\nVeteran New York bankruptcy lawyer H.

The Perseids are known to be very bright and slower moving, giving viewers time to turn and see when \u2018there\u2019s one!\u2019 is shouted out.\nThe Perseids Meteor Shower happens annually as earth passes through the icy debris of Comet Swift-Tuttle. The particles left behind this astronomical litterbug enter our atmosphere at around 40 miles per second and burn bright, creating \u2018shooting stars\u2019 or meteors. So why isn\u2019t the earth peppered with big holes from these flying fireballs? They are smaller than a pencil eraser and they burn up completely about 60 miles over our heads (anything large enough to make it to earth is promptly renamed a meteorite). And why don\u2019t we call the biggest cosmic event of the summer the Swift-Tuttle Meteor Shower? Meteor showers are named after the constellations where the meteors appear to radiate from (the intersection of the comet debris, the constellation and earth), and in the case of our August show, the constellation is Perseus.\nWe pass through the highest amount of Swift-Tuttle debris on August 12 (peak night) and can expect to see up to 100 meteors per hour in the darkest skies. Although meteor showers have \u2018peak\u2019 nights and radiant points, they can be seen for days or weeks before or after the peak, depending on the shower, and can be seen anywhere in the sky.\nThe best viewing time is generally pre-dawn or when their namesake constellation is above the horizon and high in the sky, but during large shows like the Perseids or Geminids, they can be seen any time after dusk. For this year\u2019s summer show, a waning three-quarter moon will rise and give light to the skies at around 11pm, but that vexing moon or city lights can\u2019t contend with the brightest of the Perseids."}

{"idx": "38401", "prompt": "Continue the following text: In May, the Administration unveiled a legislative proposal for cybersecurity that is now working its way through Congress. It is one of several major legislative packages offered that seek to enhance the security and resilience of the nation\u2019s cyber infrastructure. Getting the federal government\u2019s role right in cybersecurity is crucial. One of the key principles in addressing any proposed law is that Congress should take its time and get the solution right. What Washington does online should enhance the security, freedom, and prosperity of Americans in equal measure. The Administration\u2019s proposal does not adequately address all these priorities.\nFor too long, national companies have been faced with a proliferation of state laws that require service providers to notify their customers whenever they suffer a data breach and the disclosure of personal information. Today, there is a patchwork of laws in 47 of the 50 states, each a little different. In this truly national\u2014indeed, international\u2014market, the Administration is wise to propose a uniform federal standard.\nSometimes private-sector actors voluntarily seek the government\u2019s assistance in dealing with cyber intrusions. However, the law is often unclear as to whether the government (for example, the Department of Homeland Security) has the authority to give the private sector the assistance it wants. That does not make sense, and the Administration proposal wisely clarifies it.\nThe Administration has proposed to increase penalties for computer criminals. In general, those who use the Internet to deliberately target American infrastructure or command and control systems should be punished harshly. But caution is necessary: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which penalizes criminal computer conduct, is remarkably broad and ill-defined. Some examples of its use are good examples of what we have previously called the phenomenon of \u201covercriminalization\u201d\u2014making a crime out of anything. Before Congress enhances the penalties for violating the CFAA, it needs to fix the underlying criminal law so that it applies only to true criminals.\nOften private-sector actors have information that they want to share with the government about a threat they have discovered. But existing law\u2014principally the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)\u2014is sometimes said to prevent the private sector from sharing information with the government if that information can identify individuals. That reading of the ECPA is probably wrong, but the ambiguity in the law has made Internet Service Providers cautious. The Administration is wise to move to eliminate that ambiguity.\nThere is a problem, however, with the proposal: The Administration\u2019s legislation focuses only on private-to-government sharing of information, as if the government were the only solution to cybersecurity. It is not. The private sector can and should self-organize, sharing information among service providers, as a way of enhancing cybersecurity. But the draft proposal is silent on information sharing between private-sector actors. By affirming private-to-government information sharing to protect an information system, the law is likely to be taken as prohibiting or limiting such sharing amongst private-sector actors. If it is read in that way, the draft proposal will have done actual harm. It needs to be modified before it is enacted.\nThe Administration\u2019s proposal would speed the deployment of intrusion prevention systems that can actually block cyber intrusions and attacks against government computers.

All worked at London hospitals.\nThe charity found that hospitals interpret the charging rules differently. At some, overseas visitors officers come into antenatal units and are \"vociferous\" about chasing up payments; others adopt a less aggressive stance and give women a \"shopping list of charges\" so that they can buy some pregnancy or childbirth care from the NHS, but not the whole package if they cannot afford it.\nThe researchers heard the case of a woman who needed a caesarean for medical reasons, but who gave birth at home because she could not afford the charges. The midwives and overseas visitors officers told the charity that some women were not going to their antenatal appointments and were instead turning up in labour with severe complications.\nThe charity also heard that, in some cases, women had run away from antenatal care or given false addresses to midwives because they could not afford payment.\nJanet Fyle, professional policy adviser to the Royal College of Midwives, warned that at some hospitals antenatal care was \"going back to the dark days\" and that midwives were being \"used as immigration police\".\nDoctors of the World, which runs a clinic for migrants in east London, has seen more than 200 pregnant women who have not had antenatal care, either because they have been denied it or because they are scared of being charged. Eight of them were 36 weeks pregnant or more when they came to the clinic.\nPhil Murwill, who runs the clinic, said: \"By law, antenatal care should always be provided but we regularly see women who have been denied it, putting both mother and child at risk.\"\nRos Bragg, of Maternity Action, said: \"We are in contact with a lot of midwives who tell us women are disappearing from antenatal care because they cannot pay for it. This is unacceptable. We are very concerned about the charging arrangements currently in place.\"\nSusan Bewley, professor of complex obstetrics at King's College London, said the policy of charging migrant women for NHS antenatal care put pregnant women in danger.\n\"They may be put off accessing antenatal care that's good for them and their baby. If health professionals misinterpret their duties towards this group of women they might not come for scans, other checks or to deliver their babies,\" she said.\n\"We know that when women fail to access early antenatal care or any care at all, it can lead to poor outcomes for the mother and the baby.\n\"We live in a civilised society.

Even as the industry grappled with the possible impact of the recent expose on an Indian call center by a British tabloid, a senior Forrester official said that leading Indian companies are \"way ahead of others\" in terms of process, methodology and delivery. He emphasized that the issue of security breaches is not \"offshore-centric.\"\n\"In the last 2-3 months, there have been two reported incidents of BPO security breaches in India compared to two dozen cases in the U.S. While the MsourcE BPO case involved four customers, the recent Karan Bahree incident purportedly affected 1,000 customers in U.K. banks. In contrast, the data breaches in the U.S. have impacted millions of customers,\" Sudin Apte, Country Manager India, Forrester, said, terming the latest case as a \"stray incident.\"\n\"It is not only India. The problem is not offshore-centric,\" Forrester said, citing incidents and the size of the impact of several security breaches that happened in connection to data of Bank of America, Citi, MCI, Ameritrade, Card Systems, Time Warner and LexisNexis. He said Indian firms should rather use this opportunity to establish comfort with their clients by demonstrating superior security standards set within their companies.\nForrester's earlier report, stating that the alleged account theft by ex-employees of MsourcE would severely affect the BPO growth rate in the coming months, had sparked off a debate in the industry. Most recently, another study by the firm had found that an overwhelming majority of 31 foreign BPO clients planned to step up investigation of vendors' security and business processes to mitigate risks.\n\"However, the event in Gurgaon has been relatively small compared to what has been happening in the US. We have to gauge whether the confidence of U.S. consumers in using technology for their day-to-day transactions has got shaken,\" Apte said.\nHe said the recent incidents would bring under the scanner the concept of outsourcing (including U.S. companies outsourcing work to other U.S. companies), rather than off-shoring .\n\"However, as far as latest report is concerned, I think we will need to wait for more specific details of the case.

The carrier also confirmed that the first of its LTE service regions will go live by the end of this month.\nThis is good news for many reasons, primarily because it confirms T-Mobile's commitment to bring 4G LTE coverage to its customers. Until now this big infrastructure revamp was merely the stuff of rumors and vague statements from the carrier. During a recent meeting I had with T-Mobile execs, however, the carrier said it expects to flip the switch on 4G LTE to match availability of its BlackBerry Z10 handsets -- in other words, by the end of the month.\nGalaxy Note 2 owners will find reason to cheer here as well since this upgrade, called a maintenance release (MR), enables all the speed a fast 4G LTE has in its tool kit. Since the fresh software will take a few weeks to hit all deployed Note 2 phones, T-Mobile's LTE timing makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately T-Mobile is still tight-lipped about exactly where its LTE network will arrive first.\nNo matter where TMO LTE pops up initially, it's certainly in T-Mobile's interest to supply a fatter wireless data pipe since loyal subscribers could easily be tempted by the LTE offerings of competing networks such as AT&T and Verizon.\nBut what kind of throughput experience can you expect on a T-Mobile LTE handset? Judging from the download speeds I observed in my meeting with T-Mobile brass, potentially a very zippy one.

Mulcahy, the athletic director at Rutgers University for the past decade, was fired Wednesday amid revelations of unchecked spending and secret deals.\nThe firing comes three weeks after a special review committee issued a sharp rebuke to Rutgers for allowing the athletics department to operate without oversight -- answerable to no one -- in the drive to bring big-time college football to the state university.\nRobert Mulcahy, director of Athletics at Rutgers, leads a tour of the club seating and club lounge area at Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway in July.\n-- Schiano: Mulcahy is a man of \"integrity and loyalty\"\n-- You Make the Call: Who should be the next athletic director at Rutgers?\nRutgers president Richard L. McCormick told the school's board of governors and trustees in an e-mail last night that he has asked Mulcahy to leave his position by the end of the year.\n\"Recent events have convinced me, with reluctance, that this is the right course of action,\" McCormick said in the e-mail.\nMulcahy issued a statement later last night making it clear that the decision to leave was not his own.\n\"I was asked to resign,\" he said. \"I have not offered my resignation.\"\nAssistant athletic director Jason Baum said Mulcahy was fired at 1 p.m..\nThe university's review of Mulcahy's department followed a series of stories in The Star-Ledger that detailed hundreds of thousands of dollars in off-the-books spending that never appeared in the Rutgers budget, secret contract enhancements given to head football coach Greg Schiano and a no-bid contract with a sports marketing firm hired after it put Mulcahy's son on its payroll.\nThe group's report found no wrongdoing, but it is not the last examination of the school's athletics program. The state comptroller has sought hundreds of documents from the university.\nIn a brief telephone interview earlier yesterday, McCormick said he wanted to move quickly with a national search to replace Mulcahy, and offered praise for the 72-year-old athletic director.\n\"Bob Mulcahy has provided outstanding leadership for the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics at Rutgers for a decade. The results of his work can be seen everywhere in the program,\" he said. \"I applaud his accomplishments and his tireless efforts on behalf of our student athletes, the coaching staff, and the thousands of Rutgers fans. Bob's successor will build upon all that he has achieved.\"\nIt is not known who might replace Mulcahy in the interim. In October, the university hired Richard J. Costello, the director of athletics at Delaware State University, to the new position of deputy athletics director for finance and administration. In that job, he reports to Mulcahy and is responsible for the athletics department's day-to-day administration. Mulcahy's immediate deputy is Kevin MacConnell, a long-time member of the department.\nMulcahy's departure comes amid a football season of extremes.

Ireland\u2019s first museum solely dedicated to telling the story of Irish whiskey is launching, just across from Trinity College, in Dublin.\nEstablished, not by a distillery, but two young men with a passion for whiskey and entertaining tourists, the Irish Whiskey Museum, at the bottom of Grafton Street, has one aim \u2013 to reclaim the history of whiskey, an Irish invention, and tell its complex story.\nThe guided tour of the museum brings you through five rooms, explaining the history of the drink, from its first production by monks in the 12th century to the 20 new distilleries in Ireland currently in their planning stages. The museum uses interactive audio visual displays, as well as trained guides, to bring guests through the history of Ireland's favorite spirit. At end of the tour Master Tasters have the guests sample some of the good stuff in a beautiful bar over-looking College Green.\nIt seems an obvious attraction to have in Dublin, but as Keith McDonnell and Michael Murphy, Directors of Extreme Ireland tours and Co-Founders of the museum, realized there was a gaping hole in the market. While there are many distilleries with their own tours \u2013 Jameson, Middleton, Bushmills, and soon Teelings, in Dublin \u2013 there was no museum dedicated to educating visitors about the history of the drink, without an allegiance to a certain brand.\nThe pair spent three years researching and planning this museum. They were relentless in their pursuit of the truth behind the story of whiskey in Ireland. And it\u2019s quite a dramatic story to tell.\nOne of the main decisions that hampered Ireland\u2019s ability to mass produce whiskey was when the Irish distillers turned down the Coffey still, essentially a column still.\nIrish independence also meant that the British were no longer exporting Irish produce across the globe and then came the Prohibition in the United States.\n\u201cThere are so many connections in whiskey\u2019s history to the United States,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cFor example, John F Kennedy's dad was a bootlegger. A lot of the whiskey he was bringing over was Scottish, but a lot of it was really bad Scotch that they brought to Ireland, they filled with about 5% Irish whiskey and then re-labeled it as Irish whiskey.\nThankfully, when the whiskey industry was officially on its knees in Ireland, in the 1960s, the four distilleries got together and worked toward building a future.\nWith new specifically whiskey bars opening up in Ireland, whiskey clubs starting and people starting to really discuss Irish whiskey, the industry is set to continue its boom and the museum will surely be a success.\nTours and a tasting start from $17 per person. The museum is also available for private events. For more information visit www.irishwhiskeymuseum.ie."}

Jalen Smith is letting his offense affect his defense.\nAs impressive as the play of this year\u2019s freshman class has been, the most perplexing of the group remains the most talented in the 6-10 forward from Baltimore.\nTurgeon often says that players tend to struggle more on the defensive end when they can\u2019t make shots at the other end, and that certainly appears to be the case for Smith.\nSmith has scored just 18 points in his last three games, including five Saturday, while shooting 5 of 19 from the field (0 of 5 on 3-pointers) and committing eight turnovers, four against Ohio State.\nIn taking Smith out late in the game when the Buckeyes cut a 14-point deficit to two, Turgeon said afterwards that the Terps were better defensively with Smith\u2019s Mount Saint Joseph teammate, Darryl Morsell, as an undersized power forward.\nThe 14-point lead over Ohio State was down to two Saturday. The big crowd at Xfinity Center, which came for a \u201cwhiteout\u201d and thought it was seeing a blowout, was understandably nervous.\nGiven that Minnesota is the only team remaining on the schedule that typically plays as big a lineup as the Terps, it\u2019s something Turgeon will likely do more of, especially if Smith continues to struggle offensively.\n2. Serrel Smith Jr. could be an X-factor in the postseason.\nThe most difficult part for coaches in NCAA tournament games is the quick turnaround and the scouting that is entailed. Unlike Big Ten teams that have already played Maryland, most teams are not going to have much on the freshman guard in their reports.\nOf all the freshmen this season, Serrel Smith has probably come the furthest. His career-high 14-point outing on Saturday was more the result of opportunity than Smith suddenly showing the confidence to take shots and an ability to"}

You may remember her bluesy voice from Telepopmusik's Grammy-nominated hit Breathe, or her stint with Lilith Fair folk favourites Wild Colonials. But while both of these projects have been on indefinite hiatus, McCluskey has been releasing incredible solo records, most recently with her second album, You Could Start a Fight in an Empty House. It's a record that bristles with pop tension, haunted by McCluskey's strongest asset: her voice.\nOn You Could Start a Fight ..., McCluskey uses electronic music and hip-hop to accentuate her vocals. The album is a swaying, spiralling and emotional experience, guided by McCluskey's enigmatic talents. Her lyrics speak of recovery from a bruised life, and there is a relaxing, rainy-day atmosphere of regret to her songs.\nBut You Could Start a Fight ... is not a \"feel my pain\" record. Musically, it moves on from the trip-hop sheen of her first record, The Things We Do, and bounds into electric folk-rock and blues. At times, You Could Start a Fight ... can be unnerving for a pop record. There is a lightness of touch, and yet it is coupled with a startling bleak streak throughout, highlighted in spare and eerie blues songs such as Truth Is and I Was Looking for a Fight. She portrays dichotomies within her songs, glistening with a pure-pop finish over a voice suited for Appalachian ballads. It is this strong contrast that makes You Could Start a Fight in an Empty House a cool, almost transcendent record with real emotions.\nCatching McCluskey live is a treat. Slouched over, singing tortured ballads, she is the anti-diva, the anti-Leona Lewis, the anti-manufactured pop star. And her voice works live just as it does on record, an incredible juxtaposition of the greats: Beth Gibbons, Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. McCluskey eases emotion and soul out of her most personal obsessional ballads with an effortless cool. The sheer normality of her appearance makes her talent all the more striking.\nI am often told we are living in the age of the vocalist. For all the kudos given to the cookie-cutter lineup of X-Factor singers who hold a note for exactly 17 minutes and bask in \"amazing\" praise, you have to wonder: where is the praise to be given to Angela McCluskey? Musicians love her; Lisa Marie Presley wrote with her, REM hired her as a support act, the Cardigans took her to Malmo to record her first solo record, and she's performed with Dr John and Cyndi Lauper. It remains a mystery to me why she is still only a cult draw."}

Within a few hours, the U.S. Army's 7th Infantry Division had taken their primary objective, Kadena airfield.\nCalled Naka Hikojo by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, the field was completed a short time prior to the U.S. amphibious landings. Kadena had a single runway constructed of crushed coral and measuring 1,500 meters in length. Engineers attached to the 7th Infantry Division reconditioned the runway, adding extra coral to allow for heavy fighters to operate from the newly captured airfield.\nOn April 9, the runway on Kadena was considered ready for fighter operations. Marine aviators were ordered to move from their carriers to Ruby Base, the allied code name for Kadena airfield.\nPilots from Marine Fighter Squadron, or VMF, 312, the \"Checkerboarders,\" were the first to land their Vought F4U-1D Corsairs on the field. The squadron was soon followed by VMF-323's \"The Death Rattlers,\" VMF-322's \"Fighting Gamecocks\" and a single night fighter squadron, VMF(N)-543's \"Night Hawks,\" operating Grumman F6F(N) Hellcats.\nThe Marine corsair squadrons based on Kadena were assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 33; a second group, MAG-31, was located on Yontan Field just north of Kadena.\nThe Marine Corps fighters on Kadena airfield's primary mission was air superiority and air defense. Fighters based on both Kadena and Yontan airfields conducted continuous combat air patrols to fend off the largest threat to the Fifth Fleet -- kamikaze, or suicide, attacks.\nDuring the Japanese defense of the Ryukyus, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army Air Force would coordinate their efforts and launch mass kamikaze attacks, known as Kikusui attacks, against the fleet. A total of 10 Kikusui attacks were launched from April 6-June 22, 1945.\nThe first action for Kadena's aviators came during the second Kikusui attack on April 12. Pilots from VMF-312 intercepted 20 Japanese Zeros and four Jill dive bombers. The flight, led by Capt. Dan H. Johnson, shot down eight Zeros and damaged six more. The enemy formation turned back before reaching their intended target.\nMore than 185 Japanese aircraft participated in the raids between April 12-13, during which 17 kamikaze aircraft hit allied ships.\nNot all of the enemy aircraft encountered over Okinawa were suicide aircraft; mass kamikaze attacks were usually escorted by fighters, and conventional sorties were flown against the allied invasion.

Dannel Malloy wants the federal government to give him access to its watch lists so he can deny gun permits to people on those lists.\nMalloy said so Thursday afternoon outside his office. The executive order he is hoping to sign once the U.S. Department of Justice gives him the green light would require those who apply for a gun permit to be checked against federal government watch lists.\nAssault weapons are already outlawed in Connecticut, so Malloy\u2019s executive order would also prevent someone on the lists from purchasing a handgun, ammunition, shotgun or rifle.\nMalloy said he\u2019s been in touch with officials at the White House and is in the process of getting access to federal watch lists. It\u2019s unclear when he might get an answer.\nThe governor, who was sworn in last week as the head of the Democratic Governors Association, said he started conversations with White House officials last week after Congress failed to act.\nAt an outdoor news conference on Thursday, Malloy said he was unaware of any other governor moving in this direction.\n\u201cIf you cannot fly due to being on a government watch list, you should not be able to purchase a firearm while on that watch list as well,\u201d Malloy said.\nThere are an estimated 16,000 individuals on the no-fly list, which is one of the smallest of the government watch lists. Malloy said he was asking for access to a broad range of watch lists that include suspected terrorists.\nAccording to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report, suspected terrorists tried to buy guns from American dealers at least 2,233 times between 2004 and 2014. And in 2,043 of those cases \u2013 91 percent of the time \u2013 they succeeded.\n\u201cConnecticut, we are seizing this moment,\u201d Malloy said Thursday.\nThe governor said he believes the state government has the power to enact his plan because what is being denied is a permit, which can be appealed.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the appeals process would work if someone felt they should not be on a federal no-fly list.\n\u201cWhile the governor\u2019s proposal would infringe on some persons\u2019 constitutional right to obtain firearms, the Supreme Court has said specifically that some limitations on who may obtain guns and where they may be carried are permissible,\u201d William Dunlap, a professor at Quinnipiac University Law School, said Thursday.\nIn Connecticut, someone who is denied a gun permit can file an appeal with the Board of Firearm Permit Examiners. It\u2019s not clear how a hybrid appeal process would work between the state and the federal government.\nScott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said that the criteria for ending up on the terror list are unclear and vague.\nWilson said his group will not rule out legal action if Malloy moves forward with an executive order.\nBut Malloy, who has challenged the gun lobby in the past, said he doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would protect a person suspected of being a terrorist.\nThe executive order is expected to be signed once Malloy gets the green light from the Justice Department.\nHowever, Malloy\u2019s plan was applauded by members of Connecticut\u2019s Congressional delegation, who were frustrated last week when the U.S. Senate was unable to find enough support to debate the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015.\n\u201cKeeping guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists is just common sense, and it is crucial to keeping our communities safe,\u201d U"}

After some balking, she did so but later came back to tell me to \u201cf\u2014 off.\u201d Without saying a word to her, I informed the administration, which suspended her for a week. She eventually returned, but never again spoke in class, not even to disrupt it. I had \u201cwon,\u201d perhaps, but at a terrible cost: The student did no work and eventually disappeared into the shadows of the long corridors.\nI wish I\u2019d had contact with someone as wise and sensible as de Olivares. The former South Bronx street tough became a cop and then a youth counselor, and he\u2019s the founder of Streetwise, which trains school staffs to work with hard-to-reach kids. His counsel in Bring Them Back Alive is indispensable to anyone who parents or teaches adolescents.\nAt the heart of his argument is the insistence that you can\u2019t make adolescents do anything, whether it\u2019s giving up recreational drugs or studying hard to get into college. Threats typically engender more opposition, while inducements cause kids to see teachers as shameless panderers. Faced with the seemingly incorrigible teen, we\u2019re tempted to explode in anger or do nothing at all.\nWhat de Olivares advocates is a middle road, where teachers hold students accountable while showing them respect. This is not easy with an obnoxious or nonperforming teenager but, as de Olivares insists, we have no choice. The \u201cstresses of adolescence require that teenagers concentrate their energies on their own development,\u201d he writes, compelling us to serve their needs while subordinating our own.\nDe Olivares offers a list of practical suggestions for fostering mutual respect. \u201cNever look away,\u201d he writes, \u201cwithout first acknowledging a teenager once you\u2019ve made eye contact with him or her\u201d; to do otherwise suggests fear or disdain. And \u201calways walk over to teenagers before talking to them, especially if you are going to confront and correct [misbehavior]\u201d; doing so publicly, and from a distance, invites anger. The author also advises making \u201cpositive eye contact with teenagers before ... correcting their behavior\u201d; otherwise you\u2019re setting up a challenge. Common-sensical as these tips are, just about every high school teacher has witnessed colleagues doing the opposite.\nThese tactics don\u2019t guarantee that students will behave appropriately. And if they don\u2019t, de Olivares writes, they should \u201cexperience the direct consequences of their behavior\u201d and \u201cmake things right.\u201d A kid who trashes a classroom, for example, might be assigned to clean up the schoolyard, or someone caught stealing from a classmate might be asked to make a public apology. The point, again, is to avoid the temptations of punishment (e.g., a blanket suspension) or of doing nothing.\nBut this book is more than a how-to guide; it\u2019s also a critique of educational institutions. Teenagers, de Olivares argues, need teachers who offer them compassion and perspective. The objective of typical high schools, however, is \u201cto teach students the \u2018right\u2019 answers ... on standardized tests and move on,\u201d he charges. Adolescents also crave excitement and challenges, things not often found in schools or mind-numbing jobs. It\u2019s no mystery, given these circumstances, that many teens choose troubling paths, even if only for a time.\nWhile individual teachers may not be able to fix institutions, de Olivares tells us, we can work on building trusting"}

Regardless of coach John Beilein\u2019s success over his first five seasons with the program, he may need to start making deep runs in the NCAA Tournament on a consistent basis to regain that \u201crabid\u201d following.\nSedlecky is confident it could happen soon.\nDavis\u2019 colleagues at ESPN agree that Beilein is capable of doing just that.

{"idx": "38444", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Six years ago, I wrote with a certain amount of sadness a rather gloomy report for the National Trust entitled Natural Childhood. It highlighted the barriers standing in the way of engaging young people with nature: primarily dangers from traffic, parental fears of \u201cstranger danger\u201d, and a growing aversion to exposing children to any form of risk. I concluded that we faced the very real danger of a \u201clost generation\u201d, who might never engage with the natural world.\nSo how did this movement evolve so suddenly and efficiently since my gloomy report? Much of the impetus behind it began at the annual British Birdwatching Fair, or Birdfair, held in Rutland in August, at which people from all over the world gather in England\u2019s smallest county to share their mutual passion for birds.\nUntil recently, one group was conspicuous by its absence: young people between the ages of 16 and 30. Then, thanks to some determined and far-sighted individuals, this began to change. Today, dozens of youngsters visit Birdfair each year, holding debates, swapping stories and forging careers in conservation, environment and the media.\nMany are members of the organisation A Focus on Nature (AFoN), whose mission is \u201cto connect, support and inspire young people across the UK with an interest in nature and conservation, and provide a voice for the youth conservation movement\u201d.\nThe idea for AFoN actually began at Birdfair, back in 2012, the same year I published my report. A young birder, Lucy McRobert, asked the company Opticron to donate binoculars to young conservationists who might otherwise not be able to afford them. Opticron said yes, and soon the idea of a larger and more ambitious network emerged: connecting young people with more experienced mentors, in areas such as nature writing, wildlife television and conservation. Yet the best guidance often came from the members themselves, who began to develop a peer-to-peer network, offering practical help and advice.\nIn 2015, AFoN organised a conference in Cambridge, leading to the publication of the report A Vision for Nature. It contained a thoughtful, clear and workable set of proposals to save our natural heritage, written by the generation who will have to clear up the mess we made.\nPredictably, despite endorsement from Sir David Attenborough, the report was largely ignored by politicians and the media. Since then, however, AFoN committee members have twice been invited to Downing Street to meet environmental advisers and MPs.\nAFoN is not the only youth organisation to spring up in recent years: others include the Bristol Nature Network and the now-disbanded Next Generation Birders, who in 2017 inspired the Telegraph headline \u201cThe rise of the hipster bird-watcher\u201d.\nThen there is Mya-Rose Craig, aka Birdgirl, who at 16 years old has already made a real impact in encouraging minority ethnic youngsters to engage with the natural world.\nSo where does AFoN go from here? As the problems facing our environment become ever more acute, it recently launched the #NowforNature campaign, reflecting the importance of social media in getting the message across.\nAFoN\u2019s earliest members, now in their late 20s and early 30s, are beginning to wield more influence.

I was a professor at Princeton University. And, in that capacity, I studied for many years the role of financial crisis in the economy. In fact, I became an expert on the Great Depression of the 1930s. It was a period in which the stock market crashed, and it collapsed the banking system. It was one of the main reasons that the economy was in such deep depression for more than a decade.\nIn 2002, I came to Washington to join the Federal Reserve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is the Central Bank of the U.S. It's an agency of the United States government, and it has a number of functions.\nOne important function is to set monetary policy, which means to change values of the short-term interest rate, to try to steer the economy to full employment and low inflation, to try and use that tool to keep the economy as stable as possible.

And one of the most important is trying to preserve stable transformance.\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 in response to a severe financial crisis in 1907, with the objective of having an institution that could be a first responder to try to address situations where financial markets were in great disruption, great disarray before the effects on the economy were too great.\nImportantly, in the 1930s, in the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve, despite its mandate, was quite passive and, as a result, financial crisis became very severe, lasted essentially from 1929 to 1933. And the effects on the economy we know. So, again, I came to Washington. I initially joined the Board of Governors, which is the group of seven leaders of the Federal Reserve who are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate.\nI did that job for about three years. I then spent nearly a year in the White House advising the President on economic policy. And then in 2005, he appointed me to succeed Alan Greenspan as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. So, as the chairman of the Federal Reserve I am, essentially, the leader of this institution, and also of the committee that makes monetary policy, such as short-term interest rates, to address unemployment and inflation.\nAbout a little more than two years ago, in the late summer of 2007, the financial sector of the U.S., and much of the world went into a period of significant stress. It was tied to excessive risk taking in much of the private sector. For example, many banks and mortgage brokers made sub-prime loans, which turned out to be bad loans, and those losses affected the banks and their perceived solvency from the perspective of the public and investors. But there were many other investments, also, that were made that were excessively risky, were dangerous, and brought losses to the financial system.\nThe stress on"}

And in Hong Kong, there are direct sea links at the airport by ferry to places such as Shenzhen and Macau.\nSuch connectivity provides convenience to travellers, boosts airport traffic and makes the airport an integrated multi-modal hub, which Singapore aspires to be.\nIf practicable, we can build separate train cabins for transit passengers, who can be whisked away from the airport to Malaysia while bypassing immigration clearance in Singapore. This might attract more airlines and travellers to Changi Airport.\nThe Changi-Tuas link will also alleviate traffic congestion caused by people travelling from one end of the island to the other, by getting car owners to switch to the high-speed rail instead of driving."}

The importance and usefulness of social media continues to grow across the Army - antiterrorism protection is no different especially in light of a persistent terrorist threat.\nAreas to focus on during the quarter include: understanding social media and why to use social media for community outreach, how to establish and manage a social media presence, use of social media for crisis communication, and how to mitigate the risks associated with the use of social media.\nAntiterrorism awareness and community outreach efforts empower the entire Army (units, leaders, Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians, families, and Army contractors) to take prevention measures against terrorist acts and encourage each individual to serve as a sensor - continuously aware of and reporting suspicious activity (iWATCH Army). The creative use of social media expands the reach of antiterrorism communications and enables Army organizations, leaders, and communities to stay connected and share important threat and protection information.\nDuring the month of August 2013, the Army will execute its fourth annual Antiterrorism Awareness Month. In addition to the emphasis on the use of social media, antiterrorism awareness month will focus on suspicious activity reporting and law enforcement as a critical enabler to protecting our communities.\niWATCH Army remains as a vital element of our community awareness program and Army commands are encouraged to continue to maintain active outreach efforts.\nFeedback from Army commands indicates that the use of awareness themes has been value added to the overall antiterrorism program. The department intends to continue the use of quarterly themes throughout FY14.\nEffective information sharing and community involvement are vital elements of the Army's antiterrorism program. The use of social media can significantly improve information sharing and our ability to empower our communities to enhance our defense against terrorism.\nFemale Soldiers have bled and died and sacrificed the same as men have for the past 12 years in this long war. If they can meet the requirements to be an infantryman or an armored crewman or an engineer or a field artilleryman, then so be it. We'll be a better Army for it. I am extremely excited about this and I look forward to seeing more of our female Soldiers as they take advantage of opportunities in the combat arms."}

The site is a Tumblr blog, sarcastically called, Congrats! You Have an All-Male Panel.\nIt started in February and features 200 photos, submitted from people from about 10 countries. The simple but now-viral idea is a project of the Finnish feminist researcher and artist Saara Sarma, who specializes in internet parody images and memes.\nWhether it's a Global Summit of Women with only men on the panel or back-to-back male panels in conferences, the images on the site bring home the message that gender equality among rostrums of leaders or experts is in short supply.\nThe blog has over 5,000 followers on Tumblr. The site has been shared on Twitter more than 6,000 times and been liked or shared on Facebook over 60,000 times.\nThe most distinctive part of the Tumblr blog is a stamp added to every submitted panel. It's a photo of a picture of David Hasselhoff, the American actor, best known for his lead roles in the popular US TV series Knight Rider and Baywatch.\nImage caption Sarma considers it a double whammy if the panels are all-male and all-white.\nThere's no indication that the Hasselhoff actually endorses all-male panels, instead Sarma says: \"He just epitomises white masculinity especially in his '80s Knight Rider appearance, a lone white man saving the world with a help of a car. I grew up watching Knight Rider so I do have some kind of fondness for the Hoff.\"\nSarma believes the stamp is partly what has made the blog popular. \"This is such an enraging and sad thing, but to be able to laugh at it is truly empowering for many people,\" she says.\nSarma points to many other efforts to call groups out on the \"manel\" phenomena including the Twitter accounts of watchdog group @EUPanelwatch and @genderavenger, public forums like Foreign Policy Interrupted and websites manpanels.org and that of Owen Barder, the Director for Europe at the Centre for Global Development, who is encouraging male experts to take a pledge not to appear on all-male panels.\n\"I think it is always very small steps that we take towards equality, so I don't dare to hope that manels would stop altogether, but if this makes people to think about diversity more seriously and at least some people commit to not organising all male or all white panels, I'd be very happy,\" Sarma says. \"I'd be very happy if I never saw any of my colleagues on an all-male panel again.\"\nNext story: Where did Charlie Charlie Challenge come from?"}

{"idx": "38462", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Apple App Store Has Lost $450 Million To Piracy - 24/7 Wall St.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the companies that sell software for the iPhone and iPod touch at the App Store have lost over $450 million to piracy since the store opened in July 2008 according to an analysis by 24/7 Wall St. There have been over 3 billion applications downloaded since the App program began. Bernstein analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, estimated that between 13% and 21% of those downloads are from paid applications. According to this analysis, the average price of an application purchased at the App Store is $3. Sacconaghi estimated that Apple\u2019s revenue from the App Store is between $60 million and $110 million per quarter. That amount has certainly increased since this research report was published because of the rapid growth of the number of applications.\nHowever, behind all this success lies an insidious force that has plagued the music, software, and movie industry for decades. Developers of iPhone applications have reported alarming piracy rates for their software, and the ease with which users may obtain pirated versions of paid applications for free is only increasing. The total number of applications available at the store, including those which are free and those which require payment, is in excess of 100,000.\nMost iPhone users have not jailbroken their phones. This is likely a result of the perception that this process is incredibly technical for many non-tech savvy owners. Others may fear that Apple might retaliate. No rabid Apple fanatic would risk being placed on a DO NOT SELL list! However, the technical barriers to jailbreaking an iPhone or iPod touch are rapidly decreasing. The original process required at least some programming ability. The most recent jailbreak software makes the process accessible to even most Luddites, so the number of jailbroken iPhones will only increase.\nIt is difficult to get precise figures for the number of iPhones and iPod touches that have been jailbroken. Jay Freeman, operator of Cydia, a renegade app store that can be found on almost any jailbroken iPhone or iPod touch device is probably the best source for this estimate. Freeman told Wired Magazine in August 2009 that he has received over 4 million unique visitors to his store. This represents about 10% of iPhones and iTouches that existed at that time. The jailbreaking process has only become easier since August, and if that figure is still about 10% of all Apple devices that can access the App Store, that would mean that the total number of jailbroken devices today is approximately 7.5 million assuming that total worldwide sales of the iPhone and iPod touch are now 75 million. It is important to note that not all people who jailbreak their iPhones are pirates. Pinch Media, a company that specializes in mobile software analytics, has found that only 40% of jailbroken devices use pirated software.\nWhile it is difficult to get a firm grasp on exact piracy rates, some developers have put features in their software that prompts it to \u201cphone home\u201d when the phone has been cracked. Developer testimonials put the figure much higher than many analyst would expect. Developers Neptune Interactive Inc and Smells Like Donkey Inc have reported piracy rates has high as 90% for their game $1.99 Tap-Fu, and claim that it was available in a pirated version within 40 minutes of its release on the App Store.

We have that as a 'wow' factor when people come in. With this renovation we want to make it even more interesting. If people who visit thought it was exactly the same, they might not want to come back.\"\nLast week, workers were busy crafting branches on the huge red oak tree, and preparing other areas for their new exhibits. Chorice said there will be a new entry kiosk with better maps of the nature center building and its network of walking trails.\nSome key live-animal exhibits are being updated with a more modern look (less oak trim around glass aquariums, for example). The Nature Center's two resident snapping turtles will get a bigger home that visitors can view by peering through a hole in the wall instead of looking at a square glass tank.\n\"We think it will make it less dated looking, more organic in shape,\" Chorice said.\nThe popular \"creatures of the night\" exhibit is getting a complete makeover. Visitors can learn about nocturnal animals in the Ozarks and what they do at night. The extremely popular bird-viewing room, where visitors watch wild turkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, cardinals and other creatures enjoy the outdoor feeding stations from behind glass will get a makeover, including portals for kids to watch the animals as they eat.\nThe Ozarks exhibits are a mix of live animals and realistic educational dioramas that tell the story of wild places in our area.\n\"I hope they learn more about our Ozarks and then go outside and explore these natural communities for themselves, perhaps by walking our trails,\" Chorice said. \"Our purpose is to connect people to the outdoors. They need to be aware of the places where they live and hopefully it will make people better stewards of our environment. Of course, there's also the health benefits of going outdoors, for one's body and soul.\"\nThe renovation is coming in three phases.

Costs for Phase 2 and 3 improvements won't be finalized until early summer.\nThe project is being funded through Missouri's 1/8 of one percent Conservation sales tax voters approved in 1976, as well as from money generated through fishing and hunting permits.\nThe Nature Center has drawn 2.5 million visitors since it"}
{"idx": "38464", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Symantec's latest security software in its consumer Norton line installs in less than a minute and uses much less memory, two key improvements the company sees as keeping its products competitive.\nOn Tuesday Symantec released Norton AntiVirus 2009 and Norton Internet Security 2009 for U.S. customers. Symantec is translating and doing final quality checks for local-language versions for European countries, which should be on the shelf by the end of the month, said Con Mallon, product marketing director for Symantec's consumer division in Europe, on Wednesday.\nSymantec embarked on a top-down engineering review of its consumer products after complaints the software slowed down PCs by consuming lots of memory and scanned files at inopportune times.\n\"Norton is seen as big, fat and slow,\" Mallon said. \"People hunt around looking for better performance.\"\nOne focus has been installation times. Internet Security 2009 installs in around 53 seconds, a vast improvement over the four to five minutes needed to install Internet Security 2008, Mallon said. AntiVirus 2009 will also install in less than a minute.\nOne way Symantec slashed the install times was by ignoring Microsoft's recommended sequence for how applications should install on Windows. Symantec got rid of the menus asking questions such as what folder the application should be installed in. Users can go through that sequence if they choose, however. Most users don't care, though, and will trust Symantec.\n\"By and large, we know what we are doing,\" Mallon said.\nWhen running, both programs use about 7M bytes of memory, where competing products use up to 10 times as much, Mallon said. By tracking queries to its help desk, Symantec found that 40 percent of their users have 512M bytes of memory or less, making it important security software is as light as possible, Mallon said.\nBoth products also use Norton Insight, a technology that speeds up scanning times by ignoring files that have not changed or those that have already been verified as being trusted files. Insight calculates and stores hashes for files on a PC; if the hash changes, the file is scanned. The Norton product also holds off on scanning until its user is away.\nAntispam software used to be a free download for Internet Security and AntiVirus, but now is part of both products.\nSymantec is also offering a plug-in for Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers that displays a warning next to search-engine results if a Web site is hosting malware. The product, called Safe Web, is in beta and requires a purchase of Internet Security 2009. In this area, Symantec is just catching up to products such as McAfee's SiteAdvisor or AVG's LinkScanner.\nIn the U.S., Internet Security 2009 is priced at US$69.99 and AntiVirus costs $39.99. Other features such as a two-way firewall, antiphishing and identity protection technology and parental Internet controls account for the higher price of Internet Security.\nIn the U.K., Internet Security will cost &#163;49.99 (US$88); AntiVirus will be &#163;39.99."}

Preserve your produce by canning it.\nJuly 14, 2015, 2:27 p.m.\nWhen fruit season is in full swing, most of us would rather buy too much produce than pass up a good deal on delicious-looking fresh fruit. (Perhaps this sort of ingrained behavior stems from our primeval past, when a cache of goodies ensured our clan's survival.) But once the food is procured and piled on the kitchen counter, then what? Smoothies and raw fruit will only take you so far before fresh produce begins to degrade.\nOne solution is to make small-batch preserves, a cooking strategy designed to extend the shelf life of produce that hits the sweet spot between thriftiness and decadent abundance. Salt, alcohol and the acid found in tart fruit are effective tools in the cook's arsenal to preserve food well past the sell-by date. This method is also ideal for occasions when there's more fruit to be had than there are mouths to feed.\nTo sterilize, place jars in tall cooking pot, cover with water to 1 inch above the top. Cover pot and bring contents to a boil for 10 minutes. Add lids. Remove pot from heat. Use tongs to extract items or allow water to cool before removing jars with clean hands. Invert jars on rack to air dry, about 5 minutes.\nBored of lemon chicken? Spike the dish by making a marinade out of salted lemons.\nWash lemons, cup off woody stem, then quarter to about 1/2 inch from the bottom. Combine salt and pickling spice in a mixing bowl.\nAdd 1 tablespoon. of salt mix to jar. Pack lemons with 1 tablespoon. of mix. Place lemons cut side down in jar, adding a bit of mix between each layer. Mash down lemons to release the juices, packing as tight as possible. If needed, add fresh and lemon juice to cover ingredients, not water or concentrate. Add bay leaf and cinnamon stick. Leave 1/2 inch headspace. Set jar in a cool dark place to pickle for 1 month. Use preserved lemon peel in marinades.

Talent matters, of course, but we want players who see a healthy volume of targets and touches to anchor our lineups, especially in daily fantasy. Every week in the second season of the Opportunity Report, we'll look at all the passing targets for every NFL team and the percentage each player owns. Franchise will handle the backfield touches section this year and his Week 14 piece is tabbed above.\nJ.J. Nelson is a nice addition to an offense, but it's hard to assert with much confidence he's the type of player who needs to be getting 11 targets in a game. That was his highest game since Week 8. The Cardinals do not have much of choice right now with the state of their receiving corps. In the absence of the departed Michael Floyd, John Brown saw his snap rate to go up to 59 percent. The team still does not want to put much onto his plate with his sickle cell trait issue. For the third straight year we are watching Larry Fitzgerald slump toward the end of the season. Since Week 11, the veteran receiver averages 52.6 yards per game and has collected double-digit targets just once, something he did six times in the nine games prior.\nTaylor Gabriel led the team with six targets but only played 24 total snaps due to a shoulder injury that sent him to the locker room for a while and the game being a blowout. Aldrick Robinson led the wide receiver in playing 81 percent of the team's snaps and made a downfield catch along the sideline and another long catch and run on a seam route. Neither player will have a stable role if Julio Jones returns to take on the Panthers next week, but should he miss another game, either could once again make big plays against that secondary.\nNothing much changed with Baltimore's passing distribution, as Steve Smith and Mike Wallace led the way, as usual. However, the team did run the ball far more often on Sunday than they had been in the weeks leading up to this. Baltimore handed-off to their running backs 22 times to just 30 pass attempts for Joe Flacco. That may have been due to the windy weather, but with two talented backs and a solid line, it should be more of their approach as they make a run to the playoffs.\nAfter trending up in playing time culminating with a 90-plus percent snap share in Week 14, it was wildly disappointing to see Sammy Watkins slip back down to go out on just 64 percent of the plays. That could have easily just been due to the blowout nature of this game, which favored the Bills. Yet, it also just appears we will be playing a guessing game with his health and usage the rest of the way. Let's hope Watkins is more consistently healthy next season.\nIt was right back to work for Alshon Jeffery, who led the wide receiver group by playing on 94 percent of the team's plays. He went long stretches without getting a target, but started to get rolling in the second-half. Perhaps he started to develop more comfort with Matt Barkley as the game went on. Cameron Meredith is established as the No. 2 receiver (89 percent) and Deonte Thompson (71 percent) as the No. 3. Meredith took 73"}

{"idx": "38469", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A representative from the Ritz-Carlton in downtown Denver sent an instructional video to the Dodgers traveling secretary in the days leading up to the team\u2019s trip to town this weekend. As they prepared for a series with the Rockies, the Dodgers confronted a litany of issues, from how their bullpen will function without closer Kenley Jansen to whether their inconsistent offense can ever cohere.\nBut at least they have the composition of Ross Stripling\u2019s mattress under control.\nIn the video, which was forwarded to Stripling, a staffer demonstrated how to flip the hotel\u2019s mattress to use the firmer side. When he landed on the disabled list in August, Stripling admitted his lower back inflammation was triggered by the fluffiness of his sleeping surface in Denver. The hotel hoped to correct his issue.\nStripling was red-faced as he related the anecdote on Wednesday morning. His complexion stemmed in part from his embarrassment \u2014 candor is rarely rewarded in a baseball clubhouse \u2014 and in part from the simulated game he had just completed. The outing was his final hurdle in a return that was first stalled by a recurrence of discomfort and then delayed as the Dodgers built up his pitch count.\nThe team intends to activate Stripling on Saturday. Manager Dave Roberts indicated the team has not decided how to use Stripling. He could appear in high-leverage situations or he could handle multiple innings. He made the All-Star team as a starter earlier this summer, but he may spend the rest of the season in the bullpen.\nStripling logged 34 pitches in his simulated outing. It resembled a three-inning assignment. He suggested he could throw up to 45 pitches in his first game back.\nHis presence in the bullpen is a necessity, especially this weekend. Stripling has not pitched since Aug. 9, which was also the first game the Dodgers (76-64) played without Jansen after he experienced an irregular heartbeat. The condition sidelined Jansen for 11 days, and it precluded him from traveling with the team to Denver this weekend.\nJansen met with a cardiologist on Tuesday who advised Jansen not to travel for the series. The recommendation disappointed Jansen, but he declined to challenge it. He was wary of exacerbating his condition, which will likely require surgery this offseason.\nWith Jansen recuperating in August, the Dodgers suffered through a phase in which the bullpen blew a lead in seven consecutive games. The team lost its grip on the National League West in the process. The Dodgers recovered to reclaim first from Arizona last weekend, only to stumble at home against the Mets and watch the Rockies rise to the top. Colorado leads by 1 1/2 games heading into Friday.\nGiven the size of their deficit, their general unreliability as a team and the brevity of the remaining schedule, the Dodgers may not be able to survive another extended bullpen collapse and still reach the playoffs.\nThe options to replace Jansen are all fallible. Kenta Maeda has been unable to replicate the success he experienced as a reliever in the postseason, giving up runs in three of his six appearances since shifting to the bullpen. Ryan Madson has let five of the 12 batters he\u2019s faced as a Dodger reach base. Neither Scott Alexander nor Dylan Floro has fully earned Roberts\u2019 trust.\nThe team has reached the point where Pedro Baez, the bane of the fanbase\u2019s existence, could"}

This course reviews a variety of historical and contemporary issues relating to race and the law from the perspectives of sociology, psychology and history.\nThis course will examine the application of constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination law to race related controversies across a variety of settings. The course will begin with an exploration of the historical developments that led to antidiscrimination law, and with an introduction to the competing frameworks that define current antidiscrimination law: the discriminatory purpose and anti-classification approaches that feature prominently in equal protection doctrine, and the disparate impact framework that is incorporated into some statutory law. After some exploration of the historical origins of antidiscrimination law and its alternative formulations, the course will then turn to the specific contexts in which controversies arise. The settings that will be examined include criminal justice, college admissions, political participation, primary/secondary education, employment, housing, hate speech, and the formation of family relationships. In each of these settings, we will devote close attention to the role of antidiscrimination law in specific controversies.

The sweetness is sheer pleasure to feel and it leaves behind a splendid colour pattern on the tongue, which looks doubly alluring when reflected in a mirror. What get drowned in this moment of sweet pleasure are some plain, pricking realities. We might notice the partly open lid of the jar that welcomes flies and ants crawling in. We might not care for the fact that the candy is not even wrapped and even God cannot answer how old it is.\nRetheesh Mithila in his debut film almost manages to make up for some obvious dearth of craft with a simple story that weaves together warmth innocence and fortune. The extent to which one could like this film may depend upon whether effusion of virtues gets suffocating or not. In case warmth and innocence played out in rich flavours on screen come across as exhausting and intolerable, this film would fail to engage. However, if there is space in the heart to accommodate flaws, jarring it may be, just for the sake of encouraging an attempt, Lal Bahadur Shastri deserves good mention.\nThe narrative is picked from the all familiar basket of single-day-multiple-characters type and could easily be dismissed as one replete with pitfalls that emerge out of bad film-making. An unemployed young man sets out hoping to meet a man who would ensure him a job as a driver. He meets an enterprising, flirtatious old man and another youngster who dreams of a career in cinema, in his journey. The film then swirls around a lottery ticket which one of them happens to buy.\nThere are instances where the characters are not even allowed to complete a dialogue in a sequence before the editor cuts to next scene to enforce meaning into the type of story being told. Emotional scenes are sketched with utter disregard for basic notions of time and place of action. A boy who arrives in a city for the first time easily finds his way back no matter where-ever he ends up and that too in most difficult circumstances. His sprint may put a seasoned marathon runner to shame for the amount of distance covered, the time he requires to do that and the energy he expends.\nRetheesh still exudes promise for he tells a story that traces the faintest trace of goodness in a human being. The manner in which he accomplishes it may be crude, but he succeeds a bit, owing to exceedingly touching characters played brilliantly by Minon and Nedumudi Venu. Jayasurya and Aju Varghese display good heart in concealing the follies of the narrative with an easeful, direct approach to the story. There are moments where Retheesh elevates the film beyond the realms of drab moralizing sermons; like instances where a man helps someone whom he has met just minutes ago or a teacher advising an uneducated boy to give back what doesn\u2019t belong to him."}

All it meant, he wrote, was that the marriage fulfilled the requirements of Article 11 of the Inheritance Law, which does not refer to married couples but to \"mates\" or \"partners.\" According to the law, the partner of someone who dies and bequeaths his estate is eligible to half the legacy if the dead person has children. In this case, the children are awarded the other half. The Inheritance Law applies to situations in which the dead person has not left a will. The incident involved a man whose wife died in 1992. The couple employed a Romanian who helped the ailing wife. The widower and the Romanian were married in a civil ceremony in Romania in 1996 and returned to Israel. The woman applied and received citizenship according to the Law of Return, and the couple registered their marriage. Five months after the wedding, the man died without leaving a will. The man's two children asked the court for a declaration that they were his only inheritors. The woman petitioned against the decision. The court recognized that the couple was married in the context of that particular law and awarded her half the inheritance.

This one slipped right through Stewart\u2019s own hands, even.\nThose fine margins ended up being as small as the width of Stewart\u2019s foot, or the strength of his grasp. Stewart had a chance to make a touchdown-saving tackle on Olamide Zaccheaus on Virginia\u2019s go-ahead touchdown but couldn\u2019t bring him down. In the fourth quarter, with the Tar Heels down by six, Chris Sharp\u2019s fumble bounced right into Stewart\u2019s hands with a clear path to the end zone, only for his right foot to be a few inches out of bounds. Not only did the Tar Heels not get the touchdown, they didn\u2019t even get the fumble.\nThose were just two of many such plays \u2013 like Brandon Harris missing a wide-open Anthony Ratliff-Williams in the end zone on the game\u2019s final drive, or the officials deciding a Virginia player did not grasp Harris\u2019 facemask on North Carolina\u2019s final play \u2013 and Stewart was merely one of many such players, but the fumble non-recovery in particular loomed as a game-changing turn of events.\nSo it goes for the Tar Heels in a season that is not only unlike what Stewart expected, but anything he has experienced in his time at North Carolina.\nHe arrived on campus in 2014 and was suspended for his first game after a hazing incident, not out of character in a season that saw the Tar Heels set records for defensive ineptness, give up 70 points at East Carolina, fall to 6-7 overall and provoke a change of defensive coordinators between the end of the regular season and a bowl loss to Rutgers.\nWhich is to say: Stewart has seen worse than this, even if the Tar Heels\u2019 record right now may not reflect it.\nHe has also seen better, in 2015 when North Carolina played for the ACC championship \u2013 Stewart missed two games of that season after being suspended for an off-campus incident \u2013 and came within a controversial onside kick of having a chance to upset Clemson, and even in 2016 when the Tar Heels weren\u2019t particularly dominant but still managed to grind out eight wins.\nThat team was, in many ways, the opposite of this one. Its errors were never as catastrophic as they have been this year; it eked out wins where this team has eked out losses \u2013 3-3 in one-possession games, as opposed to 0-2 this season.\nThe comparison Stewart draws upon now, though, predates even his tenure. The year before he arrived on campus, North Carolina started 1-5 before winning five straight. Stewart watched that from afar, at home in Arlington, Va., but an interested party nonetheless.\nHe was just a kid then, a high-schooler looking forward to college.

They also will send the Tigers a player to be named or cash.\nIn a separate deal, the Angels let Cameron Maybin go to the Houston Astros on waivers. Maybin was expendable after Upton was acquired, although Eppler said the deals were independent.\nEppler said the Angels got Upton for what he can bring over the final month of 2017. Beyond that is unknown.\nUpton, who signed a six-year, $133 million deal with the Tigers before the 2016 season, has an opt-out in his deal after this season.

Upton has a month to see how much he likes playing for the Angels. Eppler said when he talked to Upton\u2019s agent two years ago, he was told Upton was interested in playing in Southern California.\nFinancially, it\u2019s not a certainty Upton could do better as a free agent, so the decision could come down to other factors.\nFor now, Upton said he\u2019s excited to join the Angels on Friday in Texas, playing for a contender and with Trout and Albert Pujols.

Maye Quade is a first-term Democratic lawmaker who rose to prominence last year after accusing male legislators of sexual harassment. Both men later resigned.\nShe also staged an overnight sit-in on the House floor in April to protest lack of action on gun control legislation.\nMaye Quade was a political organizer for both President Barack Obama\u2019s and Governor Mark Dayton\u2019s campaigns.\nShe was elected as state representative in 2016.\nMurphy was the sole Democratic candidate in the three-way race for governor not to pick a running mate before the convention weekend.\nBefore the November election, they will once again face Walz. He plans to stay in the race despite losing the endorsement after six ballots.\n\u201cClearly there was a split at the DFL convention between the progressives and the labor factions who would rally behind Erin Murphy, and the more moderate folks who had rallied around Congressman Walz,\u201d Larry Jacobs said.\nJacobs is the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School.\nHe added it\u2019s a party division reflected across the country.\nJacobs called Murphy a \u201cgood campaigner,\u201d but said Walz will have more money and a broader base of support.\nThe DFL candidate who wins in the Aug. 14 primary faces the Republican challenger with less money and more fatigue, Jacobs said. There's a lot at stake.\n\u201cThe battle for the Governor's race is probably the most significant political face-off in November,\u201d he said.\nThe GOP already controls the House and Senate.\nHennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson has the Republican endorsement. He faces former Governor Tim Pawlenty in the primary. Pawlenty did not attend the convention.\n\u201cJeff Johnson is mobilizing support among conservatives, among those who support President Trump by reminding them that Tim Pawlenty had been against candidate Trump,\u201d Jacobs said.\nJacobs thinks Pawlenty would\u2019ve lost if he sought the party\u2019s nomination."}

But federal environmental laws are stirring budget tensions and forcing local educators to enter the fray over when and how to limit the harvesting of trees on federal land.\nDozens of counties in California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington state have been sliding into an economic rut since environmental rules adopted nearly a decade ago placed major restrictions on logging. The rules are intended to preserve the natural habitats of the northern spotted owl and other birds, animals, and plants protected under the Endangered Species Act.\nMore recently, even Eastern states, from Pennsylvania to Georgia and Florida, have felt the impact.\nSchool leaders from affected counties have now joined a long-running battle over forest regulation in which lawmakers, environmental groups, and the timber industry are at odds.\nNearly 100 school and local government officials met in Reno, Nev., last month to map out a long-term strategy for addressing the issue. Dozens have made monthly jaunts to Washington to advocate a balance between preservation and managed production that they say is needed to sustain their communities.\n\"The environment-and-timber issue has become very emotional,\" said Superintendent James W. Parsons of the Alpine County, Calif., schools.\nMr. Parsons' tiny northern California district, with some 200 students in grades K-12, has seen nearly a quarter of what was once its $1.6 million annual budget evaporate in the past five years or so. To survive, it has eliminated athletics and several clerical and teaching positions and cut spending on school nurses, curriculum support, transportation, and maintenance.\nEnvironmentalists \"see it in very simplistic terms--that these big timber companies want to get rich fast by clear-cutting the forest,\" Mr. Parsons said. \"I live in the forest, so I don't want to see it decimated,\" he said, but he sees an essential role for the timber industry in forest management.\nCommunities, and their schools, have long depended on the money earned from logging.\nUnder the 1908 federal law that created the national-forest system, some 25 percent of federal timber receipts is turned over to affected counties to pay for schools and roads and compensate for lost tax revenues that the public land could potentially generate. For years, the program was a boon for rural communities, often pumping hundreds of millions of additional dollars into local coffers. School districts have been able to supplement student health services, library and media resources, and curriculum support with the extra money.\nBut the environmental movement of recent decades--fueled by reports of abuses in the industry such as the clear-cutting of thousands of acres of forest and the destruction of natural habitats--has succeeded in gaining strict limits on the industry.\nEnvironmentalists want to see logging activities diminish even further, according to Melanie Griffin, the director of land-protection programs in the Washington, D.C., office of the Sierra Club. Tourism, recreation, and restoration projects could replace many of the lost jobs, she argued.\nThe federal logging program \"puts pressure on counties to cut more than perhaps ought to be cut,\" she said. \"The cutting cannot go on forever. It would make sense to look to a future when economies are not dependent on the timber industry.\"\nA decade ago, some 12 million board-feet of timber was harvested from national forests, according to Chris Wood, an assistant to National Forest Service Chief Michael P.

Today, the online accommodation platform has more than five million listings in 81,000 cities, and on any given night, two million people stay in Airbnb rentals around the world. On New Year's Eve alone, 2,574 guests stayed in castles, 1,031 in tree houses and 121 in windmills.\nAt least 78,000 fans booked Airbnb digs during the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil, and two years later, seven out of 10 foreign visitors made use of the room-sharing service at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea.\nBuilding dozens of hotels for one-off sports events, trade conven\u00adtions or concerts is clearly impractical, and so in cities with limited hotel capacity, or where accommodation is only required for short periods, Airbnb's flexible supply system is a godsend.\nBeyonce would no doubt agree. When the American singer performed at the 2016 Super Bowl half-time show in Santa Clara, California, she stayed at a five-bedroom Airbnb listing that cost US$10,000 (S$13,548) a night.

Inquiry responses will be lightning fast, friendly and helpful. They realise you are likely to be tired and disoriented, might not speak the local language and will struggle to navigate a new city. They will offer to pick you up from the railway station or suggest a nearby landmark as a meeting place.\nInevitably, some hosts won't be home when you arrive but they will text you with an entry keypad pin number, or tell you where they have hidden a spare door key. They will also send a short welcome message, which can be enough to reduce exhausted travellers to tears: \"Let yourself in and make some coffee. There's milk in the fridge, biscuits in the cupboard and the Wi-fi details are on the kitchen table. I'll be home within an hour.\"\nMany of these hospitality industry heroes are designated as \"superhosts\". These are people who invariably receive excellent feedback, mainly because they care more about their guests' experience than the income from a spare room. Women over 60 are currently rated the best Airbnb hosts and 59 per cent of all superhosts are female.\nLurid headlines of house trashings and even the murder of a guest who couldn't pay his bill help sell newspapers but are the exception rather than the rule.

Thankfully it turned out correct!\nIf we had scored eight, Rochdale could have no complaints, while we were really stupid to allow them to score a consolation and ruin the clean sheet.\nAs it was, though, we could have got plenty more. Oli Hawkins had a few headers in the first half, Lee Brown missed a sitter at the very end and keeper Josh Lillis pulled off a great save to deny Omar Bogle.\nIt remains a concern that we tend to regularly play really deep when a couple up.\nBut, apart from the one defensive error, I don\u2019t think Rochdale looked like having anything from the game.\nIt has got to be Jamal Lowe \u2013 or Conor Chaplin!\nHe was outstanding, absolutely outstanding, not only back to the form earlier in the season, but actually better.\nYou look at how he created the space to cross for the first goal.

Rothamsted is not a profit-making multinational company and has a 168-year tradition of providing agricultural research for public good. The chemical ecology group has expertise recognon ised across the globe for environmentally friendly agriculture and has many peer-reviewed publications in this field. We are seeking non-toxic biological solutions to protect crops from aphids (greenfly) for real environmental benefit. We imagine that reducing pesticide dependency is something we can all agree on. We are dismayed that you plan to destroy our crop before we can find out whether it works or not.\nOur new wheat plants contain genes copied from nature and are planted in a highly controlled field trial that has been thoroughly evaluated, inspected and risk-assessed by independent scientists and government. The risk of cross-pollination was judged negligible. All experts agree wheat is self-pollinated not wind or insect pollinated. Wheat flowers fertilise themselves before they open. The pollen, which is heavy, only lives for a few hours and falls to the ground around the plant. Furthermore, this is a very small scale trial eight 6m x 6m plots. The smell the new plants make already occurs naturally in the aroma of more than 400 plant species including apples, hops and mint.\nOur approach is fully compatible with agro-ecological farming and biocontrol because the smell we engineered into wheat attracts natural enemies of pests to fields instead of killing them with broad spectrum pesticides. It could work well with field margins and conservation biocontrol.\nThis is public research for the public and the results would made freely available. We find it sad that our chemical ecology research on insect repellent wheat is being targeted for destruction by you when it is actually part of an alternative vision for sustainable agriculture. We ask you to call off your plans to destroy our publically funded research, and instead come and protest peacefully.\nPlease could you explain why it is justifiable to proceed to destroy crops when you have declined our offer of a public debate on neutral ground? We would have preferred to have met you face-to-face, rather than this debate by correspondence.\nIt's evident from your own application for this trial that you recognise open-air planting of a crop which can cross-pollinate with common couch grass does present a contamination risk. The example of Bayer's 2006 rice trial in America shows that low-pollination risk crops on a supposedly secure small trial site can escape and widely contaminate the food chain. British farmers must be protected from this.\nConcerns about the health implications of GM in the food chain are too readily dismissed and we believe they should be thoroughly assessed before any open field trials are approved. In this case they were dismissed in a cavalier manner. We must look at the real problems caused by GM crops already grown, not try to create more.\nYou claim your experiment represents \"part of an alternative vision for sustainable agriculture\". In which case the very first question should be, is this particular intervention/input needed? As no one, anywhere in the world, currently buys GM wheat \u2013 or seems likely to; and effective long term non-GM methods and non-pecticide methods for dealing with aphids already exist, the answer is no.\nSo why is Rothamsted determined to run this trial? Because it is the best way to achieve sustainable farming? Or is it connected to the fact that it is committed to a biotech, patent and high technological product driven vision that puts the food system, farmers and citizens even firmly in the"}

Having taken the time to seek out a few more other deaf folks, going to a deaf club seemed the next logical step.\nFor sign-language users all over the world, deaf clubs are like second homes, places where they can truly relax and converse with others in their preferred language.\nFor those who lived in Dublin, the location of the main deaf club was a large building in the heart of Drumcondra called the St Vincent\u2019s Centre for Deaf People, next door to the train station.\nSuffice to say, visiting the place for the first time \u2013 and many times subsequently \u2013 quickly brought home to me the importance of deaf clubs as vitally important physical spaces where the use of sign languages can thrive and prosper \u2013 and thereby provide the glue that binds the deaf community together. This includes not just deaf people, but their hearing friends, family, co-workers, interpreters, CODAs (children of deaf adults) and many others besides.\nThese days the deaf club is based just a couple of miles further north in Cabra, in a new campus-type facility called Deaf Village Ireland (DVI). The club was forced out when the Government slapped a compulsory purchase order on the St Vincent\u2019s centre for use as a Metro North station back in 2008. The owner of the building, the Catholic Institute for Deaf People (CIDP), used the generous proceeds of the sale to develop the new facility on lands it owns in Cabra.\nThey could have built something small and modest but, in consultation with the deaf community, it chose to build a large, ambitious new facility incorporating a social centre, a suite of offices and a state-of-the-art sports facility with swimming pool. The offices are occupied by just about every deaf organisation in Ireland, including Chime (formerly Deafhear), the Irish Deaf Society, Deaf Sports Ireland, the Dublin Deaf Association, National Deaf Women of Ireland, the Irish Deaf Youth Association and the Deaf Heritage Centre, not to mention the CIDP.\nIn many places around the world, you will often find that the same facility that houses a deaf club also serves as offices for organisations providing services for deaf people. This makes complete sense and still does, but in an age when government policy now blindly dictates that integrating and dispersing key disability services into the wider community is the way to go, such facilities are often \u2013 and unfairly \u2013 perceived as anachronisms.\nDespite this, DVI was officially opened in 2013 and, barring a few hiccups, is running very smoothly today.

Mobile phone penetration is the United States was 102% as of the end of last year, and this is a conservative number using the entire population of the United States and its territories as the denominator. Removing small children, the elderly and infirm and the prison population, the number would be significantly higher. Not only does every American already have a cell phone, but many of us have two or three.\nBut hey, even though everyone already has a phone, there\u2019s still growth in the smartphone market, right?\nNot nearly as much as you might think. Already, more than 61% of all American mobile phones are smartphones. Even among Americans aged 55 and older, the rate of ownership is 42%.\nWill the baby boomers adopt iPhones and Androids in larger numbers going forward? Probably. But the low-hanging fruit was picked a long time ago. And to the extent that the over-55 demographic adopts smartphones, those people are likely to buy entry-level data plans that are highly competitive on cost.\nIt\u2019s hard to see a lot of room for margin expansion in a saturated market where the \u201cstickiness\u201d of consumer loyalty is being steadily eroded by falling switching costs to the consumer. Add to this the body blow that T-Mobile US (TMUS) dealt to the industry with its adoption of transparent pricing and the elimination of the carrier phone subsidy, and it\u2019s hard to find much to like here.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the effect of that last point. Carriers have offered \u201cfree\u201d or highly discounted phones for a long time as a way of enticing you to pay up for a Cadillac voice and data plan. It was a terrible deal for the consumer, but the pricing was opaque enough that most had no idea just how bad of a deal it was. T-Mobile\u2019s transparent pricing has been something of a wake-up call.\nAll of this is a long way of saying that Vodafone got the better end of this deal. It rids itself of a profitable but soon-to-be no-growth business, has the means to pay off all company debts nearly three times over, and has the financial firepower to expand its emerging-market presence, which is already one of the largest among Western carriers.\nAs far back as 2011, Vodafone\u2019s CEO had publicly stated that Vodafone was an \u201cemerging markets company\u201d and not a European company. Emerging markets accounted for 29% of Vodafone\u2019s service revenue last year and virtually all of its expected future growth. The company operates in 30 countries and partners with other carriers in 40 more.\nSo, what will Vodafone do with all of its cash? That\u2019s a fine question, and the company hasn\u2019t given a lot of specifics just yet. Some combination of debt retirement, share repurchase and a special dividend would seem likely.\nBut should you buy Vodafone now, after the Verizon Wireless divestiture?\nPerhaps.

New breakthroughs in robotics, genetics, computers and other digital technologies will do the same in the generation to come. Here are a few of the areas in which technology will transform hospitals.\nFor many cancers, the standard way to find it and diagnose it is a biopsy, usually a surgical procedure to sample the tumor for testing. The future might see a less invasive way of testing: a simple blood test which could detect fragments of tumors and diagnose them using advanced genomic sequencing techniques. Besides the reduced pain and trauma for the patient, such tests might also allow doctors to pick up on cancers sooner \u2014 and treat them faster.\nFor many patients, the future of the hospital could mean the hospital comes to them. Advances in computing mean you can create ever smaller, ever more powerful processors \u2013 so machines that used to be gigantic can now be really small, like wristwatch size. If you strap a powerful computer to a patient, you can monitor his or her vital signs minutely, on a second-by-second basis, before he or she is in the hospital. That could mean intervening before a patient gets really sick, or simply capturing the same information remotely that used to require a trip to the doctor.\nRobots are already performing surgery \u2014 the DaVinci system, for instance, uses a robot for prostate surgery, although it's not yet clear if robots can do a better job than humans. Still, some tech companies \u2013 like Google \u2013 think that the technology will develop rapidly and that future models will get to a point where robots will be able to do a better job at some surgeries than human surgeons.\nMany sensors in hospitals are bulky: they require work to set up and maintain. In the future, they will get smaller and smaller and be embedded in the hospital bed or places in less obstructive places. They could even be ingested and delivered in pill form. The one-atom-thick sensor above, developed by scientists at Princeton University, is designed to be installed over teeth and can can detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria.\nFor too many hospitals, vital signs monitors mean a tangle of wires and a provider writing down the readings by hand. In the future, the devices will \u201ctalk\u201d to each other instead. Many will be able to make adjustments without human intervention, so a drug infusion pump will be able to recalibrate dosage without any human input. This promises to reduce errors as well as dangers to health care providers: Nurses and doctors could keep farther away from a patient with Ebola, for instance."}

Streets bustled with a lively mix of residents and businesses all day and night. An ever-changing array of shopkeepers peddled their wares. Kids played safely in the streets and parks. We can reclaim that hyperdynamic sense of community \u2013 and we can do it in a way that puts people, not technology, front-and-centre.\nTheir vision includes a range of street types that are designed to be pedestrian friendly, with no private cars. Instead, it will have self-driving \"taxibots\" and buses. Renderings show lots of bikes and streetcars too.\nLike Disney World, it will have an underground network of services, including robot delivery trucks. This will all be a challenge as it is below water level in a toxic soup, but that's why governments are spending a billion and a half bucks to clean up the site.\nThe buildings have some 19th century characteristics, too; like old manufacturing loft buildings, they will be made of wood and be designed for flexibility, adapting to different uses as required. Putting a brewery up on seventh floor may not be the best idea, but most other uses would be fine.\nThey may also be modular, possibly with the nearby decommissioned Hearn generating station acting as a factory. No word on whether the food in the jiffy truck will be organic or vegan.\nThey will be very energy efficient, and will be \"the largest cluster of large-scale Passive House buildings yet constructed in North America.\" Sidewalk is confident \"that the incremental cost of Passive House will decline significantly if it is deployed in several buildings at once.\" It is all part of a plant to make it \"the first truly climate positive community on earth\" with an advanced microgram for electricity and a \"thermal grid.\"\nThe thermal grid will capture heat and cool from multiple sources, balance it in a thermal energy centre, and distribute it to buildings via hot and cold water pipes, just as the energy grid taps multiple sources of electricity generation and manages the electric grid to match demand.\nI\u2019m not fussed about the vehicle counts or sensors that gauge and assess how much waste material is going into Sidewalk\u2019s high-tech recycling systems. But there are other elements in this plan that are potentially far more troubling. For example, sensors on street furniture (are we going to monitor how well a bench is used?) ... But let\u2019s not sugarcoat what\u2019s being proposed, which is the commodification of living in and moving through urban space \u2014 something that only becomes possible if the traces of said movements can be captured and processed.\nLorinc raises some valid concerns about it being a company town, and worries that Toronto might \"become Google\u2019s version of Dearborn, Redmond, or Cupertino.\" Perhaps. Writing in the New York Times, Emily Badger has a few reservations too.\nThe prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially.

{"idx": "38518", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In a team-based structure, employee teams are empowered with project and task responsibilities.\nEmpowerment has become a buzzword in today's business environment. Empowerment generally refers to the management practice of giving employees the authority to make decisions regarding their work, as opposed to a traditional environment in which the boss gives orders. While contemporary business theory often argues that the empowerment style of leadership is more productive, like all leadership styles, it has its benefits and drawbacks.\nEmpowering your employees to make decisions on their own can increase productivity. When employees don't have to wait for approval from a manager or supervisor, workflow doesn't slow down or stop. Employees solve their own problems, and move on to the next task. Being able to make decisions and devise innovative solutions increases employee satisfaction as well. Empowered employees feel as if their contributions matter; when the company trusts them to make decisions, morale increases, and as a result, so does productivity.\nGiving your employees the training, tools and guidance to make independent decisions often encourages them to produce quality work and helps your business meet its goals. In fact, a 1999 study of Canadian hospitals conducted by the University of Alberta found that a culture of employee empowerment and ownership is a key to reaching quality improvement goals and maintaining quality standards. When properly trained employees are empowered to solve problems, take risks or be creative in their approach to work, they are more likely to assume ownership of the tasks. Whether the job is caring for ill patients, developing an entire product line or simply selling movie tickets, empowered employees often feel as if they have a stake in the organization and their work and strive to consistently produce quality results.\nWhile empowering employees can increase morale, productivity and quality, it also has its drawbacks. Without proper training and a set of guidelines, empowerment can lead to chaos. It doesn't make sense to have each employee operate under his own set of values and goals. Employees need guidance in the mission, vision and values of the organization so that their decisions fall in line with company goals and don't cause harm. Empowering organizations need to be comfortable with a certain amount of risk, both in terms of security -- empowered employees often have access to information that could damage the company if leaked -- and in terms of loss due to entrepreneurial failure.\nIn some situations, empowering employees can slow down important processes, particularly during times of major change or instability. In a 2006 study conducted at the University of Texas, \"A Contextual Examination of New Venture Performance: Entrepreneur Leadership Behavior, Top Management Team Heterogeneity and Environmental Dynamism,\" researchers found that companies that need to make rapid decisions are better suited by a directive leader, who can make a quick decision about the work that needs to be done, and by whom. An empowering leadership style works best in an environment that is stable, where the goals are already established and employees can explore options and try new and innovative solutions.\nManagement Study Guide: Employee Empowerment - Good or Bad?\nHamlin, Kristen. \"The Pro & Cons of Empowerment in an Organization.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pro-cons-empowerment-organization-13397.html.

Richard Spalding, CEO of Kontraband and The 7th Chamber looks at the dilemma.\nPacemedia, an-automated self-service portal for television advertisers, announced its findings from its 2013 Advertisers Survey of 264 ad executives that it says shows that 89% of them found television video impressions were more important than online video impressions. A similar overwhelming majority of 88% say there are benefits in better targeting in television advertising."}

During the brief scheduling hearing, Judge Glen Baker said he would review whether Jamal met the qualifications for certain forms of deportation relief and set Jamal\u2019s next hearing for April 27, 2022.\nJamal is applying for two ways to remain in the U.S., one via a cancellation of removal and the other through asylum. Baker, though, said he is not sure whether Jamal is eligible for the cancellation of removal. Baker said he would review the matter and issue a written decision. The hearing in 2022 will proceed either way, since he can apply for asylum.\nJamal\u2019s hearing was combined with that of his wife, Angela Zaynub Chowdhury, who is also from Bangladesh and seeking the same forms of relief.\nIf immigrants have already been living in the United States for 10 years with no disqualifying convictions, they can qualify for a form of deportation relief called a cancellation of removal. Asylum is a process that applies to refugees from a foreign country who can demonstrate they have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of various qualifying factors.\nOne element of Jamal\u2019s case is whether a voluntary departure order that an immigration judge previously issued him is valid. Whether the order is valid matters because it would make Jamal ineligible for a cancellation of removal.\nJamal\u2019s attorney, Michael Sharma-Crawford, told the judge that the order was not valid because Jamal was not provided the proper notifications. He said a box acknowledging that certain required advisals had been read was not checked. Attorney Patricia Lacey, representing the Department of Homeland Security, said the notice was valid and that Jamal had been properly advised regarding the order.\nFollowing the hearing, Sharma-Crawford said that although there is not a timeframe for when the judge will make his decision about the validity of the order, he expected it in coming months.\nSeveral friends and supporters of the Jamals attended the hearing, as did their three school-age children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. The children greeted their parents with smiling faces once the next hearing date was set and the proceedings concluded, and Jamal himself was also positive.\nBetween now and the 2022 court date, Jamal said he plans to stay in Lawrence and continue with what he\u2019s been doing: teaching, researching and taking care of his children. He said he will continue to apply for renewals of his work permit.\nJamal was nearly deported earlier this year related to an overstay of a previous visa, and his case has attracted international attention. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Jamal on Jan. 24 as he was taking his children to school and he was subsequently held in ICE custody about two months.\nIn mid-February, Jamal was put on a plane back to Bangladesh, but a midair decision allowed him to return to the U.S. to have his case reviewed.

The LMN movie is written by Christine Conradt and directed by Alyn Darnay. Girlfriend Killer is about a businesswoman who owns an agency that sets up the perfect marriage proposals, but when she becomes the object of a jilted client\u2019s obsession, someone is bound to be murdered. Girlfriend Killer is not advertised as a true-story movie. However, it sounds very similar to a case that made headlines in 2016. Girlfriend Killer stars Barbie Castro and Corin Nemec.\nCarmen Ruiz runs a savvy online business. Rich men find the woman of their dreams and Carmen works her magic to make sure the woman accepts. Her elaborate marriage proposal packages are well-thought out and perfectly planned. The situation is no different when she meets Emerson Banes, a handsome man who is planning to ask his girlfriend to marry him.\nWhen Emerson finally proposes to his girlfriend, she rejects the proposal, sending Emerson into a sea of despair. Carmen is devastated for Emerson. The marriage proposal planner\u2019s success rate for creating romantic events is usually high, so she feels the need to help him.\nIn speaking with him, Carmen comes on a bit too strong, and Girlfriend Killer\u2019s Emerson believes that she is in love with him. Mistaking her sympathy for romantic interest, Emerson leads himself down a deadly path of obsession after Carmen also rejects his advances.\nNow, an insane and crazed Emerson decides that he won\u2019t accept one more rejection. To tie Carmen\u2019s hands, he abducts her daughter, in the hopes that Carmen will come looking for them. Will Detective Baker and Detective Michelle Price save Carmen and her daughter in time?\nGirlfriend Killer\u2018s plot, though fictional, could have been inspired by a real-life case. With marriage proposal event planning on the rise, people are willing to pay top dollar for the perfect marriage proposal with no guarantee that the person will accept. In most cases, the rejection ends in tears and months of sorrow. However, sometimes rejected proposals end in murder.\nTake the example of the following true stories.\nIn 2007, Ricardo Antonio Navarro thought that asking for his girlfriend\u2019s hand on national TV would make the perfect marriage proposal. He thought wrong. When his Russian girlfriend, Svetlana Orlova, declined and rejected him in front of viewers, he stabbed her to death.\nAlmost 10 years later, in 2016, another marriage proposal ended in murder. According to Fox-59, Jason Eaton, 43, killed his girlfriend, Wendy Sabatini, 44, after he walked into the bedroom with a ring in his hand to propose to her. When she turned him down, even before he could finish the question, he finished her off by retrieving the gun from a drawer and shooting her to death. Then, he left her dead body in the bedroom.\nWhen Wendy Sabatini\u2019s teenage son came home from school, he made himself something to eat. He had no idea that his mom\u2019s dead body was upstairs until police came to the door.\nLifetime fans will be happy to see actor Corin Nemec return to LMN.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!\nRobson Moura is also a very good butterfly guard player, but Marcelo Garcia is the best by far and a subscription to MGinAction will get you more butterfly material than you could ever absorb.\nThe sad truth is that few guys play pure \"butterfly guard\" outside of mma. In the modern game, butterfly guard is really more a set of principles that link the hook sweep or shin to shin position with leglocks/1 legged x guard.\nFor true butterfly guard against a kneeling opponent, I would watch Marcelo and Leo Santos. I would augment that with watching some guys who are sick at transitioning between butterfly guard and leglocks (rather than 1 legged x). In the gi, I would also focus on watching some guys who are great off a sitting collar drag (like braulio).\nI really don't think you can get away from learning a lot of modern half guard/DLR/RDLR even if you are a butterfly guard player. It's not the kind of guard where you can sit there and avoid transitioning into other guards. You will need a versatile set of leg attacks if you are a butterfly guard player, period. They can be leglocks, x guard, inverting DLR/RDLR, or regular wrestling takedowns. But you are going to need to attack the legs like a dog as a butterfly player, because attacking the legs is where your sweeps are going to come from. The more traditional attacks on the head and arms combined with hook sweep (basically like closed guard with hooks in) is not something you are going to be able to forcibly sit and work against advanced opponents for any length of time.\nFor what it's worth, I personally find that RDLR transitions nicely into shin-on-shin on the same side and butterfly on the opposite side. The former is useful when the opponent kills your distance control, or tries to halt the single leg, and the latter comes in handy any time your knees get redirected, or sitting up to recover vs. a front side pass (Marcelo style).\nI couldn't disagree more with you guys...The reason people use DLR and inversions is because someone started to use it and dominate. It's not a superior guard, but the players who were using it were, bc they were training harder and were talented.\nIf some \"new Miyao Bros\" started using butterfly, they would have the same success. Not because of the guard, but because they WORK HARD, are TALENTED and IMPOSE THEIR GAME.\nSo...don't limit your game to other people game!\nrules? they are still very similar to the time when butterfly was more popular.\nWhat happens is that guard pullers are lazier now...butterfly comes easily if you pull closed guard.\nMW: Lo sweeping with X, Otavio with sit ups (ok, a DLR derivation), Vitor Oliveira with HG and pressure passing, Estima and Calasans with closed guard.\nI rolled with"}

He wrote that the breach shows that government can\u2019t secure data. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d he added.\nCall said Gov. Mark Dayton recommended funding better technology to protect against phishing attacks, but the Legislature didn\u2019t fund it.\nCall said that, generally, attackers will look to monetize data or use e-mail addresses to send out more phishing attacks. Hackers could also try to reroute paychecks or target government systems to be disruptive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to go back to the days of paper. It\u2019s always going to be out there,\u201d he said of personal data stored electronically. But, he added, Minnesota needs to invest more to ward off and respond to cyberattacks.\nLast December, a hacker targeted Explore Minnesota, the state\u2019s tourism agency, with phony news postings on Facebook. In April 2017, an e-mail \u201cspear phishing\u201d attack targeted the state Department of Education but was unsuccessful in getting data. And in June 2017, a hacker targeted the University of Minnesota\u2019s computer system but didn\u2019t access private data, following similar attacks against Minnesota State University Moorhead and other state government databases.\nDHS is preparing a report on the data breach. The report is expected by early to mid-November."}

For a President who has clearly established that foreign policy is not something that gets him up in the morning (or appears to keep him awake at night), Latin America must rank just above Antarctica in descending areas of interest.\nThis uneven, sporadic focus on the region has led to only adverse consequences for U.S. interests. What effort the administration does expend seems only directed toward placating a smattering of hostile populist regimes, while ignoring the interests of our friends. Indeed, the predictable response is that we have only emboldened our enemies and despaired those in the hemisphere who share the U.S. vision of open political systems, free markets, and robust trade.\nRadical populists in Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia have run roughshod over democratic institutions and the best Washington can come up with is asking for the terms under which a U.S. ambassador would be allowed to return to their capitals. In Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega is likely chuckling at the feeble U.S. response to his recently rigged re-election.\nIt also appears that the administration has lulled itself into complacency over a cancer-stricken Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, ground zero for regional instability, seemingly content to wait and see what happens after Ch\u00e1vez passes from the scene. But even as his circus antics continue, he is leaving behind what my colleague Roger Noriega calls a mountain of toxic waste that will take years to clean up.\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s days may indeed be numbered, but his friends in Iran, Russia, China, and Cuba are certainly taking the long-term view of things. All four have been great beneficiaries of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s political solidarity and oil-fueled largesse and can be counted on to want to maintain that access with or without him in power. In other words, don\u2019t count on them to support a democratic transition away from Chavismo, only a succession. Every day, the United States stands idly on the sidelines, the chances they will succeed improve.\nThe administration\u2019s complacency may also be due to the current economic boom the region is experiencing, as commodity producers are riding the great wave of Chinese demand. If the U.S. profile in the region has diminished, does it really matter? Times are good, government coffers are relatively full, and poverty is declining.\nThe problem with this scenario is that Chinese demand will not always be there. The Chinese economy as it exists today will not be the same one a decade from now. Moreover, long-term regional prosperity is not going to be built on producing raw materials for the development of the Chinese economy today. All the current boom is accomplishing today is masking over the deep structural changes that are still desperately needed in most of the region\u2019s economies.\nThere will be many who will cheer-lead that Latin America is finally out from underneath the United States\u2019 long shadow and doing great \"on its own\" \u2013 but such sentiments are short-sighted. Many challenges remain: transnational criminal organizations involved in the drug trade continue to wreak havoc, making a mockery of rule of law along with corruption in many countries; too many citizens in the region are shut out of their country\u2019s economies through excessive regulation and other barriers; and doing business in the region is still too difficult to draw the kind of investment that is flowing to Asia.\nIt\u2019s not the United States has all the answers for what ails the hemisphere, but what we can"}

He confirmed to Yahoo News that he was questioned for more than two hours on Sept. 1 by an FBI agent and a Justice Department national security lawyer at the bureau\u2019s Washington field office.\nThat was equally true of TASS and Pravda back in the Cold War era, though. Did the US force them to register under FARA? I honestly do not recall whether we did or not, but that precedent might be helpful in this case. Do we do the same for other government-controlled media operating in the US now? For instance, Feinberg draws a distinction between Sputnik and al-Jazeera that may be less certain than what Feinberg assumes.\nThese aren\u2019t questions designed to let Sputnik and RT off the hook. Both of them have reputations as shills for Putin and harbors for anti-American cranks, which is why they have about the same level of credibility that TASS and Pravda had back in the day. The White House Correspondents Association could have denied Sputnik credentials without getting the FBI involved, however, which might have reduced their credibility even further. Their market reach surely has been limited by their laughable propaganda.\nThe issue here is whether the FBI and DoJ should get into the business of regulating foreign news agencies, regardless of their connection to foreign governments. FARA is intended to heighten transparency in lobbying, not news media, and expanding it into the media realm could set dangerous precedents down the road for Americans engaged in free speech. Will the FBI look into those websites who regurgitated Sputnik\u2019s nonsense for FARA violations, merely for publicly agreeing with it? In another administration, might pro-Israel websites and journalists get similarly probed for backing them?\nPerhaps the FBI just wants to establish the \u201cfake news\u201d distribution chain for context in investigations of others. If so, that would make more sense than a probe into whether Sputnik or RT should register as foreign agents when they do not lobby government officials."}

Now you can play at discovering them and convincing them to vote for Clinton.\nIf you\u2019re not having fun this election season, Jane McGonigal wants to help.\nWhen Pok\u00e9mon Go launched two weeks after the Brexit vote this summer, McGonigal, a game designer, was struck by the difference in engagement between the game and the political discourse. People playing Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2013the fastest-growing game ever\u2013were suddenly exercising when they hadn\u2019t before, or meeting people despite social anxiety. The game was motivating people in ways and at a scale that seemed unprecedented.\nIn the U.K. vote, by contrast, people felt profoundly disempowered: The next day, many voters reported that they didn\u2019t think their vote would actually count.\nAs she thought about the consequences of the U.S. presidential race, McGonigal started to wonder if she could create an experience for the election cycle that would replicate the emotional pull, and sense of empowered fun, of Pok\u00e9mon Go. Shortly thereafter, she happened to get a call from MoveOn.org asking her to design a game for the election.\nThe game, which will be unveiled on October 10, does two things. First, it helps you find people in your social network who happen to live in swing states and who are undecided. Then it gives you dozens of new approaches to help convince them to vote\u2013and to vote for the candidate you believe in (because this is MoveOn, that means not Trump).\nTalking to a voter you know is more effective, but people often tend to assume\u2013in part because of the filter bubble of social media\u2013that most people they know already agree with them about the election.\nOf course, when people spend a little time thinking about it, they realize that\u2019s not true. An uncle in Virginia might be planning to vote for Trump, or a friend in Ohio might not plan to vote at all. A relative in Iowa might plan to vote for a third-party candidate. With more tenuous connections, the list might be much longer.\nThough the game is fully under wraps now, McGonigal says it avoids the gamification techniques that have been used in some attempts at voter engagement in the past\u2013with incentives like points or badges or leaderboards, which may or may not actually motivate anyone.\nMcGonigal also spent the last few months studying what made Pok\u00e9mon Go so successful\u2013factors such as what she calls \u201con-demand chances to succeed\u201d and a sense of abundance\u2013and incorporated those into the new game. Like Pok\u00e9mon Go, the game will let people play anytime, wherever they are.\nThough it\u2019s a new tool, MoveOn.org believes there\u2019s evidence that it might work. One to one, authentic conversations with voters are proven to be powerful, especially with voters with someone knows. And in early tests of the game, the techniques have been successful.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some of the most amazing conversations with my parents, who vote typically in a way that I am not excited about,\u201d says McGonigal.\nThe game\u2013whose name will be announced on October 10\u2013is temporarily called Top Secret Election Game.\nRelated Video: Which Social Media Platform Is \u201cWinning\u201d The 2016 Election?"}

The purpose of the study was to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in the perception of teachers in the two separate groups in terms of how they incorporated instructional strategies that were associated with PLCs. The sample from which teachers were selected included high school teachers from a large Midwestern county.\nThe Professional Learning Community Assessment-Revised (PLCA-R; Olivier, Hipp, & Huffman, 2010) survey instrument was used to measure the perception of teachers across six different domains of a PLC. This study attempted to determine whether: (1) there were statistically significant differences in the perceptions of teachers in schools with and without professional learning communities across the six dimensions associated with professional learning communities; and (2) gender, ethnicity, number of years teaching, and curricular content influenced the perception of teachers on the six domains associated with a professional learning community. Utilizing an ex post facto design, the researcher administered two separate instruments, the PLCA-R and a demographic survey to test the five research questions. Of the 1,143 instruments uploaded to a secured website, 221 teachers (or 19.3%) completed the survey instruments. A one-way MANOVA was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the perception of teachers in the two types of schools. The 0.05 level of confidence was used for determining statistical significance. Findings in this study indicate that teachers in schools without PLCs had more positive perceptions regarding PLCs than their corresponding counterparts. In addition, gender and content area taught did not appear to have any influence on teachers' perceptions of PLCs. Consideration should be given to expanding the sample size to include school districts that are more representative of school districts in the state and nation.

In a letter that spread across Facebook last week, John Floros, dean of K-State's College of Agriculture, said that such cuts would be a \"crisis in the making.\" But things are a little brighter for the department, which works in a variety of ways to help and grow Kansas agriculture, the state's biggest industry. Rep. Marc Rhoades, R-Newton, chairman of the House Appropriations and Legislative Budget committees, called the more far-reaching cuts to Research and Extension a \"clerical error\" that was addressed in the past week. \"In capping higher education salaries for 2014, we saw four higher education institutions had expenditures below their 2013 approved budgets. During conference committee, half the capped money was restored to those schools,\" Rhoades said in an email to The News on Wednesday. \"However, the KSU Extension Service was inadvertently included with KSU as one unit when calculations were made. Once the oversight was noticed, that portion was restored.\" Rep. Don Hineman, R-Dighton, said he and many of his colleagues expressed concerns about extension cuts and that he would have voted against any measure that included them. While it appears those extensive cuts aren't part of a budget, \"no one knows what it will take to build a budget,\" he said. \"But I do hear enough negative comments about it I don't think it would pass.\" Earlier this month, the House and Senate Conference Committee had agreed to a 1.5 percent across-the-board cut to higher education for fiscal 2014 and an additional 1.5 percent cut for fiscal 2015. Also, the plan called for an immediate salary cap lapse - a sweep of all vacant positions starting from March 2013, said Floros. That would have amounted to an 8 percent permanent budget reduction - or an 11 percent cut in all - slicing about $6 million from the $50 million typically allocated by the Legislature. The measure in the Senate still calls for a 2 percent cut to higher education, Floros said, adding that is a \"great relief\" compared to the previous measure. \"But we are still left with a cut, and we have a workforce that has not had a salary merit raise in six years,\" he said Wednesday. \"We take great pride for the people we have, but if we have to compensate, the quality of our organization will suffer.\" The university's total budget is $150 million, he said, adding that K-State ranks the lowest in the Big 12 for salaries and ranks 41 out of 48 land-grant institutions regarding pay. Floros said that for every dollar invested in the College of Agriculture and K-State Research and Extension, $20 to $40 in long-term economic growth is created.

It was ages ago, sure\u2014years before Robinson broke out on NBC's The Office as Darryl Philbin, the irritable warehouse employee, then appeared in films like Hot Tub Time Machine and This Is The End. But Robinson didn't have trouble channeling those early days to concoct his own new semi-autobiographical sitcom, Mr. Robinson, which premiere tomorrow night on NBC. \"This show is tailor-made for me,\" Robinson says of his debut turn as a leading man, in which he plays an elementary school teacher and musician. Seeing as he has some real-life experience, we talked to Robinson about how to best handle annoying children, how he's dealing with his moment in the spotlight, and what important lesson he learned from Steve Carrell.\nIs it safe to say Mr. Robinson incorporates some autobiographical elements?\nYes. It's autobiographical in the sense that I was a schoolteacher in Chicago. A music teacher. It was in the inner city at a school called Horace Mann. I think I was most effective when the kids pissed me off [laughs]. I would get super-serious with everybody and they would be like, \"Oh okay.

She taught me in high school and she would take us and put us in these madrigal groups. We would go to a museum or whatever and just perform. So I started to do that with these kids.

He used it to come up with the g Factor theory of intelligence way back in 1904. Factor analysis is an interesting combination of objective and subjective, because the final step of giving names to the most important underlying structures is a creative one.\nHere's a study looking at the top five factors in entertainment tastes.\nPeople spend considerable amounts of time and money listening to music, watching TV and movies, and reading books and magazines, yet almost no attention in psychology has been devoted to understanding individual differences in preferences for such entertainment. The present research was designed to examine the structure and correlates of entertainment genre preferences. Analyses of the genre preferences of over 3,000 individuals revealed a remarkably clear factor structure. Using multiple samples, methods, and geographic regions, data converged to reveal five entertainment-preference dimensions: Communal, Aesthetic, Dark, Thrilling, and Cerebral. Preferences for these entertainment dimensions were uniquely related to demographics and personality traits. Results also indicated that personality accounted for significant proportions of variance in entertainment preferences over and above demographics. The results provide a foundation for developing and testing hypotheses about the psychology of entertainment preferences.\nThe name \"communal\" was chosen to distinguish it from the other two lowbrow factors, which cluster together to form a \"rebellious\" grouping. \"Communal\" could probably better be entitled \"Relationship\" entertainment aimed at women who are most interested in personal relationships.\nThe Cerebral factor might better be named \"Informative.\" It sounds a lot like entertainment for what I call Frequent Flyers: people with management and technical jobs who travel a lot on business and like information. James Michener rather than John Updike. (My favorite Updike novel is The Coup, which imparts a Michener-worthy load of information about Africa in Updike's deliriously aesthetic style.) Airport bookstores and newsstands cater to their interests. Humorist Dave Barry, who is from Armonk, NY, home of IBM, is the poet laureate of Frequent Flyers.\nIt would be interesting to drill down further within this group to see if the nerds and managers can be distinguished. Adding sports would help. Management types tend to like to play team sports and watch spectator sports. Nerds are less interested in watching sports and are more interested in less structured outdoor activities, such as, say, kayaking."}

Carson leaned on his upbringing growing up in inner-city Detroit and his family's need for public assistance, although they never lived in public housing, to make up for his lack of experience related to running the $47 billion agency.\n\"I have actually in my life understood what housing insecurity was,\" Carson said, CNN reports. Carson added that his family was forced to move from Detroit to Boston because they had \"no place to live.\"\nAs such, Carson assured the committee that he understands issues facing the millions of people dependent on HUD programs. Carson also included four letters from past HUD secretaries supporting his confirmation, CNN reports.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) challenged Carson's nomination.\n\"Although you have many accomplishments in the medical field, there is relatively little in the public record that reveals how you would further HUD's mission,\" Warren wrote in a letter to Carson questioning the former GOP presidential candidate\u2019s qualifications.\nIt's Ben Carson's turn in the hot seat as the former neurosurgeon and onetime opponent of President-elect Donald Trump sits before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday morning in hopes of being voted head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nCarson\u2019s nomination was a bit of a shock after the former GOP presidential candidate noted that he didn't have experience to be considered for a Cabinet seat. According to CNN, Carson has \"no government experience or expertise in housing and urban development policy, and Democrats on the Senate Banking committee are expected to question his qualifications to lead the $47 billion agency, which is charged with helping millions of poor Americans secure affordable housing.\"\nBecause Carson's area of expertise is outside the realm of what's needed to do this job effectively (a trend among the majority of Trump's Cabinet selections), Carson is expected to highlight his time growing up in Detroit. Somehow, Carson believes that his Dickensian ascension from the inner city to becoming a renowned neurosurgeon will be enough to sway the committee that he can handle HUD. CNN notes that although Carson's family received food stamps, he never lived in public housing.\nAn early release of his opening statement viewed by CNN shows that Carson plans to argue that because he grew up poor, he understands the needs of those relying on HUD programs.\n\"I understand housing insecurity\u2014we were forced to move from Detroit to Boston to live with relatives because she couldn't afford our house,\" Carson says in the written statement.\nIf Carson is confirmed, he would be the only African American in Trump's Cabinet."}

Local papers strive so hard for fresh angles that they can't even agree on something as simple as the weather forecast.\nSo, Londoners were surely surprised Sunday to find the normally suspicious, cynical papers all declaring that Saturday's Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium was--literally--the Greatest Show on Earth.\n\"Rock's Night of Glory,\" proclaimed the Mirror in a front-page headline. \"Rock's Finest Hour,\" agreed the Mail. \"An unprecedented outbreak of human goodness,\" suggested the Sunday Times. And on and on.\nThese notices must have been heartwarming for Bob Geldof, the rock singer who worked for months corralling dozens of the world's leading pop acts into joining this campaign to help famine victims in Africa.\nBut Geldof is too sophisticated to believe that the final evaluation of the event has been made.\nThe Irish performer insisted from the day he announced the Live Aid concerts that the event's importance won't be measured by what happens on stage, but in the money--and, more importantly, the social consciousness--that will be raised. It'll be easy, eventually, to tally the money. Live Aid officials said Sunday they won't have an exact figure for weeks, but the amount raised will greatly exceed the cautious $10 million estimate offered earlier by Geldof. The issue of public consciousness is far harder to measure. Even more than money, Geldof's goal--\"Ending hunger: Now that we can, we must\"--was to arouse public concern over the horrors in Africa, and to mobilize that public opinion into convincing governments to do more to stop the deaths of millions of people.\nOne moment during Saturday's concert here underscored the difficulty of raising that consciousness and why it is too early to call the Live Aid shows a victory.\nDavid Bowie, whose set drew one of the day's strongest responses, had been so moved earlier in the week by a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. video of Ethiopian famine victims that he cut his performance short so the video could be shown on the giant Diamond Vision screens at Wembley, and to millions more on television.\nBefore leaving the stage Bowie introduced the video and urged the audience to pay attention. The scenes were absolutely heart-wrenching: mothers and their infants, both without the strength even to move, and with nothing to look forward to except death. The video was so powerful that the BBC repeated it twice during the evening.\nSo what happened in Wembley Stadium? About a third of the audience did seem to watch the screens, and some around me were moved to tears. But considerably more took the break from the music as a sign of intermission, turning to their neighbors to talk about such things as whether the surviving Beatles were going to get together for the finale.\nPerhaps 5,000 or more people--missing the awesome irony involved--got up from their seats and headed for the food stands.\nIn the glow of the proud moments these concerts represent in rock history, that reaction reminds us that Live Aid and the USA for Africa effort are still fighting an uphill battle. The dying continues.\nIn all the media discussion over whether Live Aid was another Woodstock, it is important to remember that Woodstock was looked upon as a socio-cultural turning point not because of the performers, but because of the attitude and size of the crowd.\nThe thousands of young people who gathered in Upstate New York in 1969 were part of a generation intent on declaring its"}

Various armed factions hold sway in broad swaths of the country, but much of the rebel-controlled terrain is thinly populated desert.\nThe oft-repeated statistics \u2014 more than 4 million have left the country and 8 million are internally displaced \u2014 hardly hint at the physical and psychological demolition of Syria, once a cultural and intellectual hub of the Middle East.\nStill, ever-resilient Syrians strive to maintain some shreds of social cohesion amid an overriding sense of insecurity and uncertainty about the future.\nDaily conversations on Skype, WhatsApp and other social media applications help people stay in touch with those scattered around the world.

However, there are usability issues that need urgent attention.\nThis is a saas service so I was surprised that it only works with Windows machines. While having to use Internet Explorer because of Firefox incompatibility, it crashed the browser twice. The user interface is not particularly friendly and it uses Times New Roman as a font face, which as far as I know, only the IMDB has successfully pulled off. Since Internet Explorer was crashing, I tried Firefox, with the IETab plugin, as this makes the software work in Firefox.\nThe software is bulky, buttons are abbreviated and at first glance it is difficult to understand what they do. There are inline frames with scrollbars. I was never quite certain where I was in the program and equally unclear as to what I was meant to be doing. Maybe it's because I'm 'just a kid' who knows Excel pretty well, but I'm happy with Excel. I know where things are, I know what they do, I know how to make pretty little pie-charts and 3D graphs. Any new product based on a spreadsheet metaphor is going to present challenges but this product should only be put in the hands of power users prepreaed to invest in learning the solution.\nOne bright spot is the version tracker. All too often, spreadsheets end up in a mess because someone messed up the template and it didn't get spotted until the next revision. With model sheet you can get back to the previous version to figure out the model inconsistency. Consider this feature a \"shadow copy\" of a spreadsheet - being able to go back and forth through edits and updates.\nAt this stage, I'm not sure Modelsheet makes life easier. After wrestling with it for 24 hours I found myself bemused. While the software is meant to make tasks like budgeting and forecasting easier, I found it too hard to understand without expending a significant effort. In today's consumery world, that's not going to stand up well to scrutiny. Today's users expect intuitive interfaces and right now, I don't see that. You can argue that serious software demands serioius attention but all the talk I hear is of intuitive working. After all, who has time?\nI hoped the video introduction might help. But it was so dull, I found myself dreaming of an intensive tour of a cardboard box factory followed by pampering in a day long Chinese water torture experiment.

And the effects are not the same for all people: the disenfranchised are disproportionately poor, minority, elderly and disabled.\nIn the predominantly African American city of East St. Louis, the race for United States senator in 2008 was missing a header that specified the type or level of government (Federal, Congressional, Legislative, etc). Almost 10 percent of East St. Louis voters did not have their vote counted for U.S. Senate, compared to the state average of 4.4 percent. Merely adding a header could have solved the problem. Below you can see the original ballot and the Brennan Center redesign.\n\u201cWhen we design things in a way that doesn\u2019t work for all voters, we degrade the quality of democracy,\u201d said Whitney Quesenbery, a ballot expert and co-director of the Center for Civic Design, an organization that uses design to ensure voters vote the way they want to on Election Day.\nMany mistakes can be avoided with tiny tweaks.\nDesigner Marcia Lausen, who directs the School of Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, wrote a whole book about how democracy can be improved with design. She even tackles the infamous butterfly ballot. The 2000 Chicago Cook County judicial retention ballot crammed 73 candidates into 10 pages of a butterfly layout punch card ballot, with punch holes packed much more tightly together than in previous elections. As in Palm Beach, Yes/No votes for the candidates on the left page were confusingly interlaced with Yes/No votes for the right page.\nLausen\u2019s proposed redesign eliminates the interlaced Yes/No votes, introduces a more legible typeface, uses shading and outlines to connect names and Yes/No\u2019s with the appropriate punch holes, and removes redundant language.\nMinnesota\u2019s mailing envelope is a good example of how designers can solve design problems well before any election actually happens \u2014 by testing those ballots beforehand.\nBad instructions are a design problem, too.\nBeyond layout and ordering, the unanimous winner for worst part of ballot design? Instructions.\nEven if the instructions are clear, placement of instructions has a huge effect on whether people understand them. In usability tests conducted in Florida\u2019s Sarasota and Duval counties in 2008, the majority of participants got to the end of the ballot and stopped. Which was a problem, because the ballot continued on the other side. Despite instructions specifically telling people to"}

It lies in the constituency of the same name which last month saw Conservative defector Douglas Carswell winning a byelection \u2013 brought about by his defection from the Tories \u2013 for the UK Independence Party (Ukip).\nClacton, which is obsessed with immigration, has few, if any immigrants. Ninety-five in every 100 residents are white British. Indeed, it has few of any demographic other than an ageing population that moved out to the seaside town on retirement.\nCarswell\u2019s victory, therefore, was dismissed by Conservatives \u2013 Clacton is redneck territory best by described by a defaced advertising poster: \u201cClacton for the Incontinent\u201d.\nToday, however, matters are different. In the early hours of yesterday, another former Conservative MP, Mark Reckless, who too had provoked a byelection, won his seat in Rochester and Strood in Kent for Ukip.\nThe Tories vowed to have his head following his defection. Prime minister David Cameron, referring to Reckless, told party members in the constituency that he would get \u201chis fat arse off the green benches of the House of Commons\u201d.\nThe party certainly tried; it spent a fortune on the campaign. MPs were dragooned into service in the constituency, but it did not work \u2013 Reckless won by 2,900 votes. However, this was less than Ukip had been predicting in the days immediately before the vote, and not enough, the Tories now claim, to hold on to the seat in next May\u2019s general election.\nMichael Ashcroft\u2019s polling \u2013 increasingly the Bible for political obsessives \u2013 suggests that the Tories have grounds for hope, if not optimism, as Reckless\u2019s lead falls to just one percentage point.\nUkip however is doing better, even if its ability to target voters using data-management techniques, which was the subject of glowing reviews during the campaign, is still an imperfect beast.\nMost importantly, it managed to fend off a Tory campaign that was directly targeted at Reckless \u2013 they assaulted his honesty, his intelligence, his loyalty and his past declarations.\nTories argue that the negative campaign worked, after a fashion.

(AP) \u2014 Louisiana's Republican Party leader is calling on GOP contenders for governor to focus their ire on Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards and avoid attacks on each other, after one Republican contender appeared to be linked to intraparty fighting.\n\"Our Republican candidates must wage this campaign in the knowledge that Republican infighting only assures a second victory for John Bel Edwards, and we must not let that happen!\" GOP Chairman Louis Gurvich said in a statement released Thursday night.\nThe comments followed information that appears to connect businessman Eddie Rispone's campaign to a website slamming fellow Republican gubernatorial candidate Ralph Abraham. The website Conservative Intelligence Briefing, known as Conservative Intel, questioned the conservative bonafides of Abraham, a third-term congressman, and suggested Abraham doesn't support President Donald Trump, who remains popular in Louisiana.\nRispone's spokesman circulated the website post, and the Rispone campaign sent out a fundraising email through the conservativeintel.com domain.\n\"Clearly they were involved. They can't deny that,\" said Abraham's political consultant Lionel Rainey. \"They do business with the company, and they sent the email out.\"\nRispone spokesman Anthony Ramirez didn't respond Friday to a phone call and text message seeking comment about Gurvich's statement or the website post .\nConcerns about GOP infighting are particularly acute ahead of the October election, because Republicans blame attacks among their own candidates for helping to elect Edwards four years ago. In that 2015 race, Republican candidates Scott Angelle and Jay Dardenne focused their criticism on GOP rival David Vitter instead of Edwards in the primary, and Vitter limped into a runoff against Edwards badly wounded from the hits.\nGurvich didn't say whether he believes Rispone was directly involved in the attack on Abraham.\n\"However, I do think it is an appropriate time to remind our candidates that the one essential imperative of this campaign season is to defeat John Bel Edwards,\" the GOP chairman said. He said personal attacks \"have no place in this contest,\" and he warned the \"party will not permit a reprise of 2015.\"\nRainey said the congressman will keep his focus on Edwards.\n\"You would think that we had learned our lesson,\" Rainey said. \"If Republicans want to beat John Bel in October, we can't make the same mistakes that allowed him to be elected in the first place.\"\nThe Conservative Intel post pointed to critical comments Abraham made about Trump during the presidential election after an \"Access Hollywood\" recording emerged in October 2016 of Trump boasting about groping women. At the time, according to The Advocate newspaper, Abraham called the comments offensive and suggested Trump should \"consider whether he needs to step aside\" and let his then-running mate Mike Pence lead the GOP ticket.\nSince Trump took office, Abraham has been a strong backer of the president and his policies. But the Conservative Intel website said Trump supporters should \"be wary.\"\n\"Ralph Abraham and #NeverTrump candidates like him across the country should not be given a free pass. Abraham was against Donald Trump before he won the presidency, and is supportive now only out of necessity and his own self-interest,\" the unsigned website post said."}

It\u2019s the sequel to the original Drift Mania Championship, which RatRod claims has over 10 million players worldwide, and is available now as a paid Universal download for $1.99.\nIn Drift Mania Championship 2, players take on the role of a rookie drift racing driver aiming to make a name for themselves on the world circuit. Through completing a series of challenges and attaining high scores, players will earn money through which they can upgrade their car or purchase new vehicles and thus put themselves in with a chance of completing more difficult races.\nThere are four modes of play in the game \u2014 Career, Tournament, Multiplayer and Practice. In Career Mode, players work their way through a series of challenges and upgrade their vehicle to ensure success. In Tournament, players compete in a short knockout competition over a series of rounds. In Multiplayer, players compete online against others. And in Practice, players can get used to their cars and the various control schemes until they find something that works for them.\nBy default, the player controls their vehicle through a combination of tilt-based steering, a touch-sensitive \u201cthrottle bar\u201d at the side of the screen and a handbrake icon in the opposite corner. Through accessing the settings menu, the player may customize these controls to their liking by moving them around the screen, swapping them to \u201cleft-handed\u201d mode or even changing their style \u2014 tilt controls may be replaced with an on-screen steering wheel if desired, and the throttle bar may be replaced with a gas pedal virtual button. Sensitivity of all the controls may also be adjusted, meaning the player can make the experience something that works for them. There is a steep learning curve to learning to control the car effectively, but practice pays off over time.\nPlayers progress through races by successfully using the controls to drift their car around corners at high speed in order to score points. Drifting in specially-marked areas and chaining moves together increases the points attained, but crashing into something loses the score earned for that particular combo. Players have a limited amount of time and set number of laps of a course to achieve as high a score as possible and, upon completion of a challenge, may submit their score online to compare their performance against other players from all across the world.\nThe game features excellent presentation, with high-definition video sequences, impressive static artwork in the menus and smoothly-animating 3D visuals in races. Background music is also thematically appropriate, though the strong focus on American punk/rock may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. The game has no objections to the player using their device\u2019s music library or other music apps for background audio, however.\nDrift Mania Championship is an excellent game for fans of drift racing and car enthusiasts in general. The high level of detail in the simulation-style driving and the enormous degree of customization makes this a game with a considerable degree of depth and replay value that players will likely be enjoying for many months to come.\nAs a new release, Drift Mania Championship 2 is not yet listed on the App Store leaderboards. Check back shortly to follow its progress with AppData, our tracking service for mobile and social apps and developers."}

The museum has no collection to speak of, no money just yet to buy art, and no budget to operate beyond the next few months, although they say they expect to make fast progress on each goal in the next year.\nWhat The Cuban does have, they say, is four elegant, inviting exhibition galleries and a high-tech auditorium with a 110-seat capacity that\u2019s generating significant interest in the Cuban-American community, galvanizing important artists, collectors, donors and corporate sponsors to pledge works of art or gifts of cash.\nFounding director Ileana Fuentes said she has been fielding constant offers since a \u201csoft\u201d opening reception in November drew some 500 people. \u201cThere is no shortage of art or desire or collaboration.

Although several pieces in the Cruz Azaceta show focus on the exile experience, for instance, others range broadly from dictatorships in Latin American to the attack on the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City bombing.\nThat\u2019s one reason why the museum changed its name, they said.\nYet the museum\u2019s opening has been so subdued that even leading figures in Miami\u2019s tight-knit art world were unaware of it.\nProminent Miami art dealer Fredric Snitzer said he happened to be driving on Coral Way recently, saw the banners advertising the exhibit \u2014 Snitzer used to represent Cruz Azaceta \u2014 and decided to stop in. The gallerist said he was strongly impressed by the art and the building.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really aware of what was happening there, or that anything was happening there,\u201d Snitzer said. \u201cMy honest-to-God first response was how beautiful it was, how well it was presented, how correctly everything was done.

Under Islam\u2019s strictest tenets it must be aniconic, so any depiction of nature \u2013 humans, animals, trees, etc. \u2013 is considered a sin against God. As a result its artwork traditionally took the form of attractive shapes, intricate patterns, and complex geometry designed to inspire the human mind.\nTodd\u2019s Music of the Spheres is a laid back puzzle game that asks you to make sense of complex patterns via simple shooting and rhythm mechanics. While its puzzles can leave you scratching your head, they are designed for contemplation rather than frustration. This is informed by the nature of Islamic art.\nTodd is now working with Bahrami to make Engare. The game was inspired by a geometry question once put to Bahrami\u2019s high school class, which made even the mathematically indifferent strive after the solution.\nThe games industry in the Middle East is growing rapidly. In 2012 Iran alone boasted more than 95 active studios. Yet we still see very few games explicitly influenced by this culture. There are a number of reasons for this; if we take Iran as an example, the stressful political climate in the country can make it difficult for developers to reflect what is going on around them due to the danger of agitating the government. Although more people than ever have access to the resources necessary to make a game, publishing remains a huge obstacle. It\u2019s not only a risk; trade sanctions keep major western publishers out.\nSome Western-developed games have caused controversy by, often inadvertently, featuring Islamic elements. In 2008 Sony had to delay the release of LittleBigPlanet so that a song featuring lines of the Qur\u2019an could be removed. In 2012, a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 map was taken down and altered to remove a quote from Muslim prophet Muhammad that featured on a painting in a bathroom. Outside of Islam, the Church of England threatened Sony with legal action in 2007 over the use of Manchester Cathedral as a setting in Resistance: Fall of Man.\nWhile these controversies were relatively small and were each swiftly resolved, religion as a hot-button issue may cause Western developers to view them as cautionary tales. Even a fairly low\u00adkey release like Music of the Spheres quickly attracted derogatory comments about Islam and 9/11 on its Steam Greenlight page.\nThis is, of course, only considering the influence of Islamic art in video games in the most literal sense. While the physical art itself is geometry or architecture, the spirit of this work can reach much further, and might offer guidance for one of the more significant problems faced by the games industry today.\n\u201cThe problem people have been thinking about for a while is, how do we make video games that can move you towards deeper considerations?\u201d says Todd. \u201cIslamic art has a sense of trying to inspire you to think about higher things. There are very few games that you could describe as sublime.\nThis is exactly the intention of Islamic art. It\u2019s necessary here to draw a distinction between the aesthetic of Islamic art and its spirit. The Prince of Persia games are one of the few \u2018major\u2019 titles to prominently feature Islamic art in the form of temples and decorative artwork, but its focus on combat and acrobatics means you\u2019re"}

They take their place in history with those who perished in frail ships on uncharted seas, who vanished with their Conestoga wagons out on the vast prairie or who fell at Omaha Beach so that others might succeed.\nRisk has always been the price of any successful venture, whether it be the discovery of the New World, the shaping of a continent, or the preservation of that new freedom. Those who risk their lives to accomplish great ends, who have a vision of something larger than themselves, lift all our lives to a higher level. Our failures in space -- the Apollo spacecraft fire, the shuttle Challenger explosion, the flaws in the Hubble Telescope, the nightmares aboard Mir, the miscarriage of two Mars missions and now this tragic loss -- have caused many to question the danger and the expense.\nBut we often forget that there can be no meaningful success without the opportunity to fail. It's easy to see the glass half empty. To see it half full would be to wonder at the fact that in 22 years of shuttle flights, only two have been lost, that no one perished on Mir, that astronauts were able to repair the Hubble in space and that most missions are enormously successful.\nThere are tense moments in any space mission. The most dangerous part of our moon landing, the descent to the lunar surface, was accomplished in the face of onboard computer failures, faltering telemetry, a field of boulders and only seconds of remaining fuel (prompting Flight Director Gene Kranz to quip: \"You'd better remind them there ain't no damn gas stations on the moon. \").\nthey evolve or decline.

It began with the quest for fire -- not because its uses were known, but because it was wondrous.\nCarrying the fire out of Africa, into the frozen north, across oceans and continents, we have relentlessly breached the barriers in pursuit of wonder -- the lookout on Pinta, spying a hint of white sand cliff in the moonlight; Amundsen on a bleak, windswept plain of ice, reaching the pole with his few surviving dogs; and men from Earth, riding the fire over the rocks of the moon.\nSpaceflight was inevitable from the first gleam in the eye of the hunter- gatherer, from the first fire, wheel, and furrow; it was latent in the stirrup and the longship, in the creak of every caravel, the ring of every railroad spike. The need to see the whole, from the mountaintop or the moon -- to see the soft glow of Earth, haloed on the black abyss -- is the heart of the human journey, the hallmark of our species.

The objective was and continues to be the establishment of a worldwide Islamic caliphate. In 1928, after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Egyptian cleric Hassan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood which continues to be the voice of Islamic expansionism and a source of virulent anti-Semitism worldwide.\nand death for the sake of Allah the loftiest of our wishes.\"\nGerman scholar and historian Matthias Kuntzel explains the connection between Islamism and anti-Semitism in his extraordinary 2007 book Jihad and Jew-Hatred: Islamism, Nazism, and the Roots of 9/11. Kuntzel identifies the Muslim Brotherhood as the ideological reference and organizational core of radical Islam. He warns that, \"whoever does not want to combat anti-Semitism hasn't the slightest chance of defeating Islamism.\"\nKuntzel argues that, \"The Brotherhood's most significant innovation was their concept of jihad as holy war, which significantly differed from other contemporary doctrines and, associated with that, the passionately pursued goal of dying a martyr's death in the war with the unbeliever.\" He identifies \"the start point of Islamism as the new interpretation of jihad, espoused with uncompromising militancy by Hassan al-Banna, the first to preach this kind of jihad in modern times.\"\nKuntzel explains the intimate connection between jihad and Jew-hatred, and the behavior of, \"University students who blow themselves up with the aim of heavenly self-improvement, priests who throw hydrochloric acid into young women's faces to punish them for violating the obligation to wear the veil, parents who cheerfully prepare their children for jihad with dummy explosive belts: anyone seeking to find the motives for such behaviors enters a world in which reason is considered betrayal, doubt a deadly sin, and the Jews 'the brothers of monkeys, murderers of the Prophet, bloodsuckers, and warmongers.'\"\nMatthias Kuntzel explores some forms of the Muslim Brotherhood's holy jihad in America but not all of them.\nThe conversion of America from a Judeo-Christian country into a sharia compliant Muslim country through public school indoctrination was the unapologetic objective announced by Muslima Sharifa Alkhateeb in her 1989 speech hosted by the Muslim Brotherhood organization the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Alkhateeb, the late managing editor of the American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences (AJISS), advocated using US public schools to proselytize and convert America to Islam.\nAlkhateeb was born in Philadelphia 1946 but lived with her husband in Saudi Arabia from 1978 and 1987 where she was a teacher. In 1988 she returned to the United States and became a diversity consultant with the Fairfax County Public Schools in Fairfax, Virginia.\nThree decades later, what is most disturbing is how effective the Muslim effort has been in proselytizing Islam in the public schools and shattering our constitutionally guaranteed separation of church and state.

{"idx": "38659", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Working out on the same old leg machines can get stale, and you don't have to use them to get stronger and more toned thighs. Energize your workout with your own body weight and a few simple pieces of exercise equipment that work your thighs with other body parts. You will get a quick, fat-burning workout while improving muscular definition, coordination, speed and strength in your legs.\nThe thighs are made up of primarily the quadriceps muscle group, and they are part of the superficial front line, which is a meridian that runs from the tops of your feet, through your thighs, hip flexors and abs and into the front of your neck and the base of your skull near your ears. Because they share many nerves and connectives tissues with nearby muscles, the quality of your thighs' function can affect how much your hips can extend and rotate, according to massage therapist and anatomist Thomas Myers, author of \"Anatomy Trains.\" Your quadriceps also function as an accelerator like a gas pedal to propel your body forward during a sprint or jump.\nRunning is one of the most economic and practical ways to work on your thighs since you don't need a treadmill to run. You can perform all kinds of running almost anywhere -- running track, hiking trails, basketball courts and your neighborhood. The type of running you do will depend on your goal. If you want to run a marathon, long-distance endurance running coupled with some sprinting will improve your mileage. Sprinters and \"stop-and-go\" athletes -- such as soccer and basketball players -- can benefit from various forms of short-distance running, such as fartlek and interval running. Fartlek is Swedish for \"speed play,\" which involves running outdoors from one point to another at various speeds without a structured protocol. Interval running is performing a short bouts of high-intensity sprints followed by a longer period of lower-intensity running. Any running method will certainly give your thighs a workout they won't forget.\nWorking with your own body weight strengthens all lower-body muscles, including your thighs. Physical therapist Gray Cook, author of \"Athletic Body in Balance,\" recommends that you perform the squat, step-up and lunge, which are the basic movement patterns in most field and court sports and daily activities. Once you are familiar with these exercises, add some resistance by using free weights, such as a barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells. Even a sandbag, a medicine ball or a water-filled, 5-gallon cooler with a handle will do the job. Even though your thighs and buttocks are doing most of the work, your abdominal and spinal muscles are working just as hard to stabilize your torso. Other calisthenic exercises include single-leg squats, multi-planar lunges and multi-planar step-ups.\nPlyometrics involves moving your thighs and other leg muscles to move quickly and explosively for a short period of time. Your muscles contract repetitively like a rubber band when you jump, hop and bound. Before you start any plyometric training, develop a foundation of strength, endurance and stability with strength-conditioning exercises, such as squats, deadlifts and lunges Sample plyometric exercises include vertical jumps, lateral hops, power box marches and squat thrusts.\nRunners' World: What's the Difference Between Fartlek, Tempo, and Interval Runs?\nIDEA Fitness Journal: Look Before You Jump!"}

In the video below, the prime minister attempts to clarify his remarks about \u201cphasing out\u201d the oilsands and argues that his recent pipeline approvals demonstrate his commitment to developing this resource.\n\u201cYou know who tried to force a choice between the environment and the economy? The last government. They said \u2018we\u2019re not going to do anything on the environment and we\u2019re going to get all of these pipelines approved.\u2019 Do you know what they did? They didn\u2019t get any pipelines approved.\nIn just those few sentences, the prime minister manages to cram in numerous falsehoods and misrepresentations. This is unfortunate. The goal should be to get these pipelines built, and if both the Liberals and Conservatives support that goal, then the focus should instead be on standing up to those who would block these projects. Playing politics, like Trudeau is doing here, doesn\u2019t help.\nFirst of all, when Trudeau says he \u201capproved pipelines that the previous government wasn\u2019t able to do,\u201d he\u2019s being rather disingenuous. The National Energy Board (NEB) recommended approval of the Trans Mountain project in May of 2016. The decision on the Line 3 replacement came down the previous month.\nAs we all know, the Conservatives lost the election of 2015 and so clearly Stephen Harper was not prime minister when it came time for the prime minister to make a decision on these projects. So of course the previous government \u201cwasn\u2019t able\u201d to approve these pipelines \u2013 that would have been impossible.\nStephen Harper\u2019s government did, however, approve the Northern Gateway pipeline in June of 2014. And although Trudeau opposed that pipeline and ultimately killed it, it puts to lie the statement that \u201cthey didn\u2019t get any pipelines approved.\u201d I certainly hope that the Trans Mountain project gets built, but as of now Trudeau\u2019s achievements match Harper\u2019s in this area: both said yes to a pipeline project to the west coast.\nMaybe, though, when Trudeau said \u201capproved\u201d he actually meant \u201cbuilt.\u201d Harper may have said yes to Northern Gateway, but construction of the pipeline never occurred. So no pipelines built on Harper\u2019s watch, right?\nThe Alberta Clipper pipeline and the original Keystone pipeline were both approved and constructed while the Conservatives were in office. Granted, the Liberals didn\u2019t oppose those projects, but certainly the Liberals must be aware of their existence. Not only that, but there was the Kinder Morgan Anchor Loop and the Line 9B reversal \u2013 both approved and constructed.\nNow, none of those projects represent a pipeline to the west coast, but those were the projects submitted for NEB and federal cabinet approval. Harper said yes to all of them. All except Northern Gateway got built and it would be supremely disingenuous for Trudeau to fault Harper for not getting a pipeline built that he himself opposed.\nTrudeau should stop playing ridiculous political games and focus instead on building political alliances to ensure that we can overcome pipeline opposition and get these much-needed projects built."}

In its near 100-year history, this otherworldly form of photography has appeared in everything from scientific research in the 1930s to psychedelic album cover art in the 1960s.\nThe U.K.-based photographer Edward Thompson set out to create a survey of all its diverse uses, from scientific to artistic, utilizing a type of color infrared film that isn\u2019t even produced anymore. His book documenting the results of those experiments, The Unseen, will be published next month after a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nHuman beings can see light with wavelengths between 400-700 nanometers, which is also the range of light captured by most film. Infrared light lies between the visible and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and when film is sensitive to it, photographs can pick up on the light beyond our vision. \u201cI found that infrared film with the correct filtration can reveal light up to 700-900 nanometers, allowing you to capture the invisible,\u201d says Thompson.\nThe view from Rose Court from The Village, 2010.

Though the film is no longer made, he sourced the film from a man in Germany, who cut it down to a size that could be used in commercial cameras. The resulting photographs are haunting images, seeped in a deep, saturated red.\nTrained as a documentary photographer, in the The Unseen Thompson uses infrared film as a tool to examine hidden aspects of his subjects, from pollution in the atmosphere and veins running underneath human skin to the health of fauna. In that way, Thompson\u2019s photographs are like encrypted missives that only reveal a deeper meaning to those who know the code.

Today\u2019s hunger and poverty crisis is similar, in scope, to the one of the Great Depression.\nOne in six people in America suffer from chronic hunger. In a nation that is both, the world\u2019s largest economy and its most productive food producer, it is simply not acceptable. In Los Angeles, one of the wealthiest cities in California, which is the world\u2019s eight largest economy and America\u2019s top agricultural state, one in eight people suffer from hunger.\nLos Angeles county is in the middle of an unprecedented hunger crisis with over 1 million people confronting hunger and food insecurity on a daily basis. This is not including the homeless population, which is currently estimated at 100,000 in Los Angeles county. One in eight Angelinos must often make the decision between paying the rent or buying food to feed themselves and their families. The daily struggle of 1 million people in Los Angeles that the US government defines, in an understatement, as \u201cfood insecurity\u201d is real, and it is on a dramatic rise all across America.\nIn the wake of the economic crisis, with unemployment numbers increasing and families losing their homes to foreclosure, more and more people are becoming food insecure. In Los Angeles, the number of people utilizing emergency food services has increased by 41 percent since 2008, with at least one in six people receiving food aid identified as never having received assistance in the past. The number of people receiving food stamps in Los Angeles is at an all time high of 795,000. The food stamps program was originally launched by Lyndon Johnson in 1964 under his comprehensive program of \u201cwar on poverty\u201d.\nNot surprisingly, children and seniors are at greatest risk from suffering from hunger: 25 percent of children in Los Angeles county are food insecure and about 50 percent of independent elderly do not have enough money to buy adequate food. Furthermore, the lack of healthy affordable food has led to an obesity epidemic that reaches 55 percent of adults in Los Angeles, and 25 percent of children. This, in return, presents a growing public health risk. On a local and state levels, these problems have been magnified by a major budget crisis. Governor Schwarzenegger\u2019s reaction to California\u2019s budget crisis was to cut back programs that address poverty and hunger.\nNot only the overall political decisions at local, state and federal levels are absurd, but they lack the most basic morality. The ruling class of conservative Republicans, corporate Democrats and CEOs are de facto practicing social Darwinism. The super rich in America such as Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d from Wall Street give to charities in large amounts. But this substitution of what should be good governance and local, state and federal social safety net for 49 million Americans is not truly helping. It helps the super-rich feel less guilty, but it doesn\u2019t change the system or even start scratching the surface of the root problems hiding in plain sight behind hunger and poverty.\nOur tax dollars are wrongly spent on all level of government. For example, in Los Angeles, the lion share of the city budget is spent on the police department. Sate wide the amount of money spent on the prison system is astronomical. Instead of hiring more cops and incarcerating more people, it would be a wise and durable investment to invest in good and free public education. Federally, the waste of our tax dollars"}

The fewer the days, the greater the stress, and the slower the pace of my writing became.\nThe news comes after an update a few weeks ago, when Martin said that the tone of the sixth book would be darker than its prequels: \"in any story, the classic structure is, \u2018Things get worse before they get better,\u2019 so things are getting worse for a lot of people.\"\nEven if Winds of Winter is released this year, the events of the TV series have already overtaken the events of the novels.

These rail stations will now act as hubs. Staff attached to these stations will travel to other stations along the line to assist customers when necessary.\nThe 13 hubs along the Dart line are located at the following stations; Bray, Dalkey, D\u00fan Laoghaire, Blackrock, Sandymount, Pearse, Tara Street, Connolly, Killester, Raheny, Howth Junction & Donaghmede, Howth and Malahide.\nBarry Kenny, spokesperson for Irish Rail, says that the move towards hubs, announced last year, is aimed at ensuring \u201cbetter assistance for customers with mobility impairment\u201d.\nAccording to Kenny, this \u201chub station model\u201d yielded more than 99.9% successful service provision in 2018.\nLast year, concerns were raised several times about security at Dart stations following anti-social behaviour on the northside line in January and an \u201c\u201dunprecedented\u201d stabbing incident between Killester and Harmonstown stations in October.\nIn December, \u20ac115,000 was allocated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to Irish Rail to provide additional security over the Christmas period.\nO\u2019Brien says that station staff shouldn\u2019t be forced to deal with anti-social behavior. But concerns remain that staffless stations could lead to a rise in this type of behaviour, he says.\nIn order to ensure the new hub model works efficiently, staffing changes at Dart stations are necessary, says Irish Rail\u2019s Kenny. As service staff retire or are promoted Dart stations will gradually become staffless as staff are redeployed.\nKilbarrack, Killiney, Shankill and Portmarnock Dart stations have all been unmanned since 2017. Lansdowne Road become fully automated in late 2018.\nKenny says that Irish Rail anticipates more Dart stations, like Clongriffin, becoming fully automated in 2019 but could not confirm which stations yet."}

The \"hubsters,\" as they're affectionately known, have 24/7 access to church space to work, meet clients and attend workshops on everything from branding to cybersecurity.\n\"If you think of a monastery in the Middle Ages, it would have a worshipping community, but it would also have a brewery, it would have medicine, it would have educational resources for the community. So there was a variety of services and contribution to the local economy,\" said Rob Dalgleish, who runs EDGE, the United Church's innovation team.\nThe Markham Community Innovation Hub, which can host up to 20 entrepreneurs, is only a small part of a broader shift in the United Church. In an attempt to engage millennials and reimagine its role in communities across the country, the church is turning to the language and techniques of startup culture.\nTwo years ago, EDGE ran its first Social Innovation Challenge in Toronto, inviting entrepreneurs and social activists, both church and non-church members, to pitch ideas that would be considered for small amounts of seed funding, ranging from $500 to $1,500. Successful applicants had to show that their ideas were not only financially viable, but also beneficial to the community.\nThey've since run challenges in cities across the country and established an online network to connect over 170 initiatives with business mentors.\n\"A lot of them are social workers or psychologists and their understanding of business is not strong\u2026 What we're trying to do is give them the tools,\" said Mr. Miller, who's mentoring Markham hubsters as well as other entrepreneurs in the church's online network.\nThe United Church has even allocated 10 per cent of its mission budget \u2013 which typically goes to things like summer camps and soup kitchens \u2013 to support social enterprise. \"Social enterprise is the religion of millennials, it's where they find meaning,\" explained Mr. Dalgleish.\nIt's a key psychological insight for Carla Leon, manager of New Initiatives with EDGE, and the mastermind behind the Markham hub. Baby boomers are willing to donate money to charities and churches, but millennials want to be actively engaged and see themselves as agents of change, she said.\n\"If that dynamic is happening, of course we want everyone to be involved in it, but how do you make it financially sustainable?\" asked Ms. Leon.\nIndividualism amongst millennials creates problems of scale when it comes to funding churches and charities, but also opportunity for more smaller-scale experiments. In that sense, what's happening in church and charity spheres mirrors the proliferation of entrepreneurs seeking autonomy through small-scale commerce online.\n\"Faith organizations actually want to help the world become a better place... and neighbourhoods specifically. So if we're helping other people live that out, regardless if they come to church on Sunday, that's beautiful, that's a great thing,\" said Ms. Leon.\nThere are also more practical real estate concerns behind ideas like the Markham hub.\n\""}

Relying on your phone's GPS, you move around the physical world and interact with beasts, objects, points of interest and other witches and wizards you come across on your game's map.\nThe game is a joint effort from WB Games San Francisco and Niantic under the Portkey Games label.

If you've used the map on those other games to navigate to a portal or a gym and if you've traced a glyph or tossed a Poke Ball, you've got a head start here. But as familiar as the game feels, it's distinct enough that I didn't feel like I was playing a reskinned Pokemon Go. Instead, I was in a new and strange world.\nPart of the fresh experience comes from several tricks not found in Ingress or Pokemon Go that improve shared multiplayer AR environments. (You can catch a glimpse of that in this Niantic video.) And unlike in Pokemon Go, you're armed with spells in Wizards Unite. To cast one, trace a spell hint with your finger on your phone's screen.

But before Congress bought President Bush's prescription for curing the world's ills, it should have reviewed some medical history on the disastrous side effects of this quack remedy.\nThe first patient in line for this harsh medicine -- Iraq -- has already taken it twice before. The results turned a minor regional irritant into a wound of worldwide concern.\nIraq's first dose came in 1963, when a young CIA protege named Saddam Hussein helped overthrow Gen. Abdul Qassim, who had nationalized some of the country's foreign oil interests two years earlier.\nAccording to one history, \"CIA assistance reportedly included coordination of the coup plotters from the agency's radio station inside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and solicitation of advice (on who) should be eliminated once the coup was successful.\"\nAfter more domestic political instability, another CIA-backed coup in 1968 installed Hussein as deputy to the new military ruler. Hussein waited his turn and became dictator in 1979.\nHussein's popularity in Washington peaked during the 1980s, when the Reagan- Bush administration supported his invasion of Iran with billions of dollars in export credits and top-secret satellite intelligence.\nBy supporting Hussein, Washington was just trying to fix the damage done by another regime change gone awry years earlier in Iran.\nIran took its bitter medicine in 1953, when a now infamous coup, planned by the CIA and British intelligence, deposed the elected government of Premier Mohammed Mossadeq, which had nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.\nOperation Ajax, as it was code-named, led to the death of hundreds of Mossadeq followers, the return of the shah to the throne and creation of a new oil consortium favorable to U.S. oil companies.\nBy the 1970s, the shah was squandering billions of dollars a year in oil wealth on exotic armaments. His jails were packed with the victims of his secret police, SAVAK. And millions of resentful Iranians began listening to anti-American clerics, including one named Khomeini.\nThe overthrow of the shah in 1979 marked the first great modern victory of militant political Islam. It helped inspire jihadists in a neighboring country that was left similarly hobbled by regime change: Afghanistan.\nIn 1979, Afghanistan was governed by a secular, pro-Soviet government. Its policies of land reform, women's rights and opium suppression antagonized rural conservatives who began to rebel.\nA State Department memo that summer argued, \"The United States' larger interest would be served by the demise of the regime, despite whatever setbacks this might mean for future social and economic reforms in Afghanistan.\nThe overthrow of the (government) would show the rest of the world, particularly the Third World, that the Soviets' view of the socialist course of history being inevitable is not accurate.\"\nPresident Jimmy Carter approved the first directive for secret aid to the Islamic rebels on July 3, 1979. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told the president that day \"in my opinion, this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.\"\nThe Soviets finally did intervene that December, fearing a radical Muslim state on their border. Brzezinski wrote again to Carter: \"We now have the opportunity of"}

The findings cannot be applied to infants and children, though this was not emphasised in the report. It is important that parents understand this and continue to follow advice regarding vitamin D supplementation for their infants and children. Vitamin D is important in the development of healthy, strong bones and to prevent rickets. All infants should receive a daily dose of 8.5mcg-10mcg from birth until one year unless they are consuming over 500ml of formula milk a day. Children aged between one and four should receive 10mcg of vitamin D supplementation and those over this age should consider taking the same dose, particularly through the winter months.\n\u2022 Once again a study on bone is being used to denigrate the benefits of supplementation with vitamin D3. D3 acts on almost all our cells and influences 10% of our genes, playing a defensive role. Around 5,000 research papers per year are unravelling its role in infections, auto-immunity, degenerative brain diseases, longevity etc. The error in interpretation being made repeatedly by clinicians is in extrapolating D3 levels that are adequate for bone to the multitude of other D3 actions. If \u201cprimitive man\u201d broke a leg it could be fatal, so bone evolved to function with the very lowest D3 levels. It follows that using bone data to decide upon D3 adequacy for the wide variety of D3-sensitive disease states is wrong. So what is the D3 level in man living a natural life?

From the beginning, though, it found fans among writers and artists. P. G. Wodehouse compared it favorably to Wagner\u2019s \u201cParsifal\u201d; Jack Kerouac later said it influenced the Beats. The strip ran from 1913 until 1944, the year that Herriman died. It is set in a dreamlike place called Coconino County, where a black cat named Krazy loves a white mouse named Ignatz, who throws bricks at Krazy\u2019s head. Krazy interprets the bricks as \u201clove letters.\u201d Meanwhile, a police-officer dog, Offisa Pup, tries to protect Krazy, with whom he is smitten. The structure of the strip was built on reversals: a cat loves a mouse, a dog protects a feline, and, at a time when anti-miscegenation laws held sway in most of the United States, a black animal yearns for a white one.\nThat last detail took on additional resonance, in 1971, when Arthur Asa Berger published a story about Herriman\u2019s birth certificate. The certificate described Herriman\u2019s race as \u201ccolored,\u201d Berger revealed, to the astonishment of many readers (Ralph Ellison among them). Herriman was born in New Orleans, in 1880, to a mixed-race family; his great-grandfather, Stephen Herriman, was a white New Yorker who had children with a \u201cfree woman of color,\u201d Justine Olivier, in what was then a common social arrangement in New Orleans called pla\u00e7age. George Herriman was one of the class of Louisianans known as blanc fo\u2019c\u00e9_:_ Creoles who actively tried to pass as white. (Creoles who could pass but did not try to were called pass\u00e9 blanc.) In adulthood, Herriman frequently covered his tight curls with a hat, and invented fanciful origin stories that attributed his light brown skin to years living under the sun of Greece. Sometimes he claimed that his ancestors were French or Irish\u2014anything that might sow confusion.\nIn the years following Berger\u2019s initial reporting, a number of writers have grappled with this aspect of Herriman\u2019s work. \u201cIn the comics page no less than in social life, the opposition between black and white can be redefined but not abolished,\u201d the journalist and comics scholar Jeet Heer has written. As Michael Tisserand points out in his new biography, \u201cKrazy,\u201d Herriman might have lost his job as a cartoonist had he been outed as black. When Herriman worked at the Los Angeles Examiner, as a staff artist, the paper published multiple articles about light-skinned African-Americans who had tried to pass as white and were subsequently \u201cexposed.\u201d But \u201cKrazy\u201d also helps to expand the meaning of the comic\u2019s subversive play with identity beyond race. In an era when books depicting homosexuality and gender nonconformity could lead to charges of obscenity, \u201cKrazy Kat,\u201d Tisserand notes, featured a gender-shifting protagonist who was in love with a male character.\nI asked Tisserand if he thought Herriman\u2019s own experience with racial identity and his depiction of gender in the strip were linked.

Today, the index is trading around 1690, so Lee's forecast implies an additional 5% upside for stocks over the next three months.\nForemost, the recent move to all-time highs is quite constructive for the S&P 500. In fact, as shown in Figure 5, there have been only three prior instances when the S&P 500 sustainably surpassed multi-decade highs: (i) 1958 (taking out the 1929 highs); (ii) 1982 (taking out the 1973 highs); and (iii) 1991 (taking out the 1987 highs). In all 3 prior cases, the equity markets continued to advance for 5-15 years and increase another 136%- 314%. This is consistent with our baseline view that we are in a secular bull market and expect markets to rise for several more years. Second, valuations are still supportive for equities. While the median P/E of the S&P 500 today is 16.2x on NTM EPS, this cannot be looked at in isolation ... 10,438 companies have a P/E below the comparative investment grade P/E (the inverse of the yield-to-worst). At the 2000 and 2007 market highs, only 201 and 274 companies, respectively, had a P/E below that of IG bonds. Third, cyclical stocks are demonstrating leadership. They have outperformed the S&P 500 by 100bp from the August low to the Sept 18th high and a further 40bp since the market pulled back 1.4% from the highs (see Figure 11 and Figure 12). Moreover, economic momentum is continuing to improve, as evidenced by the synchronized gains in the economic momentum indices for the US, Eurozone, and emerging markets (see Figure 13). This suggests a very constructive structure to the market \u2013 leadership by Cyclicals even in pullbacks.

Since the return to democracy in 1988, Chile's institutional politics have always been divided into two powerful party coalitions: the Concertacion (centre and left-wing parties), and the Chilean Alliance (right-wing parties). Since 2006, and especially during the last few years (during Sebastian Pinera's current presidency), new arrangements of citizenship brought into question this entrenched political order.\nBy citizenship, I mean a group's access to expressing their political rights through institutional political representation. Therefore, citizenship expresses how much people feel represented by political institutions.\nHow Chileans relate to the state and other institutions has changed in the past years, and this election expresses those shifts. This election is historically unique because it brought to the fore new parties and novel independent candidates. Topics never before discussed by presidential candidates have been addressed. These new socio-political developments are particularly visible on the left.\nChanges in the socio-political configuration of Chile began with the growing student movement which periodically took to the streets in the past 12 years.\nCentre-left parties (excluding the Communist Party) united during the 1980s in order to defeat the dictatorship in a coalition called Concertacion de Partidos por la Democracia (Concert of Parties for Democracy). Despite many people's expectations that they would promote egalitarianism and justice in the country after the dictatorship, the Concertacion managed to deepen Chile's exclusionary and neo-liberal system.\nAlthough once inspirational and progressive, the Concertacion became engrained in the state's bureaucratic structure. Accordingly, they got involved in collusion and corruption scandals, gave little salience to the transitional justice process, increasingly based strategies on electoral research, and had a strong top-down emphasis that neglected people's empowerment.\nDuring the Concertacion period of rule, authorities managed to open Chile's market through a large number of free trade agreements (Chile holds 22 commercial agreements with 60 countries, including the US, China, and the EU).\nReacting to their low popularity, the Concertacion recently decided to change their name, creating a new coalition: New Majority. The New Majority includes all the centre-left Concertacion parties, as well as the Communist party.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Chilean Alliance has also lost representation, especially among the right-wing youth. The Alliance demonstrated that it is ready to reject any progressive initiative in terms of civil or social rights, moving away from the more liberal branches of the right (leading a centre-right wing movement, neo-liberal Bellolio represents such liberal ideals [Sp]).\nAdditionally, charismatic right-wing candidate Laurence Golborne, stepped down after a fraud scandal involving the company he led for years, effected more than 600,000 consumers. The Chilean Alliance was left with no choice but a bureaucratic reaction, diminishing their leadership and opening spaces for alternative candidates, like Franco Parisi.\nChanges in the socio-political configuration of Chile began with the growing student movement which periodically took to the streets in the past 12 years. However, it was only in 2011 that the movement had the experience, the structure, and the inclusivity to become convincing enough to challenge Chile's neo-liberal system, beyond specific educational"}

So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly with markets near all-time highs.\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE: IFF) saw beneficial owner Winder Investment add to its stake again. At prices that ranged from $127.87 to $128.7, the total of 60,000 shares reportedly acquired in the past week cost the Singapore-based holding company more than $7.68 million. Note that Winder was buying shares throughout May and early June.\nIFF shares rose about 2 percent over the past week, most of that gain before Winder's purchase. The stock ended the week at $128.26, within Winder's purchase price range. The 52-week low of $122.11 from back in May compares with the 52-week high of $157.40 that was reached early this year.

My existence was an insult to her, and I was never allowed to forget it.\nAnyway, in my adulthood, I lived just close enough to mom and dad (and sib) that my Christmases and Thankgivings involved a long, grueling visit to my family. It was torture, but because my parents wanted to go visit, we of course went along. Instead of being happy and comfortable in my own home with loving friends or other relatives, I was counting the minutes at my sib's place, feeling guilty about subjecting my husband and daughter to her, and trying to dodge the inevitable barbs, outright insults, and innuendo that were a fixed feature of our being in the same room. I did it for my parents' sake. They knew it was ugly between their daughters and tried to make a show of it being not so on holidays.\nI would give anything, Carolyn, to have those days back to give to my loved ones what they deserved from me: a long, loving, fun day together with dear ones in our own home. When my mother passed, I put my foot down and traveled no more; and for the ensuing eight years our family holidays at home have been a joy. Until he passed away, we would go the next day and visit my widowed father and make a great fuss over him, and it was enough.\nIf I could go back and talk to my then-self, the argument I'd make is that no amount of peacemaking compromises (or outright capitulations) can ever serve one's nuclear family as well as putting their happiness first. The first Christmas or so of opting out might be a little awkward, but after that it's just the way things are done and everyone calms down about it. And if they don't, it becomes their problem.\nI could be very quick, if sarcasm counts. But when I tried to be polite, I found myself agreeing to all kinds of things I didn't want: from giving up information to inviting people over.\nI used to be especially easy prey to my passive-aggressive mother-in-law. My husband was a wonderful coach, after the fact, in pointing out the boundaries she and others were crossing with my permission.\nOne of many things I learned from him was to try adopting the Golden Rule.\nFirst, I changed the way I approached others. Not \"Are you free on Saturday?\" but \"I'm moving Saturday, and I could use your help with the boxes if you've got an hour.\" Being purposeful when I was the one initiating the conversation (and could think about it ahead of time) made all the difference.\nOnce I heard what that sounded like, I knew how to listen for it. That's how I got better at responding. It's a good way to get in practice for the spur-of-the-moment situations."}

It includes a difficult road trip that will take them through Texas and Utah. And it includes matchups with three teams \u2014 Cleveland, Dallas and Denver \u2014 that, at this point, have to be considered legitimate NBA title contenders.\nBut more than anything, what's scary is the sheer volume of basketball to be played.\nIn the 30 days between March 2 and March 31, the Celtics are slated for 17 games. That's 816 minutes of basketball, bare minimum, and you're talking about a team whose biggest stars are 32, 33 and 34 years old. Every mile you put on those odometers matters. The knees can only survive for so long.\nWith that in mind, you have to wonder what the Celtics' mindset should be going into this rough stretch.\nWho gets how many minutes? How deep does the rotation go? What is their goal from here on out \u2014 a break-neck pace and a \"win at all costs\" mentality, or a slow and steady coast from here to an inevitable Eastern Conference playoff berth?\nChances are, these Celtics will err on the side of the latter.\nAt this point, the goal is to make the playoffs and be in decent physical shape to play well upon getting there. That's just about it.\nA couple of years ago, this was a Celtics team that aspired to more than just making the big dance and playing past April. The gaudy numbers, the flashy win total \u2014 these things mattered back in 2008. But the Celtics aren't that team anymore, and they should keep their vision realistic.\nThey're not playing to show up the rest of the Eastern Conference. They're not playing to leave the rest of the East's top teams in the dust, the way they did during their title run two summers ago. And in fact, it's probably best not to think about Cleveland, Orlando or Atlanta too much right now. It can't do them any good.\nWhich isn't to say the Celtics are hopeless in their quest to make another deep playoff run. They're certainly not, and they've still got a decent chance at turning some heads in the Eastern semis and finals later this spring. But their best chance to do that comes with pacing themselves, and not expending too much effort in March. Energy is at a premium these days, and Doc Rivers should save it for the months that really matter.\nPaul Pierce, whose nagging thumb injury kept him out for all of last week, needs as much rest as he can get. Kevin Garnett, who's at less than 100 percent despite taking the floor every night, should keep his minutes low and his energy level high. Ray Allen may be healthy, but he's already played over 2,000 minutes this season, which is just asking for trouble down the road. Even he should be watched carefully.\nWhen the Celtics take the floor for postseason basketball seven weeks from now, they will have a rotation that runs nine deep, at the very least. Rasheed Wallace, Marquis Daniels, Glen Davis and newcomer Nate Robinson will all see meaningful playoff minutes, not to mention a few"}

We\u2019ll put the most work into the situation it seems Patriots fans would prefer, which is to wait until the second day of the draft to take a QB.\nMcGlinchey is regarded as the best offensive tackle in a weak class. He has ideal size for the position, and the Patriots immediately would be in better shape at the position by taking McGlinchey and hoping he can start from Day 1 over guys like LaAdrian Waddle, Antonio Garcia and Cole Croston.\nIs Carter a defensive end? Is he a linebacker? Is he both? Let\u2019s just call him an edge defender. Carter could align standing up on the edge of the Patriots\u2019 defense and rush the passer or drop back into coverage using his 4.46-second 40-yard dash speed at 6-foot-5, 250 pounds.\nHe\u2019s the best player in the second wave of quarterbacks, and there are many reasons to believe he\u2019s a great fit for the Patriots.\nThomas is big enough to get in the way of defenders as a blocker at 6-foot-4, 259 pounds, and he\u2019s definitely a good enough athlete to make an impact as a receiver. The Patriots should look to take a tight end early given Rob Gronkowski\u2019s offseason waffling.\nBaker kind of looks like a skill-position player at 6-foot-1, 229 pounds, but he\u2019s one of the most athletic linebackers in the draft, and he\u2019s just what the doctor ordered if New England wants to improve its pass coverage.\nHaley\u2019s a solid slot option as an uber-athletic undersized corner.\nDitto, but he\u2019s a slot receiver.\nWarren is a massive back at 6-foot-2, 250 pounds, and he still fits the Patriots\u2019 pre-draft testing standards with a sub-7-second 3-cone.\nThe Patriots get a better tight end in this situation, but they wait longer to add offensive tackle competition.\nThe Patriots trade both first-round picks to move into the top 10. They still wind up with one of the better offensive tackles while taking more of a pure defensive end.\nNow, which one do you like best?

During their nonconference schedule, the Utes compiled a perfect 11-0 record \u2014 a feat that the Utes haven\u2019t achieved since the 2000-01 schedule when the team started out 13-0.\n\u201cThrough 11 games, you can\u2019t get any better than 11-0,\u201d head coach Lynne Roberts said.\nThough the Utes sometimes had a hard time scoring the ball and they ranked near the bottom of the conference in offensive categories, Utah boasted one of the better defensive schemes in the Pac-12. The Utes were ranked fourth in the conference in opponent field goal percentage as they restricted opposing teams to just 38 percent from the floor. The Utes clamped down even harder out on the perimeter, where opposing teams shot just 30 percent.\nThe Utes also swatted nearly five and a half shots per game, led largely by the efforts of junior forward Emily Potter, who averaged nearly three blocks per game.\nPotter was just one of 26 Utah women\u2019s basketball players, one being current teammate senior wing Paige Crozon, to hit the vaunted 1,000 point mark during her career at the U.

I think if you take a look at the requirements for obtaining these grants, it is based on the very best evidence about what works. Arne Duncan has gone through and talked to every educational expert out there, and they have arrived at a consensus that if you're improving teacher quality, you're combining that with high standards, you've got strong data to back it up, you're focusing on low-performing schools and not just the upper tier -- that all those things in combination produce results.\nAnd so this is a classic example, I think, of evidence-based policymaking. It's not based on politics; it's not based on who's got more clout; it's not based on what certain constituency groups are looking for; but it's based on what works. Now, what we're also doing, though, is we're saying this is voluntary. If there are states that just don't want to go in this direction, that's their prerogative.\nQ And you're willing, if it turns out that a politically important state like Ohio or California, if it turns out that they're ones that don't get the money, that's -- politics won't come into play?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Politics won't come into play. And we've been very clear about that. That's part of the problem in the educational debate, at every level, for decades now, is politics always comes into play and kids end up being left out.\nNow, keep in mind that we're also trying to encourage consensus building. So, for example, we're challenging school districts and teachers unions to use the collective bargaining process as a catalyst for reform as opposed to an impediment for reform. And when you've got teachers, school administrators, parents, politicians all thinking in terms of what actually will help our kids become -- or possess the kind of skills that they need in order to compete in the 21st century economy, then we're confident that we're going to see improvement.\nIt may not be as fast as we would like. And the one thing that I think is always important is to say that improving the quality of schools and the student achievement is a long, deliberate process.\nAnd one of the things we want to get out of is this notion that somehow one law, one program, magically is going to change things.\nWhat happens then is people get disappointed, they scrap it, and they try a whole new thing. What we want to do is just keep on building on the evidence of what works.\n-- if we could talk more about teacher pay. You've made clear that teacher pay should not be dependent on a single standardized test score, even though you're pushing for steps toward performance pay.\nWhat do you say to teachers who believe it's unfair to be judged or paid, even in part, on the test scores of students who come to school with so many disadvantages?"}

The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.\nNow, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google\u2019s free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.\nThe recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling company that had worked with Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, harvested data from 50 million Facebook users, raised the current uproar, even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election. It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up.\nThat has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it\u2019s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.\nCongress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThere are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\n\u201cThey are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\u201d Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.\nThe greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.\nThe next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.\nThe Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.\nAlthough many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\nIn interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.\n\u201cYou\u2019re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,\u201d"}

Instead of exposing 70,000 Alaskans to the loss of health insurance by cutting this program, putting access to opioid treatment at risk and pushing Alaska deeper into a recession, let\u2019s continue moving toward transformational policies and reforms that both save money and improve care.\nAlaska\u2019s Medicaid spending has remained flat since 2015, yet more than 47,000 additional Alaskans have access to health insurance through Medicaid. This is no accident. The bipartisan passage of Senate Bill 74 in 2016 launched Medicaid reforms that have secured more economical fee agreements with health providers, reduced systematic waste and fraud, and implemented tele-health assessments to reduce travel costs. These advancements were a step in the right direction for Alaska\u2019s economic future and the health of our residents. Health care reform represents the largest cost savings opportunity in K-12 and higher education spending. While our schools and the university system have absorbed large budget cuts over the last four years, their health insurance costs continue to grow. It makes no sense to lay off teachers and close campuses when we can tackle the real costs contributing to the growing expense of education.\nHealth insurance reform is also vital to discover savings in the correctional system. Medicaid is the primary funder of addiction treatment. After the state implemented Medicaid expansion, our opioid addiction rates finally began declining. It is far less expensive and more effective over the long term to help Alaskans free themselves from addiction than it is to incarcerate them.\nOur state budget has long been tied to the boom and bust of oil prices. Rather than eliminate state programs that sustain our economy and protect our residents, we should seize this opportunity to transform state government. Bipartisan legislation has already made significant progress in reducing health care costs, but there is more work to be done. With a little creativity and foresight, we can achieve sustainable cost savings while providing a foundation for durable economic growth and development.\nRep.

But, in the wee hours of Oct. 14, driven by winds gusting as high as 87 mph, hidden hot spots erupted in flames and the Little Valley fire escaped containment. It roared down the canyon into a subdivision along Franktown Road. By the time it was contained, it had destroyed 23 homes and 17 outbuildings. Nearly 2,300 acres were burned by the blaze that reached all the way into Washoe Valley and across Highway 395.\nA key factor was inadequate mop-up to find and extinguish underground hot-spots, the report concludes. Hot spots can smolder for days beneath the forest floor.\nThe report cites lower than required staffing, including of supervisory positions, during the burn.\nIt also says there were Eastern Sierra Camp crews available but the last day they were assigned to Little Valley operations was Oct. 11.\nThe burn boss in charge of the fire was advised there would be high winds the night of Oct. 13, but believed that they could handle mop-up with their local resources.\n\"Based on the limited amount of heat near the control lines, success of the current mop-up effort and the risk to firefighters working in timber during high winds, the decision was made not to staff the prescribed fire the night of Oct. 13,\" according to the report.\nThat decision was made despite the fact that hand crews in the area earlier that day reported seeing more \"smokes\" south of their location.\nThere had been some rain before the burn began, but not enough to push back the drought.\n\"The eastern Sierra front, including the Little Valley area, was under the influence of a long term drought,\" it states. The report also says after that bit of rain, the forest quickly returned to drought conditions.\nConceding that subsurface smoldering stumps can be hard to find, the report notes that hand crews basically had nothing more than feeling the ground by hand to try find them.\nThey did not have infrared devices to help.\nThose underground hot spots can linger for days but can quickly ignite once they are disturbed and exposed to oxygen.\nThe winds on the 13, the report said, were strong enough \"to disturb the forest floor and introduce oxygen to the smoldering materials \u2026 in some instances bringing them to a free burning state.\"\nThose winds, it says, were also strong enough to transport burning embers out of the containment area.\nThe report says there was no analysis of potential fire spread outside the burn area in the fire plan and the plan didn't consider adjacent fuels.\n\"The dry duff bed in the area of origin of the Little Valley Wildfire was extremely receptive to ignition sources under the extreme wind conditions present the evening of Oct. 13,\" the report says.\nRecommendations in the report include developing stronger evaluation procedures after future controlled burns and the use of \"wet water\" (foam) in mop-up operations because it penetrates the fuel bed on the forest floor much"}

We assume a problem was solved.\nIntuition tells us that government is in the problem-solving business, and so the more laws passed, the better off we are. The possibility that fewer laws could leave us better off is hard to grasp. Kids visiting Washington don't ask their congressmen, \"What laws did you repeal?\" It's always, \"What did you pass?\"\nAnd so they pass and pass -- a thousand pages of proposed new rules each week -- and for every rule, there's an unintended consequence, or several.\nIt's one reason America has been unusually slow to recover from the Great Recession. After previous recessions, employers quickly resumed hiring. Not this time. The unemployment rate is still near 8 percent. It only fell last month because people stopped looking for jobs.\nDan Mitchell of the Cato Institute understands what's happening.\n\"Add up all the regulations and red tape, all the government spending, all the tax increases we're about to get -- you can understand why entrepreneurs think: \"Maybe I don't want to hire people. ... I want to keep my company small. I don't want to give health insurance, because then I'm stuck with all the Obamacare mandates.\" We can see our future in Europe -- unless we change. Ann Jolis, who covers European labor issues for The Wall Street Journal, watches how government-imposed work rules sabotage economies.\n\"The minimum guaranteed annual vacation in Europe is 20 days paid vacation a year. ... In France, it starts at 25 guaranteed days off. ... This summer, the European Court of Justice ... gave workers the right to a vacation do-over. ... You spend the last eight days of your vacation laid up with a sprained ankle ... eight days automatically go into your sick leave. ... You get a vacation do-over.\"\nSuch benefits appeal to workers, who don't realize that the goodies come out of their wages. The unemployed don't realize that such rules deter employers from hiring them in the first place.\nIn Italy, some work rules kick in once a company has more than 10 employees, so companies have an incentive not to hire an 11th employee. Businesses stay small. People stay unemployed.\n\"European workers have the right ... to gainful unemployment,\" says Jolis.\nBoth European central planners and liberal politicians in America are clueless about what really helps workers: a free economy.\nThe record is clear.

ACT scores were not reported in the NY Daily News piece; however, I think it is safe to assume that this will increase proportionately.\nWith all the publicity given to college athletes being just that, (rather than the preferred student-athlete), the \u201cbasket-weaving\u201d course loads they are accused of taking, and poor student-athlete graduation rates at too many universities, it is very good to see the NCAA moving in this direction. In this case, change is good, really good.\nI have one more suggestion.\nOne that will take a concerted effort and change in philosophy by all involved. If we could get high schools, and even junior high schools to increase their academic standards for athletes so as to enhance the chances the student athletes under their direction will be able to meet college Division I standards, get elementary schools to use this as a means to help motivate their pupils to higher levels of classroom performance, and, lastly, get ALL professional sports to adopt a policy where playing professionally is contingent on successful college completion, then we might actually make a difference.\nHigh academic expectations need to start at a time when youth can be influenced, when behavior can be molded, when the importance of doing well in school is implanted at a young enough age so that it becomes a foundation, a choice by the student themselves.\nHowever\u2026nothing truly worthwhile was ever easy, now was it?\nThey supposedly did this several years ago, but all it will do is result in more stories about people having their grades raised and others taking their SATs.\nSince nothing seems to can be done about \"one year and out\" for basketball players, I'm sure the stress is not on academic excellence.\nThanks for the response. Yes there will always be those who try to skirt the rules, however, the approach I discussed is a comprehensive one that starts when kids are very young and finishes with all professional sports making it a pre-requisite to have successfully completed a college degree.\nThe pro thing is certainly a hard sell, and one that I am not sure would be fair. However, it might not even be necessary if we instill the right values at a young enough age. Kids need to get the message, at an age when it matters, that school is essential to their success.\nJust brainstorming thoughts that might be of benefit."}

Funding sources have tightened up. The district is struggling to erase a $22 million deficit by June 30. In short, expectations on all levels \ufffd teaching, learning and resource management \ufffd are higher now and will continue to rise.\nIn this context, it is important to residents whether the system is well-positioned to deliver, in spite of the diversity of challenges in the urban district. James checked off the progress achieved on various fronts. He is proud, and rightly so, of successes such as the Early College High School (ranked 29th in performance among 743 Ohio public high schools) and the STEM school, a source of innovative practices for other buildings.\nReading and math proficiency are rising, albeit slowly. Community partnerships \ufffd most recently the University of Akron\ufffds proposed Innovation Generation Scholarship program and the GAR Foundation\ufffds $800,000 pledge and challenge for matching contributions toward a STEM high school \ufffd are providing the public support crucial to raising achievement levels.\nYet goals, also, are revealing indicators of the strength of a district. From that view, the stated goals for Akron within the next two years are a sobering reminder of how much work lies ahead for the district to succeed in an expanding field of public-, charter- and private-school competitors.\nConsider the graduation rate. As the superintendent noted, the district is committed, as part of its Race to the Top goals, to raise the graduation rate to 80.8 percent by 2014. Without question, that would be a big improvement, given its graduation rate was 76.4 percent in the 2009-10 school year. All the same, the disheartening fact is that even if it hits the target, the district will not be close to the 90 percent rate defined on Ohio\ufffds Report Card as the passing standard.\nAnother of Akron\ufffds performance goals, closely related to graduation, is to increase the number of students enrolling in post-secondary education, Again, this is essential to creating an employment pipeline, given the growing number of jobs that now require credentials and training beyond high school. It is not good enough that roughly 20 percent of a graduating class may leave school without the minimum qualifications.\nA lagging graduation rate reduces the district\ufffds competitiveness.

In this review, we are testing the XPS 13 model 9350 which comes with the latest improvement from Intel, including a processor upgrade, and more stable Windows 10 drivers. Is the XPS 13 as good as it sounds?\nEver since this XPS 13 design came out, it was a hit with a lot of users. After all, what\u2019s not to like: a 13.3\u201d display in a body of a 12\u201d laptop seems like a great idea for someone who is looking for a compact chassis, without the traditional downsides of the smaller real estate (= smaller display, trackpad, and keyboard).\nFrom the outside, the Dell XPS 13 (model 9350) is very clean-looking. It is the quintessential business laptop, which looks durable and classy, thanks to its aluminum shell. It feels heavier than it looks, probably because of the more compact body. At 2.8 lbs, it is considered to be an ultra-light or, at least, a thin & light.\nAlthough not the absolute thinnest, The XPS 13 can easily compete with laptops like the Lenovo YOGA 900. There\u2019s a small difference which is partly due to the bump that the XPS 13 has in the back (to allow the air intake to function). In my opinion, a light weight is more important than thinness when it comes to real-world use \u2013 that\u2019s what you need to focus on if you carry a laptop all the time.\nThe XPS 13 display doesn\u2019t recline to 180 degrees (flat), and it will not turn into a tablet, but its smaller size helps it a little when used on a plane\u2019s tray or in a packed conference room. In most \u201claptop situations\u201d it\u2019s perfectly fine.\nI liked the smaller form-factor because it allowed me to carry this laptop in a smaller backpack which was just a little too small for a classic 13\u201d. If I need to work in a crowded space (tradeshows like CES are the worst), like using a sling bag like the Maxpedition Lunada GearSlinger because I can quickly sling it in front of me so that I don\u2019t inadvertently bump into someone.\nWhen I go to places like MWC (Barcelona) where pickpockets are literally hunting journalists, it helps a little having my stuff in front of me. These sling bags tend to be just too small for regular 13.3\u201d laptops, but your luck will vary with the brand. These are high-quality bags but were not designed for computer products.\nI like that the XPS 13 isn\u2019t prone to fingerprints or greasy hands in general. Both the aluminum shell and the soft-paint area around the keyboard and trackpad stay clean and non-slippery.\nThere are two full-size USB 3.0 ports, and one USB-C (+thunderbolt) port. Additionally, there\u2019s an SD card slow, along with 3.5mm audio connector.

Dawley said the hike in values isn\u2019t over with this latest assessment.\nHe said that approach, which isn\u2019t the case in places such as Clark and Washoe counties where \u201cthey follow the market really closely,\u201d stems in Carson City from an effort to keep the hit to any particular property owner less onerous by spreading it out over two years.\nThis century\u2019s roller coaster in overall assessment, including both Carson City owner-occupied residences and commercial property, can be seen by analyzing totals from FY 2000-01 forward. Dawley\u2019s figures show the total was $978.8 million in the first year of the century and went to $997.9 million in FY 2001-02. From then on it was more than $1 billion each year.\nThe annual levels: $1 billion and change both in FY 2002-03 and 2003-04; $1.1 billion in 2004-05; $1.2 billion in 2005-06; $1.4 billion in 2006-07; $1.6 billion in 2007-08; and a peak of more than $1.8 billion in both of the next two fiscal years.

{"idx": "38773", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Jesse Jackson and some conservatives say voters should have full representation in Congress. FROM D.C. TO NEW COLUMBIA?\nWILL ``New Columbia'' become America's 51st state? Jesse Jackson says the time has come for the nation's capital, which would be renamed New Columbia, to gain statehood, including full representation on Capitol Hill. If Congress and President Bush won't agree, the Rev. Mr. Jackson threatens an appeal to the United Nations to end ``tyranny'' over the federal city.\nIt might surprise people from other nations to learn that here at the heart of Western democracy, the 604,000 residents of Washington, D.C., cannot vote for either the House of Representatives or the Senate. It was only 29 years ago that this mostly black city won the right to vote in presidential elections.\nWith democracy movements sweeping Eastern Europe and even the Soviet Union, the political consciousness of Washington citizens is being stirred. They call their city ``the last colony.'' If citizens of Budapest, Warsaw, and Moscow are winning the right to vote, they ask, why not Washington, which has more people than three states?\nJackson, who can always draw a crowd of TV cameras, has adopted statehood for the District of Columbia as his newest cause c'el`ebre. Calling it ``a question of simple democracy,'' the preacher-politician says it is time for D.C. voters to have two senators and at least one representative in the House, just like any state.\nEven some conservatives who have strongly criticized D.C.'s city government, such as Rep. Stan Parris (R) of Virginia, now agree that the district should have a voice on Capitol Hill. Mr. Parris says it is unfair that district residents must pay federal taxes and serve in the military without full representation in Congress.\nHowever, that is where the agreement ends.\nParris would solve the problem by allowing D.C. residents to vote for Congress as if they were residents of neighboring Maryland. No new state. No new senators. District residents would share Maryland's two US senators, and be given representatives in the House in proportion to their population.\nJackson, who many suspect would like to be a US senator from New Columbia, denounces as ``half remedies'' anything that falls short of statehood. Merging Washington with Maryland for voting purposes would deny the capital an opportunity to ``solve our own problems,'' Jackson says.\nEven in this pro-democracy age, statehood for the capital city will be a difficult goal, predicts R. Kent Weaver, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Furthermore, Mr. Weaver suggests that Jackson's threatened appeal to the UN could backfire.\nEven so, Weaver says that D.C. residents are clearly being ill-served. ``They are being denied the right to vote, which is a basic American right,'' he observes.\nIn 1978, Congress tried to remedy the situation with a constitutional amendment that would have given the district two senators and a representative as if it were a state. However, only 17 states ratified the amendment out of the necessary 38, and the amendment died.\nMerger with Maryland. Gov. William Donald Schaefer (D) of Maryland set off a flurry of speculation when he said he would ``have no problem with D.C. becoming a part of Maryland.'' Jackson retorted: ``Thanks, but no thanks.'' Jackson said that would be like turning D.C. into a ``bantustan,'' or black homeland, as in"}

The new dual-camera system promises optical zoom with no moving parts, while also allowing for better noise reduction that's not available on current phone camera sensors.\nBack in 2014 at Mobile World Congress at Barcelona, Corephotonics had told CNET that phones featuring its technology could appear in the same year, but two years have passed with nary a word. As cool as the dual-camera technology is, the delay is certainly frustrating, especially for the tech geeks who want something cool and new.\n\"When Corephotonics introduced dual-camera technology in 2014, its benefits became clear soon after. In 2015 the first generation development was complete; the demand was there from the start, and it has only increased since,\" says Eran Kali, Corephotonic's vice president of sales and licensing, when I caught up with him again in Barcelona this time around.\n\"Yet in 2015 the supply chain was not quite ready for dual cameras and was revamping for that. I am happy to report that today, all three components' demand, development and the supply chain maturity are in place. That goes for the camera manufacturing and also for the application processor framework.\"\nWhile Corephotonics declined to confirm whether its camera technology was used in LG's new G5 and X Cam phones, CNET understands from an LG executive that the technology used in its phones was developed in-house, and doesn't seem to share the same features as those from Corephotonics -- there's no comparable optical zoom.\nSo what does it do, and how?\nIt's not the first time that the smartphone industry has tried something with dual cameras on smartphones. In the 3D-everything frenzy a few years back, phones such as the HTC Evo 3D used dual cameras to take 3D images that could be viewed back on its 3D capable display, but the tech never really took off since it felt gimmicky.\nBut this is a very different beast. For the very basic model, Corephotonics' tech relies on two cameras, one fixed-focus telephoto with a narrow field of view and a more normal wide-angle camera, and combining the images together with algorithms for a better picture. Corephotonics calls this combination a \"computational camera\", and claims it offers resolution gains, noise reduction in low light, increased dynamic range and depth analysis. Higher-end modules, such as the new Hawkeye shown above, use a different method, which we'll talk about more in a bit.\nAnd from what I have seen, it works -- and it works amazingly. The demos shown by Corephotonics at Mobile World Congress are the same as what we saw two years ago, but clearly smoother and a lot more optimized. Low-light images feature amazing detail and significantly lower noise, something that phone makers have been trying to achieve with using larger sensors in phones.\nThe quality of the zoom obtained from this shot easily beats the older digital zoom we"}

On Tuesday, the congresswoman asked Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner whether he would \"categorically renounce the United States moving away from the dollar and going to a global currency as suggested this morning by China.\"\nThe President may not enter into a treaty or other international agreement that would provide for the United States to adopt as legal tender in the United States a currency issued by an entity other than the United States.\nWhat happened in the meantime? Geithner appeared before the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday morning and confused his audience, not to mention currency traders watching the live stream of the event all over the world, by appearing to indicate that he was open to an idea proposed by China's Central Banker Zhou Xiaochuan calling for the creation of a new \"super-sovereign\" international reserve currency.\nAsked today about a currency proposal from China at a Council on Foreign Relations event, Secretary Geithner stated he was open to supporting it. Despite attempts to clarify his remarks later in the day, the unguarded initial response calls into question his true intentions.\nHis true intentions! It's not enough that the right thinks Geithner's a power-mad statist who wants to destroy the free market for all time, while the left thinks he's a minion of Goldman Sachs determined to hand billions of taxpayer dollars to his plutocrat buddies! No, the truth is far, far worse. He's a Chinese mole, a real-life Manchurian treasury secretary, programmed to take over the Treasury Department of the United States and destroy the value of the U.S. dollar. He is the Benedict Arnold of treasury secretaries!\nYet even as I jest, I have to acknowledge that currency traders dumped the dollar within seconds of Geithner's initial comments, and they only stopped panicking after the moderator of the CFR event, former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, gave Geithner an opportunity to reiterate the platitude that the dollar would remain the world's \"dominant currency.\" It seems ludicrous that the world's currency traders could be so naive, but hey, all it takes is a trickle of stupidity to start an avalanche of sell orders.\nSo what did Geithner really say? I watched the CFR event in real time, and the first thing that struck me was how much more relaxed and comfortable Geithner appeared in front of an audience of his peers -- bankers, regulators, financial journalists -- than he does when facing Senate and House committees, giving speeches, or appearing on CNN. It's a lot easier not dumbing yourself down for an audience that understands what you are talking about than sparring with the likes of Maxine Waters, Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann or Jim Bunning. Geithner spoke fluidly and confidently about a range of issues. But it's possible that that very sense of comfort set him up for a fatal trap.\nHere's what Geithner said after being asked to comment \"on the Chinese government proposal about a global currency.\"\nI haven't read the governor's proposal. He's a -- a remarkable -- a very thoughtful, very careful distinguished central banker. Generally find him sensible on every issue."}
{"idx": "38777", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Ask Eartha: Are there eco-friendly approaches to yard work?\nCompared to sprinklers, drip irrigation is a much more efficient way of getting water to plants. This type of irrigation uses a tube with holes in it which is snaked along the base of your plants. A garden hose is connected to this tubing system, and water is delivered directly to the roots of plants. While drip irrigation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ideal for lawns, it can perform beautifully for flower beds, shrubs and decorative trees.\nNow that the weather seems to be nice, I am thinking about revamping my front yard. Can you make some eco-friendly and water conscious suggestions?\nThis question is so very pertinent, Dan. As Coloradans, we have a deep responsibility to conserve water. Not only do we have our own state\u2019s water rights to contend with (a deeply complex topic for another time), but as a headwater state, we have the added responsibility of ensuring that 60 percent of the water that originates in Colorado is sent downstream to other U.S. states and Mexico. The water that does stay here must be allocated among five sectors: agricultural, municipal, industrial, recreational and environmental. So, the water that is available to use in Colorado is very limited and restricted to uses already designated within the state.\nThat said, there are ways that you can have a lush, beautiful yard while keeping the environment and water conservation in mind. One relatively new trend for lawns and yards is xeriscaping. A word coined by Denver Water in the 1980s, xeriscaping literally means dry landscaping. It\u2019s a method of landscaping or gardening that uses native and other drought-resistant plants which require little to no supplemental water. The look of these yards varies depending on region and climate. In Summit County, a xeriscaped yard could consist of sage bushes, quaking aspen, columbine, yarrow, coneflower, lupines and other indigenous, low-water, high-altitude plants.\nIf your goal is to maintain a traditional lawn, there are a few eco-friendly choices when it comes to grass. The turf of choice in Colorado is typically Kentucky Bluegrass, however this variety of grass requires an abundant amount of water to maintain its lush green appearance. Without supplemental irrigation, turf grasses can be difficult to grow and maintain at high altitude, and selecting the right variety for your yard depends on a few different factors, such as sun exposure and traffic. Better options for a high-altitude, low-maintenance lawn include wheatgrasses and fescues, but to get the best advice for your lawn, consult the local Colorado State University Extension Office or a local landscaper.\nUtilizing conservation-friendly irrigation methods is another important component to maintaining an eco-friendly yard. Sprinklers tend to be the go-to method for irrigation in large gardens and lawns. However, sprinklers can be wasteful due to both evaporation and malfunction of the sprinklers themselves. If you are going to use sprinklers, avoid watering during the heat of the day when evaporation levels are highest. Additionally, ensure that all sprinkler heads are in working order and are facing the plants you intend to water \u2014 please don\u2019t be the neighbor who waters the sidewalk. Finally, consider using moisture sensors so you don\u2019t irrigate while it\u2019s raining.\nCompared to sprinklers, drip irrigation is a much more efficient way of getting water to plants.

World leaders and most of the pro-market media applauded him as a \u2018great leader\u2019 who elevated Singapore to a modern state on a par with the most developed countries. They admire Lee basically for his three decades (1959-1990) of having absolute power that he used to assist local and international capitalists to reap economic profits. But this was achieved by widespread repression as well as an anti-working class and anti-socialist agenda.\nLee\u2019s Singapore is held up as a political model for a city-state by right-wing Hong Kong nativist groups and at the same time it is used as a model for a modern authoritarian China by the leaders of the Chinese dictatorship (CCP). How is it that two groups that claim to be bitter enemies both share a common admiration for the same authoritarian model?\nAlthough considered modern and developed, Singapore is among the countries with the worst records of human-rights violations. Lee always identified with autocratic rule, and had some common characters with regional leaders such as Suharto in Indonesia and Mahathir in Malaysia. He cracked down against government critics and dissidents \u2013 jailing many without trial. Lee never allowed an independent media, and suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. According to Reporters Without Borders Singapore\u2019s press freedom ranks 153 out of 180 countries in the world, just below Putin\u2019s Russia. Opposition leaders who were outspoken against the government were bankrupted by contesting in courts controlled by the government. Nepotism and cronyism are also evident in the Singapore regime. In addition to his son, Lee Hsieng Loong being the current Prime Minister of Singapore, his other children and immediate family members occupy important government or business positions in the country. Lee\u2019s daughter-in-law, Ho Ching, is the CEO of Temasek Holdings, Singapore\u2019s giant investment company which allows the ruling party to control large parts of the economy.\nAt the beginning of his political career, Lee Kuan Yew used the left and the trade unions as a platform to increase his popularity. Chin Peng, the leader of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), in his autobiography \u2018My Side of History\u2019, said about Lee\u2019s astounding electoral victory in May, 1959: \u201cI can certainly say that most of the island\u2019s workers sympathised with the left-wing trade unions, and members of these unions well appreciated they were under the control of the CPM. Our supporters, sympathisers and fellow travellers went on to provide Lee\u2019s grassroots electoral support. Without them he would never have achieved his stunning 43-seat victory in the 51 constituencies up for decision at the May 30 polls\u201d.\nThe CPM, which was trapped in Maoist and Stalinist opportunist ideas, adhered to the idea of a popular front (politically tail ending the liberal or \u2018national\u2019 capitalist leaders) and the \u2018two stages\u2019 theory, i.e. that first it was necessary to struggle for democratic rights, and only after accomplishing this was it possible to fight for socialism. Their mistaken approach was utilised by Lee Kuan Yew in the 1960s to take power and promote the agenda of capitalism in Singapore.

What makes this talk so unsettling is its plausibility, and the knowledge that such a disastrous global struggle could have been averted if American leaders had pursued wiser policies.\nWhat, after all, has made the Middle East a geostrategic focal point for so long but its possession of vast reserves of the oil we and our allies need to sustain our economies?\nIf there were any adequate alternative sources of this precious fuel, we would have to be mad not to take advantage of them.

This year's ZITF would be held in Bulawayo from April 23 to 27.\n\"We are launching a nationwide trading competition at this year's trade fair. The competition, which will run over a four-month period will see the winner walking away with a car while the runner up will win an all-expenses paid for a three-day holiday to Victoria Falls.\n\"The competition is designed to foster a trading culture in Zimbabwe,\" he said.\nOnline currency trading is the world's largest market generating over $7 trillion a day while in London alone, over $2,7 trillion is exchanged through the virtual platform. The school, which recently partnered local universities and other tertiary institutions in setting up trading clubs has trained over 4 000 people in Zimbabwe since its establishment in 2017.\n\"The competition will see all those whom we have trained fighting for the top prize. Traders will be required to fund their trading accounts and the winner will be judged based on the highest percentage account growth achieved over the four month period.\n\"We will also expect the candidate to place a certain amount of trades every month and to maintain a detailed trading plan and journal,\" said Mr Manzanga, adding that maintaining such records was key to developing and becoming a professional trader.\nForex Trading School Africa has also engaged local universities and other tertiary institutions in setting up trading clubs.\n\"For instance, we will be training, in partnership with the University of Zimbabwe's elite Economic Think Tanks Association in April and we have other training sessions planned having already completed training recently at MSU (Midlands States University). We also train the public as well,\" he said.\nAs part of their economic empowerment, Mr Manzanga said after the competition, top 10 traders would also receive an undisclosed amount of funding to trade with. In January, the school launched a $50 000 mentorship programme aimed at empowering potential entrepreneurs across the country with online foreign currency trading skills.\nThe institution was also working closely with leading international brokerage and investment firms to give the top traders capital to trade with.\n\"It's not difficult for an elite trader to be given US$50 million dollars to manage by a hedge fund if they can show a proven technique.

It is hoped that the trading SEZs will not only allow people to trade and earn currency for themselves but for the country at large.\n\"We want to train 10 000 people by end of this year and our dream is to see 30 percent of them become consistently profitable traders.\n\"If we can have 3 000 traders making $1 000 a month each, that will work out to US$36 million per annum and it is not difficult to imagine trading being a bigger forex earner than tobacco within five years,\" he said.\nMr Manzanga noted that"}

Boundaries also create and delineate space to facilitate the activities and purposes of political, economic, and social life. Using physical space to create social place is a long and deep American tradition.\nGated communities, one of the more dramatic forms of residential boundaries, have been springing up around the country since the early 1980s. Millions of Americans have chosen to live in walled and fenced communal residential space that was previously integrated with the larger shared civic space. Civic space is more than a political or jurisdictional construct. It is a manifestation of society, culture, and the shared polity.\nIn this era of dramatic demographic, economic and social change, there is a growing fear about the future in America. Many feel vulnerable, unsure of their place and the stability of their neighborhoods in the face of rapid change. This is reflected in an increasing fear of crime that is unrelated to actual crime trends or locations, and in the growing number of methods used to control the physical environment for physical and economic security. The phenomenon of walled cities and gated communities is a dramatic manifestation of a new fortress mentality growing in America. Gates, fences, and private security guards, like exclusionary land-use policies, development regulations, and an assortment of other planning tools, are means of control, used to restrict or limit access to residential, commercial, and public spaces.\nAmericans are electing to live behind walls with active security mechanisms to prevent intrusion into their private domains. Americans of all classes are forting up, attempting to secure the value of their houses, reduce or escape from the impact of crime, and find neighbors who share their sense of the good life. The new fortress developments are predominantly suburban, with a growing number of urban inner-city counterparts. They are, however, more than walled-off areas and refuges from urban violence and a rapidly changing society. They are also a search for sociospatial community--the ideal community that Americans have sought since the landing of the Pilgrims.\nGated communities are residential areas with restricted access in which normally public spaces are privatized. They are security developments with designated perimeters, usually walls or fences, and controlled entrances that are intended to prevent penetration by nonresidents. They include new developments and older areas retrofitted with gates and fences, and they are found from the inner cities to the exurbs and from the richest neighborhoods to the poorest. Their gates range from elaborate two-story guardhouses staffed twenty-four hours a day to roll-back wrought-iron gates to simple electronic arms. Guardhouses are usually built with one lane for guests and visitors and a second lane for residents, who may open the gates with an electronic card, a code, or a remote control device. Some communities with round-the-clock security require all cars to pass the guard, issuing identification stickers for residents&apos; cars. Others use video cameras to record the license plate numbers and sometimes the faces of all who pass through. Entrances without guards have intercom systems, some with video monitors, that residents may use to screen visitors.\nThe residences we are discussing are not multi-unit, high-density apartment and condominium buildings with security systems or doormen in which gates or guards prevent public access to lobbies, hallways, and parking lots. Gated communities are different: their walls and fences preclude public access to streets, sidewalks, parks, beaches, rivers, trails, playgrounds--all resources that without gates or walls would be open and shared"}

There will be plenty to talk about (especially President Diane Nelson getting down to Uptown Funk before the cameras were meant to be on) but just for now, Bleeding Cool correspondent Will Romine lets us know that after a questioner expressed keenness for the character of Tommy Monaghan, the Hitman from Garth Ennis and John McCrea\u2018s series from two decades ago, Geoff Johns said that yes, he and Greg Berlanti have been in discussion about a TV version of Hitman.\nFor those fuzzy on the details.\nHitman, running 61 issues and a few spinoffs, told the story of an ex-Marine Gulf War veteran turned contract killer from the Cauldron, a lower-class Irish district of Gotham City. Attacked by an alien, the bite unexpectedly grants him x-ray vision and moderate telepathy. A side effect is that his corneas and irises are solid black, indistinguishable from his pupils. The powers later come with limits, and Monaghan uses them selectively, both because of the difficulty of concentrating during an explosive firefight and the side effects of their extended use (which includes anything between a headache and a minor illness).\nAfter gaining these powers, Monaghan decides to specialize in killing metahumans and supernatural threats, targets typically shunned by conventional contract killers as too dangerous or too expensive. Despite his powers, Monaghan relies most on his creativity, improvisational abilities, and impressive gunfighting skills to take down a majority of his targets. This speciality line of work gives him an edge over his competition, but also leads him to encountering a number of eclectic characters including demons, zombies, dinosaurs, gods, superheroes and supervillains, as well as more conventional, realistic characters such as CIA agents, the SAS and the Mafia.\nThe series is firmly entrenched in the DC Universe. Batman, The Joker, Green Lantern, Catwoman, Etrigan the Demon, and Superman all guest star at various points, and joking references are frequently made to then-current DC happenings (such as the long-haired Superman). The series also crossed over with many DC events, including Final Night, One Million, and No Man\u2019s Land. There was even a one-shot pairing Monaghan with Lobo, and Monaghan has made a few appearances outside the series (see below).\nAlthough the character adopts the moniker \u201cHitman\u201d in his first appearance, he only refers to himself by that name once in his own series, in the very first issue; the rest of the time, he is referred to by his given name (although he was sometimes called \u201cHitman\u201d in guest appearances)."}

Yet until recently, Republican taxpayers in this peaceful suburb south of Denver were unwittingly paying about $1.25 million a year to fund Democrats\u2019 political campaigns.\nHow so? Most of the district\u2019s 4,300 plus teachers belonged to the local American Federation of Teachers (AFT) union, to which they paid about $1.25 million in dues annually, according to the union\u2019s IRS filings. Since teachers\u2019 salaries are paid by the county\u2019s property tax payers, their dues come out of those salaries. So the $1.25 million annual dues end up in the coffers of the AFT and that money is funneled to the campaigns of Democrats running for office. That\u2019s a lot of Republican-bashing TV campaign commercials and mailers.\nThe AFT and its allied union, the National Education Association (NEA) are among the country\u2019s biggest contributors to Democrat candidates and political groups. From 2004 to 2016 their donations ballooned from $4.3 million to over $32 million \u2013 a new high. And 94% of that money goes to Democrats.\nWhich is especially galling for Douglas County Republicans because 60% of them voted for Donald Trump, even while they were funding Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign through their teachers\u2019 union dues.\nIn the current Douglas County school board election, the AFT is spending big bucks to get its power and influence back after the union and the conservative board ended their contract a few years ago. In their desperation to elect the pro-union \u201cDream Team\u201d slate, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s Tracer website, the AFT has donated $300,000 to a local group, Douglas Schools for Douglas Kids; the political surrogate for the union candidates.\nThe national teachers\u2019 unions have long interfered in Colorado\u2019s elections, trying to boost pro-union school board candidates and sink conservative, reform-minded board members. They poured over a quarter million into Douglas County\u2019s school board race in 2013and over $285,000 to defeat the Jefferson County conservative board in a recent recall election.\nThe \u201cDream Team\u201d ticket which recently renamed itself \u201cCommUNITY\u201d won\u2019t talk about its big bucks union funding. Its four candidates claim to be financed only with \u201csmall contributions\u201d from \u201cfriends and neighbors\u201d but they well know the huge union machine is busily promoting their agenda by bigtime spending on anti-school-choice mailers, TV and radio ads, attacking the pro-choice \u201cElevate Douglas County\u201d candidates: Randy Mills, Ryan Abresch, Debora Scheffel, and Grant Nelson.\nThe main issues are school choice and merit pay for teachers, both of which are poison apples for the union.

Sunni Arabs (search) fear they will lose out on oil revenues if the country is split into federated zones.\n\"We reject it wherever it is, whether in the north or in the south, but we accept the Kurdish region as it was before the war,\" said Kamal Hamdoun (search), a Sunni member of the committee drafting the constitution. Some Shiite leaders want to replicate the success of Kurdish leaders in the north who govern an autonomous part of the country.\n\"The aim of federalism is to divide Iraq into ethnic and sectarian areas. We will cling to our stance of rejecting this,\" Hamdoun said.\nThe dispute threatened to delay the drafting of a constitution, just three days before a deadline for it to be approved by parliament.\nBut even if that deadline is met, the Sunnis appeared to be warning that they could still bring down the charter when it is put before voters in an Oct. 15 referendum, which is to be followed by general elections in December.\nAmerican officials have pushed hard to keep the political process on track as they consider the process vital to maintaining momentum they hope will undermine the Sunni Arab-led insurgency and pave the way for U.S. and other foreign troops to begin withdrawing next year.\nAt the Kmeira Mosque in northern Baghdad, about 500 Sunni Arabs gathered to listen to Sheik Ayad al-Izzi, a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, the largest Sunni Arab political party that has members on the committee drafting the constitution.\n\"We reject these calls (for federalism) and we look to them with suspicion,\" he said.\nThe reaction came a day after Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the country&apos;s biggest Shiite party, called for a Shiite federal state during a speech to cheering crowds in the holy city of Najaf. He said it was needed \"to keep a political balance in the country\" after decades of dictatorship under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni.\nShiites comprise 60 percent of Iraq&apos;s 27 million people but were long suppressed by minority Sunnis.\nAl-Hakim&apos;s endorsement of federalism may have been a last-minute bargaining tactic. The Kurds also have demanded federalism to maintain control over three northern provinces and want authority over Kirkuk, from which thousands of Kurds were expelled by Saddam.\nGovernment officials urged compromise. \"Every group is saying that they have stands that they cannot abandon because they are &apos;red lines&apos; but in the end, everyone is going to make some concessions,\" presidential spokesman"}

Fabulous West Menlo Park Location.\"\nThe rustic two-story house, where Veblen lived the last few years of his life and died in 1929, was marketed by real estate agents as a \"tear down.\" It was sold to local developers in September for $1,115,000 by Charles Sims, 59, whose grandmother Ann Bradley Bevans Veblen, a sharpshooter and suffragette, was Veblen's second wife. The house is a charming but somewhat ramshackle affair reflective of Veblen's abhorrence of froufrou.\nMr. Sims, a biochemist, lost his job at a biotechnology company 18 months ago. His wife, Lyn, 55, a software project manager, was laid off four years ago. Mr. Sims grew up in the house, which Veblen moved into the year after he retired from the New School of Social Research in New York in 1926. Although Veblen's time in the house was brief, it holds deep and long associations with the economist, who, in addition to his radical theories, was known for romantic dalliances with students.\nThe house has been described by the biographers Elizabeth Watkins Jorgensen and Henry Irvin Jorgensen as \"an arty, board and batten, two-story redwood shanty, with a movable skylight roof in one of the upstairs bedrooms.\" It was built in 1910 by Veblen's first wife, Ellen Rolfe Veblen, from whom Veblen was estranged.\nHe began teaching at Stanford in 1906 and lived in a faculty cottage next to the property. Ellen Veblen built the house, mixing the concrete with her bare hands, according to some accounts, \"in order to keep track of her estranged husband's comings and goings,\" said Russell Bartley, a Veblen scholar and professor emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.\nAs if building a watchtower were not enough, she made a concerted and ultimately successful effort to have Veblen forced out of his Stanford teaching position, Professor Bartley said.\nVeblen eventually married Mr. Sims's vivacious grandmother, known to friends as Babe, who was a former student of his at the University of Chicago. His first wife hung on to the house and, upon Babe's death in 1920, offered to sell it to him for $2,000. He moved in in 1927. He died in an upstairs bedroom, which is now outfitted with Mr. Sims's computer and an exercise bicycle.\nEven after death, the house retained a simple, albeit rickety, Veblen aura, lending to this once unassuming neighborhood of oak trees and cottages an intellectual and bohemian cachet.

Start the day with sensual hits like \u201cSuperclean\u201d and \u201cOnly in My Dream\u201d while you are sipping your coffee or tea, then up the motivation midday with upbeat tracks like \u201cBasta Ya\u201d and \u201cI Like It,\u201d and finally get festive during a friendly dinner party with \u201cI Don\u2019t Know You\u201d playing while the wine is being poured. \u201cD\u00e9jate Llevar,\u201d however, is the golden track of the bunch. The tune is beautifully poised between the slow sensuality of Mar\u00eda\u2019s voice as she sings in Spanish and the lush background instrumentals, affording each of the band members a moment in the spotlight\u2014deservedly so.\nSuperclean Vol. II, like Vol. I, is filled with lyrical ingenuity and musical surprises. Tracks like \u201cClueless\u201d and \u201cRuthless\u201d may feel riffed and improvised, thanks to a marvelous trumpet solo that concludes \u201cRuthless,\u201d but the internal discipline is clear. The star of the EP is \u201cCari\u00f1o,\u201d a single that was released before the EP, and still stands as one of the best in the collection. \u201cYou can talk to me, but you already know/I can be your babe if you won\u2019t let go/Cari\u00f1o eres un amor/Cari\u00f1ito pintas en color.\u201d It\u2019s a song made both for the ease of a long love affair and the thrill of a new one.\nTheir most recent single is \u201cDrip,\u201d a collaboration between The Mar\u00edas and Triathalon that seems to be the quintessence of the band as a whole. It\u2019s packed with a soft sweetness for every occasion, full of heart, and like their other tracks, is best enjoyed with others\u2014either in a group or with that special someone."}

His legacy is remembered in the reconstruction of the Four Courts, the Customs House and the Law Library, and also his art deco design for the post office in Rathmines.\nFor private homes, his signature style was influenced by the arts and crafts movement \u2013 and many of these survive on Zion Road, where he also resided.\nGlencar, at number 36 was originally built for a member of the Weir jewellery family, and it stands on what was the Danum estate, the residence and 30-acre farm owned by the Bewley family. The remainder of the estate was purchased in 1955 by The High School \u2013 who moved to the site in 1971 \u2013 and the co-educational school continues to operate just two doors down.\nGlencar has been home to David and Geraldine Cooke (no relation to the architect Howard Cooke) for the past 36 years.\nWhen they moved in, a neighbour called by with the original plans of Glencar which had been unearthed in the attic of her own home because it had been Howard Cooke\u2019s residence. The plans now hang in the upstairs study of this 257sq m five-bedroom house, and they indicate that the estimated build cost of the house was \u00a31,462 in 1921.\nOver the years the Cooke\u2019s added two extensions to this fine home. Firstly and seamlessly was a two-storey build which added two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, with a dining room and second drawing room at hall level.\nThe second addition, a Norman Pratt conservatory located to the rear of the kitchen was added 20 years ago. It is an ideal room for entertaining in warm weather as it opens out to a dining area in the garden.\nThe kitchen in solid pine, is centred around a very large Aga. David Cooke was managing director of Campbell and Cooke, the Irish agency for Aga cookers until his recent retirement. The Aga caters for both winter and summer cooking; with two gas ovens for winter and two electric ovens for summer use, in addition to four electric plates in a modular unit, sitting beside the two Aga plates.\n\u201cIt really comes into its own at Christmas \u2013 when the four ovens are in full swing,\u201d says Cooke.\nThe property has three large reception rooms \u2013 two drawing rooms and a dining room, in addition to a music room. The main drawing room features a particularly impressive period marble fireplace which was valued at \u20ac20,000 by Antique Fireplace Restoration on Francis Street.\nThe kitchen is flanked by a small living room at one end \u2013 and the conservatory on the other.\nUpstairs, a bedroom was changed into a study \u2013 as it now leads into the two bedrooms which were added in the extension. \u201cIt was an ideal place for the kids when they were teenagers as they had their own space to hang out with their pals,\u201d says Cooke.\nThere are still five bedrooms upstairs, and the attic area is accessible via a set of narrow steps providing an abundance of additional storage.\nThe gardens extend to almost a third of an acre, and were once part of an orchard on the Danum estate, where Jersey cattle roamed a century ago.

The opposition Free Forum party, launched by defectors from Dzurinda's SDK\u00da, named actor Marek \u0164ap\u00e1k to its number two slot behind leader Zuzana Martin\u00e1kov\u00e1.

Originally, the SDK\u00da had been expected to offer a spot on its candidates list to renowned Bratislava lawyer Ernest Valko, a former Constitutional Court chief justice, but Dzurinda allegedly forced party members to choose between Valko and \u017dit\u0148ansk\u00e1.\nValko, along with current Health Minister Rudolf Zajac, eventually appeared on the list of the tiny non-parliamentary Civic Conservative Party (OKS). Zajac accepted the OKS offer even after earlier saying he was finished with politics.\nApart from football coach Galis, who holds the No 30 slot on the Smer candidates list and gained national recognition during Slovakia's exciting run for a World Cup qualifying spot last fall, Robert Fico's party stuck by its traditional leadership, fielding deputy chairmen Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k, Pavol Pa\u0161ka, Du\u0161an \u010caplovi\u010d and Igor \u0160ulaj in top spots.\nIn a surprise move, Smer's Monika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, originally number two on the party's candidates list, gave up her spot a week after being named.

{"idx": "38846", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: HAIFA, Israel \u2013 War is a human disaster. Not only due to the victims, but also because it brings in plain view many evil and ugly phenomena: violence, racism, nationalist zeal. The atmosphere here in Israel during the current war is one of bloodletting, that brings to mind prior periods of incitement that preceded the murders of peace activist Emil Grunzweig and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\nOn a recent Saturday evening, July 19, a joint Jewish-Arab antiwar demonstration took place in the northern city of Haifa. Amongst the demonstrators stood Yara, a young Arab woman from Kufr Yassif and a student at Haifa University. Yara stood with a sign that read \u201cIn Gaza and in S\u2019derot, girls want to live.\u201d At some point a brick was thrown at her from the right-wing counter-protest. It hit her stomach. She was knocked to the ground. In a Facebook status she published after the demonstration, she emphasized that three young Jewish women whom she did not know came to her aid. Yara saw in this proof that even in difficult times, human decency transcends national boundaries.\nThe violence was not confined to the demonstration itself. In the nearby square outside the Haifa Arts Cinema, the deputy mayor Suheil Assad and his son were attacked by right-wing activists, because they spoke Arabic. A few hundred meters away, the Hussari brothers were attacked as they left their car. A group of people moved toward them, one shouting, \u201cAre you Arabs?\u201d The brothers did not answer, instead choosing to flee. Their assailants caught up to them, broke the nose of one brother, and the other\u2019s arm. When an ambulance arrived to evacuate them, it was surrounded by a furious mob, which proceeded to hit it, screaming \u201cDeath to Arabs.\u201d If not for the courage of the paramedic, who prevented the mob from taking their anger beyond mere injuries, there would have been people killed that night in Haifa.\nThis evil wind is not a private initiative. It\u2019s a direct result of the fear and incitement spread by the ruling parties. If the prime minister had not called for \u201cvengeance\u201d immediately following the death of three kidnapped teenagers, and if ministers, members of Knesset (the Israeli parliament), and mayors had not denied the right to express criticism of the war, the outbreak of violence would not have occurred.\nThe government and the man at its head chose the way of war. In the five years of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s administration, he has conducted a consistent policy of peace rejectionism: he did not agree to freeze construction in settlements in order to allow negotiation over permanent borders, and was careful to keep saying that Abu Mazen is not a possible partner for peace. In the name of the ideology of Greater Israel, Netanyahu and his government chose to leave Israelis and Palestinians permanently on the brink of a clash, when any tiny spark could ignite a conflagration. When this occurred, instead of trying to put out the fire, they continued to pour the gasoline of incitement onto it.\nThe events of the past weeks can create a feeling of desperation. The pain of grieving families, in Gaza and in Israel, is an intolerable burden. The knowledge that in my city, at the very place where only three years ago we created an encampment for social justice, there was a pogrom attempt against its Arab residents, is horrifying. Yet I choose to remember those incredible moments of hope three years ago, when we mar"}

Other income increased 21% due to higher income from the insurance business, the bank informs.\nTotal expenses rose 4%. The increase is due to higher staff costs and regulatory expenses. Credit recoveries according to IFRS 9 amounted to EUR 2 mln.\n''While for the financial sector 2018 has been a turbulent year, for Latvian society and economy it has been mostly positive. Latvia has begun its second centenary with the historically best economic situation, strong exports, rising savings and an average salary of over EUR 1,000.

As a result we have evidenced the strongest loan portfolio growth over the last 10 years. 2018 also marked a milestone in our society's ability to use mobile technology - now every second Swedbank client uses a mobile phone to find out its account balance or make payments while Smart-ID replaces code cards at a fast pace,\u201d said Reinis Rubenis, Head of Swedbank Latvia.\nAfter launching a new version of the mobile app in the third quarter, Swedbank joined the instant payment system between banks. The mobile app had more than 355,000 active users by the end of the year, while the number of Smart-ID users has doubled during 2018 and reached 389,000 users.\nSwedbank also continued to expand its services available through the Internet Bank last year.

Among the latest to surface in the news is the startup Thor Motors, which just announced its own offering, the ET-One, said to be available as soon as 2019.\nThe Class 8 ET-One is claimed to have a hauling capacity of 80,000 pounds and a range of about 300 miles per charge, with a 90-minute charge time. It intends to deliver a 70% savings in fuel costs per mile, as well as 60% lower maintenance costs, with the intended market being short-haul and regional fleets. The price is expected to be about $150,000, which is significantly cheaper than the presumed $180,000 Tesla Semi, but they're also two completely different animals, so to speak. Even aside from the differing specs on the two models, the companies themselves are virtual opposites. Whereas Tesla has not only its vehicle production facilities up and running, as well as its own battery production pipeline in place, Thor Trucks is operating out of an LA-area warehouse, where it currently takes existing truck platforms and retrofits an electric drivetrain and battery pack into them according to the needs and specifications of customers.\nAccording to Bloomberg, one of the founders of Thor Trucks, Dakota Semler, managed the fleet of trucks at his family's vineyard, first converting them to run on waste vegetable oil, and then turning his sights to the electrification of semis. Instead of building an entire vehicle from the ground up, Thor Trucks focuses on what it believes it can do best, which is to optimize its battery packs and electric drivetrain, as well as work on the software that helps to make the most of the capacity.\nThe company now has a working prototype of its ET-One, and offers fleet demos to prospective buyers, and expects to be able to produce the truck in 2019. However, there's no indication what the time to ramp up production might be for this 18-person company if some of the big fleet customers place initial orders to trial the trucks, as they have with Tesla."}

It supports more than 11,000 businesses, 70,000 full-time jobs and contributes a staggering $7.9 billion to B.C.\u2019s GDP \u2014 second only to the oil and gas industry.\nNot only is tourism lucrative for our region, it\u2019s also the leading industry for defining and celebrating Vancouver\u2019s global brand. Vancouver has been voted Best Destination in Canada for 15 consecutive years by Travel Weekly Readers\u2019 Choice awards. It\u2019s the Best Destination in Canada, according to TripAdvisor, and a top-rated cruise destination for U.S. and Canada. And those are just a few of our city\u2019s accolades.\nYet, there are challenges on the horizon. We can\u2019t take our leading position for granted. While our growth has drawn worldwide attention, it also means we are now competing on a global scale. If we want to ensure Vancouver remains a top global tourism destination, we need long-term thinking around policy and an unwavering focus on sustainable growth.\nIn 2018, Vancouver is expected to welcome more than 10.7 million overnight visitors \u2014 the fifth consecutive year of record growth. While this trajectory is exciting and a boon for local businesses, we are facing acute accommodation challenges. Vancouver\u2019s hotel inventory dropped by nearly 2,000 rooms between 2002 and 2017 due to ongoing pressures in the real-estate market.\nTo help preserve our existing stock of hotel rooms, Vancouver council recently passed an interim hotel development policy, a strong first step toward protecting hotel inventory. But we must do more if we are to keep tourism growing. To meet projected visitor growth and to ensure tourism remains a vibrant contributor to our economy, it\u2019s vital that all levels of government collaborate with industry to implement policies and promote investment opportunities that protect and increase hotel inventory.\nTourism\u2019s benefits extend beyond economics. Ultimately, a strong tourism industry improves quality of life for residents. Tourism helps drive ongoing investment in local museums and galleries, festivals and concert arenas, seaports and airports, as well as parks and other recreational facilities. No wonder a recent Insights West survey found 91 per cent of Vancouverites feel tourism has a positive impact on residents.\nLong-term thinking must also be reflected in our industry\u2019s approach to sustainable growth. B.C. has been successful as a tourist destination because we play to our strengthens. British Columbians have always known and appreciated our region\u2019s natural beauty. It\u2019s a fundamental component of our heritage and a legacy for our children. It\u2019s also a natural asset that needs to be protected \u2014 a key reason why our industry must be leading stewards of our environment.\nTake, for example, the cruise industry, a primary driver of tourism in B.C. Each ship that calls at Canada Place stimulates $3 million of economic activity for Vancouver. Last year, more than 230 cruise ships carrying nearly one million tourists called at Canada Place. Provincially, it\u2019s an industry that generates more than $1 billion of economic activity across B.C., but for years cruise ships had one of the largest environmental footprints in the tourism industry.\nIn response, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, which operates Canada Place, installed shore power, allowing"}

On April 21, 2014, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. encouraged federal prisoners to seek relief, noting that, despite sentencing reforms Obama signed into law in 2010, there were \u201cstill too many people .\u2009.\u2009. sentenced under the old regime\u201d who needed attention. Holder said the White House had \u201cindicated\u201d that it wanted to \u201cconsider additional clemency applications to restore a degree of justice, fairness, and proportionality for deserving individuals who do not pose a threat to public safety.\u201d In addition, the Justice Department was \u201ccommitted to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences.\u201d Clemency Project 2014 has, however, become a bureaucratic disaster, assigned to volunteer lawyers and law students with little if any experience in the pitfalls of dealing with the federal criminal justice system.\nIn June 2014, the Hill reported that Obama was pushing forward with a review of the clemency system. In March 2015, the president told the Huffington Post that the pardon process had been \u201crevamped\u201d and that he would be exercising the pardon power \u201cmore aggressively.\u201d Seven months later, he told the Marshall Project that clemency applications were being processed \u201cmore effectively\u201d and a \u201csteady ramp up\u201d was in play. The Post recently reported that some additional grants are expected in the coming weeks, but \u201cbig\u201d is hardly a word that appropriately describes what has gone on to date.\nBy now, Obama could have simply signed an amnesty proclamation covering everyone qualifying for lesser sentences. He could have taken the pardon process out of the Justice Department and given the job to a commission or an independent agency that would give him a degree of political cover if anything went wrong. Just such a move had been proposed by his first White House counsel, Gregory Craig.\nRegardless, seven neglectful years allow for few pretty endings. If current patterns persist, Obama will go down as one of the most merciless presidents in history. On the other hand, even a moderate display of concern about clemency, with a few grants here and there, will almost certainly be viewed (and dubbed) as \u201ca last-minute gesture,\u201d granted to avoid any serious political accountability.\nHaving waited almost two years before granting his first presidential pardon, Obama would probably do as much harm to the general reputation of the pardon power as to his personal legacy with a controversial, Bill Clintonesque splurge in"}

Some of them will be extensions of existing concepts, others will be new, some will be production ready, and others really far-fetched.\nThe Vayant is an affordable indoor car simulator designed to be paired with virtual reality headsets like the Rift from Oculus or the Vive from HTC. With it, you will be able to ride (or race) to any place, real or not, on Earth with your friends\u2014without polluting the air, making noise, paying for gas or insurance and without leaving home.\nVirtual reality is just around the corner, and it will create a shock wave in home entertainment. I think personal vehicle simulators paired with those devices will become a huge market too. The Vayant would make it possible to visit places and countries you've dreamed of from the perspective of a driver. It would also make it possible to conduct races with other drivers and link them to real Phantom 1 driverless racing car concepts. The concept name 'Vayant' comes from a French comic book series about car racing titled Michel Vaillant.\nThe Vayant's body could be made of plastic or a light composite material. Four actuators on the vehicle would simulate the up and down movement and leaning. I would approach D-BOX technologies to develop the mechanical system because they already make all sorts of automotive simulators. They have all the necessary expertise to integrate actuators, and they have a supplier network in place.\nTo integrate the Vayant in different games, I would approach companies like Sony and Microsoft who are major players in this industry. I would also contact Google because they will most probably create 3D footage of all the roads in the world, so incorporating that content for Vayant users would be a natural fit.\nThe real challenge will be to create a really low cost automotive simulator\u2014something that would cost less than $5,000. It would need to fit in a living room and you would assemble it like an Ikea kit in under an hour. Options could be installed on the simulator like AC, heat, heated seats, and an excellent surround sound system.\nImagine if you could invite friends or fellow players to explore canyons in the Valles Marineris on Mars? Or take part in a car race with the best drivers in the world? You could even explore cities from across the globes in a Lamborghini, a pick-up truck or a tank.\nThe Vayant could simulate all those vehicles and extrapolate the view by using existing images collected by Google cars. You could also use the Vayant to test and feel the 2020 Cadillac models in a focus group at your local dealership.\nIn my opinion, the question is not if there is a market for powersports simulators, but rather who will seize it first?\nThe Vayant concept was developed in collaboration with Jan Bujnak, an industrial designer from the Slovak Republic.

The Oxford Word of the Year is a word or expression that is judged to have lasting potential as a term of cultural significance, Oxford English Dictionary said in a statement. The word toxic was selected from a shortlist that included contenders such as \u2018gaslighting,\u2019 \u2018incel\u2019 and \u2018techlash.\u2019 The data shows that, after \u2018chemical\u2019, \u2018masculinity\u2019 is the most-used word in conjunction with toxic this year.\n\u201cWith the #MeToo movement putting a spotlight on toxic masculinity, and watershed political events like the Brett Kavanaugh Senate judiciary committee hearing sparking international debate, the term toxic masculinity has well and truly taken root in the public consciousness and got people talking in 2018,\u201d the statement said. The adjective toxic is defined as \u2018poisonous\u2019 and first appeared in English in the mid-seventeenth century from the medieval Latin toxicus, meaning \u2018poisoned\u2019 or \u2018imbued with poison\u2019. In 2018, toxic added became a descriptor for the year\u2019s most talked about topics.\nIt is the sheer scope of its application, as found by our research, that made toxic the stand-out choice for the Word of the Year title, according to Oxford. The data shows that, along with a 45 per cent rise in the number of times it has been looked up on oxforddictionaries.com, over the last year the word toxic has been used in an array of contexts, both in its literal and more metaphorical senses. Words like \u2018environment\u2019, \u2018relationship\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 were habitually used alongside toxic.\nBeyond the more usual substance warnings, this year toxic chemical has had particular significance as the nerve agent poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter in Britain sent shockwaves around the globe. Ongoing international attention to the case, including rising concern over who has access to the world\u2019s toxic chemical stockpiles, ensured that \u2018chemical\u2019 topped the list of words most frequently seen alongside toxic in 2018. Similarly literal and deadly are toxic substance, toxic gas, and toxic waste, with the latter especially becoming a focal point as the US seeks to combat the spread of toxic waste in the wake of hurricanes.\nThis burning of toxic waste, resulting in the release of toxic gases, has been identified as one of a number of causes of toxic air. Air pollution has rapidly become a prime public health concern, and global attention reached a high in October 2018 when the World Health Organization published its report into the quality of air breathed by children worldwide.\nThe report described this pollution as toxic air, plainly and potently signifying its poisonous nature, and with the aid of international media coverage, served to consolidate the association of toxicity and poor air quality. The term toxic environment itself, however, has been more frequently used in reference to harmful workplace environments and the toll this takes on the workforce\u2019s mental health.\nFrom overly demanding workloads to outright sexual harassment, many companies have been exposed as crucibles for such toxic culture this year, which has seen mass walkouts at Google, the fashion mogul Philip Green disgraced, and the Speaker of the House of Commons accused of misusing his official powers to cover up allegations of bullying"}

Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. 249 pp. $20.\nReading philosophy has its rewards. Abstract terminology, logical rigor, and the extreme conciseness of expression cultivated by modern philosophers can put you off, but when these are balanced by a mature, deeply felt concern for the great problems of mankind, there's nothing like reading philosophy. When the work is a late one, like these recent books by Eric Voegelin and W.V. Quine, one thinks of late Beethoven, late Rembrandt for parallel experiences.\nOn the face of it, Voegelin and Quine couldn't be more different. Voegelin, who died in 1985, is a philosopher noted for his writings on political science and ancient thinkers; Quine, professor emeritus of philosophy at Harvard University, began as a logician and has made major contributions to analytic philosophy.\nBorn in Germany in 1901, Voegelin fled the Nazis, teaching primarily at Louisiana State University, becoming known mostly for his published work, especially the monumental ``Order and History.'' Quine has been visible almost from the beginning, contributing to a major school of modern philosophy and teaching at a major university.\nVoegelin's work has centered on recovering the thought of the ancients; Quine is definitely a modern specialist. Voegelin has a transcendental thrust befitting a student of Plato; Quine has seemed to undermine traditional concepts by relating everything to language and logic.\nReading their latest works side by side shows a certain community of interest, perhaps inevitable, since they shared the same world, philosophical and otherwise. Both men have taken obvious delight in the richness and complexity of language.\nQuine's ``Quiddities'' is a sometimes arcane, often playful tour through his major themes, arranged alphabetically. Many of these short pieces come under headings like ``Definition,'' ``Etymology,'' ``Kinship of Words,'' ``Language Reform,'' ``Syntax.'' Far from trying to flatten out the bumpiness of words, Quine relishes the odd, sometimes paradoxical combinations of sound and meaning the study of words reveals. He can sound like a newspaper columnist: ``It is heartwarming to hear transpire used correctly''; or like a logician, ``To define is to eliminate.'' For some of his own effects, Quine exploits the playful insights afforded by words. Start with the ambiguity of the title of this book: ``Quiddity'' refers both to essence, and to quibble. For a man who doesn't believe in essences in the traditional sense, and who loves to quibble in the logical sense, this is a particularly happy title.\nIn his own way, Quine has preserved the central complexity of the human world from the reductionists who would use philosophy (he prefers the term science) to flatten out our mental life. Long considered something of a skeptic and relativist, in ``Quiddities'' Quine appears to be motivated by something like love for the universals - just so long as they"}

As an award-winning journalist, a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and a special correspondent at ABC News, he has covered major international news stories around the world, and has received both a National Magazine Award and a Peabody Award. Junger is also a documentary filmmaker whose debut film \"Restrepo\", a feature-length documentary (co-directed with Tim Hetherington), was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.\n\"Restrepo,\" which chronicled the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley, is widely considered to have broken new ground in war reporting. Junger has since produced and directed three additional documentaries about war and its aftermath. \"Which Way Is The Front Line From Here?\", which premiered on HBO, chronicles the life and career of his friend and colleague, photojournalist Tim Hetherington, who was killed while covering the civil war in Libya in 2011. \"Korengal\" returns to the subject of combat and tries to answer the eternal question of why young men miss war. \"The Last Patrol\", which also premiered on HBO, examines the complexities of returning from war by following Junger and three friends--all of whom had experienced combat, either as soldiers or reporters--as they travel up the East Coast railroad lines on foot as \"high-speed vagrants.\"\nJunger has also written for magazines including Harper's, The New York Times Magazine, National Geographic Adventure, Outside and Men's Journal. His reporting on Afghanistan in 2000, profiling Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was assassinated just days before 9/11, became the subject of the National Geographic documentary \"Into the Forbidden Zone,\" and introduced America to the Afghan resistance fighting the Taliban. He lives in New York City and Cape Cod.\nSebastian Junger: I think everything we do is a form of tribalism. We\u2019re evolved for that. We\u2019re wired for that. The question is how big do we want our tribe to be? England seems to be saying we want our tribe and at our choice. All right so that\u2019s a point of view I understand.

Equally legitimate is the opposite point of view where there should be a broader pan European tribe as it were to protect itself and reinforce itself in a dangerous world. That\u2019s also tribalism.

Election night is an almost therapeutic pastime, and as it turns out, in California it\u2019s almost completely irrelevant.\nAnd nobody really seems to care.\nThe media still perpetuates the importance of early results, while voters and candidates ardently expect them. Because think about it\u200a\u2014\u200awhat if once the polls closed, they just told you to check back in two weeks?\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, we like drama in the United States. Learning who the \u201cwinner\u201d is late on election night is purely a psychological pleasure that really serves no public policy purpose. We do it for the thrill and because we love competition, which is fine until those results don\u2019t actually reflect reality.\nSo, if election night results were reliable in the past, what\u2019s the deal now?\nAs California goes, so does the nation. This saying is particularly true of the progressive policies this state has in terms of empowering voters. As such, we regularly pass laws that increase the accessibility and ease of casting a vote.\nOne example is the no excuse absentee law. Previous to this, a voter had to have a legitimate \u201cexcuse\u201d (e.g. a doctor\u2019s note) to receive a vote-by-mail ballot. Now, any eligible voter can request a vote-by-mail ballot for any reason, and do so permanently.\nCalifornia also recently passed legislation that allows ballots postmarked by election day that arrive within three business days to be counted, and anotherthat allows voters who forgot to sign their ballot an additional eight days to send in a signature.\nThese seem like small changes, but they mean a lot in terms of empowering voters, which are increasingly using the vote-by-mail option to participate in democracy.\nAnd of course, there are challenges.\nMost notably, vote-by-mail and provisional ballots (the ones you fill out at your polling place if you forgot your mail ballot) require what\u2019s called \u201csignature verification\u201d. Essentially, election officials must verify that you are the person you say you are and that nobody is voting more than once.\nThis is a long a laborious process, and that\u2019s a good thing.\nWe want to make sure elections are verified and accurate. We also want to ensure the right person is elected and the right policy implemented. However, because it takes time to do this, it takes time to produce accurate results.\nThis presidential election was a prime example.\nSo why then, with the increasing inaccuracy of election night results, and the realization that they\u2019re pretty much completely useless in California, do we still rely so heavily on them?\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that, though I assume culture, tradition and human nature play a big role. Perhaps continuing the practice because of those reasons isn\u2019t so bad in and of itself, but the ramifications for election officials may be a different story.\nNot only are we continually expecting officials to do more with lessconsider"}

But the Lynx went on a 15-5 run and eventually forced overtime.\nI would rather that we have trouble maintaining the lead than getting ourselves out of a 16-point deficit, said center Nakia Sanford, who led Washington (7-12) with 25 points. At least we\u2019re evolving a little bit. We have different issues now, but I\u2019d much rather have that.\nDespite the Mystics\u2019 fast start, the game featured 10 lead changes.\nWashington has a two-game winning streak heading into the All-Star break. Last night\u2019s victory pulled the Mystics within five games of the .500 mark for just the second time this season.\nThe Mystics have struggled early in games this season, partially the reason for their 0-8 start.

For instance, the Mystics used a 13-0 run in the fourth quarter Saturday to rally past the Chicago Sky.\nAs a result, the Mystics have won seven of their last 11 games, though they have a league-worst 3-7 record at home.\nWe have to get a streak going at home, coach Tree Rollins said. Obviously, we\u2019re happy with the wins we have on the road. But we definitely need more wins at home. Most teams protect their homecourt.\nAlana Beard scored 13 points, while Monique Currie and DeLisha Milton-Jones added 12 apiece.\nIn the third quarter, Stanford helped the Mystics get back into the game.

The Bangladesh government has been responsible for improving safety in about 745 other factories.\nBangladesh\u2019s labour ministry and garment factory owners argue the $29bn industry has become much safer in the six years since the disaster and that its inspectors are ready to take over the accord\u2019s work.\nBut the government\u2019s performance in the 745 factories under its control illustrate otherwise, according to an analysis by a consortium of labour rights organisations seen by the Guardian, which will be published on Tuesday.\nNot a single garment factory under the government\u2019s control has completely eliminated all the \u201chigh-risk\u201d safety hazards in their buildings, according to the report. Outstanding issues include buildings with lockable emergency exits, a danger that is required to be fixed within two weeks of being identified.\nBangladesh\u2019s urgent need to improve building safety has been reinforced in past months by a series of deadly fires, including a six-hour inferno in an upmarket office block in Dhaka last week that killed at least 25 people \u2013 some of whom were hampered from escaping because of locked emergency exits.\nThe analysis, using safety progress data last updated by the Bangladesh government in January, found the vast majority of the 400 factories for which data is available had completed less than 20% of their required renovations. In contrast, factories covered by the accord had completed 89% of their upgrades.\nIn addition, more than 50 factories identified by the accord as too dangerous to continue making clothing were found to still be operating under the government\u2019s inspection programme, the report said, with no evidence they had carried out any safety improvements.\nThe report\u2019s authors, who include the Clean Clothes campaign and the Workers Rights Consortium, said that ejecting the accord from Bangladesh \u201cwould put workers\u2019 lives in danger\u201d.\nThe Bangladesh government has been contacted for a response to the findings.\nFactory owners and the government are eager to see the accord leave, arguing that their industry is being more heavily scrutinised than those of their low-cost competitors in China, Vietnam and Ethiopia. Many of the safety upgrades are expensive, and the government offers little financial assistance.\nMore broadly, industry leaders argue they have been investing in safety while facing unrelenting pressure from western buyers to make clothes more cheaply. The import price paid by EU buyers for clothing has fallen from about $1,589 (\u00a31,212) per 100kg in 2012 to $1,520 (\u00a31,160) last year, according to data provided by a factory owner.\nRubana Huq, whose Mohammadi Group is one of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers, said the time had come for the country to"}

What happens in those games will play a big role in his future.\nIf and when the Twins ever resume playing \u2014 as soon as tonight! \u2014 after this weather-marred but undeniably successful soft launch to the 2018 season, the Brian Dozier countdown clock will also keep ticking.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that he has just 151 regular-season games left in his Twins career. But what happens in those 151 games could still play a significant role in his future.\nSix weeks ago, the Star Tribune\u2019s Jim Souhan wrote about Dozier\u2019s impending free agency after this season and noted that the Twins second baseman was not engaged in contract extension talks with the team.\nSix weeks later, nothing appears to have changed. I only circle back on this subject now because of a recent ESPN.com Insider piece (subscription required) that attempted to use projected production of top impending free agents to estimate what sorts of deals they might get on the open market next offseason.\nIf the perception is that Dozier, who turns 31 next month and would turn 32 early in a free agent deal, might be squeezed because of his age and position in a market that turned cold this past offseason, th ESPN piece at least went against that thinking. He was tabbed as worthy of a five-year, $77 million deal \u2014 not a break-the-bank contract, but a make-you-blink deal deal, at least, when considering that\u2019s an annual value of $15+ million that will carry Dozier into his age 36 season.\nDozier, of course, has showed no signs of slowing down. Quite the opposite, his trajectory is still on an upward arc after smashing 76 home runs over the past two seasons and four more in the Twins\u2019 7-4 cold-weather start this year. He\u2019s been a bargain on his current four-year, $20 million deal.\nBut if the Twins want to keep costs down, they have a bevy of young middle infield prospects, including the knocking-on-the-door Nick Gordon. The Twins also have just four players under contract in 2019 and exactly zero in 2020 \u2014 making it seem obvious that they could not only afford Dozier but should want to keep him. In not too long, though, a lot of the young core players that are under team control will start hitting free agency. The payroll and commitments will go up accordingly.\nIt\u2019s possible the Twins would try to trade Dozier this season to get something in return for him, but that seems unlikely given that they appear poised to be in contention for the playoffs again. Maybe he\u2019ll have a monster first half of the year and an extension will happen.\nBut the most likely outcome at this point seems to be Dozier hitting free agency \u2014 and a situation where might be more valuable to the Twins than anyone else but might also find a salary with another team that the Twins aren\u2019t willing to match."}

More than half ofthe samples hada more aggressive strain called Nosema ceranae, the association said in a release Tuesday.\nButthat wasn't the only problem. \"The bees were already under stress from a high incidence of varroa mites as well as the environment. Due to a wet fall, the bees were not able to gather enough pollen to use as a protein source for raising young bees in the spring,\" said Alison Skinner, an association expert.\nErnesto Guzman, a University of Guelph environmental biology professor, said recently that thevarroa mite and Nosema ceranae may have causedlast winter's highmortality.\n\"It may be one of the main factors in Ontario's colony loss,\" Guzman said in a release in October,\"but because it's so new, the prevalence of this parasite in the province and how it affects colony mortality have never been studied.\"\nNosema ceranae was discovered in Ontario in May, buthas been blamed for large colony losses in Europe.\nThe Maritimes have also seen an unusually high number of bee deaths recently and anentomologist said in May that Nosema ceranae might have contributed. At the time,Agriculture Canada's leading bee scientist, Steve Pernal, said he thought unusual weather conditions were more likely to blame.\nThe Ontario Beekeepers' Associationhas given Guzman nearly $278,000 to investigate the parasite.\nMeanwhile, the association'stech transfer team is promoting theonly known treatment for Nosema, a drug called Fumagilin B that can kill Nosema spores. The prognosis is good, the association said.\nAlmost 27,000 of the76,000 hives in Ontario were killed last year, and many of the remaining colonies were badlyweakened.\nWhile the immediate financial loss was relatively small \u2014 about $6 million \u2014 the problem highlighted the role of bees in pollinating other crops.Honey-bee pollination is responsible for one-third of food, the association said.\nNosema divides once it enters a bee, and the bees defecate more often (called bee dysentery) to try and remove the parasite. If they defecate in the hive, which they may do in the winter, other bees are affected.\nThe bee problems in Ontario and other provincesappear to be separate from Colony Collapse Disorder, whichaffected almost a quarter of United States earlier in 2007."}

For starters, although it's clearly set in the present day, most of the characters appear to be straight from the 50s as the small rural village of Ballymoran witnesses a comet pass overhead. The Cassidy family return to their house to find a mysterious man clad in a red plastic suit and cycling helmet, Zonad (Simon Delaney), conked out on their living room floor.\nThe slack-jawed yokels believe him to be from outer space and give him the run of the town, which is where all logic in the story is completely disregarded.\nZonad tries to give the impression that it's some sort of sci-fi spoof but hasn't got a script worthy of the task. It'll be stoutly defended by its makers as 'only a bit of a laugh' but really, being aware that something is a pile of crap doesn't mean that it's any less of a pile of crap. Awful, and with a disturbingly sleazy undercurrent to boot.\nHaving impressed in two Shane Meadows' movies, This is England and Somers Town, Thomas Turgoose turns in another fine performance in the debut feature from Tom Harper. Set in a Norfolk caravan park the film follows 14-year-old David (Turgoose) and his best friend, Emily (Holliday Grainger), as they make the best of the summer while his father and her mother work on the site.\nWhat's shaping up to be a conventional coming-of-age story takes a dark turn when Emily receives word that she's going to live with her father and the pair concoct a scheme to make it appear as if she's gone missing. Things quickly spiral out of control and, while Turgoose is chillingly effective at conveying how David's attitude to the situation has changed, his character's course of action doesn't really ring true.\nThat said, for a low-budget movie it looks lovely and the performances from the two leads are commendable.

Paws-itively!\nThe culprits behind a cold, or upper respiratory infection (URI), are bacteria or viruses, sometimes both, and its symptoms can include sniffling, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, wheezing, clear to pus-like discharge around the eyes, and lethargy. Fortunately, cats can\u2019t pass their colds on to people just as we can\u2019t pass ours on to them, but they can affect every other cat in a multi-cat household.\nAlthough most of the agents that cause a URI don\u2019t survive very long (from a few hours to a few weeks) in the environment, they can last a very long time in a cat\u2019s respiratory tract, in either a latent or potent form. Many cats carry these agents inside them throughout their lives, causing them to suffer from occasional flare-ups when stressed or when their immune systems are weak. They may also pass these agents on to other cats even if they themselves aren\u2019t actively sick.\nTo help keep such paw-tential \u201cpredators\u201d at bay, keep your own cat indoors and away from other sick animals. Keep her environment scrupulously clean, and that includes clean food, clean water bowls and a clean home. Keep the temperature consistent, and if she ever gets wet, either dry her off immediately or make certain that she stays warm while she dries off. Speak to your vet about annual vaccinations to ward off such infections.\nAt the sound of your kitty\u2019s first \u201cker-choo\u201d, separate her from all of your other pets since the incubation period for these infections is between two and ten days. Then increase the humidity inside your home by either using a humidifier or by taking your snuffling sweetie into a steamy bathroom several times a day for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Make certain that her water bowl is kept clean and filled to keep her adequately hydrated. Encourage her to eat either by warming her usual food in the microwave to enhance its smell, by offering her canned instead of dry food, or by providing her with an especially tasty food that she hasn\u2019t tried before. Wipe her face, eyes and nose with a warm washcloth several times a day to clear away any mucus or other discharge while murmuring soothingly to calm her as you do.\nA minor infection will often clear up on its own, but if there\u2019s no improvement within five to seven days, bring your cat to the vet. You should, however, see the vet immediately if your cat isn\u2019t eating (cats who don\u2019t eat for even a day or two can be at risk for hepatic lipidosis, a potentially lethal liver disease), or if she\u2019s having extreme difficulty breathing.\nThe clinical signs and symptoms are generally sufficient to confirm a URI, but only diagnostic testing can determine its cause. Your vet, therefore, may recommend the following: a complete blood count to rule out blood-related conditions; chemistry tests to evaluate kidney, liver and pancreatic function, as well as sugar levels; electrolyte tests to ensure your cat isn\u2019t dehydrated or suffering from an electrolyte imbalance; urine tests to screen for a urinary tract infection and/or other diseases, and to evaluate the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, and tests for both feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).\nIn most cases, a URI can be treated successfully with a course of drug therapy \u2014 antibiotics"}
{"idx": "38910", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Public speaking is difficult for many people. When you add the sorrow of losing a loved one and the pressure of trying to honor the legacy of someone you admire, it can feel like an impossible task. Here are five tips to help you get through this difficult time and deliver a speech that will celebrate the life of your friend or family member.\n1. Get your head right.\nBefore you sit down to start writing a eulogy, it is vitally important that you are calm. Losing a loved one can trigger many strong feelings, positive and negative, which will come out in your writing as over-the-top praise, selfish anger or overwhelming sadness. Often these feelings come and go quickly, especially if your loss was unexpected. You may write one thing in the morning and not still feel the same way at the end of the day. Taking the time to work through your feelings makes writing an honest and endearing eulogy much easier.\n2. Start with a story.\nIdeally a funny one. Delivering a eulogy will always be sad and reflective, but there is no reason that the entire speech needs to be in this tone. If you start the speech with an anecdote about the person\u2019s life that is both funny and representative of the better traits of the person, you will instantly connect with the audience. Stories are also easier for people to follow because in our day-to-day interactions we almost always speak in stories, telling our friends or family what happened to us during the course of the day.\nIf you can\u2019t think of a funny story or a meaningful story about the person\u2019s life, it is also a good bet to grab and hold people\u2019s attention.\n3. Stick to the greatest hits.\nEvery situation is different, but generally speaking your eulogy shouldn\u2019t take too long. You risk losing the audience and, more importantly, failing to highlight the truly great accomplishments of the loved one you are remembering. I suggest picking the three greatest qualities of the person you are remembering and figuring out a way to highlight them in your speech with meaningful personal stories that represent these qualities.\n4. Write short simple sentences.\nDelivering a eulogy is emotional. It is easy to get choked up at points. Sometimes, your mind wanders while you are speaking. Short simple sentences will be easier to say when these difficult moments arise. They also sound better spoken out loud, when compared to a longer sentence that is likely better constructed for reading quietly.\n5. Stick to the script.\nNo one will be upset if you read from a script when you are delivering a eulogy. Style points are really a thing in this setting. Public speaking experts will tell you that you should look around the room and try and make eye contact with people, which is fine if you are comfortable doing so, but at a memorial service or a funeral people are there to honor your loved one and they want to listen to what you have to say. I suggest using a large font to help you read, printing out your speech on one-sided paper so it is easier to track your place, and numbering the papers with a colored marker in the upper right hand corner to make sure you don\u2019t get lost in in your script."}

Persistent draught and migration have led the residents to a coin a slogan: 'Gaon-gaon talab banega, tabhi humara vote milega' (Will vote only after getting ponds in ech village). The villagers have formed an outfit 'Jal Jivan Sangathan' to raise the issues.\nThe Bundelkhand region comprises 14 district of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Almost all villages in these districts face water crisis in summers. Each election sees political parties promising the people to solve their water woes, but nothing tangible has happened.\nThe Lok Vigyan Sansthan of Dehradun is running an awareness campaign in Panna district under which village-level committees -- Gram Swaraj Samiti -- have been formed. Members of village panchayats are also members of these committees. Representatives of three panchayats -- Fatepur, Birampura and Bilpura -- have decided to mount pressure on all candidates.\nKhilawan Singh, chief of Aloni village committee, said: \"We have decided to make it a mass movement to press for our demand. Our aim is to get the ponds rejuvenated through political and administrative action.\"\nThe water crisis has affected the lives of women who have to spend hours in arranging water. \"Leaders of various parties come here to ask for our vote, but no one does anything,\" said Tilak Rani, President, Roshani Mahila Mangaldal, Sonmau Kalan.\nAccording to data, Bundelkhand had 10,000 ponds some decades back, but the count has come down to around 2,000.\n\"This region is suffering from severe water crisis.

{"idx": "38912", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Enterprises need tools that work together -- even among competing products.\nCloud-based work management and collaboration tools are now considered a must-have for successful businesses. In a recent survey of business leaders, more than 80% say collaboration and work management tools are used across their entire business. It\u2019s clear that business leaders have recognized the vital role that these tools can play: collaboration is an essential driver of growth, and investing in enterprise collaboration and work management tools is critical to staying competitive.\nAnd they\u2019re not waiting to invest in these tools. Nearly half of the survey respondents said their organization was using at least six collaboration tools, and over a sixth were using more than ten. Furthermore, 95% say that collaboration tools are a \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018medium\u2019 IT investment priority for their organization in the next 12 months.\nBut what\u2019s seen by the business as a key growth accelerator is sometimes seen by workers as a nuisance. Disconnected work management tools can cause more fragmentation, making it harder for workers to find the information they need to get work done, in turn slowing down productivity, execution, and innovation.\nThe biggest problems with work management tools involve this disconnect between tools and between teams. Of the leaders surveyed, 32.8%report that the #1 employee complaint about these tools is that not everybody uses them; nearly 20% say employees feel they have too many or duplicate tools for the same tasks (which may explain why not everyone is using any given collaboration tool).\nAnother challenge facing employees: enterprise collaboration tools are not consistent across an organization. Of the IT decision makers surveyed, 83.5% reported that most of the collaboration tools in their company differ by department, and are not used across the entire organization, causing further disconnects.\nAs employees demand more connected work systems, enterprises are demanding tools that allow their employees to work seamlessly across platforms. To succeed in this landscape, vendors must provide greater interoperability among products \u2014 even those that compete fiercely in the market. For example, Microsoft Teams added an integration with Google Drive, even though Google Drive and Office 365 are competing products. Applications that connect with other workplace technologies are essential for true enterprise collaboration.\nThis is reflected in the increasing demand for work management tools that integrate with other programs. For example, since Smartsheet released an integration with Microsoft Teams in March, 2017, over 1,000 organizations have adopted the integrated platform to collaborate and keep information in context.\nThere\u2019s also an increasing demand for specifically solving for cross-team collaboration, and solution providers are rising to the challenge. Smartsheet\u2019s JIRA integration, for example, lets users automatically synchronize data on IT and software development projects. Now business users have instant visibility into what IT is doing using an intuitive, business-friendly interface and IT teams can still live in JIRA. Companies like Creative Kingdoms, who use the Smartsheet for JIRA integration, get a consistent and accurate project view in Smartsheet that\u2019s easily accessible to leadership, while keeping their software developers working in JIRA.\nAs software vendors move into an age of interoperability, a period of consolidation is likely as well. Signs of this include Atlassian\u2019s acquisition of Trello and Salesforce\u2019s acquisition of Quip. It\u2019s likely that enterprises will increasingly choose vendors with a strong business foundation to minimize potential disruption and alleviate their security and compliance concerns.\nWhat\u2019s more, enterprises will choose tools that work together, seeking interoperability among products, and giving preference to solutions that \u201cplay nice\u201d for their employees. Increasingly, IT departments will seek to connect the dots and make"}

But it could prove fatal in Michigan's general election.\nThis much is clear: You can't win a Republican primary in Michigan without Donald Trump on your side.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether any candidate embraced by Trump can survive this November's general election in a state the president carried by only a whisker in 2016, when his popularity was at its zenith.\nThat Trump's place in the hearts of Michigan's Republican voters remains secure was confirmed by Tuesday's election, in which candidates who won the president's explicit endorsement or campaigned in support of his nationalist agenda swept the GOP nominations for governor, U.S. Senate, and the US. House of Representatives.\nConversely, Republican candidates who expressed the teensiest bit of skepticism about Trump were largely swept aside, consigned to political oblivion for the duration of 45's reign.\nAdios, Brian Calley. Good to know you, Sandy Pensler.\nAnd hey, term-limited state Sen. Mike Kowall, R-White Lake, maybe Michigan Republicans aren't ready for a congressman as circumspect in his appreciation for the incumbent president's genius as you are.\nIn Kansas, Trump-endorsed firebrand Kris Kobach was clinging to a razor-thin lead in his bid to upset incumbent Republican governor Jeff Colyer for their party's gubernatorial nomination.\nIn Missouri, Josh Hawley, the conservative attorney general Trump campaigned for, easily won the Republican nomination to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill this fall.\nThose wins in Michigan, Kansas and Missouri extended the president's near-perfect record for picking GOP primary winners. As of Wednesday, he had backed the victorious candidate in at least 14 of 16 Republican primary contests held since he took office in 2017.\nBut his record in one-on-one showdowns between Republican and Democratic candidates is more problematic: When the polls opened Tuesday, Trump had backed the winner in only one of the four of those match-ups.\nTroy Balderson, the Trump-endorsed Republican in the closely watched special election for Ohio's 12th Congressional District, was leading his Democratic rival by less than a single percentage point Wednesday morning with virtually all of the votes counted. But even if Balderson holds on, the president has lost most of the inter-party fights he's picked.\nIn Michigan, Trump's endorsements of gubernatorial candidate Bill Schuette and senatorial candidate John James helped both men overcome rivals perceived to be more muted supporters of the incumbent president.\nSchuette never let GOP audiences forget that his only serious competitor, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, had withdrawn his endorsement of Trump late in 2016 after the publication of the Hollywood Access tape in which the Republican presidential nominee boasted of sexually assaulting women, even though Calley reaffirmed his support after Trump's election.\nAnd James' race against GOP businessman Sandy Pensler appeared too close to call until the final weeks of the primary campaign, when Trump's 11th-hour embrace gave James a decisive edge.\nBut now both Schuette and James enter the general election campaign as candidates closely identified with Trump and his distinctly nationalist brand of Republicanism.

Rick Crawford said the SNAP program has grown exponentially because states exploited loopholes to increase eligibility, \u201csuch as artificially making people eligible simply by mailing a TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) brochure, or substantially increasing benefits by sending a nominal LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) check.\u201d He said the legislation to impose further cuts on food stamps would also keep states from waiving work requirements established by 1996 welfare reform legislation.\n\u201cWe can't expect to continue to provide assistance to the poor if we allow abuse to bankrupt the food stamp system,\u201d Crawford argued on the House of Representatives floor.\nFudge replied to Crawford\u2019s speech by observing that 18.2 percent of his constituents are SNAP recipients. She said that in 2011, SNAP kept 4.7 million people out of poverty, including 2.1 million children, and said Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates every $1 increase in SNAP benefits generates about $1.70 in economic activity.\nLisa Hamler-Fugitt, who heads the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, says the state's charities and food pantries \u2013 which distributed $227 million in food to needy residents last year \u2013 won't be able to come up with another $190 million in food to replace today's cut in federal aid.\n\u201cWe will have to do what low-income people do, which is reduce the amount of food we hand out and ration,\u201d she said, predicting the cuts will increase hunger, forcing more school children to attend school without eating, and worsening the health of senior citizens and people with disabilities.\nShe said food stamp recipients in Ohio have received notice of the amounts their benefits will be cut, and that she has already heard complaints.\n-- The Cleveland Food Bank Help Center can help people in need find food pantries and hot meal programs.

And he looks delighted \u2014 or at least at peace.\nThere he was on Sunday morning strolling out of St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church across from Lafayette Square, across from the White House, with his square jaw framing a smile and his salt-and-pepper hair neat but not perfect. He filed out of church with the other congregants, some of them in baseball caps and cowboy hats, sweatshirts and lumberjack plaid. But in his white shirt and dark pinstriped suit with a discreet tie, Mueller looked like himself \u2014 or at least the version that we have gotten to know, a man who would not come to work or come to Jesus without a tie.\nIt was early on Mueller\u2019s day of rest, and the attorney general had yet to release the principal conclusions from Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year-long Russia investigation. But no matter. The TV pundits and anchors were already on air guessing and prognosticating and vamping until there was actual news to report. Photographers were outside St. John\u2019s, and they were doing their best to frame Mueller with the White House in the background \u2014 such irresistible symbolism, after all. But Mueller seemed unwilling to cooperate. He was in proximity of the White House but he remained as disconnected as could be. His gaze was cast away from it. He was looking forward, not back. He was a man walking off into a sunny day, a man patiently waiting for tour buses to pass, for traffic to clear, as he made his way to his car alongside his wife, Ann.\nMueller still has not spoken in public. We have only the pictures to tell us the story of his moods. How are you feeling, Mr. Mueller? You look smashing and so surely, you must feel swell.\nFor so long, the only pictures of Mueller were those of him looking like the consummate professional, the man in the crisp white shirt, the dark suit and tie. His expression was neutral. He was sharp, but he was also a cipher. He was not a man prone to flashes of sartorial exoticisms. There was nothing to parse other than he looked the part of an FBI man \u2014 a government man. That was the image ingrained in our fevered brain \u2014 a no-nonsense, imperturbable fella.\nHe was respected and ballyhooed. Derided and dismissed. Mueller\u2019s look was reassuring mostly because it accurately reflected his demeanor. His clothes didn\u2019t peacock and neither did he. And for this, we were grateful. He was the calm in the storm of leaks and Tweets.\nWhether one viewed Mueller as an avenging angel or a relentless witch hunter, his clothes said he was Mueller: righteous seeker of facts.\nOn Thursday, however, the story took a turn. The public saw a very different Mueller than it had grown accustomed to.\nThat picture was the last the public saw of Mueller before he turned in his report. It was the final image of the investigator investigating. And if there was one startling aspect it was that Mueller looked so regular, so relatable. In all those other photographs, the ones that basically all looked the same except for the color of the tie \u2014 red or blue \u2014 Mueller came across like a spy novel version of super prosecutor \u2014 such a perfect specimen of a law man that if he had been crafted by Hollywood, audiences would have rejected him as too pat.\nBut in his baseball"}

Chief Visionary? Chief Cheerleader? Chief Salesman? Chief Funding Officer? Chief Communications Officer? Chief Team Builder? Chief Lightbulb Changer? Chief Coffee Maker? Yup, all of these titles apply to the role of a startup CEO.\nIt is perhaps one of the hardest jobs to do in the business world, given the wide range of skills required to excel. This is one of the reasons only 1-in-10 startups actually succeed, as it takes a really special person that has the right combination of skills and startup DNA.\nThe first two points herein really go hand in hand. In order to create the clear vision, you need to have a good sense of what is going on in the industry and with competition. That is really the first step to building a winning business plan. It is not enough to say, \u201cwe are building a great travel website\u201d, as there are tons of travel websites out there.\nYou must shape the vision in a way it is more unique and competitive than current solutions in the market. My previous startup, iExplore, positioned itself as a niche killer for adventure travel (compared to the general online travel agencies like Expedia).\nWithin the adventure travel sector, iExplore marketed \u201cprivately-guided, made to order\u201d tours (compared to the traditional packaged group tours with set itineraries) at a price point 25 percent less than similar tours being offered (leveraging the cost efficiencies of the internet, compared to brick and mortar agents).\nThis vision for the business created a unique product in the market place, which consumers ultimately flocked to with over one million unique visitors per month.\nBut, the CEO\u2019s job is not done after setting the initial vision. He or she must stay on top of those competitive trends to navigate the ship over time. For example, after 9/11/01, iExplore needed to evolve from a travel agent of other tour operators\u2019 trips, into an iExplore branded tour operator of its own, in an effort to get bigger margins on the bottom line during a difficult economic climate.\nAnd, at the same time, iExplore opened up a whole new revenue stream from online advertising, to get the company to profitability. It is the CEO\u2019s job to constantly watch these kinds of economic, industry or competitive movements over time, and to respond accordingly to keep the ship afloat.\nAnother job of the CEO is to make sure all employees are clear on the vision, and that all staff are sailing in the same direction. In the iExplore example for adventure travel, you can\u2019t have your tech guy building a cruise seller, your operating guy building a hotel seller and your finance guy building an airfare seller.\nEveryone is building an adventure travel seller, and the CEO\u2019s job is to make sure all staff have contributed in building that vision, so all players are on the same page as to what they are building. Therefore, the CEO is not only the communicator of the vision, the CEO is the consensus builder for that vision.\nYou will never be successful if your team does not buy into the vision, or if they feel their good ideas for improving the vision are not being listened to. Then once everyone is firmly on board, keep them clearly focused on the goal.\nOnce the vision is set and being maintained over time, now comes execution. One of the key execution requirements for any startup CEO is to be its Chief Evangelist. This includes cheerleading the staff, from top to bottom"}

Maybe even two.\nA 30-16 loss to a lackluster Bengals team capped off a rocky week for the silver and black that started with the firing of 2016 NFL Executive of the Year Reggie McKenzie. A lawsuit, lease proposal withdrawal and indefinite suspension followed, and now the Raiders are left with two games, one of which could be the last ever in Oakland next Monday night against the Broncos.\nIf you missed Sunday\u2019s loss to the Bengals in front of a stadium about 40 percent full, nobody would blame you. But maybe you still want to catch up on what happened.\nHere are three players who improved their stock and three who hurt it in a largely meaningless Week 15 game.\nDaniel Carlson: The Raiders\u2019 rookie kicker continues staking his claim to be the team\u2019s long-term option at the position. Jon Gruden said again after the game he hopes that\u2019s the case. Carlson, cut by the Vikings after just two weeks despite being the first kicker taken in the draft, went 3-for-3 on field goals against the Bengals. He hit from 27, 40 and 50 yards, his 50-yarder tying a career high. Carlson is now 13-of-14 on field goals with the Raiders after going 1-of-4 with the Vikings and 0-for-3 in the Week 2 tie that got him cut. Carlson\u2019s only miss with the Raiders came Week 9, when he banged a 45-yarder off the right upright early in the fourth quarter of a 31-3 game against the 49ers. He\u2019s also hit all 15 extra points.\nErik Harris: The Raiders\u2019 28-year-old safety tallied the first interception of his career Sunday when cut cut off a Jeff Driskel deep ball that probably would\u2019ve gone for a touchdown. Driskel targeted speedy wideout John Ross, who had Gareon Conley beat down the middle of the field. Harris cut across from Conley\u2019s left, slightly bobbled the ball but ultimately corralled it at his own 5-yard line before getting up and diving forward for a yard. Harris\u2019 pick was the Raiders\u2019 11th interception of the season. They only had five picks all of 2017. Harris joked after the game, since he kept the ball, that he has to keep it away from his two twin sons since they\u2019ll be running around the house with it.\nJordy Nelson: Not too long ago it seemed the 33-year-old Nelson had little to nothing left in the tank. From Week 6-Week 12, he played in five games and caught only five passes for 36 yards and no touchdowns. In three games since, Nelson still doesn\u2019t have a touchdown catch, but he\u2019s caught a combined 22 balls for 233 yards. Against the Bengals, Nelson led the way with six catches for 88 yards on eight targets, including a 44-yard gain that would\u2019ve been a touchdown if Derek Carr had led Nelson instead of underthrowing him.\nGareon Conley: On the Bengals\u2019 first touchdown drive, Conley allowed a "}

{"idx": "38942", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: If you ignore the occasional surprises that roil the market and focus instead on its long-term behavior, you'll find corporate earnings and interest rates are key.\nOver periods of five years or more, stock prices closely track corporate profit growth. The longer the stretch of time, the more important earnings trends are. Since World War II, an estimated 90% of the stock market's gain has come from profit growth. As profits add up over time, the scale tips and prices rise, regardless of how investors have voted in any given day, month or year.\nIn the short run, changes in interest rates can be more important than earnings. When rates go up, all other things being equal, investors tend to pull money out of stocks and put it into bonds and other fixed-income investments because the returns there are so attractive.\nThat brings stock prices down, and sends bond prices higher. On the other hand, when interest rates come down again, then investors tend to shift money into stocks, reversing the previous trend.\nWhat is a price/earnings (P/E) ratio?\nThe actual P/E calculation is easy: Just divide the current price per share by earnings per share.\nBut what number should you use for earnings per share? The sum of the past four quarters? Estimates for next year?\nThere is no right answer. The P/E based on the past four quarters provides the most accurate reflection of the current valuation, because those earnings have already been booked.\nBut investors are always looking ahead, so most also pay attention to estimates, which also are widely available at financial websites.\nWall Street analysts generally compute earnings-per-share estimates for the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year and use those estimates to assign a P/E, though there is no guarantee that the company will meet those estimates.\nThe P/E can't tell you whether to buy or sell. It is merely a gauge to tell you whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. Assuming they have the same total shares outstanding, is a $100 stock more expensive than a $50 stock?\nNot exactly. Where valuation is concerned, price is dictated by expectations of future performance. If the earnings of the higher-priced company are growing considerably faster than the other, the higher price may be justified.\nWhat's an appropriate P/E? Different types of stocks win different valuations. Generally, the market pays up for growth or enormous profitability. Consider a slow-growing industrial conglomerate and a tech company with fat profit margins and enormous growth potential.\nThe market will typically reward the second company with a higher P/E.\nWhat is a PEG ratio?\nTo quickly compare P/Es and growth rates, use the PEG ratio -- the P/E (based on estimates for the current year) divided by the long-term growth rate. A company with a P/E of 36 and a growth rate of 20% has a PEG of 1.8.\nIn general, you want a stock with a PEG that's close to 1.0 (or lower), which means it is trading in line with its growth rate. But for a quality company, you can pay more.\nAlso, don't get excited by rock-bottom P/Es -- some companies are doomed to low valuations. One group the market tends to penalize is cyclicals, companies whose performance rises and falls with the economy.\nWhat is a Price/Sales ratio?\nJust as investors like to know how much they're paying for earnings, it's also useful to know how much they're paying for revenue (the terms \"sales\" and \"revenue"}

Is there any way I can test my motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply before I order a new video card? As per your suggestion I have used Prime95 in the past but Windows does not seem to be stable.

Bowe Bergdahl (center) arrives at the military courtroom facility for a sentencing hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Friday.\nA military judge has ruled that Bowe Bergdahl, who has pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, should serve no prison time.\nDuring a hearing Friday in Fort Bragg, N.C., Bergdahl was sentenced to dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of $1,000 in pay per month and a reduction in rank from sergeant to private, according to a statement from the Army.\nThe judge, Col. Jeffery Nance, had wide discretion in determining a sentence for Bergdahl, who walked off his military post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was held by the Taliban for five years. He could have given him anything from no prison time to life in prison.\nProsecutors had been seeking 14 years in prison, while defense lawyers had asked for no prison time and a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge.\n\"The judge didn't explain his reasoning; he didn't explain the mitigating factors,\" NPR's Frank Morris reported from the court.\nThe military court heard testimony from three current and former service members who were wounded while searching for Bergdahl. Prosecutors argued that he deserved a significant prison sentence because those service members were injured as a result of his actions; the defense said that he did not intend for anyone to get hurt and that it was the Taliban that actually injured them.\nIn a tweet after the sentencing, President Trump said, \"The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\nTrump's comments on Bergdahl have been a factor in the case. While on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed. He highlighted those comments again at a recent press briefing, on the same day that Bergdahl pleaded guilty to the charges.\nThat led Bergdahl's defense to file a motion to dismiss, saying that Trump's remarks amounted to unlawful command influence. Nance ultimately decided that he wouldn't throw out the case, saying that he was \"completely unaffected\" by the remarks and would still be able to rule fairly.\nBergdahl's dishonorable discharge strips him of his veteran's benefits. However, as Frank reported, that will automatically go to appeal with another military judge. That judge is able to mitigate the existing sentence, Frank said, but is not allowed to impose a harsher one.\n\"I was sitting in back of Bowe Bergdahl. He was stressed, he often looks stressed though,\" Frank said. \"You could see a big vein snaking across his temple. He was trembling a little bit after the sentence was announced.\"\nBergdahl has been stationed at a base in San Antonio, and Frank says that now he has \"a job waiting for him at an animal shelter in San Antonio. ...He's earned a reputation as someone who is amazingly good with feral cats.\""}

Makwetu went on to say that TVET colleges continued to struggle to account for their finances. Makwetu said, \" For instance, of the 48 colleges audited by the AGSA, only three received clean audits, compared to nine in the previous year. Questions should be asked about the potential loss of money through the poor management of assets, revenue and debtors at these colleges at a time when funding is desperately needed for tertiary education. \"\nThe Auditor - General also said that the IDT received a disclaimed opinion for the third year in a row and the SABC regressed from an adverse opinion to a disclaimed opinion. Only the DBSA \u2013 which was audited by the AGSA for the first time \u2013 obtained a clean audit opinion.\n\"At national level there was a regression in audit outcomes, with the number of clean audits decreasing to 23 % of the total audited population. Audit outcomes of 43 auditees improved, however they are overshadowed by the 73 that regressed from the previous year,\" the Auditor General said during his presentation.\nHe added that in 2019, the Auditor - General's office will be releasing reports focused on some of the key government programs such as education and infrastructure.\n\"The quality of the performance reports slightly improved to 65% of the auditees now publishing credible reports. However, the AGSA received performance reports for auditing with substantial misstatements. Departments of education, health and public works continued to have the poorest results of all \u2013 33% of these departments received qualified opinions (compared to only 16% of the other departments).

And fiscal constraints will prevent country authorities from boosting growth through public spending alone\u201d.\nThe outlook remains vulnerable to changes in oil prices and the global outlook, and to geopolitical developments.\nU.S. interest rates have risen, and tighter and more volatile global financial conditions could increase borrowing costs for MENAP oil importers and their banks, adding to fiscal sustainability concerns, weighing on bank balance sheets, and undermining private sector activity.\n\u201cSuch tightening could be particularly challenging for countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Tunisia, which will be competing for funds in international markets,\u201d, the IMF Regional Outlook observed."}

When home in the United States, both Melania and the president are tight-lipped when it comes to bringing Barron\u2019s name up in public.\nThe media has a tendency to twist almost anything that both Melania and the president say, so by staying mum about Barron, it\u2019s the simplest way to protect him from being the subject of a misconstrued news article. It was when President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were posing for photos in Israel that a voice from behind had some nice and encouraging words for the visiting dignitaries.\nThe very gracious and handsome son of Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his thoughts on a subject that hit very close to home for Melania and Donald Trump. Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stepped into the picture to say how he can relate to what Barron Trump has gone through since being thrust into the limelight as the president\u2019s son. You can see and hear the conversation in the video below.\nFor a few moments there, Yair Netanyahu bonded with Melania while explaining how his plight as the son of a world leader mirrored what he\u2019s seen Barron go through as a child of a president. Prime Minister Netanyahu did the introductions of his family to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. This is when Yair Netanyahu opened up to both Donald and Melania about understanding the difficult time Barron is facing with his father being the president of the United States.\nDuring this stop in Israel, both President Trump and Melania were able to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family without an interpreter being involved. The Netanyahu family seem to speak very fluent English, making conversations a bit more relaxed. Opposing Views calls this impromptu discussion a \u201crare personal interaction\u201d that took place just as Trump and Netanyahu were getting ready for a press conference.\nThe conversation was on a personal level and it gave a little insight into the mindset of these two powerful families and how their children\u2019s treatment in the press caused them much angst. Hearing these two sets of parents, along with Yair, talking about this very real problem seemed to lend evidence to the many reasons that children of politicians should be off-limits to the media and entertainment outlets. The effects are long-lasting and when the kids grow into adults, this is something they don\u2019t forget.\nTrump summed up Prime Minister Netanyahu and his wife as \u201cgreat parents.\u201d Pointing to Yair he said, \u201cLook how he turned out. \u201d As the world of politics dictates, these two busy men had somewhere to be and the time came when it was obvious that Prime Minister Netanyahu needed to wrap it up and move on to the next point of business, which was the press conference with President Trump."}

On May 31, 1918, the Renault FT a French light tank was first deployed in battle. The 30 tanks sent against two German infantry divisions advancing in the sector bordering Ploisy and Chazelles caused havoc, crippling the German attack. Yet, this was not the first use of tanks; that had happened two years earlier.\nSo what changed? Earlier tanks were lumbering, heavy and slow; they could be picked off by artillery. In contrast, the Renault FT was light, and it had a significantly superior power-to-weight ratio, rendering it fast and maneuverable. It was the first to have a gun mounted on a rotating turret, crew space in the front, and an engine at the rear, innovations in use to this day. For all these reasons, it is rightfully considered the forerunner of the modern tank.\nThe terrible loss of life in WWI was not enough to prevent the devastation of the Second. War\u2019s horrors also advanced culminating in the ultimate. Nuclear weapons, and their capacity to destroy life as we know it, have prevented conflict between major powers ever since. Moreover, the haves endeavor to stop nascent nuclear states (Iran) from acquiring the same, or curb increases (North Korea).\nThus we have Kim Jong Un\u2019s right hand, General Kim Yong Chol, visiting the U.S. for talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The General arrived in New York and made Pompeo travel up from Washington. The dinner and get-together on Wednesday were followed by extensive talks on Thursday in preparation for the Singapore summit \u2026 certain once again, as anything can be with the mercurial Mr. Trump.\nThe dinner photos released show the parties with an affable Pompeo and a dour Kim in a room painted yellow. Should color matter? How important is it? Very, it turns out, according to the leading color theorist of the 20th century.\nFaber Birren (1900-1988) spent his life studying color, and advocating its proper use for effect and well-being. He thought of it as akin to religion in its power to heal and change our feelings. According to him, humans are born with certain responses to color, just as they are with a fear of snakes.\nBirren\u2019s fascination with color began early. After two years at the University of Chicago, he dropped out in 1921 to focus on his absorbing interest. Soon he began writing articles on color, and in 1928 published his first book \u201cColor in Vision\u201d. He was to write seventeen of them and numerous articles. His experimentation and exploration yielded financial rewards when he began offering his services as a consultant.\nAt a Chicago wholesale meat business he noticed the white walls of the coolers gave the meat a gray look. Testing meat under different lighting, he determined a blue-green backdrop made the cuts appear more red. Sales shot up and his business career was launched.\nHe went on eventually to advise Walt Disney in the making of Bambi, Fantasia and Pinocchio. In industry, he developed a code for safety: yellow for falling hazards, red for fire protection and so on. His work is evident in many other spheres.\nHospital operating rooms are now blue-green; office walls darker than the machines reduce irritability in the staff and improve attentiveness.

The team then measured static (at 2,000 rpm and 4,000 rpm) and dynamic horsepower (the engine revs to redline like a normal dyno test) to see how premium fuel affects engine output.\nUltimately, the results show that the Escalade with cylinder deactivation functioning and the EcoBoost F-150 (two heavy vehicles powered by small engines) saw the biggest fuel economy benefit when ascending the grades, and the Audi A3 actually started knocking. And as for horsepower readings, increases are mostly moderate, though the EcoBoost F-150 gained 11 horsepower.\nThere is not a clear case where premium gasoline is beneficial from a cost perspective. In most cases, the extra cost of premium over regular does not result in a positive return on investment (lower cost to drive a given distance). However, there are instances \u2013 and they vary widely by vehicle type and model \u2013 where the use of premium gasoline can be marginally beneficial.\nIf you hear knocking, definitely use premium. If you tow a lot, or do a lot of \u201cspirited driving,\u201d then maybe you should consider premium; AAA recommends that you experiment to find out.\nEarlier this week, Mini rolled out its new logo, which looks like a more \u201ctwo dimensional\u201d version of the current one that has been around since the brand was acquired by BMW for its 2001 relaunch.\nThere is an especially striking similarity with the signet introduced for the classic Mini in the mid-1990s\ufeff...[back in 1990] there was... a return to traditional logo design and a focus on the sporting merits of the classic Mini.

An enormous \"sword of Damocles\" hangs over all markets now. A massive liquidity drain is underway as global QE reverses into QT and rates rise against the background of immense ubiquitous crippling debt burdens. What this means is that the biggest credit crunch of all time is bearing down on us, which will involve markets crashing in the absence of bids, serious dislocation of capital markets and out of control interest rates.\nThis is probably the high point for Trump's presidency as the stock market enjoys its final \"swansong rally\" ahead of the crash, buoyed up the last of the stock buybacks before rising rates choke them off, and the dumbest of the dumb money who think that because the market has been in an uptrend for years it's going to continue.\nThe Fed has been playing a stealth game for a long time now, gradually but steadily raising rates and hoping that the market won't notice, and also furtively offloading its Treasury hoard, and other central banks are following the Fed's lead and doing likewise. The liquidity that drove the massive bubbles in real estate and stock markets is being pulled. That must inevitably lead to these markets dropping, and we are already seeing the start of it with the Emerging Markets plunging and hitherto red hot real estate markets cooling. When punters realize that the game is over, the decline is likely to become disorderly and involve a number of crash phases.\nThe Fed is always behind the curve and reactive. It has been undermining the markets for over a year now with its raising of interest rates and now QT, so when the markets buckle and cave in, it won't be \"something out of the blue\" or an \"Act of God\" as the mainstream media will inevitably portray it; it is eminently predictable, and slated to happen soon. The reason that the Fed and other central banks are raising rates and withdrawing liquidity is that they know there is another mammoth crisis looming, and they are scrambling to buffer themselves ahead of it, by giving themselves \"wiggle room\" to lower rates, and scaling back their massive holdings of Treasury paper, etc. The trouble is that it's a very delicate balancing act, and they are inevitably overplaying their hand to the extent that their actions will bring about the crisis that they are seeking to avoid, or at least get ahead of.\nWhen you get up in the morning, you know that no matter how bright and strong the sun is around midday, night must later follow. In the same way bull markets are followed by bear markets, with the consolidation and contraction in the bear market phase of the market cycle being necessary to strip out excess and waste and cull the weak and inefficient.

The tempered glass remained intact and no injuries were reported.\nTown police were in the vicinity of Roots when the first call was received and immediately responded. Employees advised they were inside cleaning when they heard the popping sound but the restaurant was closed to customers, Greer said.\nTown detectives are investigating and both scenes were processed by the crime scene unit of the Morris County Sheriff's Department. Police believe both businesses were damaged by a \"BB-type\" projectile, Greer said.\nPolice are requesting assistance with the ongoing investigation.

It remains unknown how many of these were in fact Democrat-leaning groups, partly because individual names cannot be publicly released under IRS confidentiality laws.\nThe IRS did reveal there had been an explosion in groups of all political persuasion seeking to qualify for this type of tax exemption after a relaxation in campaign finance rules meant this would also allow them to keep the identity of their donors secret. In total 3,357 applications were made in 2012 compared with 1,735 in 2010 before the law changed.\nDemocrats on the committee seized on the new data and said it revealed the hidden story behind the IRS scandal - that political parties were exploiting the tax code to hide their donors.\n\"There isn't a single person up here [on this committee] who doesn't understand what is going on here and what it says about the hidden nature of political donations,\" said Marcy Kaptur of Ohio. \"This is what demands serious attention by the IRS.\"\nKaptur praised \"some smart people in the IRS\" for \"doing their job\" and trying to use overt political affiliations to screen out non-profits that might be fund-raising groups in disguise, although she said there was insufficient clarity in the law about what classed as political activity.\nActing IRS commissioner Danny Werfel told the committee he had launched a comprehensive review to restore trust in the agency because \"the use of certain political labels resulted in some applications being inappropriately singled out\".\n\"The agency stands ready to confront the problems that occurred, hold accountable those who acted inappropriately, be open about what happened and permanently fix these problems so that such mis-steps do not occur again,\" he said. \"We need to show the utmost fairness and impartiality \u2026 and there was a fundamental failure [to do this] by the IRS management.\"\nBut Republican critics saw his testimony and that of treasury inspector general J Russell George as more evidence to support their view that the practice amounted, at best, to inadvertent political bias and may even have been sanctioned by the Democratic administration.\nMario Diaz-Balart of Florida said: \"When government targets individuals for their beliefs this is an affront for democracy and an attack our freedoms.

The same thing appears to be happening to the United States and, indeed, our planet while we delay and hesitate on climate solutions.\nAs extreme weather, floods and droughts are becoming the norm around the globe, debate on the reality of the climate crisis is obstructing forward action on climate solutions. This paralysis also enables the continued expansion and development of our existing carbon-based energy model and its ensuing components, including pipelines. This fact is clearly demonstrated by our seemingly perpetual indecisiveness on the building of the Keystone XL pipeline.\nLet\u2019s not worry at this moment about our children\u2019s children.

Climate change presents an incredible and exciting opportunity to change the course we are on, but we need to move quickly. Scientists all over the world tell us time is of the essence.\nWe need an energy revolution with all hands on deck, a Manhattan Project that begins with a retooling of where and how we get our energy. It will create jobs, advance our economy and build a cleaner, safer, more stable world, while at the same time putting us on a path to heal our planet. As Obama said in his nomination acceptance speech, if we are willing to work for it, \u201cWe will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment\u2026when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\u201d This moment seems to be at hand. The question is: Is the president willing to lead?\nLast week, the State Department released it\u2019s final report outlining the environmental impact of the Keystone XL pipeline, and concluded that rejecting the pipeline\u2019s development would not make a significant dent in stalling climate change. Secretary of State John Kerry and President Obama now face a key decision: by either approving or disapproving this pipeline, they have an opportunity to \u201cstand up and be counted\u201d as seminal figures who help bolster momentum for a renewable energy future.\nOn Feb. 3, people across the country \u201cstood up\u201d to be counted in protest of the Keystone XL.

I visited the Alberta oil sands in July of 2011.

I took my children with me, to watch me get arrested for the first and, so far, only time in my life. Three months later, with my children and my husband at my side, we once again went to Washington to join hands with thousands of individuals, circling the White House to ask the president to say no to this particular pipeline. My children were with me on Feb. 3 in Union Square in New York City, where Bill McKibben and other leaders of the Climate Movement demanded action on the climate crisis, which includes saying no to the Keystone XL pipeline project in a definitive way.\nBuilding more pipelines and infrastructure only keeps us addicted to fossil fuels, propelling us to a place where scientists tell us we can\u2019t go.

Dido works with her brother and Faithless founder Rollo Armstrong throughout most of the album, and that collaboration brings about an agreeable mix of electronic music and more organic modern pop.\nNothing earth-shattering here.
