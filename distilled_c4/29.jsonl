Not so when it comes to women. The rough-and-tumble world of high finance remains among the handful of industries that have not figured out how to retain the top-flight talent they spend bundles to attract.\nAccording to data provided by nine leading Wall Street banks to The New York Times this year, women, on average, made up 33 percent of analysts, a job filled mostly by those just out of college. Women represent 25 percent of associates (those with M.B.A.\u2019s) and 14 percent of managing directors.\nThe reasons are, of course, complicated. Wall Street is among those industries not conducive to a balance between work and life, a critical factor for many women in their 30s and 40s.

Georeferencing, image processing by Field Museum Staff.\nThe site of Beaubien Forest Preserve in 1938.\nSandwiched between the Bishop Ford Expressway and the Little Calumet River and within sight (and occasionally smell) of two landfills, Beaubien Forest Preserve is an unlikely swath of wet prairies and old-growth oak trees amid the industrial patchwork of Chicago\u2019s far Southeast Side.\nEach month Laura Milkert, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County Site Steward for Beaubien, leads volunteers on workdays to help maintain the Preserve\u2019s 135 acres. On Saturday they practiced a kind of eco-time travel, removing invasive species that have crowded out native species like white and burr oaks, redtop grass and rough blazing star. The goal is to restore a habitat that more closely resembles the area\u2019s original prairies and wetlands.\nThough 209 native plant species have been identified at Beaubien, biodiversity has plummeted since invasives took root. Native species like big bluestem grass and buttonbush are not just visually appealing \u2014 they hold the soil against erosion and harbor wildlife. Biodiversity in prairie systems can have a dramatic impact on an ecosystem&apos;s properties.\nIn January, of course, those iconic (and exquisitely named) wildflower species would not be visible anyway, but the frozen ground afforded the volunteers a chance to clear away the invasive species that have colonized Beaubien without trampling the rest of the forest floor.\nThe invasives are the usual suspects for Northeast Illinois: buckthorn and honeysuckle, mostly. The shrubs grow voraciously, crowding out sunlight otherwise destined for young oaks and other native plants. Volunteers sawed and hacked through the plants\u2019 spindly branches, leaving oaks and other native species intact. They piled the brush onto a bonfire and applied herbicide selectively to the stumps of cleared invasives.\nOnce an important stop on the underground railroad, Beaubien is situated directly east of Altgeld Gardens, the neighborhood where Barack Obama got his start as a community organizer. Maintaining the forest preserve is community work, too, according to Milkert.\n\u201cThe story of Beaubien is it\u2019s a real collective effort,\u201d she said.

The iPhone and the iPad, which since 2007 have made even the phrase \u201ccomputer\u201d obsolete and put entertainment on the road.\nBut that success was achieved by Jobs letting Pixar creative boss John Lasseter and some talented filmmakers loose on an unsuspecting Hollywood.

You have been able to take films and television and books out of the home and on the road for some time but the iPad convinced people that they really needed to have that ability at their fingertips on a 24/7 basis.\nIt was often Jobs who did the sales job.

Paisley, the Jerry Falwell of right-wing, evangelical Protestantism in Northern Ireland.\nRemember Bernadette Devlin, James Chichester-Clark, Gerry Fitt, William Whitelaw, William Craig, and Brian Faulkner? These were the names, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, that captured headlines when the ``troubles'' of Northern Ireland erupted in 1969.\nToday, in Northern Ireland, they are only names in the history books. But not Ian Paisley.\nLeader of the hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, Mr. Paisley is a scourge of the British government, b^ete noire of Northern Ireland Catholics, and an irritant, if not outright embarrassment, to many moderate Protestants. He has been branded a bigot and a fascist, even by many Protestants.\nYet many Protestants who say they would not vote for Paisley often feel that he speaks for them when speaking out against the Anglo-Irish agreement. Most Protestants, known as ``unionists,'' favor continuing the tie between the province and Britain. After the accord was signed last November, it was thought Paisley was being overtaken politically by his more hard-line deputy, Peter Robinson. But Mr. Robinson lost ground, because he failed to distance himself enough from Protestant extremist violence.\nIn a curious way, Paisley -- the traditionally militant Protestant -- is now viewed as a moderate.\nEven some middle-of-the-road Protestants who previously ignored Paisley now wonder if he may be the only viable political game in town. Such a development, observers say, is symptomatic of the slide to the far right in Northern Irish politics.\nDespite his attacks on the institution of the Catholic Church, demographers say that Paisley's huge majorities could not be possible unless some Catholics were voting for him. This could be a reflection on his tireless constituency work.\nTo the British, who Paisley contends have never really understood Northern Ireland, his language and attacks on the church often comes across as archaic and crude. He has never left his audiences in any doubt of his views on the Irish Republic and the Catholic Church. Both are the ``enemy,'' he told a recent Democratic Unionist rally at Lisburn, near Belfast.\nPaisley's unabashed attacks on the Catholic Church are an anathema to the British government, which seeks reconciliation in Northern Ireland.\nAt one time, London would have preferred to see Paisley quietly disappear from the political scene. Not anymore.\nThe possibility that he might be overtaken by more-extreme Protestant elements now frightens the British government. The conventional political wisdom among British officials is that Paisley -- and his more moderate partner, the leader of the Official Unionists, James Molyneaux -- must be saved at all costs if the paramilitaries are to be controlled.\nYet neither Britain nor Paisley and Mr. Molyneaux have found an acceptable formula to negotiate the way out of the impasse. Britain won't scrap or suspend the Anglo-Irish agreement, but unless it does, Molyneaux and Paisley refuse to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government. Paisley contends that Mrs. Thatcher must eventually come to recognize the political writing on the wall."}

Answer the questions based on what you have read.\nIf you had your choice, would you rather sit in an office all day to make a living or work from the comfort of your own home? Nowadays, more and more businesses are allowing employees to work at least part of the week from home. The idea of \u201ctelecommuting\u201d isn\u2019t that new and for many it\u2019s been technically possible since the Internet became widely accessible. Some employers, however, have been less willing to allow the practice for fear that employees who were not being watched would become lazy and undisciplined. Actually, recent evidence has shown that these fears are mostly unwarranted and that businesses can actually save a lot of money on rent by converting more of their staff over to telecommuters.\nIn a normal telecommuting situation, a worker will be given assignments and asked to complete them or report on them, as in any other office job. The major difference is that most communication is done using the telephone, email and instant messaging. Some employers allow workers to choose which hours they will work, others require them to be online during a normal work day. Either way, most telecommuters have the freedom to work from home or wherever else they would like.\nYet telecommuters often find that their freedom comes with a cost. Those who work outside the office may discover that their employers are more willing to ask them to work long or strange hours. In situations where there are other family members at home, it can be difficult to keep work life and home life separate. Other chores around the house can also serve as distractions, and there\u2019s the matter of getting office supplies like printers and desks. Working at a coffee shop or a library may be a solution, but some locations put time limits on Internet use. Sometimes employees actually take a room in their house and convert it over to a home office \u2014 this can be quite helpful in creating an ideal working environment and provides the added benefit of a few dollars back in the bank when tax time comes around.\nThe benefits to employer and employee seem clear \u2014 surveys show that the ability to work from home is interesting to possible employees. The one thing that has not been perfected yet is the work meeting. Holding a meeting on the phone or over the computer is not as effective as meeting in person because it can be difficult to converse with a group without seeing the people you are talking to.

I now do a lot of Chinese cooking and many of the recipes specify peanut oil.

By comparison, safflower oil contains 74 percent and 9 percent, sunflower 64 percent and 10 percent, and corn oil 58 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Clearly, to increase polyunsaturates, peanut oil is not the best choice. Whether you decide to use another variety will depend on how much oil is called for in a particular recipe, and on the importance of flavor. In our experience, substituting an oil with greater amounts of polyunsaturates in a dish generously seasoned with garlic, onions and other spicy ingredients typical of Chinese cooking will have little impact on flavor.\nBecause you are interested in dietary modifications to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, you might want to consult a new pamphlet produced by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

But the nutrients the manufacturers chose to add varied somewhat. All brands were made with enriched flour, which means that the thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and iron lost during refining were restored. In addition, all the waffles contained a ''second helping'' of these nutrients, augmenting what was present in the wheat from which they were milled. That alone qualified them for the ''fortified'' tag.\nBeyond that, for reasons that remain unclear, two brands also had vitamin A added, and one of those two had vitamin B-6 (a nutrient lost in refining and generally not restored), and vitamin B-12, a nutrient not found in plant foods.\nThe products we examined were made with whey rather than milk. Some contained more calcium than others, but none compared to the amount in waffles made from scratch or from a mix prepared with milk.\nFor kids on the run, waffles that can be popped quickly into the toaster for a quick breakfast are fine, especially if washed down with a glass of milk.

Those reasons include discussing the character and reputation of individuals, conducting a strategy session to prepare for negotiations with nonunion personnel -- the president-elect in this case -- and to comply with any general or special law such as state privacy laws.\nThe Open Meeting Law says that state and municipal governmental bodies must hold their meetings in public with certain exemptions.\nThe law includes 10 reasons for a public body to meet in executive session.\nConnolly said trustees did not use the purpose for an executive session in the Open Meeting Law that specifically guides interviews of job applicants.\nInstead, they used the three other purposes, which were applicable to the session, he said.\nNo interviews with finalists were held in open session.\nBefore the full board meeting, a separate public body \u2013 the 21-member search committee \u2013 met in closed session with each of the three candidates at a downtown Boston hotel.

While she lost out on the role to Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner, there was concept art drawn up to showcase the Neon Demon actress embodying the role. Whether it was because the artist really liked Fanning in the role, or if negotiations were further along than the public ever knew, this art has recently been released to the internet, and you can see it below for your own curiosity.\nGregory Hopwood, a costume assistant on X-Men: Apocalypse, shared this photo from Alan Villanueva's early concept art from the film's design phases, and it's rather interesting as it's closer to one of Jean Grey's actual comic outfits. As you can see the image below, the actual costume that Sophie Turner wore in the final film maintains the color scheme that Villanueva's original design shows off. However, the Fanning variant has two big differences.\nThe first big difference between the final X-Men: Apocalypse costume and the concept presented above is the lack of a facial component. With Elle Fanning's Jean Grey, the costume extends upward with chin and cheek guards, and a headband component to cap it all off. Sophie Turner's version of the costume did not have any facial or cranial features to speak of.\nSecond, and more importantly, the final design of Jean Grey's costume, much like the rest of the uniforms for the X-Men in X-Men: Apocalypse, look more like like standard big budget jumpsuits for superheroes. Meanwhile, Fanning's potential costume looks more like a comic ready costume that foregoes realism for more of a fantastic look. Take a look at the final Turner variation from X-Men: Apocalypse in the photo below, for comparison.\nIf only X-Men: Apocalypse had embraced the more comic book elements of its source material, it might have seemed more excited to tell the story it settled on. But then again, Bryan Singer's approach to the X-Men series has always been more anchored in a sense of realism, so to have embraced such an approach would have required a wild deviation from the current formula and/or a director different than Singer at the helm. At the very least, Singer can be considered consistent, above any other problems folks had with X-Men: Apocalypse.\nX-Men: Apocalypse will be available on Digital HD on September 9th, with the Blu-ray / DVD release set for October 4th."}

Unlike other federal employees affected by the shutdown, active-duty coastguardsmen had no choice but to keep working: as members of the military, they could not legally quit. They were reimbursed with back pay after appropriations resumed, but during the shutdown they were forced to rely on the generosity of their neighbors, families and friends and the support of civil society groups.\nMembers of the other branches of the military were not affected, as they fall under the Department of Defense, which had already been funded prior to the partial shutdown. \u201cTens of thousands of American servicemembers went without pay during the shutdown simply because of departmental jurisdiction \u2013 that\u2019s a disgrace and it can never happen again,\u201d said Rep.

{"idx": "29026", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A healthy diet improves your quality of life and fights chronic disease.\nWhether your goal is to look amazing in a swimsuit or be able to keep up with your kids, healthy eating helps you get there. A diet based on healthful, minimally processed foods -- including vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins -- provides you with the vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients your body needs to function. When you eat healthy, you'll not only look and feel your best, you'll be on the road to long-term health.\nEating healthy improves your energy levels throughout the day. A balanced diet provides you with B vitamins that your body uses to break down fats, carbohydrates and proteins into fuel for your cells. A diet rich in iron, magnesium and potassium supports energy production. Opting for healthy foods, such as whole grains, over sweets and processed carbohydrates also boosts your energy levels by stabilizing your blood sugar. Sugary snacks cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash, draining you of energy. Whole grains and healthy fats provide a sustained blood sugar increase, so you'll continue to feel satisfied and energized after your meal.\nSeveral nutrients in a well-balanced diet help your brain to function properly, and eating healthy also benefits your mental health. Several B vitamins, including vitamin B-6, helps you make neurotransmitters -- chemicals your nerves need to control brain function and regulate your mood. Low levels of vitamins B-3, B-9 and B-12 also put you at risk of depression, notes the University of Maryland Medical Center. Avoid excessive caffeine -- it can contribute to anxiety -- limit alcohol intake and try not to skip meals to benefit your mental health, recommends the Norris Cotton Cancer Center.\nEat healthy today to invest in a healthier future. Trading in fast food for healthful, home-cooked meals aids in maintaining a healthy blood sugar level, while consuming fast food puts you at greater risk of diabetes, explains the University of Minnesota. In addition, phytonutrients -- beneficial compounds found in fruits, veggies, nuts and whole grains -- help fight heart disease. Consuming these nutrients also lowers your risk of some cancers, including colon, oral, prostate and lung cancers, according to Stanford Medicine.\nApproach healthy eating as a lifestyle change, and set a series of small goals to help you achieve success. If fast or processed food currently makes up a part of your daily diet, you might feel overwhelmed trying to completely turn your habits around overnight. Start small -- for example, try switching out soda for water, and make it your goal to cut your fast and processed food intake in half. As you continue to adjust to your new lifestyle, focus on preparing the majority of your meals at home using healthful cooking methods like steaming, baking or grilling, and then work on the details, such as incorporating vegetables into each meal. Remember that every positive change you make to your diet benefits your health. Treat healthy eating like a lifelong journey -- that may include a few bumps in the road -- and don't get bogged down with the daily grind.\nTremblay,, Sylvie. \"Why Is Eating Healthy Beneficial?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/eating-healthy-beneficial-8549.html.

Connect NC is a $2 billion bond package that has funded new construction and renovations to buildings on the state\u2019s community college and university campuses.

While this potential combination of a Republican President and a split Congress may seem like gridlock, stock markets have historically fared well. It tends to constrain political overreach, resulting in a stable backdrop for markets.\nOver the past two years, tax cuts have been enacted and the much-maligned Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) survived repeal and has been embraced by more Americans. With these two major initiatives settled, voters seem content to rebalance power and impose more checks on the executive branch.\nA split congress would be broadly bullish for equities, as it supports the status quo.\nThe long term growth outlook should remain unchanged. The Republican ambitions to make individual tax cuts permanent would be unlikely to materialize. While these tax cuts may have boosted short-term growth, they would have also raised the risk of overheating the economy, resulting in more aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve (\u201cFed\u201d) rate hikes. And extending the tax cuts would have further amplified the debt burden, eventually weighing on borrowing costs.\nEnding Republican Congressional control will likely result in a marginally weaker dollar. However, a pullback in the currency should keep U.S. exports more competitive and generally be supportive of Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d) 500 earnings.\nWhat Business Impact Could The New Congress Have?\nA Democratic-led House may push for increasing the minimum wage, controlling drug prices and launching infrastructure spending. All three policies should be met with some support, particularly from President Trump as he looks to champion main-street issues ahead of the 2020 Presidential election.\nMinimum wages have become a significant issue. Amazon recently announced an increase in its minimum wage to $15 an hour and encouraged others to follow suit. This was partly in response to criticism of its business practices from the White House and former Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Amazon also promised to lobby for increasing the decade-old federal minimum wage from $7.25. Even if Congress doesn\u2019t support an increase, high-profile political pressure and the tightest job market in almost 50 years seems to be having an effect.\nBroad-based minimum wage increases would be felt most in the service economy, particularly in labor intensive sectors such as consumer discretionary and consumer staples. That could certainly pinch profitability, but it depends on a company\u2019s ability to pass costs through to consumers.\nHealthcare costs and drug pricing are likely to be scrutinized by a Democrat-led House. Escalating drug prices have also drawn criticism from the President, so there is some bipartisan support to contain increases. Across specific sectors, biotech and pharmaceutical are the most vulnerable to potential drug price controls. However, serious disruption in healthcare is unlikely as each party will constrain the other in attempting to dial back or increase existing services.\nInfrastructure spending has appeal across both parties. The challenge has always been on how to best select and qualify \u201cshovel ready projects.\u201d Proposed solutions tend to run into conflicts as each party has different priorities on what regions and projects should be targeted. As in previous attempts, it still looks like a low probability to get a large program up and running. There may be opportunity for some small, targeted projects. Industrial and materials sectors could benefit from any uptick in spending.\nAs President Trump plans his 2020 re-election campaign, a potential gridlocked Congress is unlikely to deliver any notable wins to help expand on his domestic or economic agenda. Therefore, Trump will likely focus on his broad executive powers to"}

How About An Encore This Year?\nMasters sophmore Snedeker (2nd from left) had a chance to join leaders Rose and Immelman, but bogeyed 18 to finish one back. Tiger is four off.\nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Justin Rose has the first round of the Masters down pat.\nIt's the rest of the tournament he must master.\nRose shot a 4-under 68 that put him atop the leaderboard on a warm, sunny opening day that featured Ian Poulter's hole-in-one, a solid start to Zach Johnson's title defense and Tiger Woods poised for a run at another green jacket. Sound familiar? It should.\nIn 2004, the Englishman led after the first and second rounds but faded to a tie for 22nd. Returning to Augusta National a year ago, Rose surged to the front again with a 69 on Thursday, but didn't come close to matching that score the rest of the weekend, settling for a fifth-place tie three strokes behind Johnson.\nOn Thursday, he got off to another quick start and was tied for the lead with South African Trevor Immelman.\n\"I've learned you can't count your chickens too early,\" said Rose, who won the Order of Merit as the top golfer on the European Tour in 2007. \"Obviously, the first round has been great to me here.\"\nWoods prefers to do his best work on the weekend. In his four previous Augusta wins, he twice trailed by three shots after the first round, another time by five, and was a daunting seven shots back in 2005.\nWoods, who shot a 72, remained the overwhelming favorite to win his fifth green jacket -- the starting point for an unprecedented Grand Slam.\n\"I feel good about how I played all day,\" he said. \"I hit a lot of good putts that just didn't go in. I've just got to stay patient out there and hopefully it will turn.\"\nAfter putting up nothing but pars through the first 12 holes, Woods was on the ropes a bit with two straight bogeys. But the world's No. 1 player quickly pulled himself up by chipping in for eagle from just off the green at No. 15, bringing out his first fist pump of the tournament. He parred out from there.\nRose actually struggled in the beginning, with bogeys on two of the first four holes. But he played the rest of the round at 6 under, surging past early clubhouse leaders Poulter and Robert Karlsson, who posted 70s.\n\"Eventually you've got to say, 'OK, it's time to step up,'\" the 27-year-old Rose said. \"But I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. I'm just coming into my prime, I feel. I've got 10 to 15 good years in front of me.\"\nImmelman played a bogey-free round that seemed to come out of nowhere. He missed the cut in four of his eight events this year, and has yet to finish higher than 40th in a stroke-play tournament.\n\"Obviously, my form has not been too stellar so far this season,\" Immelman said. \"I had to just stay patient with myself and know it's in there somewhere.

Many suggest that it will be the first rival to eat into the iPad\u2019s overwhelming market dominance. As it turns out, Apple may be planning a new addition to the iPad line that will directly combat this new threat. A new leak suggests that the company is in talks with LG to produce displays for a smaller iPad.\nThe report says that Apple is currently negotiating a long-term deal with LG. The deal would allegedly have LG supplying displays for a 7.35-inch iPad from 2012 through 2016.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a smaller iPad has been rumored, but it is the first time that the rumors are based on (alleged) supply chain leaks. Previous information came from market analysts, who often understand current market conditions better than they do Apple\u2019s tendencies and priorities. This could, however, end up being a case where they were right.\nOf course this iPad Mini (or iPad Nano?) would certainly be sold alongside the larger iPad 3, rather than in place of it. While Apple has thus far avoided splitting its iPhone or iPad lines into separate tiers, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of \u2014 Macs and iPods have been sold in a variety of sizes (and prices) for years.\nA smaller, cheaper iPad would certainly be a powerful counterattack to the Kindle Fire, but its ultimate success would probably depend on how it would be priced. Apple wouldn\u2019t likely match Amazon\u2019s content-subsidized $200 price tag, but a $250-300 iPad could very well put a damper on the Fire\u2019s momentum. If they set the price any higher than that, they\u2019d be overshooting the Kindle Fire\u2019s target demographic \u2014 average consumers who want a quality tablet for cheap.\nOf course this rumor should be taken with several grains of salt.

We\u2019ll miss all the fuss about Tebow-mania, because of the rigorous debate it created about religion and the place of faith in public life.

The results of our unscientific survey of 13 freezing cold New Englanders, most of whom were warming up with alcohol: 0% believe that divine intervention was fueling Tebow\u2019s comebacks.\nSo if God was not responsible for Tebow-mania, who, or what, is? Blind luck, athleticism, talented teammates were among the reasons our respondents offered. \u201cHe\u2019s just a good quarterback,\u201d said one Pats fan, the kind of understated, uncomplicated response most Americans are inclined to reject. One fan credited Tebow\u2019s lack of, er, experience. \u201cSince he\u2019s still a virgin, he hasn\u2019t been sapped of all this strength,\u201d says Don Colligne, a Patriots supporter from Dracut, Mass. \u201cTebow is a typical pro athlete,\u201d says another man. \u201cHe\u2019s strong, and in great shape.

Instead, his podcast\u2014bearing the Fox News-friendly title Just The Facts\u2014is constantly RSS-ing its way into Peter\u2019s feed as you swing across New York, commenting on everything you do in the game, and (inevitably) finding a way to spin it in the worst possible light. You can always turn it off, of course, but who could resist the urge to hear J.J.J. angrily calling them a deranged, mask-wearing pervert for once?\nFrom a design point of view, the podcasts serve the same purpose that they do in most of our lives: killing time on your daily commute. Like any big open-world game, Spider-Man has moments when you\u2019re doing little more than moving from point A to point B, clearing your map of those irresistible little icons that denote collectibles, photo ops, or crimes to stop.

And as a piece of evolution for a 55-year-old character, it\u2019s practically sublime. Or, to put it another way: J. Jonah Jameson was always a born podcaster. He just didn\u2019t know it.\nLuckily, all of this madness is delivered with the same humor and charm that underlies the rest of Spider-Man\u2019s presentation. (Plus, there are no ads, except Jameson\u2019s frequent plugs for his own book.) Although he can\u2019t quite match the character-defining bluster of J.K. Simmons\u2019 J.J., Darin De Paul gives a performance that\u2019s a commendable mixture of comedy and rage, taking him to the heights of hypocritical apoplexy that the character requires. Each episode of his show essentially acts as a 90-second comedy skit interspersed into your action, and he nails the punchline (or occasional sober lack thereof) with ease.\nEven more interesting, though, is the way Just The Facts fits into the game\u2019s wider view of New York\u2019s online ecosystem.

Joyce's presentation on network security at the event boiled down to one piece of advice.\nNSA tiger teams follow a six-stage process when attempting to crack a target, he explained. These are reconnaissance, initial exploitation, establish persistence, install tools, move laterally, and then collect, exfiltrate and exploit the data.\nDuring the reconnaissance phase agents examine a network electronically and, in some cases, physically. They work out who the key personnel are, what email accounts matter, how far the network extends, and maintain constant surveillance until they can find a way in.\nThe goal is to find weak points, whether they be within the network architecture, or in staff who maybe work from home or bring in unauthorized devices. There\u2019s also areas where the target network interconnects with other computer systems, like heating and ventilation controllers, which can be useful for an attack.\nCompanies need to pay particular attention to cloud providers, he said. Once you use a cloud company you are essentially handing your data over to them and relying on their security, so he warned due diligence is even more important than usual.\nFor the initial exploitation phase the key attack vectors are malware attachments in email, injection attacks from websites, and removable media - the latter being particularly useful for penetrating air-gapped systems that aren\u2019t even on the network; Iran found that out the hard way with Stuxnet.\nAnother common attack vector is common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) that haven\u2019t been patched, he said. Companies need to make automatic patching the norm to protect themselves against nation-state hackers he warned. As for zero-day flaws, he said they are overrated.\nAs for the NSA\u2019s own collection of zero-day exploits, Joyce said that in fact the agency had very few and each new one was discovered was evaluated by an outside committee to see when software manufacturers should be informed to build a patch. The NSA doesn\u2019t have the final decision on this, he claimed.\nTo protect against this admins need to lock things down as far as possible; whitelisting apps, locking down permissions, and patching as soon as possible, and use reputation management. If a seemingly legitimate user is displaying abnormal behavior, like accessing network data for the first time, chances are they have been compromised, he said.\nReputation-based tools are particularly useful against malware, Joyce explained. Signature-based antivirus won\u2019t protect you against a unique piece of attack code, but when used in conjunction with reputation databases it can be effective - if code or a domain hasn\u2019t been seen before there\u2019s a high chance it\u2019s dodgy.\nIt\u2019s amazing how often simple issues come up and allow access to target networks, he explained. Things like administrator credentials being left embedded in scripts, how many networks are unsegmented, and how often suspicious activity reported in network logs got missed.\nHe cited cases where NSA hackers have performed penetration testing, issued a report on vulnerabilities, and then when they go back two years later to test again found the"}

Thus, it makes sense to know what you're getting into.\nUnless you're a qualified building inspector yourself, let a professional do the job for you. Along with all your other concerns, you might wonder if the roof leaks, whether the heating system is reliable, the plumbing sound, or the electrical system up to code. Will you have water in the basement after the next heavy rain? The list could go on and on.\nYou might want to hire a professional property-inspection service to thoroughly review your intended purchase before the deal goes through.\nSuch inspections are usually included as a contingency in your offer to buy the house. Your real-estate agent is familiar with the wording used in your area. Typically, that wording provides that you are entitled to have a professional inspection of the property performed at your expense. It further provides that you may disapprove the property on the basis of the inspection and have your deposit refunded in full.\nPractically speaking, if the house inspection reveals, for example, a substandard electrical panel, you could choose to negotiate repairs to the property as a condition of purchase rather than walk away from the purchase.\n* Major repairs. You should be aware of any problems you might be buying so you can consider the cost of repairs as part of your decision to buy or avoid them by choosing to buy elsewhere.\n* Buyer's remorse. Soon after your offer is accepted, you'll have second thoughts about the wisdom of your purchase. Salespeople call this ''buyer's remorse.\n* Deferred maintenance. A property inspection can forewarn you about future maintenance that you'll need to consider sooner or later. While not a problem now, deferred maintenance items must eventually be taken care of.\n* Older houses. The older a house, the more things there are that may work fine at time of purchase, but will slowly deteriorate with age. Fan bearings, roofing, and built-in appliances are a few such items.\n* A property inspection is not a substitute for a termite report. In most states, only a licensed termite inspector can prepare a termite report and recommend or perform work to eradicate the pests. You need both.\n* Property inspectors will rarely warrant that the roof does not leak. You need to independently verify the condition of the roof if this is important to you. However, the inspector will inspect the crawl spaces into the attic and subfloor areas and report what he finds.\n* Property inspectors are usually not appraisers. They will not offer an opinion as to whether or not you should buy the house. That decision is entirely up to you. If in doubt as to the cost of repairs, ask a qualified repairman for an estimate.\nMost inspection firms use a checklist, perhaps one that the owner or manager had developed. The checklist covers all aspects of residential property - attics , basements, plumbing, electrical, and room-by-room details that the inspector is to record for the report. The report itself can only be as good as the inspector is knowledgeable, so extreme care should be used in selectingthe firm.\nGenerally, it is preferable to be referred to a firm rather than to choose one at random. Out-of-work carpenters and builders, for example, have been known to start property-inspection businesses when times are hard. A trusted recommendation will increase your chances of satisfaction.\nAn accurate, well-written property-inspection report may help in negotiations for your next house.

We say it to the kids all the time, but is it true for us as educators?\nThis afternoon my son had a friend from his kindergarten class over to play. Within seconds of the friend's arrival, the boys were actively engaged in a lego building, superhero attacking, Barbie takedown extravaganza. Their enthusiasm was unmasked. They were playing. Now I am not advocating that we turn professional development into lego building and Barbie destruction, but shouldn't we feel such enthusiasm when we gather with colleagues in our field and work to learn and improve our practice and education?\nFor me the answer is yes, and thanks to several Edcamps, and conferences such as iPad Summit and BLC, I have had the great fortune of experiencing this overwhelming excitement for education while ensconced in events with incredible educators and friends. But then it happens, I leave and go home. My brain whirls with ideas and suggestions gleaned from the day, and my \"to-do list\" is doubled with apps and tools I want to explore. When is that going to happen?\nThis is the story of my professional development experiences. I get all riled up by possibilities but then leave and feel the stress of exploring on my own. What I have really needed is a chance to sit with equally passionate educators and share ideas and knowledge with one another based entirely on the growing to-do list I have. I was thinking just this when I read a post by Jennie Magiera about the plan that she, Autumn Laidler, Anita Orozco, Carolyn Skibba and Sue Gorman hatched on their way home from iPad Summit in November. Since that point, this great idea has become PLAYDATE13, the first event of its kind, with simultaneous events happening in Chicago, Boston and Portland, OR.\nPLAYDATE13 is a space for us to come together and collaboratively explore the edtech tools we've always wanted to learn more about. The concept is to invite educators from around the area to join together on one day, sit in a room for a few hours and dig more deeply into these tools. We will collaborate with one another to explore functionality, application in our learning environments and experiment. There are no presenters in the room, no experts and no agenda. Simply time to play, tinker, and explore.\nWhy is Playdate different than an Edcamp?\nWhen my colleagues and I have attended Edcamps, it has been wonderful to explore tools and have a more democratic learning environment. However, in most rooms the style is still \"presenter/audience\". Even in discussion-based rooms, usually someone is at the front of the room and the learning experience isn't even for all. We wanted to attend a conference that isn't about receiving information about tools, but applying the tools themselves. We wanted to create a conference that was 100% hands on at every moment, where no one was presenting and everyone is a learner.\nWhy should people leave their homes on a presumably cold, February Saturday morning?\nThis event will be high-energy exploration time for you to rediscover playtime and connect with fellow curious educators. It will be a dedicated day for you to take out your \"EdTech Tools to Explore\" to do list and move them over to your \"EdTech Tools in my ToolBox\" list. Finally, it's a great way for you to recharge your batteries and become re-inspired to try something new in your learning environment.\nSpots are filling quickly, but hurry and you may be able to snag one of the last few.

Pipelines have become a contentious issue in North Dakota since the prolonged and sometimes violent protests against the $3.8 billion, four-state Dakota Access oil pipeline in 2016 and 2017.\nMDU sought an easement across Behm\u2019s property in Ward County to build a 3,000-foot-long (915-meter-long) pipeline to service a BNSF Railway facility west of Minot. The railroad maintains and operates a switch heated in the winter with propane tanks near the private property to keep it free of snow and ice. MDU proposed replacing the tanks with the underground pipeline, according to court records.\nThe utility that provides natural gas and electricity to more than 400,000 customers in a four-state area obtained the necessary permits and approvals from state and federal agencies but had to resort to eminent domain to cross the private land.\nState law prohibits private property from being taken for ownership or use of any private individual or entity unless the land is necessary for conducting a carrier or utility business.\n\u201cWhile it is certainly not subject to dispute that maintaining railway switches is a necessity to the safe operations of the railroad, the construction of this pipeline is not necessary for this purpose,\u201d Lee wrote, noting that the propane tank option exists. He also said MDU didn\u2019t give enough consideration to other options.\nMDU is still determining whether it will appeal to the state Supreme Court, spokesman Mark Hanson said Thursday.\nBismarck attorney Derrick Braaten has represented landowners in dozens of eminent domain cases. He said most landowner victories amount to increased compensation for the use of their land, and that it\u2019s rare for a judge to entirely bar the taking of private property.\nBraaten said the Ward County case, though involving a small pipeline, touches on a larger issue."}

At the moment, polls predict the Free Democrats will get 9.5 percent of the overall vote.\nThe FDP has traditionally been a small party with a reliable voting base. It advocates minimal government interference in the economy and is strongly supported by middle-size business. Free Democrats think of themselves as neither left nor right but in the middle of the political spectrum.\nThis is one reason why they are so crucial to German politics.

But the company\u2019s upcoming product announcement, that includes new iPhone and iPad models, on Monday doesn\u2019t seem to be stirring much passion.\nApple has invited tech reporters and analysts to its Silicon Valley headquarters, where CEO Tim Cook is expected to unveil some new additions to its current family of iPhone and iPad devices. So far, however, there have been no hints of any dramatic announcements, such as last year\u2019s highly anticipated Apple Watch debut, or major initiatives like the company\u2019s long-rumored but yet-to-materialize streaming TV service.\nApple could use a shot in the arm. IPhone sales are levelling off, after surging last year to record levels that made Apple the world\u2019s biggest company by stock market value. And many are wondering if Cook can come up with another big hit.\nAnd the very next day, Apple is set to square off in court against the FBI over its demand that the company help it unlock a mass shooter\u2019s encrypted iPhone. While that dispute has drawn heated rhetoric, most Apple watchers say it\u2019s unlikely to play a major role at Monday\u2019s product launch.\nWhile Apple has been mum about its plans, several analysts expect the company will introduce an upgrade to its older, four-inch iPhone 5S _ aimed at consumers who haven\u2019t sprung for the bigger-screen iPhone 6 models that Apple introduced two years ago. The new phone may come with features like Apple Pay and the company\u2019s fastest processor, which have previously been offered only on versions of the iPhone 6.\nAnalysts and tech blogs say Apple also may unveil a new model of the iPad Pro, which the company introduced last year with several features _ like a detachable keyboard and stylus _ designed for business users.\nA four-inch iPhone isn\u2019t likely to see the kind of blockbuster demand that Apple enjoyed with its large-screen iPhone 6 and 6S models, according to several financial analysts, but it could help Apple boost overall sales and draw some additional users into the market for Apple\u2019s online services, including Apple Music, Apple Pay and the highly profitable mobile App Store.\n\u201cWe think the numbers will be modest,\u201d said RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani.

I am particularly pleased by all the protests and whistles directed at me this evening, and if you do not like me, I can say that I do not like you either.\nDo the above remarks constitute the saltiest acceptance speech in the history of the Cannes Film Festival? Maurice Pialat delivered them in 1987, when his gloomy religious drama Under The Sun Of Satan was announced as the winner, by unanimous decision, of the Palme D\u2019Or\u2014an unpopular choice that earned some catcalls, just as the film itself had upon premiere a few days earlier. Difficult, controversial, and sometimes just plain bad movies get booed at Cannes all the time, to the point where BAMcin\u00e9matek in New York held a screening series a couple of years ago devoted entirely to these jeered contenders. Furthermore, it\u2019s not so unheard of for the winner of the Palme to get some blowback from folks who favored a different movie. But how often is a film remembered chiefly for how it was received on the Croisette? Or for how its maker responded to an uncharitable reception?\nThree decades later, Under The Sun Of Satan still gets discussed as a scandal of Cannes, with even positive reappraisals noting the whistles of disapproval at the awards ceremony and the French director who met them with some characteristic disdain of his own, punctuating the brief address with a hand gesture people have alternately read as a celebratory fist pump and one final, wordless kiss-off to the peanut gallery.\nIf it remains tough to talk about this movie on its own terms\u2014to divorce it from that anecdote\u2014it may be because Pialat himself often made contentiousness his brand. How apropos that his biggest moment of recognition, his coronation at the world\u2019s most prestigious film festival, arrived amid a chorus of boos. The director, who died in 2003, was a walking contradiction: unsung in his wild success, if such a thing is possible. His career dovetailed with the French New Wave, but he never fit in with that group, whose members he often held in public contempt. (Even Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who produced Pialat\u2019s first feature, wasn\u2019t safe from his scorn.) Pialat\u2019s movies won awards, scored strong reviews, and often made a lot of money at the French box office, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the kind of reputation his peers did\u2014perhaps because he was notoriously hard on the cast and crew that agreed (sometimes just once) to work with him. Pialat seemed to relish existing outside of any one movement, while still lamenting his solitude. And as hard as he hit back at his detractors, he was his own harshest critic, copping hard to what he saw as his failures.\nI\u2019ve often used this space to champion difficult movies, because those are the kind that ideally should be honored at Cannes. And Pialat was exactly the kind of artist\u2014uncompromising, with a career generally unlike anyone else\u2019s\u2014the festival was created to enshrine. All the same, this is one instance where the opposition may have been on to something. Under The Sun Of Satan, the first French movie to win the Palme in more than 20 years (the previous champion, A Man And A Woman, split the highest prize back in 1966), may be too alienating for its own good.

ISG is known to be the headlight on the train that companies board when they start on the information technology (IT) transformation journey for their enterprise.\nOne such journey is the move from existing enterprise IT operations to operations that rest entirely in the \u201ccloud\". I believe that very few C level executives fully realize all the implications when they embark on this journey. They make the mistake of thinking that \u201cbuying\" cloud-based operations for their enterprise (and thereby cutting out traditional IT service providers who have IT infrastructure management practices) is like buying a commodity. Executives labour under the misconception that they can easily switch cloud service providers, and so don\u2019t look before they first make their \u201ccloud\" leap. So, if I were a CXO today, I could easily enter into a transaction with say, Amazon Web Services (AWS), thinking that my company could easily switch to Microsoft\u2019s Azure if AWS hasn\u2019t been up to snuff.\nNothing could be further from the truth, says ISG, since cloud service providers put in plenty of hooks to make sure that their services remain \u201csticky\". So, making this decision is a bit like deciding whether to go with Google\u2019s Android or Apple\u2019s iOS as the operating system for your phone. Once you have decided on one, it becomes increasingly difficult to switch to the other as the years roll by.\nThe general focus of outsourcing clients has been to get the best price for the services that they procure. The primary driver is to reduce the costs involved in the outsourcing effort. However, in a price-times-quantity model (PxQ), especially in the cloud, given that stickiness to a single provider is an issue, most of the money to be saved lies in the \u201cQ\" dimension, and not the \u201cP\" dimension.\n1. Start Q (consumption) reporting. Pareto\u2019s 80/20 rule often applies to heavy users of outsourced services. Reporting usage statistics, especially to the top 20% of users who drive great volumes, reveals areas of consumption that have little business value and encourages heavy users to reduce their Q footprint, thereby lowering overall costs.\n2. Many cost centres do not adequately charge back to users due to complex corporate accounting policies. However, failing to drive cost to the main users leads to the \u201cfree loader\" trap (also called the \u201ctragedy of the commons\" trap), where people use resources without moderation if it appears to them that the usage is free. Formally showing services users the costs of their activity makes them more circumspect. Properly designed outsourcing contracts are designed to deliver an elastic cost model that facilitates doing this.\n3. Set up a demand reduction incentive plan. If reducing 30% of your volumes translates into a 20% cost reduction, offer up a challenge to the user or organizations that can control these volumes. If they achieve a reduction, then hand out positive incentives such as budget relief or bonus kickers.\n4. Understanding the power of a Q \u201cratio\" analysis.

How about a side of yuca with that Big Mac?\nVenezuela\u201ds more than 100 McDonald\u201ds franchises have run out of potatoes and are now serving alternatives like deep-fried arepa flatbreads or yuca, a starchy staple of traditional South American cooking.\nMcDonald\u201ds is blaming a contract dispute with West Coast dock workers for halting the export of frozen fries to the country. The dispute also caused several days of French fry rationing in Japan last month.

Her daughter won\u201dt eat the super-starchy root, she said, and they\u201dd come for the sole purpose of treating the two-year-old to a Happy Meal.\nJohn Toaspern, chief marketing officer with the US Potato Board, noted that Venezuela\u201ds import of frozen potatoes fell off a cliff long before the labor dispute escalated. During the first 10 months of 2014, the country imported just 14 percent of the frozen fries from major McDonald\u201ds supplier Washington State that it brought in for the same period the year before, according to federal data compiled by the board.\nMost of the shortages in Venezuela are driven in part by the country\u201ds tight currency controls, which make it hard to get dollars at a subsidized rate for imports while creating a thriving black market for currency. As a result, the country either has the most expensive Happy Meal in the world ($27 the official exchange rate) or the cheapest (90 cents at the black market rate).\nMcDonald\u201ds has likely been grappling with shortages in Venezuela for a while, according to Alixa Sharkey, a researcher with the market research company Euromonitor International. And while other countries might be able to adjust to hiccups at the ports by finding alternate solutions like flying in frozen potatoes, the dysfunction in Venezuela makes these workarounds impossible.\n\u201cThis situation probably has little to do with the U.S. port dispute and is mostly the result of Venezuela\u201ds very difficult economic situation,\u201d she said.\nWhile McDonald\u201ds may be the ultimate symbol of U.S. capitalism, the socialist government seems acutely aware that Venezuelans relish their Happy Meals. A state-sponsored news website posted a story this week assuring the situation \u201chas nothing at all to do\u201d with government policy.\nAt the Caracas McDonald\u201ds, a man wearing an \u201cemployee of the month\u201d cap braved the dinner rush Monday, patiently explaining to patron after patron that instead of French fries, the store was offering yuca fries, mini-arepas, or salads.\nNonplussed customers sampled their pale yuca fries tentatively as they picked up their orders.

The Army private had served in Iraq in 2006, and deserted during her two-week leave in the US in 2007. She fled with her husband and children to Canada in protest of what she called an \u201cillegal and immoral war\u201d \u2013 a war that she said she became disillusioned with.\nUpon arrival in Canada, Rivera applied for refugee status, but was threatened with deportation in 2009. Her requests for permanent residency and residency based on humanitarian grounds were also rejected, but the young woman continued to appeal the deportation order until a second one was issued in 2012. She spent five years living in Canada before turning herself in to authorities at the US border in September.\nThe Canadian-based War Resisters Support Campaign launched a petition protesting her most recent deportation order, but Canadian authorities rejected their request to let Rivera stay. About 19,000 people had signed the online petition and rallies were held throughout Canada, calling on the government to let Rivera make her home in the country.

In many cases, conscientious objectors are appointed to alternative services as a substitute for their military assignments. Since Rivera was morally opposed to the Iraq War and claims she could never kill another person, she could have requested to serve the military in a different way.\nBut after pleading guilty to her desertion, Rivera was sentenced to 10 months in military prison and a bad conduct discharge.\nThe young mother is the third Iraq war resister that was deported from Canada and now faces a jail sentence.

The techniques used include aerial photography, time-lapse, thermal imaging and remotely-operated motion-sensitive cameras positioned around the garden that will capture animal activity when no one is around.\nWe will witness the striking transformation as each season brings different sights, sounds, smells and visitors to the garden. Surprises, delights, and unusual and unexpected discoveries abound as wildlife and plantlife are filmed in all their forms, both commonplace and rare, both by day and by night. And we will discover how the garden is used inside the Palace: from the mulberries that are used by the royal kitchens to cook dishes for the Queen to the foliage collected from the garden to decorate the Palace at Christmas.\nAnd the expertise, organization, craft and graft required to meet the challenge of maintaining a garden fit for a Queen is shown as senior garden staff share their approach and unique trade secrets \u2014 such as the use of the invaluable \u2018arisings\u2019 (Buckingham Palace argot for fertilizer from the Royal stables).\nOver the year spent at the garden, \"The Queen\u2019s Garden\" yields stories and spectacles rarely heard or seen beyond its secure walls. Royal historian Dr. Lucy Worsley describes the garden\u2019s origins as part of a much bigger hunting ground for Henry VIII and its evolution to its present day dimensions via its role as a playground for the Queen and Princess Margaret during their childhood. And the Royal Family\u2019s attachment to the garden is brought to life with rare archival footage.\nFrom its wildest corners, where it functions as one of the most important havens for wildlife in London to its role as the sumptuous venue for an 8,000 strong Royal Garden Party, \"The Queen\u2019s Garden\" will offer viewers privileged access and a unique perspective into a special place.\n\"The Queen\u2019s Garden\" was produced by Oxford Scientific Films.\nPhotos \u00a9 Oxford Scientific Films."}

They will vote again in the July 3 runoff - and this time the Russian Embassy in Washington has promised to provide enough ballots. The embassy had miscalculated the number of voters who would turn out for the first round, and local election officials had to scramble to get a ballot to every voter.\n\"Could anyone have imagined that we would see our familiar line form - for electoral ballots?\" columnist Vladimir Torchilin wrote in Bostonskaya Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Boston-based Russian-language weekly.\nGreater Boston alone has a Russian emigre population of about 40,000, but Sergei Bologov of the Russian Community Association of Massachusetts estimates that only several thousand still have Russian citizenship.\nBoston, as the Russians say, is a drop in the sea compared with the Russian emigre vote in the rest of the US - and in the rest of the world. In the first round of presidential elections, the Russian vote from polling stations outside Russia's borders totaled 3.5 million, says Vadim Rubin, a program officer at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. With a total of 72 million total ballots, the outside vote accounts for 5 percent of the electorate and could tip the balance in a close election.\nA large chunk of the 3.5 million includes votes from the \"near abroad,\" the former Soviet republics where ethnic Russians have lived under sometimes-hostile governments since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many of these voters may support Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov, who in the first round took a 60 percent majority in the Baltic states. Some new republics grant Russians no citizenship and limited rights. And many of these voters believe Mr. Zyuganov will take a firmer stance toward near-abroad nations.\nRussians living in the US and Western Europe, though, are avid supporters of Boris Yeltsin, says Mr. Rubin. In Boston, Mr. Yeltsin took 92 percent of the first- round vote, while Zyuganov received a total of \"about two votes,\" says Mr. Bologov. The Russian Embassy in Washington (where 2,700 voters turned out) reported similar figures.\n\"They are afraid that if the Communists come to power, the borders will be closed tightly, and it will be difficult to make connections with their relatives and friends in Russia,\" says Valeriy Lebedev, editor of Bostonskaya Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"So they are more inclined towards Yeltsin.\" Mr. Lebedev's newspaper and other Russian-language media were mainly responsible for publicizing elections, since the get-out-the-vote advertising campaign conducted by the Russian government didn't reach US residents.\nBologov says many have other reasons for voting. \"Of course people are worried about their relatives, but a lot of people don't have relatives in Russia - they are all in Israel or Germany or Ukraine,\" he says. \"It's very important to continue reforms, not to continue the"}

But so far it looks as though Masato Yoshii might have had a tougher time finding an apartment in Manhattan than he has had in adjusting to the National League.\nIn his best performance to date, the Japanese right-hander struck out nine batters, turned in his first complete game in the major leagues, lowered his earned run average to a sparkling 2.25 over eight starts and led the Mets to a 6-1 victory over Cincinnati at Shea Stadium last night.\nManager Bobby Valentine admitted that he was a little surprised that Yoshii's e.r.a. is now good enough to rank in the National League's top 10, along with those of two of the other starting pitchers on the Mets -- Al Leiter and Rick Reed.\n''I don't think he's missed a beat, other than not finding an apartment for a while,'' said Valentine, who walked the streets with Yoshii one day last month trying to help the pitcher get a place to live, which he finally did on Manhattan's East Side.\nYoshii's standout performance came on a day when one of the Mets' owners -- Fred Wilpon -- went on WFAN radio to try do confront the criticism the Mets are hearing for their apparent reluctance to pursue Mike Piazza, whom the Florida Marlins appear intent on aucitioning off to the highest bidder.\nPiazza would give the Mets two things they don't have right now -- a marquee name and a slugger. Wilpon did not say the Mets would indeed try to land Piazza but did announce that the team has at least four offers on the table that could land them a star player, even it's not Piazza.\nYoshii, of course, is not a marquee name. But whatever it is that defines a good player, Yoshii seems to have in abundant quantity. After he shut down the St. Louis Cardinals on one run and two hits over seven innings two starts ago, Mark McGwire said he would have to see Yoshii several more times before he could judge just how good a pitcher he is. But the Cincinnati hitters don't have the same argument to fall back on.\nAfter all, Yoshii (3-1) was facing the Reds for the third time since April 18. And to prevent the Reds from capitalizing on their familiarity with Yoshii's normal pitching patters, he and his regular catcher, Alberto Castillo conferrred on Wednesday night in the Mets' dugout. They decided they would throw fastballs in situations that would usually call for Yoshii's trademark forkball the first time through the Cincinnati order.\nAfter the first time through the lineup, though, it was back to the old forkball.\nIn taking three of four from the Reds, the Mets won with their usual recipe. Good starting pitching, strong defense, the ability to capitalize on the other team's mistakes and another injury -- this one a hamstring strain for Edgardo Alfonzo, who had just come off a stint on the disabled list for a strained shoulder.\nAlfonzo will be out anywhere from a few days to a week.

In October 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel proclaimed that a multicultural approach had \u201cutterly failed\u201d in Germany. In February 2011, French President Nicolas Sarkozy also called multiculturalism a failure, and British Prime Minister David Cameron indicted his country\u2019s policy of multiculturalism for failing to promote a sense of common identity and encouraging Muslim segregation and radicalization.\nThe debate surrounding multiculturalism is likely to continue. But what is multiculturalism really, and what do social scientists know about its effects on social cohesion and immigrant integration?\nIf the purportedly divisive effects of multiculturalism are borne out by empirical evidence, they provide support for calls to reduce immigrant flows or to differentially select new migrants, and for the creation of more aggressive assimilation policies and programs in destination countries.\nIf such effects are unsubstantiated, however, the rhetoric against multiculturalism might reflect the scapegoating of minority cultures faulted for problems rooted in others causes, such as economic globalization or discriminatory treatment.\nMulticulturalism can refer to a demographic fact, a particular set of philosophical ideas, or a specific orientation by government or institutions toward a diverse population. Much of the contemporary debate over the value of multiculturalism centers on whether public multiculturalism \u2014 that which finds expression in concrete policies, laws, and regulations \u2014 is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration.\nConceptual differences over the meaning of multiculturalism often lead to confusion and outright misunderstanding when people debate its challenges and benefits.\nFor some people, the term \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d is descriptive: It reflects the actual pluralism present in society. Such pluralism might stem from the coexistence of longstanding minority groups, such as the distinct linguistic communities within Belgium, Canada, and Switzerland, or it might be due to the migration of people with different cultures, religions, languages, and origins, as is the case in many countries around the world. In this sense, the United States and France are multicultural countries, as are Singapore and Kuwait.\nMost of the contemporary debate about multiculturalism centers on immigrants and their descendants rather than on longstanding minority groups. Indeed, in some arenas multiculturalism has become synonymous with the demographic and social changes that stem from migration, resulting in the conflation of multiculturalism with immigration policy. This is sometimes seen in debates about whether multiculturalism as a demographic fact undermines social capital and social cohesion. When the term multiculturalism is evoked in these debates, it usually refers to population diversity, not a particular philosophy or public policy.\nTypically, however, multiculturalism means more than demographic pluralism. It can also be a philosophy centered on recognizing, accommodating, and supporting cultural pluralism. The philosophy of mult"}

{"idx": "29099", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Czech Republic, specifically Prague, is a popular destination for travelers, and, unlike the USA, there\u2019s no worry about applying for an ESTA visa or the Czech equivalent! Members of the EU, the U.S., Canada, Australia etc. don\u2019t need a visa to visit the Czech Republic, so book your flights, get packed, and read up on some of our culture tips for your trip to the Czech Republic.\nThe main thing to remember when traveling to the Czech Republic is that, in general, the Czech people will appear quite hesitant at first. Initial meetings may be filled with small talk, and you\u2019ll often find that in more formal situations, a handshake is likely and sometimes even expected from both men and women. Wine or flowers are suitable gifts when bringing a gift to someone\u2019s home, and expect to have to take your shoes off! Some families may provide their guests with \u2018guest slippers,\u2019 which you can wear around the home until it is time to leave. If you decide to go out for dinner rather than visit someone\u2019s home, however, expect to pay a 10% or 15% tip, if the restaurant is more upmarket.\nDomestic culture in the Czech Republic is heavily influenced by and revolves around family, and you\u2019ll often find that it can and will take precedence over a social life. Some Universities even close their campus and dormitories on weekends so students can visit their families rather than stay on campus. It\u2019s common that you\u2019ll find two or more generations within each family home, and within the household, the roles are very clearly defined.\nThe men are usually the breadwinners of the household, bringing in the main and doing practical jobs around the home. Women, on the other hand, are encouraged to priorities childcare over work. This is made easier by the country\u2019s generous maternity benefits, including up to four years maternity leave per child, but this way of life has led to inequality in the workplace. With a pay gap 6% behind the rest of the EU, the struggle for equality is clear.\nIf you happen to be traveling for work, it\u2019s important to remember that business meetings in the Czech Republic are always formal affairs. Business dress is always worn, and there\u2019ll probably be an exchange of business cards too. Polite, non-confrontational attitude is typically adopted by everyone there, and it might even seem hesitant at first. But don\u2019t worry, while hesitancy can be an indirect way of saying no in these situations, it can also be a form of politeness.\nDon\u2019t turn up ridiculously early, and make sure you\u2019re invited before you do. Turning up early or at all if you\u2019re unexpected can be considered a major faux-pas, and should be avoided to save the embarrassment of not only you but of your peers too.\nIt\u2019s also important to consider that if the person you\u2019re doing business with doesn\u2019t speak English fluently, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll prefer communication by email. Give the recipient time to fully digest what has been said, rather than call them and force them to face the on-the-spot of trying to translate and understand the language immediately."}

Congress back in 1972 approved the federal constitutional amendment guaranteeing women equal rights and sent it to the states for ratification, but it sank without enough states\u2019 support. For years, activists have championed bills to add an Equal Rights Amendment to Minnesota\u2019s Constitution, but gotten nowhere.\nThis year, ERA bills introduced by DFL lawmakers into a Republican-controlled Legislature face a similar fate. But bolstered by the swell of activism that has followed the election of President Donald Trump, including massive turnout at the Women\u2019s March in January, supporters say they are feeling a surge of energy.\nThe gathering of ERA supporters and organizers of the Women\u2019s March Minnesota coincided with International Women\u2019s Day. It was also the date for the Women\u2019s March-led effort to get women to stay home from work, avoid spending money and wear red as a show of numbers and economic power.\nAmong the chief concerns of amendment supporters are pay disparities between women and men in the workplace. Other issues raised by advocates at a news conference on Wednesday included domestic violence and sexual assault, pregnancy and other women\u2019s health issues and women\u2019s incarceration. They said legal threats to women\u2019s rights will always be a problem unless specific protection is granted in the Constitution.\nHundreds of women pushed Wednesday at the State Capitol in St. Paul for Minnesota to pass the Equal Rights Amendment to the state Constitution.\nThe bills introduced in the Legislature have two goals: getting the state to add an amendment protecting women\u2019s rights to the state Constitution and urging extension of the deadline for getting enough states on board with the federal amendment. When Congress originally passed the amendment, states had 10 years to approve it, with 38 needed to make it official. Supporters see hope in recent actions by lawmakers in Nevada, where Democrats took control of the Legislature in November and appear ready to ratify the amendment.\nMinnesota ratified the federal amendment in 1973, but never included similar language in its own Constitution.\nCritics of the ERA have voiced concerns about how the amendment could make women subject to a military draft and disrupt traditional gender roles. Some have wondered if the amendment is necessary alongside other laws banning discrimination on the basis of gender.\nBut supporters like Rep. Rena Moran, DFL-St. Paul, author of one of the Minnesota bills, said those laws don\u2019t fix problems that persist, decades after the ERA was introduced."}
{"idx": "29110", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: A new study shows that moms with breast cancer who previously breastfed have a lower chance of that cancer returning.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that breastfeeding lowers your chances of developing breast cancer, but this study examined the relationship a bit further, a fact that the researchers say may make it one of the first of its kind.\nA study of over 1,600 women with breast cancer revealed that those who had previously nursed a child had a 30 percent decreased risk of their breast cancer returning. They also discovered that those women had a 28 percent less chance of dying from the disease than their peers who never breastfed.\nThe study involved two groups of women, some who were diagnosed from 1997 to 2000 and others who were diagnosed from 2006 to 2013. Most were patients at Kaiser Permanente. The study showed a trend toward more positive outcomes for those afflicted with breast cancer, but the study authors do say the research doesn\u2019t prove cause and effect \u2014 it only shows a link.\nThey also found that it didn\u2019t seem to matter how long a mom breastfed her child, but there was less of a link when the duration was six months or less.\nIt should be noted that the connection was strongest when they studied women who had some of the most common types of breast cancers \u2014 those that are known as luminal A subtypes, which includes tumors called estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive). The statistics weren\u2019t as strongly linked with other subtypes of breast cancers.\nEven though it doesn\u2019t show a specific cause and effect, this is encouraging, positive news. Lead author Marilyn Kwan, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente division of research, says that breastfeeding causes physical changes that include maturation of cells in the breast that can have a protective effect, making them more resistant to cancer. Breastfeeding also often reduces the number of menstrual cycles a woman experiences over her lifetime, which results in less exposure to hormones."}
{"idx": "29111", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: There is an enduring fear in the music industry that artificial intelligence will replace the artists we love, and end creativity as we know it.\nAs ridiculous as this claim may be, it\u2019s grounded in concrete evidence. Last December, an AI-composed song populated several New Music Friday playlists on Spotify, with full support from Spotify execs. An entire startup ecosystem is emerging around services that give artists automated songwriting recommendations, or enable the average internet user to generate customized instrumental tracks at the click of a button.\nBut AI\u2019s long-term impact on music creation isn\u2019t so cut and dried. In fact, if we as an industry are already thinking so reductively and pessimistically about AI from the beginning, we\u2019re sealing our own fates as slaves to the algorithm. Instead, if we take the long view on how technological innovation has made it progressively easier for artists to realize their creative visions, we can see AI\u2019s genuine potential as a powerful tool and partner, rather than as a threat.\nIronically, AI-generated music is nothing \u201cnew\u201d in music history. As early as the 1950s, experimental composers were writing music using randomized statistical models. A few decades later, David Bowie worked with former Universal Music Group CTO Ty Roberts to build the Verbasizer -- a program that prompted Bowie to input as many as 25 sentences and word groups into a series of windows, which the program then reordered randomly into new, potentially significant lyrical combinations.\n\u201cI can then re-imbue [the Verbasizer] with an emotive quality if I want to, or take it as it writes itself,\u201d said Bowie, as memorialized in the documentary Inspirations. \u201cSome of the things I\u2019ll actually empathize with terrifically.\u201d In other words, Bowie saw this chaotic (if elementary) AI as a means of elevating, rather than stifling, his art -- and he ultimately used many of the Verbasizer\u2019s output in his iconic Berlin Trilogy of albums in the late 1970s, which many consider to be his best work.\nHence, what\u2019s new in 2018 isn\u2019t so much the technology: it\u2019s the money. Major labels, streaming services, VC firms and other stakeholders are investing more and more cash in trying to build scalable, AI-generated music products for the masses.\nAlmost immediately upon joining Spotify, Pachet reunited with Carr\u00e9 to help promote a new, AI-composed music project on the streaming platform called SKYGGE. One of SKYGGE\u2019s hit singles -- \u201cHello Shadow,\u201d featuring Kiesza -- appeared on Spotify\u2019s flagship New Music Friday playlist in Dec. 2017, as well as on localized NMF playlists in the U.K., Norway and Scandinavia.\nThrough its in-house Magenta project, Google is also developing deep-learning algorithms for generating songs, drawings and other artworks. One of its most popular music projects, Performance RNN, uses neural networks to give expressive, human-like timing and dynamics to otherwise stagnant, machine-generated MIDI files. All of Magenta\u2019s tools are open-source, and real artists are already using these tools to write their own songs.\nIn the startup world, companies like Splice and Amadeus Code are building similarly AI-facilitated assistants for songwriters and producers.

Eventually, the funds raised will go directly to the cathedral, she said.\nThe organization, which was founded in 1982, gave two grants last year totaling more than $430,000 for restoration projects at France\u2019s national library, she said.\nAt the website GoFundMe, more than 50 campaigns related to the cathedral fire had been launched globally on Monday, John Coventry, a spokesman for Go Fund Me, said by email.\n\u201cIn the coming hours we\u2019ll be working with the authorities to find the best way of making sure funds get to the place where they will do the most good,\u201d Coventry said.\n\u201cI think the challenge will be whether or not people who give the money agree with those who are doing the rebuilding about how the cathedral should be rebuilt,\u201d said Lisa Bitel, a professor of religion and history at the University of Southern California.\nNotre\u2013Dame Cathedral has looked to international donors for past renovation efforts.\nIn 2017, Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre\u2013Dame De Paris, told the New York Times his group planned to organize gala dinners, concerts and other events to raise funds in France and the United States for restoration work at the cathedral."}

The area, which lies between Bridge St., the Bonaventure Expressway and Mill St., is reportedly being eyed for a baseball stadium.\nAccording to Sylvain Gaudet, a researcher with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019histoire de Pointe-Saint-Charles, the typhus victims were initially housed in sheds near the Peel Basin; later, sheds were built for them on the Goose Village site.\nGaudet says that archaeological research is needed to determine what traces remain of the thousands buried at the two sites.\nArchaeologist Anne-Marie Balac, who worked for Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Culture for 27 years and is now a consultant, told the Montreal Gazette that \u201cit\u2019s unthinkable\u201d to allow any project to be built without a thorough investigation of what lies under the ground.\n\u201cWe know it has a very high archaeological potential because it\u2019s a cemetery,\u201d she said.\nShe said that several bodies have been unearthed during roadwork and building over the years, leaving no doubt that the site is a former cemetery.\nOn March 8, 1847, the Montreal Witness newspaper reported on the expected influx of immigrants from famine-stricken Ireland.\n"}

But the Terriers (3-1), who live and die by the run, never could begin to mount a comeback after falling behind 20-0 at the half.\nThe Terps mostly kept things simple, using their advantages up front by rolling up 250 yards rushing on 50 carries.\nSenior tailback Chris Downs, starting his fourth straight game in place of the injured Bruce Perry, gained a career-high 147 yards and scored a touchdown on 22 attempts to set the tone.\nFreshman Josh Allen added 63 yards and two scores. Quarterback Scott McBrien threw for 128 yards and ran for 38.\nThe rest of the night belonged to Maryland's defense, which knocked out tailback Jesse McCoy in the second quarter, took out tight end Adam Regenthal on a crushing hit by safety Madieu Williams, got an 11-tackle night from middle linebacker E.J. Henderson, and generally controlled Wofford up front.\nOnly a fourth-quarter, 18-play, 92-yard touchdown drive and a late safety by the Terriers foiled Maryland's shutout bid.\n\"Wofford is very scrappy, tough team. I thought our defense played exceptionally, especially in the first half. We gave them one long drive,\" Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen said. \"Offensively, we had some good spots and some bad, but overall I was pleased. I think we've still got to get better in our passing game.\"\nThe Terps had some trouble early moving the ball through the air, as Wofford dropped seven or eight defenders into coverage and presented some problems for McBrien, who completed 11 of 19 attempts.\nBut while McBrien plugged away with productive runs and smarter decisions, he always had a bruising line to fall back on, along with Downs.\nWith Perry sitting out his fifth straight game -- he aggravated his injured groin muscle in practice on Wednesday and is expected to play on Saturday -- Downs took advantage of gaping holes in the Terriers' front seven.\n\"I did OK.

SouthFront: Analysis & Intelligence stands on another ground and provides an exclusive paper studying the Turkish military grouping which will be likely used in this operation.\nWe also recommend that you view an exclusive video \u2018Foreign Policy Diary \u2013 Turkey\u2019s military intervention to Syria\u2018, which covers the possible results of this act of aggression.\nRecent public comments by the Turkish government have hinted at a possible invasion into Syrian territory to \u201cstabilize\u201d the situation and secure Turkey\u2019s national security. Significant clashes between Turkish army and security forces with elements of the YPG and PKK, which have exacted a costly toll on the Kurdish civilian population have been raging in southern Turkey and northern Syria in recent months. Russian satellite surveillance and human intelligence employed by both Russian and Syria in the region have confirmed the build-up of troops and material on the border.\nIt is reasonable to believe that Turkey is preparing to salvage its failed policy of supporting Islamic fundamentalist mercenaries and terrorist groups in Syria by invading and establishing a safe area for these groups along its southern border with Syria, while at the same time dealing a crushing blow to the Kurdish forces that have been successful in fighting them. Turkey is not only trying to topple the Assad government in Syrian, but is also trying to liquidate the Kurdish movement both in Iraq and Syria, as well as within its own borders.\nTurkey\u2019s membership in NATO complicates its plans of invasion. Unless Turkey is itself attacked, the NATO alliance is not obligated to defend it. Turkey will have to engineer a provocation that frames it as the target of an aggression either by Kurdish forces from beyond its borders or by Syrian or Russian forces combating its terrorist allies in Syria. Such a false flag provocation is not outside of the realm of possibility.\nWhen a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24, claims that the bomber had strayed into Turkish airspace for a number of minutes and ignored radio warnings from the Turkish aircraft were proven to be patently false. A year earlier in 2014, an audio recording of Turkish officials, including the head of the Security Service (MIT), Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Foreign Minister and the Undersecretary to the Foreign Minister discussing staging an attack on the Tomb of Suleiman Shah (a sovereign piece of Turkish territory) in Syria and using it as a pretext to intervene in Syria were leaked anonymously on YouTube. The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan responded by banning YouTube in Turkey, in affect giving support to the recordings authenticity. Now that the Syrian government has the upper hand militarily, gaining back territory and destroying, surrounding or pushing back various Turkish-backed terrorist forces, Turkey may be ready to engineer a new excuse to invade.\nPhotographic evidence shows that the mechanized and armored forces being used in the internal operations against the Kurds within Turkey and Syria and also the incursion into northern Iraq, are composed of relatively modern tanks and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). Reports have recently been made public that over 1,000 pieces of military equipment, likely consisting of MBTs, IFVs, self-propelled and towed artillery and their prime movers, as well as trucks and light vehicles have been massing in staging areas just north of the border. Turkish military spokesmen have stressed that they have positioned approximately 30 percent of the Turkish land forces along the border with Syria.\nThe troops belonging to these units are highly trained and motivated.

In an election that turned on the economy, they repudiated Mr Bush in 1992 and chose a relatively little-known Democratic governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, a baby boomer, ushering in a generational shift in American leadership.\nIf Mr Bush\u2019s term helped close out one era abroad, it opened another.

And to truly understand the epic saga, you need to go all the way back to the beginning of the battle.\nBefore we can talk about whiskey we need to talk about rum, since the British colonies along the northeast coast of America were famous for distilling the spirit from molasses obtained from the sugar plantations dotting the Caribbean. During the revolution, the British ended the shipments of molasses, which forced a soon free but now very thirsty America to make other kinds of liquor. Rye was particularly popular in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic states since it was a good cover crop and could survive a brutally cold winter. After retiring from politics, George Washington even owned the country\u2019s largest rye whiskey distillery on his estate Mount Vernon.\n\u201cThe Americans got no help from heaven or the saints but they knew what to do with corn. In the heroic age our forefathers invented self-government, the Constitution, and bourbon, and on the way to them they invented rye,\u201d wrote Bernard DeVoto in his 1948 drinking treatise The Hour.\nKentucky was the epicenter of bourbon production throughout the 1800s.\nIn fact, by 1896, The New York Times reported that the production of the whiskey outstripped demand. Brands were sitting on 90 million gallons of whiskey, while consumers were putting away just 20 million gallons per year.\nThe problem was so great that the state\u2019s distilleries planned to shut down for 18 months.\nHuston goes on to say that people in Kentucky still call rye by that moniker today.\nThe intense rivalry between rye and bourbon was put on hold because of World War I, Prohibition and then World War II.\nBy the late 1940s, the distillers were finally able to make whiskey again. But unfortunately for rye producers, there was a small problem: Rye\u2019s big, bold and brash flavor profile had gone out of style.\nThat\u2019s not to mention the fact that many of the Mid-Atlantic\u2019s rye farms had stopped growing the grain or had been turned into homes, thanks to the housing boom.\nBourbon took full advantage of the situation and enjoyed a golden age of production throughout the 1950s and \u201960s.\nThe bourbon distillers were even able to push through Congress a bill in May of 1964 that"}

In his Independence Day address this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the ambitious mission of sending an Indian astronaut to space by 2022. India will be the fourth country after the USA, Russia and China to send humans to space.\nAfter the take off of the mission, it will reach the orbit in 16 minutes. The crew module, while making a return to the Earth, will splash in the Arabian Sea off the Gujarat coast. Alternate provisions have also been made for a landing in the Bay of Bengal or even on land, he added. Once the crew module reaches 120 kms from earth\u2019s surface, it will land in just 36 minutes, he added.\nAddressing a press conference, Sivan said the mission may be executed six months before India completes its 75th Independence Day with the help of GSLV Mk-III launch vehicle. The spacecraft will be placed in a low earth orbit of 300-400 km and the total programme cost is expected to be less than Rs 10,000 crores, he said.\nMinister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh said the mission is much cheaper in comparison to other man missions sent to space.

She lets ingredients shine, but not to the point of oversimplification. The dishes feel mature rather than showy.\nGrilled lamb is served in slices, ruby rare at the center, with pea greens and fava beans. The meat is accompanied by two phyllo dough turnovers filled with braised lamb shoulder, apricots, mint, and other herbs. There is an underlying sweetness to the filling, lent by Lillet. This preparation will disappear when the peas and favas do. This is the sadness of seasonal eating, but also the thing that keeps us returning for more as the menu shifts and diversifies.

It has now raised a total of $52 million in funding.\nIt was also revealed that David Hornik, General Partner of August Capital, will also be joining the Board of Directors at Massdrop.\nMassdrop is a community commerce platform that makes it possible for enthusiast communities to buy together. When multiple people get together and use their combined purchasing power to buy something, it's called a \u201cdrop.\"\n\"We started this company three years ago with the goal of building better community for enthusiasts, who were passionate and knowledgeable and who care a lot about their hobby or interest. That can be audiophiles, or quilters or people who make ther own beer,\" Steve El-Hage, co-founder and CEO of Massdrop, told me in an interview.\n\"There are hundreds of communities online who are supportive, where you can ask questions, and who are very willing to help. They create amazing content and they total hundreds of millions of people, but historically, forums, which used to be cutting edge in 1993 1994, have not really progressed. They are stagnant, and they have seen little to no technological innovation. We wanted to rethink the way groups interact as a community, not by making a better forum, but by creating a better comminication platform.\"\nThe founders decided to do this in pieces, and to see what was happening on forums and what could be done better. One thing they saw right away: forums had become places for people to buy and sell goods, but without any structure around them.\n\"Group buys have been happening on forums since the beginning, where one person comes on, comes up with product to buy, and sees who wants to buy in bulk. It can be hundreds of people, and so they all get a discount. Everyone in the community benefits. For someone into quilting, they would buy the fabric, cut it up and ship it. Or someone in the beer community would buy grains, and repackage and ship them,\" El-Hage said.\n\"The problems is that it took six to 12 months to do the shipping, vendors didn't like working with mobs, and there were meaningful tax implications if you were wired a lot of money, since the IRS wants their take. We wanted to make the process better, and we built version in seven days.\"\nThe next thing the site did, around seven to eight months ago, was try to tap into the knowledge that its users have, to see it could use how much they know about their categories to help create new types of products.\n\"We have hundreds of thousands of audiophile users.

You have chosen Rahul as your leader. He is my son, and it would not be suitable for me to praise him.

She recalled how nervous she was \"that my hands were shaking\" 20 years ago when she made her first address as Congress President. \"I could not think how I would manage to take charge of this historic organization. It was a formidable and onerous task that confronted me.\" Gandhi reluctantly joined politics after her husband former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed in a suicide bombing in 1991 -- seven years after her mother-in-law and then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was shot dead by her own bodyguard in 1984.\nShe said until her entery into the political limelight, her connection with politics had been entirely personal. \"As you all know, it was through my marriage that I came into contact with politics. Indiraji was the daughter of a revolutionary family which had surrendered its wealth and ease for the Independence movement. Each and every member of this family had been to prison in the cause of freedom. Indiraji accepted me as a daughter and from her I learned about the culture of this country, about those principles on which this nation was founded.\" She almost broke down and recalled Indira Gandhi's assassination in a choked voice.\n\"In 1984, when she was assassinated, I felt as if I had lost my own mother. That catastrophe changed forever the course of my life.

I lost my anchor and my support. It was many years later that I could emerge from my shell. Only when I came to feel that the Congress was facing a crisis, and that communal forces were gaining strength, did I feel compelled to respond to the call of the party workers.\n\"I felt that my turning away from this summons would negate the sacrifice of my mother-in-law's life and my husband's life.

And taking a cue from the makers of television sets, washing machines and consumer products, Geisinger essentially guarantees its workmanship, charging a flat fee that includes 90 days of follow-up treatment.\nEven if a patient suffers complications or has to come back to the hospital, Geisinger promises not to send the insurer another bill.\nGeisinger is by no means the only hospital system currently rethinking ways to better deliver care that might also reduce costs. But Geisinger\u2019s effort is noteworthy as a distinct departure from the typical medical reimbursement system in this country, under which doctors and hospitals are paid mainly for delivering more care \u2014 not necessarily better care.\nSince Geisinger began its experiment in February 2006, focusing on elective heart bypass surgery, it says patients have been less likely to return to intensive care, have spent fewer days in the hospital and are more likely to return directly to their own homes instead of a nursing home.\nGeisinger presented the first-year results of its experimental program at a meeting last month of the American Surgical Association.\nGeisinger stands out as a group that has transformed the way it delivers care, said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, the chief executive of Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a national nonprofit organization whose goal is better patient care.\nIn almost no other field would consumers tolerate the frequency of error that is common in medicine, Dr. Berwick said, and Geisinger has managed to reduce the rate significantly. \u201cGetting everything right is really, really hard,\u201d he said.\nIt is still too early to know whether the approach, which Geisinger calls ProvenCare, will catch on with employers and health insurers.\nSo far, the only insurer that Geisinger has contracted with under the new arrangement is its own insurance unit, which covers about 210,000 people in Pennsylvania. Eventually, though, Geisinger hopes to attract other insurers and employers that provide health benefits by expanding the approach into other lines of care provided by the nearly 660 doctors it employs at its three hospitals and 55 offices in the region.\nGeisinger is trying to address what it views as a fundamental flaw in the typical medical reimbursement system.\nUnder the typical system, missing an antibiotic or giving poor instructions when a patient is released from the hospital results in a perverse reward: the chance to bill the patient again if more treatment is necessary. As a result, doctors and hospitals have little incentive to ensure they consistently provide the treatments that medical research has shown to produce the best results.\nResearchers estimate that roughly half of American patients never get the most basic recommended treatments \u2014 like an aspirin after a heart attack, for example, or antibiotics before hip surgery.\nThe wide variation in treatments can translate to big differences in death rates and surgical complications. In Pennsylvania alone, the mortality rate during a hospital stay for heart surgery varies from zero in the best-performing hospitals to nearly 10 percent at the worst performer, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, a state agency.\nAround the world, other modern industries \u2014 whether car manufacturing or computer chip making \u2014 have long understood the importance of improving each piece of the production process to tamp down"}

Last week, Obama signed a proclamation extending the boundaries of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea National Monument, a marine reserve that surrounds the outer islands of the Hawaiian archipelago. The reserve is home to 7,000 species of birds, fish, turtles and coral \u2014 many of them endangered.\n\"It is also spectacular as an ecosystem,\" he said, arguing that by permanently protecting the area from fishing and future development it will \"generate the kind of biodiversity that allows us to study it, research and understand our oceans better than we ever have before.\"\nObama is in the midst of a 10-day foreign-and-domestic trip that will focus largely on environmental issues. In Lake Tahoe, Nev. on Wednesday, Obama linked conservation and climate change, and later flew to Honolulu where he addressed the leaders of Pacific Island nations whose entire existence are threatened by rising seas.\nOn Saturday, he'll arrive in China for an economic summit where he will try to cement support for the worldwide climate deal signed in Paris last year.\nBrian Deese, the president's chief climate adviser, compared the Pacific trip to Obama's Alaska visit exactly one year ago, where he toured melting glaciers and became the first president to trek north of the Arctic Circle. \"And because the president has a spotlight, him actually going and visiting these places raises the profile in a way that might not happen otherwise,\" Deese said.\nBut this trip is even closer to Obama's heart, aides said.\n\"This is the president\u2019s home state,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One \u2014 a smaller Boeing 757 version better equipped to land on the island's shorter runway. \"It\u2019s not a stretch to say that the president feels this personally.

The island \u2014 technically an atoll because it's built on coral reefs rather than the volcanic rock of the Hawaiian Islands \u2014 was once controlled by the military but is now under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service, which restricts visits to research and educational purposes.\nOn the aptly named Turtle Beach, Obama looked out at the blue waters, turned to reporters and said, \"I can't wait to get in.\"\nThe White House said Obama planned to go snorkeling with friends to see the marine life on the atoll's submerged cor"}

So why aren't more buying in?\nWhen it comes to Opportunity Zones, investors are excited about the potential for tremendous tax savings, but many are not buying in just yet. What\u2019s the problem?\nLingering questions about how, exactly, Opportunity Zones work have left investors feeling gun shy.\nThe Department of the Treasury is tasked with issuing the regulation that guides Opportunity Zones, and it\u2019s expected to release a second round of rules through the Internal Revenue Service to provide clarification in the coming weeks.\nIn the meantime, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning to issue a formal Request for Information on Friday to seek input from the public on how the agency can use its authority to maximize the impact of these tax incentives to help the distressed communities they are intended to benefit.\nCreated by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, Opportunity Zones seek to spark economic development in distressed areas by encouraging long-term investments through significant tax breaks.\nMore than 8,700 communities that are home to approximately 35 million Americans have been designated as Opportunity Zones.\nInvestments in these areas must be made within 180 days of receiving the capital gains, which can come in the form of stocks, bonds, real estate or partnership interests. But the capital cannot be invested directly into a property and funds must invest 90% of their capital into Opportunity Zone properties.\nShareholders will be rewarded with tax breaks based on how long they keep the interest in the funds. Those who keep their investments for five years will pay no taxes on 10% of their gains; at seven years they will pay no taxes on 15% of gains; and if they hold their investments for 10 years, they pay no taxes on their gains at all.\nThe potential savings here is clearly enticing for investors, but many are wary of diving in.\nAccording to an article published Wednesday by Bloomberg, the tax opportunity has created a \u201cfrenzy\u201d among accounting, law and real estate firms as well as private client groups, with numerous financial entities issuing white papers and hosting well-attended seminars that excitedly detail the tax benefits.\nBut despite the avid push from developers, accountants and law firms, few investors are taking the bait.\nWhile HUD estimates that Opportunity Zones could spur as much as $100 billion a year in investments, evidence suggests this potential is far from being realized.\nBloomberg noted that real estate data firm CoStar Reality Information is tracking the progress of more than 258 funds, but a database that specifically tracks these funds \u2013 OpportunityDB \u2013 reported only 88 funds that have raised a total of $26.4 billion as of this month.\nAlfonso Costa, HUD\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said the agency could not confirm any published stats on the number of existing funds or the capital raised so far. But he did say that he expects the Treasury\u2019s pending second wave of guidance to spur more action.\nHousingWire reached out to the IRS for details on the release of new guidelines but had not heard back as of press time.\nFor its part, HUD is seeking comment on what it can do to aid in the uptake of this program and ensure that the residents living in Opportunity Zone communities receive the intended benefit.\nCosta said more than one third of HUD\u2019s public housing units reside within Opportunity Zones, and that 2.4 million people living in these areas receive rental assistance from HUD."}

I quickly realized that, domesticated or not, there are certain realities that come with a 45-pound animal living in your house.\nThere are certainly positive aspects to having a dog. They offer companionship, loyalty and comic relief, but those aren't the qualities I find myself relating to friends and family members in the stories I tell about ours.\nMore often than not, I find myself focusing on the number of cooling muffins she ate while I was in the shower or the time our house smelled for hours like excrement and bleach after we wanted to sleep in a little bit one morning instead of taking her out right away.\nI would never give our dog up, and I'm glad she's with us, but when my future children ask me if they can have one of their own \u2014 one they'll clean up after and feed and take for walks \u2014 I'll stare off into the distance as my face grows ever sullen and ask them if they wouldn't rather have some ice cream instead.\nContact John Hou"}

Over the school holidays, she will be running two etiquette and character education workshops, lasting for three hours and costing about $100. There will also be three half-day programmes conducted at childcare centres.\nDuring the classes, pupils aged four to 13 will learn about values such as respect, responsibility and empathy through interactive games. For example, children are given flash cards and asked to decide if the scenario depicted reflects a certain value, such as respect. Scenarios can include greeting a teacher or helping a friend on the slide at the playground.\nMs Clara Tan, 35, who runs Molly Manners Singapore, an etiquette school, has also seen more interest in her classes. The school has received about 30 per cent more inquiries from schools and parents since 2013.\nThe classes emphasise not just table manners, but long-lasting life skills as well.\nThis June holidays, it will be organising three-day holiday camps for children aged four to 12.

Half of the funds take the long side, betting that the underlying index rises.

Of the 979, Russell considers 776 of them to be mid-cap.\nThe growth and value indices are constructed based on the price-to-book ratios and forecasted growth of the index members.

Lower financial statistics would imply value stocks.\nSurprisingly, of the 979 stocks in the Russell 1000 Index, 607 are members of the Russell 1000 Value Index and 678 are Growth Index members. At first glance, this doesn't add up. Russell Investment Group says that each stock has a probability of being growth or value.\nIf the probability is 40% growth and 60% value, then the stock is allocated 40% to the growth index and 60% to the value index. About 30% of stocks have some portion in both value and growth indexes.\nThe last bit of accounting magic is the use of leverage.

Several dozen of the \"low dose\" studies they found claim effects of BPA at doses that humans are thought to encounter in their everyday lives.\nThey say that BPA exposure, both in vitro and in vivo, contributes to a large range of health problems in humans, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, immune response to allergens, behavioral problems and decreased fertility. The effects on wildlife were also widespread in their review.\nWill it hold up? BPA is certainly at DDT and alar levels of hysteria - and reviews are only as good as the material being reviewed. The authors went out of their way to review studies finding problems with BPA, which lacks a valid null hypothesis, and it's published in Endocrine Disruptors. Their confidence notwithstanding, BPA needs to be examined carefully before it is vilified more."}

The system is rated with a head of 2.65 mH2O (8.69 ft H2O) and can push 165 litres (about 43.6 gallons) per hour, which means adding additional components shouldn\u2019t be an issue!

{"idx": "29198", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The kind of market we are in right now is ridiculous, and nowhere was that more apparent than the way the financial media fawned over the recent earnings report from Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR).\n\u201cTwitter Makes a Profit\u201d is what most headlines said, in some form or another.\nHowever, when investors dig into the actual results, although TWTR stock technically did make a quarterly profit, how it got there is the real story. These headlines are noise and most investors get duped by them instead of drilling down into the real story, which is what my stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio, does.\nSo, as we dive into these numbers, remember that every TWTR stock bull thinks this is a fast-growing company deserving of a ridiculous price-earnings ratio and valuation.\nRevenue grew 2% year over year to $732 million. That\u2019s right, two percent. So much for \u201cfast-growing\u201d. Yet, somehow, TWTR stock investors are supposed to cheer the fact that it was the first increase all year long after three quarters of declining revenue?\nIndeed, for the year, revenue was down 3% to $2.4 billion. That\u2019s right, down.\nIf you haven\u2019t already guessed that user growth is, well, non-existent, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Stop tweeting and keep reading.\nMonthly active users were flat from the previous quarter. They increased by only 12 million YOY, or about 4%. One look at the chart of subscribers shows that they are clearly leveling out \u2014 and have been for some time. If you want to see how TWTR stock management wants to bury this information, there is no mention of how many people were added in its slide presentation \u2014 just the fact that Twitter stock is allegedly now driven by 330 million subscribers.\nBy the way, US revenue fell 8% YOY. The growth is now coming entirely from international increases. This tells us that pretty much any American who wants to use Twitter is using it. Done. Given that Twitter was busted in a recent expos\u00e9 about censoring political posts and individuals it doesn\u2019t like, that will only lead to less usage.\nSo now we get into the meat of the TWTR stock story. If Twitter fails to grow its audiences, advertising revenues will continue to flatten or decline, which means, somehow, TWTR has to raise rates to squeeze more margin and growth from the existing subscriber base.\nI don\u2019t see how the company does this.\nBut as for this wonderful profit that Twitter stock generated, ask yourself how that can happen on flat user growth and a tiny revenue increase.\nTWTR stock cut $68 million from its R&D and another $71 million from sales and marketing. And if I stop going out to dinner and make food at home, and stop paying my gardener and stop purchasing alcohol, I can cut my household budget to profit, also.\nTwitter lost $457 million this year, and if the only way to generate a profit is to cut yourself to death, then what\u2019s the point? Twitter stock soared on this news and now has come down a bit. Still, it\u2019s trading at $33.30, up 7.59%, as I write this \u2014 far above where it traded during last year\u2019s failed buyout talks.\nIf it wasn\u2019t bought out for a perceived premium of $23 or so then, how could it be worth $33 now?

Rockstar Games' open-world adventure is already being called game of the decade by some, but it hasn't stopped others pointing out Arthur Morgan's sometimes sluggish response times.\nAs the follow-up/prequel to 2010's acclaimed Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar has managed to go above and beyond with Red Dead Redemption 2. Earning a record-breaking opening weekend, the ambitious wild Western managed to shift 17 million copies and outsell its predecessor in just eight days. Red Dead Redemption 2 is being heralded as a masterpiece, but it doesn't mean it comes without problems.\nEA Motive's Dan Lowe posted a video on YouTube and compared a selection of AAA titles. Under the microscope were the likes of Destiny 2, Spider-Man, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Destiny 2 came out on top and takes just one frame to react. On the other end of the spectrum, Red Dead Redemption 2 came last and took up to 11 frames before Arthur Morgan responded to controls.\nConsidering Rockstar put so much detail into Red Dead Redemption 2, it might be easy to see why the expansive world is causing some delays. That being said, other open-world titles like Spider-Man and Assassin's Creed Odyssey are shown to be much quicker on the video. Admittedly, Spider-Man was criticized for simply recreating the same citizens and parts of the New York skyline where Red Dead Redemption 2 is a lot more detailed.\nTo be fair to Rockstar, this is just one video. As well as the television gamers play on affecting the game, Red Dead Redemption 2's numerous animations can also add to the feeling of lag. While Lowe's findings aren't wholly conclusive, fans on ResetEra were quick to point out the \"weighty\" nature of Red Dead Redemption 2. Looking at the comments, other critics pointed out that the award-winning Grand Theft Auto V is also remembered for clunky controls when trying to move Trevor, Michael, and Franklin.\nWhatever anyone's thoughts on Red Dead Redemption 2's lag complaints, it's a relatively minor issue in a game that is so big. It's also important to remember that Rockstar has only just unveiled Red Dead Redemption 2 and developers are just getting started with the game. With rumors the franchise's first ever PC release and the highly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 Online, expect some sluggish controls to soon be forgotten."}

DPD charged him \u00a3150 when he attended one specialist renal appointment and he then missed others. He collapsed twice during rounds, including once while driving.\nRuth Lane has lodged a claim at the employment tribunal in Bristol which alleges that Lane was ill and vomiting blood but attended work due to his fear of being fined for failing to attend work without permission. He completed his route but collapsed with a heart attack when he got home and died shortly afterwards in hospital.\nThe claim also highlights the pressure Lane faced from DPD\u2019s system of allocating short windows for each delivery which give customers certainty about when parcels will arrive.\nLane\u2019s death was raised in parliament where both Labour and Conservatives reacted with outrage. It led to DPD promising to scrap the \u00a3150 charges and offering couriers sick pay. The company made \u00a3110m profit in the UK in 2016.\nRuth Lane alleges her husband was bogusly self-employed and should have been classed as an employee with access to sick pay, holiday pay and the minimum wage. If the employment tribunal rules in her favour, DPD could be forced to change its entire business model which relies on self-employed couriers, which it describes as franchisees, being paid per parcel.\nA similar claim of bogus self-employment was upheld in the employment tribunal against the minicab firm Uber in 2017.\nRuth Lane also alleges that DPD breached the Equalities Act by not adjusting its procedures to accommodate Lane\u2019s health condition.\nIt also says Lane was given a rural route with long drives between stops, when he should have been given a more urban route with shorter stops to allow him to take more regular breaks and buy food.\nLane collapsed twice at work with hypoglycemia, the first time at the wheel of his van, after which he was taken to hospital, the claim states. After the second collapse, three months before his death, his wife confronted his manager, Matt Poore.\nShe complained that Lane\u2019s route had not been changed despite his repeated requests. When Poore denied this, Ruth said other drivers had been given new routes which were local and less demanding, which Poore also denied.\nShe pointed out that he needed regular meal breaks to maintain his blood sugar levels and Poore said this would be possible. However, the claim says, Lane and other DPD couriers started working to a system known by them as \u201cprecise\u201d, which introduced shorter delivery windows that could not be changed by the driver.\nLane often struggled to meet the required timeframes and complete all his deliveries. He was told he could be \u201cbreached\u201d for missing slots and that three breaches could result in dismissal.\nA spokesman for DPD said the company was \u201cunable to comment on any potential employment tribunal matters\u201d.\nHe said drivers would be able to apply for a worker contract, rather than self-employment, from later this month. The contract would be for an average \u00a328,800 per annum, based on a five-day week, with 28 days\u2019 paid holiday, a pension and sick pay."}

The answer is unclear and it sounds like more novelty at this point. It\u2019s sometimes hard enough to get one other person on a mobile video call let alone three others.\nBut as we get more comfortable with video chatting and more devices including TVs support video chat services, I think it makes sense to offer as many options as possible. Take a look at a video of Fring\u2019s group video chat in action below."}

The award recipients dedicated years to federally funded projects that seemed downright odd at first, but made economically and socially valuable breakthroughs.\nThe Golden Goose award celebrates scientists who conduct basic research \u2014 studies that reveal the fundamental truths of nature \u2014 and use creative solutions for wide-scale problems. With this award, Cooper hopes to educate both Congress and the public about the value for federally funded research. [Basic research] depends on a deep understanding of what\u2019s going on in the world, and nothing is more vital to government function,\u201d he said.\nIn 1996, the National Zoo in D.C. witnessed many deaths in their blue poison dart frogs, and around the world, several other frog species met a similar fate. The zoo\u2019s veterinary pathologists had an inkling of a microscopic organism was causing this devastating outbreak, but they still needed expert advice.\nSince the 1980s, biologist Joyce Longcore had spent hours upon hours at the University of Maine familiarizing herself with a group of fungi called chytrids. Because she knew the ins and outs of these obscure organisms, the National Zoo called her to verify the culprit behind the mass frog die-offs. Sure enough, Longcore was able to isolate a chytrid fungus from the zoo\u2019s frogs, which confirmed that chytrids were annihilating frogs across the globe. \u201cThese fungi were inadvertently introduced to where they were not native and decimated biota,\u201d Longcore said. She added that fungi transported from different continents were long known for killing off native species. For example, other fungi have attacked American chestnut and elm trees, preventing them from maturing into healthy adults.\nWATCH: Brian Gratwicke, head of amphibian conservation programs at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, discusses frogs and killer fungus.\nWith her colleagues Don Nichols, Elaine Lamirande and Allan Pessier, and through funding from the National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution, Longcore raised awareness to an invasive species wreaking global havoc. All four will receive the Golden Goose award tonight, but Longcore said their work is not done. Their next step is to treat any afflicted frog species and sustain biodiversity.\nFor wood chemist Kaichang Li, inspiration sat underwater and on seaside cliffs.\nLi always sought novel substances to effectively and safely process wood. Knowing this, a colleague mentioned how mussels stick to wet and rugged surfaces, which was a major challenge when making water-resistant adhesives for plywood. At Oregon State University, Li studied the mollusks and noticed that proteins played a huge role in their binding strength. He wanted to make a glue out of the mussel protein, but he could only extract miniscule amounts at a time. It would definitely not satisfy the nearly 50 million pounds of glue needed for plywood each year, Li explained.\nSo Li turned to one of the most abundant protein sources he could find: soybeans. This agricultural commodity is not only in excess, but it has far more proteins with properties similar to those in muss"}

Today, however, a quick check of BFG\u0622\u2019s website shows that the days of simply supplying high end video solutions are a thing of the past and it is spreading out into a number of areas including branding computer power supply units, or \u0622\u201cPSUs.\u0622\u201d BFG\u0622\u2019s power supplies have to date typically been built by the Taiwanese company Topower or more distantly in the past ATNG. However, today the times they are a-changin' and we have the opportunity to look at a brand new power supply product from BFG that comes from a new OEM for BFG in the ES-800 (BFGR800WESPSU) built by Andyson.\nAndyson is a company that end users may or may not be familiar with as they have provided the basis for a number of Hiper power supplies, Sunbeamtech power supplies, and probably at this point most famously Ultra. Ultra has used Andyson to produce some spectacular products including to date the single highest DC output power supply for a standard PC available in North America the Ultra X3 1600w. Today\u0622\u2019s Andyson built offering comes in at exactly half that DC output but represents a radically new design for Andyson built units that promises to be interesting as we will see in a bit.\nThe first time we reviewed a BFG power supply the results were less than what both BFG and we had hoped for. That was exactly one year ago today, and in that year BFG has launched a completely new program to revamp its power supply product lines by bringing in knowledgeable engineering talent and new PSU original equipment manufacturers. The first of the products from this program we have here today in the form of the BFGTech ES-800 PSU. Now while BFG has previously marketed power supplies in the 1000w range the ES-800 is not quite that aggressive and is slotted into BFG\u0622\u2019s lineup at the 800w level displacing the current Topower built 800w unit. Since this new PSU is slotted into the same range as the previously offered Topower built 800w unit, what makes the new ES-800 different from the previous 800w unit BFG offered?\nBFG\u0622\u2019s new ES-800 power supply features four PCI Express connectors for multiple graphics card support, the new 8-pin PCI Express connector, Quad +12V rails and 80% and up efficiency and carries NVIDIA SLI certification for 8800 GTX.\nBy using \u0622\u201cFrequency Conversion\u0622\u201d technology, the ES-800 power supply can actually emulate virtually any size power supply up to 800W and therefore be at least 80% efficient, even with loads as low as 10% of the unit\u0622\u2019s maximum capability.\nThe product information for the ES-800 is certainly fascinating in regards to the \u0622\u201cFrequency Conversion\u0622\u201d technology allowing the unit to emulate any size power supply up to 800w.

So why does it feel like you\u2019re missing out?\nFOMO is a term that\u2019s only been around since the mid-2000s, but the concept has been prevalent on college campuses nationwide for decades. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, is the product of one\u2019s own anxieties on missing opportunities mixed with messages and external signals received from the outside world.\nAs a part of a large school, it is normal to want to feel like an active part of a whole, and when biology junior Patricia Bal transferred to UT, she felt no different.\nBal is not the first student to get over-involved on campus, and probably won\u2019t be the last. Social media plays a continuous loops of exciting content posted by friends, and it\u2019s tempting to want to be a part of all that excitement. Andrew Dillon, a professor at the School of Information at UT-Austin said the presence of social media does have an effect on an individual\u2019s point of view and could enhance a fear of missing out.\nDillon also said if the content we view on social media sets the expectations of normalcy, then the viewer may feel a sense of FOMO if they are not sharing in the same experience. For junior radio-television-film senior Veronica Alvarez-Ferreira, FOMO has played a role in how she manages her time.\nJunior communication studies major Georgia Herr said attending events is a big part of feeling like you belong.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t go to the big parties, you weren\u2019t really part of the culture,\u201d Herr said.\nHerr and Alvarez-Ferreira are not alone.

It was also concluded in the studies that individuals with high ranking scores on the FOMO test were more likely to check texts and emails while driving, as well as get distracted by their social media during university lectures.\nRobert Lewis, media psychologist in the Stan Richards School of Advertising commented that FOMO is often inflated by the addition of new technologies, in this example, social media, and how the presentation of everyone\u2019s best self is unachievable for a single person to replicate."}

We can change that. We must change that.\"\nTara Servatius' June 26 column \"Why does the government continue to promote biking?\" did exactly what Servatius does best \u2014 piss a lot of folks off. She's excellent at raising the volume rather than elevating the discourse, and her particular tone of shrill seems to be effective at one thing \u2014 driving traffic to the City Paper website. Unfortunately, it does nothing to help traffic flow around Charleston, which was the alleged subject matter of her rant against making the West Ashley Legare Bridge safer for bicyclists and pedestrians.\nWhile many incensed readers were asking why the City Paper continues to promote Servatius, I'm glad for the fodder. Despite Servatius' flimsy logic and blatant rehash of a column published in 2010, she makes some valid points. Yes, bicycling in busy, high-traffic areas is risky and can be dangerous. Yes, bicyclists and pedestrians are likely to be hurt \u2014 or worse \u2014 by inattentive, reckless drivers. And true, not all roads are designed to accommodate bikes. But Servatius' argument that bicycling and walking are dangerous, ergo government should not encourage these activities, is as slippery as the Legare Bridge grating in the rain. By this reasoning, the government should not support space exploration, the police department, or the armed services \u2014 all of which are inherently dangerous.\nYet while Servatius' column is racking up hits on the web, bicyclists remain more likely to be hit on our roads, 12.7 times more often than motorists, according to the dated study cited by Servatius. Which is exactly why government should be taking action to make our roadways safer and more accessible to those who by choice or economic necessity opt for two wheels rather than four. And that's exactly what Charleston County Council has done regarding the Legare Bridge.\nThere are so many public and personal benefits to bicycling that it's difficult to list them here, and too obvious, really, in this day and age, to need to. Briefly, the list includes improved air quality, fewer carbon emissions, less traffic, improved economic growth, reduced healthcare costs related to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and dare I say, lower rates of obesity? Plus the harder-to-quantify benefits of happier campers, more energetic workers, and a more connected, more livable community.\nBut as my fellow Charleston Moves board member Don Sparks has said, the real absurdity is not that people have to justify the need for bike lanes, it's that people have to fire up a car engine to go less than a mile to run an errand. For many people, the primary reason they drive rather than bike short distances is because they feel cycling is too dangerous. We can change that. We must change that. And as a traffic engineering study has determined for the Legare Bridge, we can do so without undue detriment to automotive traffic flow. And without huge expense.\nBesides the safety factor, some people \u2014 women especially \u2014 say they are reluctant to bike because they don't know how to change a flat \u2014 I'd be happy to show you, Tara, if you don't know how \u2014 or they don't want to get sweaty, but Servatius seems all hot and bothered already, so no matter.

The facility was closed, and no officials had come out to address media.\nFamily members, friends and neighbors were gathering outside in hopes of getting information. Several gathered in a circle to pray.\n\"I am very happy. I just spoke to Caix Suarez and he is alive,\" said Rodrigues, adding that the youth told him he ran when he saw the flames in the morning. \"He lost his phone, and all of his things, but the important thing is he is alive.\"\nJoao Pedro da Cruz, a 16-year-old player in the Flamengo youth league, told G1 news portal that he decided not to stay the night at the facility Thursday because the team wasn't going to train on Friday. Instead, he went to a friend's house.\nLike many professional clubs in soccer-crazed Brazil, Flamengo has a youth development program for promising young players in their early teens. Many players, particularly those who live outside of Rio de Janeiro, stay at the facilities while training.\nThe dream of many youths in Latin America's largest nation, winner of five World Cup titles, is to make it into the ranks of professional soccer. The development leagues identify promising players at a young age, working with them as they grow through their teenage years.\nThe best of those eventually play for Flamengo and several other teams across Brazil.\nFlamengo is arguably Brazil's most famous club, with an estimated 40 million fans nationwide. Supporters are so attached to their academy team that players have a motto for them: \"Flamengo makes legends at home.\"\nAmong the most famous to come through the club are Zico, a former No. 10 on Brazil's national team; top goal-scorer Adriano, who rose to fame at Inter Milan; and current Real Madrid star Vinicius, Jr., who not long ago was living in the structure destroyed by the fire.\nAs news of the fire broke, several teams and players expressed their condolences on Twitter.\nAssociated Press reporter Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Madrid."}

This is not all that simple as it reads.\"\nTrophies, like these ones, are not made in a day. He smiles, \"Sometimes, the design doesn't take the right shape in the production stage. Then you have to make some last minute changes. For instance, for the Man of the Match trophy, we tried various metals that would give us the desired shape, and finally we had to settle with copper, as it more stretchable and can take up the desired shape. So, there is a lot of experimentation is this as well.\"\nSo, that's how you get a rewarding trophy, of course you have to fight for it for sure. The ICL winner's trophy is 18 inches in height and weighs five and a half kilogram. It has a huge crystal in the middle and the four diodes behind it lend a sparkling affect. \"About 15, 000 crystals have been used in the trophy, which depicts the fire of ICL, which is also the theme.\"\nComing to designing a trophy, it takes much more than just an idea? \"As I mentioned before, one thing leads to another,\" offers Ricky, who has also done the trophy for ICC awards, the Champions trophy (except for the winners trophy) and all the trophies for Hero Honda Indian Open (except for the winners). \"One, we need to know bout the event, any main sponsorors or associations and sometimes, we have to change the whole thing according to the stakeholders,\" he adds.\nAnd in the end you get the reward - the trophy.

The Justice Department is preparing an indictment against the alleged hackers, CNN reports. The incident in question, revealed to the public in December, occurred amid a wave of Iranian hacks on U.S. banks and just three years after a computer worm believed to be built by the U.S. and Israel damaged nuclear infrastructure in Iran. Investigators said the hackers didn't take control of the dam's system but were probing its defenses. The White House was alerted when officials initially believed the intrusion occurred at a much larger facility in Oregon. The breach was still classified as of December, but it fits a pattern openly described by U.S. officials who warn that hackers from Russia, Iran and China are testing U.S. critical infrastructure networks for vulnerabilities. The Department of Justice has declined to comment, but the public attribution is seen as part of an Obama administration strategy in recent years to identify the countries and, if possible, the individuals behind cyberattacks as a means of deterrence. \"The administration has converted to the idea that there has to be consequences for bad behavior and that they have to signal places like Iran about behaving in cyberspace,\" said James Lewis, an international cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The digital intrusion came to light just months after the U.S. and other world powers finalized a deal with Iran to roll back economic sanctions on the country in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. Republicans have roundly chided Obama for the pact, arguing it will strengthen Iran's economy while failing to stop the country from acquiring nuclear weapons.

The rules codify the will of most consumers and airlines alike.\nThe issue of voice calls on airplanes has taken a back seat this year to clashes over added fees and, most important, air traffic control reform. But a Federal Communications Commission proposal in 2013 to let airlines experiment with travelers switching their connections back on at cruising altitude was met with an uproar, largely from citizens concerned about loud conversations filling the cabin.\nThis summer, a Nielsen survey found that 89 percent of passengers would prefer to keep things quiet in the clouds.\nNo wonder. Constant yammering from a seat companion in cramped quarters over the course of what could be hours of travel is far from pleasant. By putting a law into place, Congress is preserving this norm against infringement as time goes on.\nAirlines seem to agree. They have expressed little interest in allowing passengers to speak on the phone after wheels-up. Loud chitchatting is a nuisance to flight attendants trying to communicate instructions or take drink orders, and flyers perturbed by a fellow passenger's disruptive behavior are not any easier to serve. That may help explain why, even as airlines have become more permissive about phone use over time, they continue to ban voice calls via onboard WiFi.\nWe supported the FCC's 2013 plan to allow cellular data in-flight so that flyers who wanted to stay tethered to those on the ground could do so more easily. Today, as then, there is no reason not to let passengers turn off airplane mode with the right technology onboard. But the question here is not whether airlines open themselves up to cell service along with WiFi. It is whether either of those systems can be used to facilitate bothersome babbling. Passengers will still be able to access their smartphones for texting, emailing and browsing.\nCongress could consider revising its ban in the future to permit calls made with muffling devices or from private booths installed onboard, if airlines think it desirable. For now, though, it seems legislators have given Americans what they want: a little bit of solace, just this once."}

Harder to swallow is his contention that the rest of us will soon be forced to follow suit--that the cheap oil era will end for good, and spending many waking hours behind the wheel will be unaffordable.\nWith an actor's zeal and Andy Rooneylike sarcasm, Kunstler spent the last several years lecturing throughout the country as part of a movement that discourages new suburbs, promotes preservation of historic architecture and aims to cut down on car dependence.\nKunstler and fellow \"New Urbanists\" are not just looking to get around gas prices, which rose to an average $1.70 a gallon for regular unleaded in May. They envision a land where people know their neighbors, live among aesthetically pleasing homes and workplaces and either walk or ride buses to shop, work and mingle.\nTheir ideas to fight sprawl--the practice of building farther and farther away from a community's core--are gaining ground or, in this case, saving ground, in communities from Atlanta to Providence, R.I.\n\"He's lit the fire under so many people,\" said Shelley Poticha, executive director of the Congress for the New Urbanism. His book, \"Geography of Nowhere,\" she added, \"was almost a call to arms.\"\nKunstler believes that loan practices, farming trends, even World War II culminated in look-alike neighborhoods of cul-de-sacs and large lawns. He considers the result an ecological, social and spiritual wreck.\nFrom 1992 to 1997, close to 16 million acres of undeveloped land were turned into offices and homes, American Farmland Trust said. Voters are reacting. In 1998 more than $7.5 billion was approved for so-called smart growth, according to the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy.\nKunstler's criticisms go beyond conservation. He suggests that even the Columbine massacre was related to American design. A \"lack of place\" in new buildings, he argues, yields no relation to past or future, and teenagers feel this most acutely.\n\"Suburbia creates enormous amounts of anxiety and depression, and there's not enough Prozac in all the world to cure it,\" he said over lunch in a restaurant a short walk from his office.\nThe words have the urgency of a college drama major, which Kunstler is. He put aside acting for writing and lecturing. His novels include a marriage farce and a rock-and-roll drama. But it was his series on suburbia for the New York Times Sunday magazine that led to a career as a freelance social critic, which takes up most of his time.\nAt no time was Kunstler formally trained in architecture or civic planning, which is why he figures people pay attention.\n\"There's a lot of anger at architects and, understandably, at what they've delivered to us: a world of strip malls and muffler shops,\" he said.\nThe American Institute of Architects says it intends to be a leader in making \"livable communities\" a priority for the country.

The fact the 14 runs were a season high? That didn't last long at all.\nIn Wednesday's matinee at the Coliseum, the A's didn't have to worry about overcoming a 10-run deficit; they built an 11-run lead after two innings and pummeled the Twins 16-1.\nTo put some perspective on the A's offense in the series against Minnesota, try this: Before Monday, Oakland had scored in double digits only once in 2009, a 12-3 win over the Royals on May 12.\nOn Wednesday, after Justin Morneau took Trevor Cahill deep to right for his 24th homer of the season in the top of the first, the A's answered with a five-spot in the bottom half.\nConsecutive one-out singles by Orlando Cabrera, Scott Hairston and Matt Holliday (who went 3-for-3) accounted for the tying run. With two outs and the bases loaded, Minnesota's Glen Perkins got ahead of Landon Powell 0-2 before walking him, bringing home Holliday for a 2-1 Oakland lead.\nRajai Davis followed Powell with a bases-clearing triple to right-center. Just like that, the A's owned a 5-1 edge. First-inning troubles have become awfully familiar for Perkins this season: The left-hander's ERA in the first is 12.27 (20 earned runs in 142/3 innings).\nOakland pitcher Trevor Cahill delivers in the 4th inning of the Oakland Athletics vs. Minnesota Twins baseball game at the Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Wednesday, July 22, 2009.\nPerkins didn't get out of the second inning Wednesday; in fact, he didn't get an out in the second. An Adam Kennedy single and a walk to Cabrera preceded Scott Hairston's drive over the left-field wall. Make it 8-1, Oakland, and call it a day for Perkins.\nKevin Mulvey took the mound for the Twins and the A's continued stinging hits throughout the Coliseum. They tagged Mulvey for six singles in the inning, with Jack Cust, Mark Ellis and Cabrera (two) getting RBIs on their base hits. The inning ended with Oakland in front 12-1 and Mulvey headed to the showers.\nScoring at least five runs in each of the first two innings had happened one other time in Oakland history: The A's had five in the first and six in the second in an 11-1 rout of Milwaukee on July 11, 1970.\nOn Wednesday, the A's added three more runs off R.A. Dickey in the fifth. Pinch-hitter Kurt Suzuki delivered a two-run single and Davis picked up his fourth RBI of the day with a single. Davis began Wednesday with six RBIs this season.\nCahill (6-8) picked up his first win in exactly a month, since a 5-1 victory over the Giants. The rookie right-hander allowed one run on six hits in seven innings."}

A new study has tried to understand why this occurs.\nA recent study explored the molecular links between psoriasis and diabetes.\nPsoriasis is a common inflammatory skin condition, affecting an estimated 2.2 percent of people in the United States.\nFor decades, we have known that psoriasis increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the exact nature of this connection is unclear.\nRecently, researchers from King's College London in the United Kingdom designed a series of experiments to gain insight into the link.\nLead author Elizabeth Evans presented their findings at a recent annual conference of the Society for Endocrinology, in Glasgow, U.K.\nPsoriasis is the most common autoimmune disease in the U.S.\nCurrently, medicines can address symptoms, but because there is no cure, treatment tends to continue throughout an individual's life.\nIn people with psoriasis, skin cells are replaced too quickly.\nUsually, it takes 3\u20134 weeks to develop cells in the deeper layers of skin. As they mature, they slowly rise to the surface.\nHowever, psoriasis causes immature skin cells to reach the surface in less than 1 week, after which they die and flake off. This leads to red, itchy patches of skin.\nThe team from King's College studied human and animal skin samples, looking for any molecular alterations associated with psoriasis that might induce diabetes.\nThey used an experimental model of psoriasis created by applying imiquimod \u2014 an immune response modifier \u2014 to mouse and human skin.\nThe researchers found that skin from mice with psoriasis demonstrated inflammation and insulin resistance, a risk factor for diabetes.\nThis resistance means that cells are not responding correctly to the hormone insulin and are not removing glucose from the bloodstream.\nFat tissue, in particular, took up glucose less easily, and the researchers measured a reduction in levels of glucose transporter type 4, a receptor necessary for moving glucose into fat cells.\nIs there a link between psoriasis and Candida?\nHaving one condition may increase the risk of developing the other, but scientists are unsure why.\nAlso, beta cells in the mice with psoriasis produced more insulin than those in the unaffected mice. The researchers believe that this overproduction is an attempt to compensate for insulin resistance.\n\"The laboratory model we used in this study closely resembles many of the major hallmarks of psoriasis, and we have observed some changes caused by the condition which reflect what is seen in a prediabetic patient.\"\nIn short, the inflammation associated with psoriasis caused insulin resistance and increased insulin production. The triggers for both these effects were produced by the skin.\nThis is just the start of their research. The team wants to identify the factors released by the psoriatic skin that may play a role in developing diabetes.\nThe results of this investigation will improve our understanding of the common skin disease, and they may also help us gain insight into diabetes.\nEvans says, \"If we can pinpoint novel skin-derived factors that are directly affecting blood sugar control, they may lead to potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes or insulin resistance.\"\nEventually, this research may help reduce the risk that people with psoriasis will develop diabetes.

{"idx": "29253", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Strengths science teaches us that every human being has powerful, natural talents in a few areas, but that no one is good at everything. In addition to providing ways for us to harness our strengths, Gallup has also created different techniques to ensure that our non-talents do not become weaknesses. One technique is to develop complementary partnerships -- teaming up with people whose strengths are different from our own. In fact, in nature it can be a matter of life or death.\nIn the plant and animal world, there are multiple examples of symbiotic relationships where two species rely on each other for survival. My favorite example is the pistol shrimp and the goby fish.\nDespite its minuscule size of only 3-5 cm, the pistol shrimp can use its claw to create one of the loudest sounds in the ocean. The sound frightens away enemies who feel the powerful sound waves and believe an enormous predator is near. The sound waves are so potent, they can even kill small fish. Although the pistol shrimp is endowed with a life-saving gift, it also has an unfortunate disability -- the pistol shrimp is blind. Swimming through life alone, this shrimp would likely become extinct because predators would easily take advantage of the shrimp\u2019s weakness.\nFortunately for the pistol shrimp, the goby fish is a perfect complementary partner. If you search for images of gobies, you will be hard pressed to find a picture of one without a pistol shrimp. The goby fish has a life-saving skill in its relationship talent. Gobies partner with pistol shrimp to help each other survive. They make a burrow together in the sand and venture out together when they hunt for food. When the goby spots danger, it wiggles its tail to signal to the pistol shrimp. The shrimp expertly snaps its claw and frightens away the predator so that both are saved. Without the pistol shrimp, the goby would have no way to fend off hunters.\nWhat can we learn from this example in nature?\nWhen looking at the pistol shrimp, it is unimaginable that this creature the size of your fingertip can create sound waves that reach a speed of over 60 mph, but it can. For this reason, it is important to never guess someone\u2019s strengths. Encourage them to take the Clifton StrengthsFinder to get accurate results.\nPeople regularly ask me to guess their strengths. I hate that question. In my eight years as a Gallup consultant, I have spoken with over 1,500 coaches, executives, and managers. I still can\u2019t guess someone\u2019s strengths. However, once I see their StrengthsFinder results, I immediately understand who they are as an individual, and I can see their unique talents.\nGoals are achievable through various methods. Every creature in nature has some way to ensure its survival, but they all have their own ways of reaching that goal. Some use camouflage, some are bigger and stronger than their prey, and some have sharp teeth. Imagine if a pistol shrimp tried to protect itself by imitating the talents of other sea creatures. It could try to make itself fast like a barracuda or as strong as a shark. However, that pistol shrimp would not survive because it would never be as fast as the slowest barracuda or as strong as the weakest shark. If I were the strengths coach of a pistol shrimp, I would tell it to spend its free time learning how to make even louder, more devastating and intimidating sounds with its claw"}

Jalapeno peppers (Capsicum annum L.) represent one of the most popular options if you enjoy spicy food -- it rates 2,500 to 5,000 on the Scoville scale, the scale for rating pepper heat, which indicates a medium-hot pepper. While these peppers do not require a great deal of specialized care beyond keeping them staked, watered and fertilized, understanding the diseases and pests of the jalapeno pepper plant helps you grow the most robust plants.\nSeveral varieties of beetle can attack jalapeno pepper plants, including the flea beetle and palestriped flea beetle. A beetle infestation poses the greatest risk when jalapeno plants are seedlings -- these insects feed on leaves, damaging the plant so much it fails to mature. Consider using row covers or mulch to protect seedlings. Sticky traps can eliminate beetles as well.\nCutworms, wireworms, tomato fruitworms and beet armyworms can wreak havoc on jalapeno pepper plants. Wireworms, which resemble mealworms, and cutworms -- they look like brown caterpillars -- are particularly troublesome during the jalapeno's seedling stage. Wireworms feed on roots and bore into stems, while cutworms chew through seedling stems. Tomato fruitworms and beet armyworms damage leaves and peppers. All worms can be controlled by picking them off plants by hand or by attracting beneficial insects to the garden that eat these worms.\nGreen peach aphids may attack jalapeno pepper plants early in the season, which can result in wilted plants. More critically, these aphids can spread viruses. Microscopic broad mites are also an issue for pepper plants, feeding on leaves and peppers as well as resulting in a deformed plant and leaves . You can use insecticides to kill both aphids and mites. Beneficial insects, such as lacewings and ladybugs, eat aphids, and you can also dunk pepper plants in cold water to kill mites.\nPathogenic diseases, or diseases caused by external infectious agents, can damage jalapeno pepper plants. Phytophthora root rot, verticillium wilt, powdery mildew and bacterial spot are the most common of these diseases. In some cases, no controls exist to control them. Consult your local nursery for the best option to treat pathogenic diseases of jalapeno pepper plants.\nCucumber mosaic virus, pepper mottle virus, tobacco etch virus and the potato virus may strike your jalapeno plants singly or in combinations. You may find it difficult to control the spread of these viruses because insecticides rarely work. These viruses can cause widespread plant death. There are a variety of less-deadly viruses that attack jalapeno plants as well.\nWolf, Nicki. \"Diseases and Pests of Jalapeno Pepper Plants.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/diseases-pests-jalapeno-pepper-plants-39898.html.

What didn't people understand about the end of the world?\nHow quickly attitudes can change. Twelve months ago many people were in a state of anxiety and panic, fearing impending oblivion. We were approaching the end of a millennium. A plethora of books and articles addressed the issue. The end of the world was nigh, reflecting both religious and secular concerns for the future of society.\nFor some 2,000 years there had been predictions of an imminent end\u2014caused either by God or by natural events. But this time people were taking things more seriously, because science itself had joined the fray with its own extensive pick list of what we humans might do to ourselves.\nThe much publicized Y2K or millennium bug was perhaps the most urgent problem. It threatened to throw today\u2019s digital world into unfathomable chaos as we all faced up to a little problem of computer dating. To everyone\u2019s relief, this particular fear proved unfounded, thanks to\u2014or perhaps in spite of\u2014the estimated $600 billion spent to fix the bug that did not bite.\nIs the concept of the rapture, as popularly believed, found in the Bible?\nAdding to the unease, various religious groups focused on their interpretation of biblical prophecy and went into high gear\u2014and high mountains with their food stores and guns\u2014to await the apocalypse. Those expecting a secret rapture excitedly prepared for their removal from this earth. The Roman Catholic Church began its much heralded Jubilee celebrations, marking the supposed 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ. They anticipated the flowering of a peaceful and more spiritual age led by the church. Meanwhile, New Age adherents predicted a paradigm shift\u2014following unprecedented upheavals\u2014to an enlightened, peaceful and love-filled Age of Aquarius.\nNevertheless, all apocalyptic predictions failed. And a year later, the end still looks unlikely to most people. With fears seemingly assuaged and forgotten, it is business as usual, with hardly anyone giving a thought to the concerns that dominated our attention a year ago.\nHaving apparently passed safely into a new millennium, our collective mood is more upbeat, positive and forward-looking. The world economy continues to boom. Globalization also continues, widening the prospect of increased prosperity for a growing number of nations. The International Space Station has accepted its first crew members, heralding a new era of space exploration. And advances in genetics and computer technology promise unprecedented improvements in life, work, health and human relationships. The world is at relative peace, and the future seems rosy.\nSo what was all the fuss about last year?\nThere is something about human perceptions of \u201cthe end\u201d that begs clarification.\nThe first thing to note is that the passing of the millennium is, of itself, of no great significance. It is an entirely arbitrary and artificial quirk of the calendar. Last year\u2019s millennium celebrations, apart from being a year early, were actually based on an artificial construct stemming from peculiarities of the Gregorian calendar and modern social preferences: the fears and expectations about the world ending on January 1, 2000, were therefore groundless, based on nothing more than massive hype.\nBut does it really matter?

{"idx": "29264", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The project began in mid-January initially at Gateshead Carers, before moving to its base at 107, Coatesworth Road towards in February. The kav\u00e1rna, a drop-in for Eastern European Roma living in Gateshead, has been open for six occasions on Thursdays between 9.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. The aim of the kav\u00e1rna is to provide a safe space where Roma living locally can go and receive help on a range of issues and meet both other members of the community and a range of Gateshead-based professionals. It is very ably run by interpreters and workers from the Roma community.\nMembers of the Roma community have two major barriers preventing them always having the rights they should. Firstly, there is the language barrier faced by most groups of immigrants coming to a town like Gateshead. Additionally, there is the barrier caused by the huge amount of discrimination and prejudice they have escaped from in Eastern Europe. This discrimination, whether in education, housing, health provision or in the job market, has led to many members of the community not having the confidence to ask for the help they need. The kav\u00e1rna aims to act as a bridge between the Roma community and the wider community in Gateshead and on Tyneside generally and help them to overcome the barriers.\nMembers of the community have come to the kav\u00e1rna with a range of problems they have needed help with. These have included debt advice, help with sorting out council tax (ensuring they get rebates they are entitled to), dealing with rent arrears and with water bills. Those being helped are not English speakers, so by having excellent interpreters the kav\u00e1rna has been able to help Roma to sort these problems out. Universal Credit has also proved to be a huge headache for many Roma and we have been able to help them also with this.\nHousing is another huge area where local Roma need help. Among other problems, there are cases of landlords creating service charges for no apparent reason. When one landlord was phoned about this he promptly hung up..... Another landlord had overcharged a family when they had moved out, charging them for removal of furniture, despite photographic evidence that the home was empty. When the families have allowed it, as sometimes they are afraid of the landlord, Environmental Health have been phoned, because of a range of problems including the presence of rats, mould and there being no bathroom in a rented property.\nIn terms of employment, there was a case where a Roma was not paid by an agency for the last two weeks of work and wasn't sent a P45. People are still worried about employers, who are often also their landlords. Consequently there is not always anything that can be done at the moment as some are afraid of losing their jobs and/or their homes.\nPeople need to have National Insurance numbers or have a child registered as one year old. There are still numerous Roma families who are 'off the radar' and not receiving the benefits they need and are entitled to. They don't know their rights and as a result they are vulnerable to exploitation by landlords and employers.\nOn one occasion the kav\u00e1rna was open, 3 families just came along for a coffee and a chat, which is another vital function of the project. There has been a nice family atmosphere created and the project is already becoming so popular that one week two families had to be turned away to come back the following week.\nThe work involves helping to build-up confidence among members of the Roma community and helping them to be financially stable."}

Behavioral economist Peter Atwater, whose firm Financial Insyghts focuses on the market implications of consumer sentiment, certainly thinks so. \u201cI would offer that Abenomics\u201d \u2014 i.e. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s plan to goose his nation\u2019s economy with a combination of monetary policy and fiscal and structural reforms \u2014 \u201cwas the \u2018subprime\u2019 of policy-making,\u201d says Atwater.

Sounds like a bubble to me.\nSo, where do we go from here? Atwater and other folks like the smart guys at Capital Economics in London believe that the Nikkei will continue to be vulnerable and that Japan\u2019s attempts to lower the value of it\u2019s currency in order to boost exports and real economic activity may be at an end. In fact, you might even see the yen start to rise, especially if there\u2019s another crisis in the euro-zone, which is looking very possible and even likely.\nThe U.S. will continue to be the prettiest house on the ugly block that is the global economy. U.S. markets have fallen, but they are probably the least vulnerable of the major global markets right now. Private sector GDP growth in the U.S. is actually over 3%; it\u2019s the government, as per usual, that\u2019s slowing things down.\nBut the second half of the year may not be as bright as the first, at least in terms of stock markets. I spoke earlier today with Mohamed El-Erian, the head of the world\u2019s largest bond trader, PIMCO, a prescient investor who has been tip-toing away from risk for a while now. I asked him whether this was truly the bursting of the central bank bubble. His thoughful answer was \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d But he also pointed out that in a recent Financial Times column he had defined a \u201cbrand\u201d as something that divorces prices from fundamentals \u2013 that\u2019s why, for example, Apple and Facebook share prices overshot their fundamentals by so much. For years now, we\u2019ve come to trust the brand known as \u201ccentral banking\u201d to deliver us from the real economy.

These activities include explaining the benefits or terms of a contract as well as filling out application forms in behalf of the client.\nOn the other hand, loss adjustment is the determination of the amount to be paid based on the claim of the insured.\nBased on the new circular, BPO providers are also prohibited from deciding whether or not to underwrite risks and approve an insurance or reinsurance claim. IC also mandated insurance companies as well as BPO providers to observe and comply with data privacy laws in the collection, holding, processing and use of the clients\u2019 personal information.\nAmid their highly complex business environment, hiring BPO providers can be of great help to the insurance industry as it can stimulate and facilitate the productivity of the insurance companies, the IC said in a statement on Wednesday.\nInsurance Commissioner Dennis B.

According to Cisco, the global Internet traffic generated by the use of cloud computing services will increase 12-fold by 2015.\nIf you've been too preoccupied with the business of growing your business to consider what cloud computing could offer, don't fret. Here are five points to help you decide whether the time is ripe for your business to invest in the cloud.\nMoving your business-critical data and applications to the cloud can be significantly more cost-effective than maintaining on-site server hardware. As your data is stored offsite, there's no need to invest in the costly purchase, maintenance, or upgrade of onsite server hardware.\nAdditionally, as the data and software your company depends upon moves off-site, you may be able to scale back the number of IT employees or contractors needed to keep your on-site hardware running. All of this can add up to a sizable chunk of change that could be directed towards other areas of your business.\nSpeaking of IT personnel, when you turn your data-wrangling over to a company that specialises in providing cloud computing solutions to business, you're not just investing in an off-site storage solution, but you're also buying the peace of mind. Cloud solution providers like Amazon, IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft staff trained personnel ready to respond to emergencies, frustrations, and failures 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, ensuring that you and your employees will have access to business files and applications, and the assistance to use them effectively when needed.\nWhat's more, by default, cloud computing provides an instant off-site backup solution. Should disaster strike at your office, the continuity of your business will be ensured, thanks to the fact that your important client, supplier and financial information are all stored elsewhere.\nHaving a computing solution that can grow quickly to meet the demands of your employees and customers is a must. As your business grows, your cloud computing solution can quickly be scaled to meet the increasing demand data demands of your employees and customers. This can be especially important for companies who rely on web-based sales as a significant part of their revenue streams: A lack of server capacity can quickly translate into lost sales.\nWith your company's data streaming from the cloud, you and your workforce can be productive anywhere there's internet connectivity. Employees can work from their desks or from their cars. You can access, work on, and update mission-critical data, such as a PowerPoint presentation for an important client, from your office before sales personnel use it on the other side of the country.\nPerhaps most importantly, on days where you just can't bear the thought of heading into work, you'll still be able to keep tabs on your business from a laptop or tablet from the comfort of your own home.\nEveryone knows that a new car depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot. The same can be said for computing solutions: As soon as you invest in new hardware or software, something faster or more efficient will be announced. Thanks to cloud computing, this cruel reality becomes a frustration of the past. Cloud computing provisioning is a business, and just like any other money-making venture, competition is the name of the game. As new, faster technologies emerge, you can bet that your provider will jump at the opportunity to provide them to you, for fear of losing your business to another company. This means that the software you use, and the speed at which you'll be able to access your data will typically be second"}

The explicit details were not published, but instead, the OAG offered up the broader six recommendations it made, which included an in-depth assessment of the risk to the agency malware poses, improving any controls the OAG identified as ineffective, and that each agency consider additional controls to better secure its networks, systems, and data against malware.\nUnder the careful watch of the OGCIO, the Auditor General said it wants to see the WA public sector consider methods to foster \"collaboration, information, and resource sharing\" between agencies. It also wants the public sector to gather information to properly understand the threat posed by malware and other cyberthreats to the state government.\n\"Without central guidance and support, agencies work in isolation,\" the OAG said. \"There are few formal avenues for collaboration, support, and resource sharing. Increased cooperation and sharing can reduce costs to agencies through economies of scale.\"\nThe OAG's final recommendation is that the OGCIO continue the rollout and implementation of the Digital Security Policy, including its supporting guidelines and controls.\nThe purpose of the state's whole-of-government Digital Security Policy is to provide direction for the adoption and maintenance of security protection controls in digital information and digital information systems.\nPointing to a recent report by FireEye-owned cyberforensics firm Mandiant, the OAG said that jurisdictions with better central coordination have a more mature approach to security, resulting in infections and breaches being found and remediated more quickly.\n\"A whole-of-government view of cyberthreats allows for properly informed and more efficient security programs,\" the Auditor General said.\nAs state agencies are not required to report malware incidents to a central agency, the OAG said no single body was able to provide it with an overview of the size or nature of the malware threats faced.\nIn performing its audit, the OAG said it observed malware related communication on all networks tested, with the attacks believed to have originated from 18 different countries, including Australia.\nSpecifically, two agencies had signs of persistent malware infections that had bypassed the agency's security controls, with one agency experiencing a single infection that had been active for most of the 12 day sample period, the OAG said.

At the time, CBS reported similar incidents and lawsuits from over half a dozen officers from various police departments.\nChase said the Austin police cases are two of the roughly 30 he has across the country stemming from reported Ford Explorer-linked carbon monoxide poisonings.\nThe lawsuit also lists seven other businesses as defendants; Johnson Ford of Austin, Texas, Silsbee Ford of East Texas, and the remaining five are as-of-yet unnamed. The suit alleges that these companies, along with Ford, failed to effectively fix the vehicles.\nHancock claims he became ill after patrol in his Police Explorer on July 21 of this year, and was hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning the next day. The lawsuit alleges that a bulletin to dealerships from Ford describing exhaust smell entering vehicle cabins is proof that the company has been aware of the dangerous emissions issue since at least December of 2012.\nIn response to over 2,700 similar complaints since the current Explorer model\u2019s introduction in 2011, Ford has not yet officially issued a recall for the Explorer model, but has offered to \u201cfix\u201d approximately 1.4 million Explorers if the owners wish to have them inspected. The fix supposedly prevents exhaust leaks. In the same report from Friday, a Ford spokesperson also assured Jalopnik that Austin\u2019s Police Interceptor Explorers are being put back into service after repairs, but did not clarify if any were already back in service, nor a clear time frame for any outstanding repairs.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a report back in July that listed cracks in Explorer model exhaust manifolds as a potential source for the carbon monoxide exposure.\nJalopnik has reached out to Ford about the new lawsuit and this post will be updated with any new information.\n\ufeffWe do not comment on pending litigation.\nWe appreciate the Austin Police Department\u2019s collaboration with our team to repair their Police Interceptors and are glad their vehicles are returning to service. During the course of our investigation and repairs, we found unsealed spaces that were the result of police equipment installed after leaving Ford\u2019s factory. The methods and parts we\u2019ve utilized to repair Austin\u2019s vehicles have worked well to reduce the concern."}

The former wrestler and the comedian have found tremendous success in movies individually and with their combined efforts in Central Intelligence and especially Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. So it seems more a matter of 'when' not 'if' they will work together again and it's looking like that when might be sooner than we thought. Take a look.\nThat certainly sounds like these two have something in the works. Dwayne Johnson isn't clear about the specifics in his Instagram post, but he does indicate that him meeting up with Kevin Hart while he is on the set of Hobbs and Shaw is to discuss new opportunities, and that the two have some big things lined up.\nWhile it's of course possible that Dwayne Johnson might be talking about something other than a movie, given the industry these two are in, it stands to reason we'll see Kevin Hart and Johnson onscreen together sooner rather than later. The question now is, what's the movie?\nYou also have to love how much these two constantly rib each other. Whether it's on the set of Jumanji or through social media, their banter off screen is as much fun as their dynamic on it. We see that here with Dwayne Johnson using his favorite insult for his diminutive friend, calling him his son and talking about wanting to slap him.\nAs far as what these two could be working on next together, besides Jumanji 3, we are left to speculate. Dwayne Johnson talks about building their enterprises, and for him and Kevin Hart, that's not hyperbole. These are two of the hottest entertainers in the industry, showing up anywhere and everywhere with a ridiculous amount of projects always in the works.\nSo their next movie together could be something that's already been announced or rumored, but given the tease of this Instagram post, I imagine it's something new entirely.\nThat said, I could definitely see Kevin Hart showing up in The Rock's Big Trouble in Little China movie. Given their history onscreen and their dynamic, I think the safe bet is that whatever it is, it will be good for plenty of laughs and a healthy return at the box office.\nWhile we wait to see what movie set The Rock will torment Kevin Hart on, we can look forward to more of their jungle shenanigans as the two are set to return to the magical world of Jumanji in the as-of-yet untitled sequel to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, hitting theaters on December 13, 2019.

His \u201cFreedom\u201d video opens with him singing behind bars: \u201cWe are fed up with those who oppress our lives.\u201d He has protested against an unpopular social media tax and a controversial change to the constitution removing presidential age limits.\nDespite murmurs about his wild past and inexperience in politics, his approach appears to be working: All of the candidates he has backed in strongly contested legislative by-elections this year have emerged victorious.\nBut after clashes this week led to a smashed window in President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s convoy and Ssentamu\u2019s own driver shot dead, some of the singer\u2019s supporters now wonder if they\u2019ll ever see him again.\nThe brash young lawmaker was charged Thursday in a military court with illegal possession of firearms for his alleged role in Monday\u2019s clashes in the northwestern town of Arua, where both he and Museveni were campaigning. As the president\u2019s convoy left a rally, authorities say, a group associated with Ssentamu and the candidate he supported, Kassiano Wadri, pelted it with stones.\nSsentamu quickly posted on Twitter a photo of his dead driver slumped in a car seat, blaming police \u201cthinking they\u2019ve shot at me.\u201d Then he was arrested, and he hasn\u2019t been seen in public since.\nCritics have said Uganda\u2019s government might find it easier to get the verdict it wants in a military court, where independent observers often have limited access. Ssentamu\u2019s wife, Barbara, told reporters he has never owned a gun and does not know how to handle one, reinforcing widespread concerns about trumped-up charges.\nThe U.S. Embassy said in a statement Friday it was \u201cdisturbed by reports of brutal treatment\u201d of legislators and others by security forces, urging the government \u201cto show the world that Uganda respects its constitution and the human rights of all of its citizens.\u201d A separate statement by the European Union delegation and several other Western diplomats expressed similar concerns.\nThe case against Ssentamu has riveted this East African country that has rarely seen a politician of such charisma and drive. Beaten and bruised, often literally, Uganda\u2019s opposition politicians have largely retreated as the 74-year-old Museveni pursues an even longer stay in power.\nWhile Kizza Besigye, a four-time presidential challenger who has been jailed many times, appears to relax his protest movement, Ssentamu has been urging bold action. The young must take the place of the old in Uganda\u2019s leadership, he says.\nHis message resonates widely in a country where many educated young people cannot find employment, public hospitals often lack basic medicines and main roads are dangerously potholed.\nBecause traditional avenues of political agitation have largely been blocked by the government, the music and street spectacle of an entertainer with"}

Dive sites off Jamaica\u2019s coast let you see sharks, rays, sea turtles, corals and colorful fish, up close. Adding a wrecked ship or plane to the environment completes the thrill of Jamaican scuba diving.\nIn 1977 the Norwegian cargo ship Cayman Trader caught fire and sunk off the shores of Jamaica. The remains now sit between the South Key and Southeast Key in Kingston Harbor at 60 to 70 feet deep. Divers should attempt to find it on a calm day, as Shipwreck Expo indicates it is a challenging wreck to find even for advanced divers due to the poor visibility.\nThe Texas wreck sits southeast of Port Royal. This American naval vessel sunk in 1944 after a collision. The 100-foot-long Texas now sits upright in South Kingston Channel, where it is home to black coral and an abundant population of fish. Divers find the smokestack at 80 feet and the ship\u2019s propeller at 110 feet. Visible gun turrets make for excellent photographs. The current is negligible at this site, but because it is located in shipping lanes, divers must check with the harbormaster for the shipping schedule before venturing out. Interested divers should rent boats from Port Royal to access this dive site.\nVisitors to Ocho Rios can dive the Kathryn wreck site. In 1991 a dive operator deliberately sunk the 140-foot steel minesweeper. The ship is just 50 feet below the surface, and the fish here have grown accustomed to divers, who regularly feed them by hand. Divers have access to the ship\u2019s interior, which has already started to grow a thriving population of black coral. The wreck sits between Runaway Bay and Ocho Rios, but is best accessible from Ocho Rios.\nThe Pete Wreck in Negril holds three wrecks: two Cessna planes and the 50-foot tugboat Pete. In 1988 a local dive operation sunk the planes and tugboat, which were irreparably damaged after Hurricane Gilbert. The first plane is intact and accessible at 50 feet. The second plane sits in 90 feet of water. The plans and tugboat are penetrable, and the coral that encrusts them makes the dive site quite beautiful.\nShipwreck Reef offers divers a chance to explore a wrecked freighter at just 15 feet. The dive site is in front of the Ambiance Jamaica Resort, and its shallow depth allows both divers and snorkelers to glimpse the ship. Turtles, morays, barracuda and colorful tropical fish all live in around the sunken ship. Corals, sponges and sea whips also live in Shipwreck Reef.\nHarms, Nicole. \"Wreck Diving in Jamaica.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/wreck-diving-jamaica-2562.html.

The new proposal for the 28-acre site will essentially be a brand-new neighborhood named Mission Rock, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There will be 1,500 residences, an eight-acre park, and plenty of commercial space including a working brewery.

But hey, this is San Francisco, it\u2019s pretty damn easy to walk, bike or take transit to a game. It\u2019s good that that city recognized that fact and took the focus off parking completely.\nNow the project goes to a ballot measure in November for voter approval.

So instead of the soil, the plants are grown in a water solution that is rich in necessary nutrients.\n\u201cWe need locally grown food but we can\u2019t get into farming in the city as the soil is of no good, it has got construction waste in it. You can\u2019t truck in so much soil because there is no space to put it. The leafy vegetables available to us, be it in the mandi or high-end stores, are grown in the open fields where chemicals are sprayed. The idea is to change that format,\u201d says the 46-year-old who first laid hands on urban agriculture in 2007 in East Europe, taking it up as a fun activity alongside his fulltime-banking job.\n\u201cIt came naturally to me. As it was something I did as a kid with my parents in Malad. But today, formats of farming need to change. The conventional formats aren\u2019t working today,\u201d he shares.\nWhen on a visit to India in 2010, he was aghast at the state of farm produces he saw lying in rucksacks in Dadar with stray animals walking over them.

Union influence and power has continued to prevent meaningful education reform, and another public education bailout from Washington will further empower unions, which will make it more difficult for states to implement the common-sense changes that are needed to improve American education in the long run.\nTeachers unions generate the bulk of their capital from their millions of dues-paying members. During the 2009\u20132010 school year, the National Education Association (NEA) national affiliate received $162 per teacher and $93 per public school staff member. Public education employees also contribute an average of $300 per year to their state and local union affiliates.\nAn NEA member survey found that 50 percent of dues-paying members identified themselves as being more conservative than liberal, but 91 percent of the NEA\u2019s campaign and political contributions went to Democrats or left-leaning causes. The two major teachers unions make 95 percent of their political contributions to Democrats.\nTeachers unions also dominate election spending. According to the Federal Election Commission, as of July 2010, unions had contributed $9.7 million of the $24.7 million in campaign spending, representing 39 percent of total expenditures. By contrast, corporations had spent just $3.4 million.\nWith a budget of more than $355 million, the NEA spends more on campaign contributions than ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, and the AFL-CIO combined. During the 2007\u20132008 election cycle, the NEA and American Federation of Teachers (AFT) spent more than $71 million on campaigns for issues and candidates, spending more than $100 per teacher in five states. In addition to the millions in campaign contributions, the NEA provides hundreds of thousands of dollars in member dues to left-leaning groups such as Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union, and Health Care for America Now. The AFT funds groups that include the Rainbow PUSH coalition and ACORN.\nNational union leaders receive plush salaries. The national affiliate of the NEA paid more than 370 of its employees salaries of $100,000 or more in 2009. Several executive board members earned well over $200,000. NEA President Dennis Van Roekel was provided a salary of slightly under $300,000, and Vice President Lily Eskelsen received over $240,000 in 2009. NEA Treasurer Rebecca Pringle received $321,000 last year.\nOver the past five decades, unions have successfully lobbied to prevent public education employees from having to contribute to the cost of their own health insurance premiums, for increases in pensions and other benefits, and against provisions such as parental school choice. They have also fought against tenure reform and merit pay for teachers and, more recently, have been at the forefront of the Obama Administration\u2019s push for another $10 billion public education bailout.\nDemocratic leadership claims that the creation of a $10 billion Education Jobs Fund would save 140,000 public education jobs.

Those conditions existed for many weeks this year, he said.\nParsons said the discovery does not necessarily mean a breeding population of invasive carp exists within Pool 2. But he said both fish were females that contained eggs.\n\"Invasive carp pose a threat to our native fisheries, water recreation and ecosystems,\" Parsons said in a news release.\nThe DNR will continue its intensive carp sampling efforts next week to try to determine if more or smaller invasive carp are in the Grey Cloud Slough area.\nSilver and bighead carp can grow to 60 pounds and consume large amounts of plankton that native fish rely on."}

Heres a little background to get you started.\nThe Japanese government did what the U.S. did and embarked on quantitative easing. Once the program ended, the economy, once again, began to sink prompting the program to be reinstated. Things got better and then came the massive earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown.\nAnd its an impact that the Japanese government endorses. A weaker currency, in theory, lowers the cost of Japanese exports which should increase demand. This should breathe life into the economy just as it has in the U.S.\nIf youve watched the financial media lately, you know that the weakening yen has been the currency story du jour and while some believe that Japan will soon put the breaks on the weakening yen, many still believe that theres money to be made.\nOne way is to continue shorting the yen. Another is to go long Japanese companies. Examples include Honda (NYSE:HON), Sony (NYSE:SNE), and Toyota (NYSE:TM). We arent recommending these to buy but instead, to get your research started.\nFinally, the Japan story, much like in the United States, is likely to be a multi-year opportunity.

We seem far less concerned with what it sounds like beneath the waves\u2014which is why you may be surprised to learn that marine life has a lot to say.\nIndeed, the ocean is rife with the chatter of fish that indulge in a variety of \u201csquawks, burble and pops\u201d according to Robert McCauley, who\u2019s been studying these vocalizations for nearly thirty years. Worldwide, some 800 species of fish are reported to make sounds while engaging in a variety of behaviors: feeding, defending their territory, signaling to others, and mating\u2014to name just a few.\nMost fish chatter comes from solo vocalists, but as researchers are now learning, these are also fish that talk together. By sticking two sea loggers off the coast of Port Hedland, Western Australia for 18 months, McCauley and his colleagues managed to identify seven distinct choruses, most of them occurring at sunrise, sunset, or both.\nMcCauley was kind enough to share a few examples with Gizmodo. These first two come from groups of Terapontids and Mulloway (Japanese croakers), each engaged in a spawning aggregation. I for one never imagined that fish orgies sounded so much like rusty tubas!\nAs for why fish babble together, \u201cat the moment, we often simply don\u2019t know,\u201d McCauley said, adding that because sound travels quite well underwater, some of what we perceive to be choruses could be a bunch of soloists, all screaming into the abyss and giving the impression of harmony.\nIn other cases, the chatter is dense enough that we can be fairly sure the fish are vocalizing as a group. Some fish even have an \u201cacoustic niche,\u201d meaning their calls occur at a distinct frequency not used by others in the area, \u201cso that the intended recipients have more chance of hearing them,\u201d McCauley said.\nClearly, we still have a lot more questions than answers about fish choruses.

Trump responded that the United States should consider that approach. A senior administration official told me Trump was joking.\nTrump\u2019s public and private push for Russia\u2019s re-admittance to the G-7, combined with his focus on meeting Vladimir Putin before or after next month\u2019s NATO summit, have led Europeans to wonder whether the president supports the transatlantic alliance at all.\nIn Trump\u2019s first year, European allies gave Trump the benefit of the doubt as a non-politician and tried to address his concerns, including his criticism of NATO-member military contributions. Allies also relied on other senior Trump administration officials for reassurance that the United States would still uphold its basic commitments to the alliance and maintain its role as champion of the rules-based order.\nBut now in Trump\u2019s second year, many of the officials offering such reassurance have departed. Their replacements are more willing to echo Trump\u2019s criticisms and defend his policies, including his outreach to Russia and his launching of a trade war with Europe.\nIn my own private conversations with several European diplomats, I heard the same concerns and anxiety about Trump\u2019s personal behavior and policy approach. In interviews, senior European leaders were more diplomatic.\nEuropean leaders are trying to minimize the tension and address Trump\u2019s grievances where they can. But when Trump says or does things that have the effect of undermining U.S.-European relations, European leaders are confused and rattled.\nBlair also said he believes the transatlantic relationship will survive and Trump\u2019s behavior does not represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. commitment to Europe. But Biden told me Trump\u2019s actions feed into distrust of the liberal world order that is widening the gap between Western governments and their people, with drastic consequences.\nBiden said governments have to reconnect with their lost constituents, address their anxieties and educate them on the value that European alliances give to the United States. He also said that U.S. voters need to vote Trump out of office. I asked him whether this crisis in the democratic world makes him want to run for president in 2020. He said no."}

Doesn't quit day job.\nNintendo have had huge success with their range of peripherals.\nAs the Wii and the DS continue to dominate the market, consumers want to buy the extras that Nintendo touts as essential to your enjoyment of their products.\nProducts like Wii Fit and the Wii Zapper consistently sell well because of the effective and intelligent manner Nintendo market their product to specific demographics. They know their market and aim their products solely at those crowds.\nThough Nintendo also has a history of re-releasing old games with a make-over or some multiplayer and this seems to be getting somewhat stale. Even the recent release of the 3DS shows how much Nintendo rely on existing products. A console is usually released with a mix of old and new games, while the 3DS only had two direct ports of existing games to make it worth purchasing. The uDraw is symptomatic of this backwards ethic developers cultivate, and Nintendo seems to encourage.\nThe uDraw is one of the worst peripherals currently on the market. Developed and distributed by THQ (who can do far better), this product show a lack of respect for their target market, it proves just how much they think they can get away with. When something with such shoddy design and such a catastrophic failure to appeal on any level is released, traditionally (Powerglove, anyone?), the company will be shamed into either shutting down or rethinking their design ethic completely.\nSadly, THQ are far too influential and powerful to be tangibly affected if such a product doesn't sell, but the audacity it took to release the uDraw in this state should be met with a universal distaste from the consumers in the form of zero sales. Disappointingly this probably won't happen, mostly due to slick marketing. The uDraw deserves far worse.\nThe uDraw is a tablet peripheral for the Nintendo Wii. It was only a matter of time before a product like this was released, seemingly perfect for a motion sensitive console like the Wii. The unit is a white rectangle with a stylus fitted into the side and a hollow depression for the Wii remote to be inserted. The remote needs to be fitted into the uDraw before you can play, though to navigate the Wii's menu you must remove the remote from the uDraw's case, which seems indicative of a lack of forethought during the design process.\nThe stylus is supposed to be used to navigate the in-game menus, but holding a flimsy pen the required millimetre above the unit and selecting an option is a test of patience far more strenuous than something aimed at children should be.\nWhile physically the product feels as though it wouldn't survive an hour in the hands of a child, the software is where the uDraw shows its true colours. Currently there are five uDraw games available, though I only got to try out two, Pictionary and Dood's Big Adventure.\nPictionary is fine, being a game already it would've been hard to mess it up, but nothing special. Once again the controls let down what could've been a decent game. Drawing anything even mildly complex is an exercise in mind-numbing futility. Pictionary is merely content to be uninspired and adequate.\nDood's Big Adventure, on the other hand, is the worse of the two. The story, a nonsensical tale about Dood and his unexciting friends doing god-knows-what, is so absent that D"}

The Cubs will end a regular season Sunday that felt more like a beginning, the National League wild-card play-in game looms Wednesday, and construction on the team's 101-year-old ballpark outside Ricketts' office window symbolizes progress that has made this a most satisfying year.\nHas it been a vindicating one for Ricketts?\nBut not only has the reality changed for the man whose family purchased the team in 2009, but the perception of Ricketts is that he has improved from clumsy executive to capable leader \u2014 not that he has noticed.\n\"In the end, we're going to be judged by whether or not we won,'' Ricketts said. \"A lot of what happens in the middle is just noise. I hope we've built trust with the fans. What the Cubs have had to go through to stabilize the team was asking a lot of fans and I'm not sure a lot of other teams could have done it but our fans are so loyal. They want to see a championship. They're with us through this process.\"\nAt the end of a relaxed, reflective 45-minute interview in his office, Ricketts looked pensive as he escorted me toward the exit. Before shaking hands to say goodbye, he made a request. A week's worth of talking to every local and national outlet interested in baseball's best postseason story had worn Ricketts out \u2014 media cynics referred to it as the victory lap \u2014 but he wanted to add one last thing for emphasis.\nBut if this month represents the peak so far, the valley came during his first full season as Cubs chairman. Calling former manager Rick Renteria last fall to inform him the Cubs were going to replace him with Joe Maddon challenged Ricketts on a personal level, but nothing professionally tested his resolve like August 2010. That's when manager Lou Piniella retired abruptly with 38 games left to care for his ailing mother, leaving behind a team in disarray and an organization lacking direction.\n\"That was pretty rough,'' Ricketts said of the season in which the Cubs finished 75-87.\nOnly Starlin Castro remains from that team.\nRicketts knew Theo Epstein by reputation but the two never had met. That changed one October day in 2011 when Ricketts arranged a meeting at his family's New York apartment to avoid being seen in Chicago or Boston.\nConditioned from life as a Cubs fan, Ricketts feared the worst.\nAlmost immediately, Ricketts sensed his worry was unwarranted.\nLuring Epstein with his two World Series rings away from the Red Sox \u2014 even if, in Epstein's words, he was \"near my expiration date\" \u2014 marked the true beginning of legitimacy for Ricketts as Cubs chairman. Without Epstein, there likely is no Joe Maddon. Without Maddon, there is no Jon Lester. Nodding his head, Ricketts agreed no other decision made before or since hiring Epstein surpasses its significance during his regime.\n\"Obviously, bringing Theo into the organization was the biggest thing we've done, by far, to improve our chances of winning,''"}

Cohen, who served as the top United States diplomat on Africa in the Republican administration of the first President Bush, assesses the likely approach of a Trump administration towards the continent, emphasizing the benefits to U.S business interests of maintaining a number of longstanding policies.\nThere is already much speculation as to President Donald J. Trump's likely policy toward Africa. During the campaign, the Trump team did not speak very much about foreign policy in general, and said almost nothing about Africa.\nWhat follows is an effort to discern his Africa policy based on extrapolations from some of his general statements.\nIn terms of international trade, Mr. Trump emphasized his view that some U.S. trading partners are treating this country unfairly, especially in terms of currency manipulation (China), subsidies to exports (South Korea) and underpaying workers (Mexico).\nLooking at Africa, the first thing Trump's experts are likely to notice is the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the legislation that grants African nations the right to export to the United States virtually anything they produce duty free. The Trump team, with their eye on discrimination, will note that this is a one-way privilege: Africans are not required to import U.S. goods duty-free.\nThe Trump administration will likely insist on reciprocity from the Africans in bilateral trade. I recommend they refrain from making any changes until the volume of U.S.-Africa trade rises from its still relatively low level.\nThe Trump campaign talked at length about the U.S. spending too much money helping other countries. Since the early days of African independence in the 1960s, economic development, supported by significant amounts of foreign aid, has been a bedrock of U.S.-Africa policy. Some Trump advisers have characterized aid to African countries as a total waste. The Trump call for \"America first\" may mean less money spent to help Africa and more money devoted to rebuilding the United States.\nOn the other hand, since many U.S.-based global companies have been making the case that foreign assistance helps build the infrastructure needed for expanding their markets into Africa, the Trump administration's pro-business approach may mean continuing to provide this aid, which makes up less than one percent of our overall budget.\nEconomic aid to Africa has been a key foreign policy element under all modern presidential administrations. Without development aid, the ability of the U.S. to influence African policies on many issues, including voting in the United Nations, military overflight rights, and environmental problems, would be diminished.\nThe Obama administration has made a concerted effort to support African nations that are fighting \"jihadist\" terrorism, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, AQIM in the Maghreb and al-Shabab in Somalia. U.S. military advisers and trainers are on the ground throughout the Sahel region, Djibouti and Nigeria. There are intelligence drones in the Republic of Niger. Given Trump's strong rhetoric on terrorism, the Obama policy is likely to be continued.\nThere are significant U.S. business investments in Africa, especially in oil and other extractive industries. There are also growing investments in manufacturing and the retail sector.\nThe Trump campaign has said almost nothing about this element, but it seems clear that Trump will do everything to support U.S. investors to make sure they are treated fairly and equitably."}

(AP) \u2014 Casinos in Rhode Island lost nearly $900,000 on sports betting in February after winning bets for the Super Bowl and other professional sports were paid out, the state lottery said Friday.\nGamblers have placed a total of $53.5 million in wagers since the late November launch of sports betting in the state, with $53.2 million paid on winning bets, according to the lottery's figures for bets placed at Twin River Casino in Lincoln and Tiverton. The state gets 51 percent of sports betting profits, after subtracting expenses.\nThat leaves Rhode Island with a profit of about $150,000. The state had projected it would get $11.5 million from the new market this fiscal year, which ends June 30.\nMany football fans went to the casinos in January and early February to bet on the victorious New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. In February alone, gamblers placed about $20.7 million in wagers and the casinos paid nearly $21.6 million on winning bets, for a $900,000 loss.\nOther states with legal sportsbooks that launched in the past year didn't bring in as much in February as they had in preceding months. New Jersey's physical sportsbooks had a tax bill of negative $6,000 for the month, but the online ones brought the state $1.7 million.\nOverall, most of the states with newly legal sports betting are on pace to fall short of their revenue projections, but none are lagging as far behind as Rhode Island.\nRhode Island is just 1.3 percent of the way to its $11.5 million goal. Rhode Island Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi said Friday that it will obviously be difficult to meet that goal and that the budget will have to be adjusted.\n\"We'll be better able to project revenue as we get more experience,\" he said. \"I think the people who set their budget gave their best estimates based on the information they had and what the consultants were telling them. In some ways, we're learning a hard lesson.\"\nRevenue for March is looking far better than February's figures due to the NCAA Tournament, Grimaldi said. Gamblers wagered $6.4 million during the first round of the tournament and the state is expecting about $500,000 in revenue from just that round, he added.\nGov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Monday to allow sports betting to move online. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello introduced it to generate revenue and make betting more convenient.\nRuggerio said Friday that the numbers will likely improve as the facilities are better prepared to accommodate everyone who wants to wager, with the self-serve kiosks that have been added and the future addition of mobile sports wagering.\n\"It is doubtful that revenue figures will hold up to estimates, in large part due to a disappointing February, which was not unexpected due to the success of the Patriots,\" he said in a statement. \"With the NCAA basketball tournament in full swing, I anticipate that March numbers will be much better.\"\nRaimondo's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 counts on $30 million from sports betting, including $3 million in new revenue from mobile gambling. Grimaldi said he thinks the $30 million estimate will likely be lowered.\nRhode Island legalized and launched sports betting after the U.S."}

Congress will need to take a close look at its many provisions in order to come to an informed decision,\" Hyde said.\nUS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to be grilled by legislators during a Congressional hearing on the agreement next week.\nBurns said Monday the administration was open to ideas by legislators that could \"strengthen\" the agreement.\n\"If members of Congress have ideas that would not be deal breakers or require us to renegotiate, and they think and we think those ideas can strengthen the arrangement, we are all ears,\" he said.\nAfter the forum, Burns told reporters that \"there is a difference between ideas or conditions that are meant to strengthen the agreement and ideas or conditions that are meant to essentially have us go back and renegotiate it.\n\"And I said we are open to the former and not to the latter,\" he stressed.\nSome US lawmakers and experts are worried that the deal, although limited to civilian sales, might indirectly aid India's nuclear weapons program, lead to an Asian arms race and encourage other countries to seek exemptions from controls on nuclear trade.\nThe feared that regimes like Iran and North Korea could cite the US-India deal to pursue their own nuclear weapons ambitions.\nBurns said he hoped that Congress would clear the deal by June so that it could be presented for endorsement by the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, which oversees trade in atomic fuel and technology.\n\"We hope that the vote will be positive.\n\"We are going to wait until Congress acts before we formally ask\" the nuclear suppliers to endorse the deal, he said.\nThe nuclear deal needs to be accepted by the international Nuclear Suppliers Group to effectively end India's status as a nuclear pariah after it first tested a nuclear weapon three decades ago."}

The big issue at the moment is under AIDA64 - an almost industry standard benchmark for us, we see that Quad Channel isn't painted in the best light.\nIt's not our job to go out there and make sure the product is painted in the best light. It's not like Intel has turned around and said anything to us, though, it's just this personal issue I'm having at the moment with the numbers we're getting out of Quad Channel memory in our normal benchmarks. It doesn't make sense that from a bandwidth perspective it offers no more performance than Dual Channel, if not slightly less at times.\nSome of the numbers we've seen under AIDA64 haven't lined up with what you'd think Quad Channel is capable of.

It now moves to the Assembly where it is expected to die.\nThe Republican-led bill cleared the Senate on a 46-15 vote. The measure \u2013 S7594 \u2013 would lift the taxes on the state\u2019s gas and diesel purchases from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. Advocates say it would save consumers about 32 cents per gallon in state sales, motor fuel excise and petroleum business taxes during the three-month price break.\nThey also say that savings would double for consumers if the federal government endorses a potential suspension of collections of the federal tax on gas and diesel.\nThe New York bill\u2019s next stop is the Democratic-controlled Assembly. The effort is unlikely to gain any traction there as party leaders and Democratic Gov. David Paterson are opposed to the idea.\nThey cite concerns about the financial hit the state would take from May 23 through Sept. 1.

Some were sent directly to my e-mail address, but most were left in the comments section of my online review, on proud display for the public like so much toilet paper on a front lawn. (I suspect they've polluted other virtual spaces as well, but there are better things I can do with my time than to look for them.) I have little intention of entering a dialogue with these commenters, for all their confrontational goading. If the rampant spelling and grammatical mistakes were any indication, most of them were motivated by impulsive anger rather than desire for genuine conversation\u2014though, in their defense, I wasn\u2019t too interested in entering a dialogue with The Avengers either. I guess that means we\u2019re even now and we can all have dessert.\nStill, the negative comments were instructive in a few ways. As a benign manifestation of lynch-mob mentality, they reflect a stance towards culture that\u2019s worlds apart from my own: the insistence that there's no alternative to one\u2019s own opinion and that one can be only \"right\" or \"wrong\" about a work of art. I also learned, courtesy of a commenter who identified himself only as Morganthus, that anger doesn\u2019t always hinder one's capacity for character assessment. \"This reviewer, who've [sic] I've read on and off over the years here in Chicago . . . is very emotionally imbalanced,\" he wrote. How did Morganthus know?\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2004, though I suspect I've lived with it my entire life. As a kid, I always had phases of acting out and extreme introversion, bouts of sleeplessness when the weather changed, the tendency to cry for hours over trivial offenses, among other telltale symptoms. But I denied that anything could have been wrong with me: like many others with mental illness, I found it too humiliating to admit I may not be responsible for my own behavior. I accepted these symptoms as badges of a unique personality, which psychiatric treatment would succeed only in sterilizing. I cherished my periods of euphoria\u2014when all experience seemed to possess the vitality and visual beauty of my favorite movies\u2014and I didn't want those taken away.\nMy childhood didn't lack for friendships and my parents were as tolerant of my moods as I could have hoped. (My dad would try to shake me out of my depressive episodes with the brusque but helpful \"You\u2019ve got to grow a thicker skin, kid,\" advice that came in handy when reading all those silly comments.) Still, I never identified with groups of people and felt excluded from most cultural trends. I couldn't fall in line with any sort of consensus, I believed, since an internal sea change could always throw me out of it. My relationship to art\u2014though founded on deep gratitude\u2014was erratic and largely private. I liked the movies, literature, and music that I did because they gave form to emotions I couldn't organize in real life. I still respond to them in this way, even after years of counseling and antidepressants have brought me out of my hermetic worldview. The arts have been so integral to my development\u2014indeed, my stability\u2014that I find it difficult to issue anything like an objective assessment of what I see, read, or hear.

It was his first and only Tri - but Takapuna will change all of that.\n\"My last attempt at a triathlon didn't go so well. It was a running start for the swim with quite a few people. Being my first attempt at the swim, I didn't expect such a fight at the start. I had swum about 20 metres when I got a massive kick to the jaw. I was disorientated and got pulled out of the water by the lifeguards. It was a huge disappointment for me as I had put a lot of effort into my preparation. It pretty much put me off triathlons. I haven't done a swimming event since that day. The Takapuna Tri will be my first attempt to dip my feet back into the water.\"\nThe Albany father of two admits the incident put him off any competitive swimming for a long time. But he did still have a strong desire to complete a triathlon.\n\"Every time I went to enter another triathlon, the swim stopped me from clicking the submit button. All that changed when one of the guys that I train kettlebells with, entered the Sovereign Takapuna Tri. He suggested that I should look into the race because it's great for beginners. I checked out the course map and the swim sounded like a safer option, so I entered.\"\nEvent Director Stuart Dwight is delighted that Morne has chosen Takapuna to make his return.\n\"Often it is the swim that puts people off entering a triathlon, but the Sovereign Tri Series is very much about welcoming first timers or those who might be a bit nervous about the swim. The short distance option often involves swimming in very shallow water and over a short distance, this allows beginners to race with confidence, knowing that we have a great team of surf lifesavers keeping a close watch on them, but also knowing that they can simply stop and stand up if they need a rest.\n\"The Takapuna course for the Sovereign Tri Series is a great one, with the full road closure, great surroundings for family and friends to enjoy watching and the chance to relax and watch the elites in their races on the same day, I just know Morne, his friends and family are going to have a great day.\"\nThe 42-year old has been training for the Takapuna Triathlon since January. He was doing a few short sessions to lift his basic fitness level, but then he started ramping it up at the beginning of February, doing more swimming sessions and more cycling and running combo sessions.\n\"I have good base fitness from the gym and kettlebell training.

{"idx": "29347", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: When sustainability standards for commercial buildings were introduced in the mid-1990s, contractors were often expected to provide guarantees that the property would receive certification for the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s (USGBC) LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or Energy Star. But since professionals and owners lacked experience in meeting green standards, if a building ended up not qualifying for certification, it wasn\u2019t always easy to see who was at fault.\nSustainable buildings are becoming more commonplace\u2014the USGBC certified its 10,000th project in mid-2011, and is currently certifying an additional 1.6 million feet each day around the world\u2014so both owners and contractors understand the certification process for new green construction much better than they did even just a few years ago.\nHowever, when it comes to certain aspects of green building\u2014like implementing innovations, selecting green products, retrofitting existing buildings and overall energy performance\u2014uncertainty remains, and therefore liability continues to be a difficult issue, say industry experts.\n\u201cThe concepts of green design are still so new that nobody really knows what is expected of a design professional,\u201d says Jeff Cavignac, founder of Cavignac & Associates, a San Diego-based independent commercial insurance broker that manages risk and negotiates insurance on behalf of its clients.\nNegligence occurs when the standard of care is not met, or when the professional\u2019s performance falls below what a standard architect or engineer would do. But with green design, the standard of care is a moving target, says Cavignac.\nHis advice is for both owners and designers to treat green building contracts as critical, whether a design professional is working toward green standards for the first time or has a lot of experience in the achieving LEED or Energy Star standards.\nDan Null, vice president of sustainability services at WSP + Flack, a New York City-based international engineering firm, agrees. He says he\u2019s seen owners veer from their goals because their budget changes or they simply decide they don\u2019t like the look of a sustainable feature and switch to a standard one, which loses certification points. \u201cIn truth, achieving the desired rating goal is in fact the result of a partnership between the owner, the design consultants, the contractors, the constructors,\u201d he says.\nSure, says Slivka, errors can and do occur on standard buildings but green designs are often characterized by intricacies that didn\u2019t come with traditional construction.\nFirst, many green products, including HVAC equipment and electrical and plumbing fixtures, are so new they\u2019re untested. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re being applied in a different manner to produce a more efficient effect, but we just don\u2019t have the track record to test for true effects the way we do in traditional construction,\u201d says Slivka.\nRetrofitting an existing structure brings its own particular set of liability issues. For instance, LEED certification requires the use of at least 60 percent of recycled materials\u2014whether concrete, steel and wood\u2014all of which must be tested for contamination. And a traditionally built structure sometimes needs additional support to handle the load of, say, solar panels or a wind turbine on the roof, both of which increase wind load and the change of leakage.\nPut simply, that puts items on a roof that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there says Ruben Alspector, senior vice president of the NIA Group, commercial real estate brokers covering greater New York City area. In his experience, he says, vegetative roofs, which are a green feature often added to existing buildings, tend to overbuilt to handle the load, but that\u2019s not always the case. \u201cWe"}

Barring injuries -- and there have been some jarring ones already in OTAs -- jobs are rarely won or lost right now, because padless, no-contact practices are much more mental exercises than they are physical.\nBlue-chip players just don't come loose this late in the offseason very often, so the Philadelphia Eagles' decision to cut ties with their Pro Bowl guard still qualifies as a surprise, even if his contract discontent and Chip Kelly's hopes of trading him were well known. Reaching the $5.5 million-per-year salary he was due to make in Philly might be a high hurdle for Mathis, because so many teams already have most of their rosters set and salary-cap space accounted for. But as a free agent, Mathis can survey the landscape for a team with the scheme and bankroll to suit him and hope a bidding war erupts for his services. His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told WQAM radio in Miami that \"at least a half a dozen\" teams had already reached out to him about Mathis, and that he expects the guard to sign by the time training camps open.\n\u00bb Both New York teams: The Jets shuffled right guards regularly during the spring, while the Giants' O-line is in flux in the wake of Will Beatty's weight-lifting injury.\n\u00bb Denver Broncos: There is exactly one veteran starter returning here (Louis Vasquez), creating the awful possibility that Peyton Manning plays behind one of the shakiest lines he's had in years.\n\u00bb Miami Dolphins: They have allowed 104 sacks over the last two seasons -- not a comforting number for young, suddenly-well-compensated QB Ryan Tannehill.\n\u00bb Seattle Seahawks: They've lost two starters off a less-than-stellar line, and solidifying that group could make Seattle the strong NFC favorite.\n\u00bb Oakland Raiders: They have the need and the money to sign Mathis.\nThere was a time when this seemed like the biggest issue the New England Patriots would face this offseason. That was before the Wells Report and Tom Brady's subsequent suspension. But Brady will be the starting quarterback whenever he's allowed to be on the field, although it will be interesting to see how many reps Matt Flynn gets this week after signing to be the third quarterback behind Jimmy Garoppolo. The Pats' secondary isn't quite as settled just yet.\nParting ways with Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner this offseason was a defense-changing sequence. But from the time they left to the time New England hosts the league's season opener in September, Bill Belichick will have had six months to figure out how to adjust. Considering that the Patriots are one of the game's great shape-shifters -- remember the few hours last season when Jonas Gray appeared to be the new centerpiece of the offense? -- that seems to be plenty of time. Malcolm Butler, who became a Super Bowl hero with his game-saving end-zone interception, could take on a much larger role than he did last season, now that he is out of Belichick's OTA doghouse and back to practice.

The ballots were not tabulated by Long Island officials on election night Nov. 4, and all 21 of them were cast for Manchester, according to a written statement Tuesday from Secretary of State Matt Dunlap.\nThe 21 ballots, combined with ballots from other towns that had been missing or were changed in the recount, were enough to reverse the results of the election and give Manchester an 11-vote victory over Breen, 10,927 to 10,916. The unofficial election night results, before the recount, showed Breen beating Manchester by 32 votes, 10,930 to 10,898.\nThe Maine Democratic Party did not accept the results of the recount, which means the Maine Senate will create a special committee to review the recount and recommend a winner to the full Senate. Republicans will control the Senate when it is sworn in Dec. 3 and will hold four of the seven seats on the committee, which has broad discretion to make a recommendation as it evaluates the recount results.\nKate Knox, a Maine Democratic Party attorney, hopes the Senate committee investigates the Long Island ballots before making its recommendation. Specifically, she wants the committee to order a new recount and subpoena the Long Island town clerk to explain why the official tally on a sealed box of ballots, as well as a voter manifest, differed from the number of ballots inside the box.\nLong Island officials checked off the names of voters as they entered the polls on Election Day, and the final list showed that 171 ballots were cast. The unofficial results that night showed Breen with 95 votes, Manchester with 65 votes and 11 ballots with no selection in their race.\nBut when the locked box containing the ballots was opened during the recount last week, there were 192 ballots rather than 171, and all of the additional votes were cast for Manchester. That changed the final tally to 95 votes for Breen, 86 for Manchester and 11 with no selection.\nKnox said the party was considering legal remedies because there could be voter fraud.\nBrenda L. Singo, the Long Island town clerk, declined to verify the Democratic Party\u2019s claim of phantom ballots and referred calls to Dunlap, the secretary of state. Kristen Schulze Muszynski, a spokeswoman for Dunlap, said the issue was now in the hands of the Senate committee.\nDunlap, a Democrat elected by the Legislature, could initiate an investigation if he suspects that any balloting irregularities rose to the level of criminal activity. He did not appear to be leaning in that direction Tuesday afternoon.\nIn an interview, Dunlap said the discrepancy between election night and the recount may not have been flagged by either election officials or party lawyers because it\u2019s rare, although it has happened before, particularly in small towns like Long Island where ballots"}

A K Antony was defence minister at the time.\nHe assured his paymasters at Agusta that he had negotiated the deal despite the obstacles by organising a \"very high-level intervention\". He confidently informed Saponaro that the cabinet should clear the contract in their favour by the end of the week, despite the pushback from the Americans and the Russians as well as the finance secretary's reservations on pricing.\nThe Cabinet Committee on Security led by then PM Manmohan Singh had cleared the proposal for 12 VVIP helicopters in AgustaWestland's favour on January 18, 2010. CBI officials suspect Michel had sent this fax dispatch from his Mumbai office just before the final decision.\nThe Russian lobby, according to Michel, had a strong connection with the then finance secretary. The finance secretary's office, Michel claimed, was sending negative messages, suggesting that the finance ministry did not support the deal. The middleman, accused of bribing Indian politicians, bureaucrats and IAF officials, warned that Russia's deal was on behalf of a government enterprise and hence didn't require any integrity pact or bid bond and the solution was \"much cheaper\".\nIn his communication to Saponaro, Michel claimed that when the defence ministry received the finance secretary's notation on file, they decided that this had gone too far. He told Saponaro that the finance secretary had not discussed the matter with his minister and was trying to stop the file from going to the CCS.\nIn what further showed Michel's knowledge about future meetings and decisions, he told Saponaro that finance ministry's concerns would be sent on \"Friday\" to the defence minister, who would then meet the finance minister to \"sort this out\" and \"end the dispute\".\nCBI sources said Michel had given vague answers on the fax dispatch during his questioning over the last 14 days."}

Then, institutions are ranked according to 16 different academic areas where each area has its own weight in the total ranking of the institution.\nBut this ranking system doesn't take in to account veteran or military programs for students who previously served, are currently serving or their dependents.\nBefore we look at the Top Ranked Colleges, here are the key veteran and military programs that schools can offer to help support you.\nBAH - The Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) payments you receive for the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill are based on the military's Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates for an E-5 with dependents. The Department of Defense adjusts the BAH every calendar year (or January 1) based on changes to housing costs across the country. BAH rates for online colleges, schools, or distance learning programs is $754.50. BAH is not paid during summer or winter breaks, but Spring Break counts. Dropping courses can negatively affect BAH payments.\nCampus SVA Chapter - SVA chapters are student-veteran groups that have formed on college and university campuses to provide peer-to-peer networks for veterans who are attending those schools. The chapters are designed to be advocates for student veterans, and to help bridge the campus-to-career transition.\nFull-Time Veteran Counselor On Campus - A full-time veteran counselor is on campus to offer support and assistance for any array of student-veteran issues. These counselors will assist veterans in a number of ways, including helping them determine which services they need to succeed, and then directing how to engage them.\nSigned VA Principles Of Excellence - Educational institutions participating in the Principles of Excellence program agree to follow a set of guidelines pertaining to student-veteran issues. Examples of these guidelines include: Providing students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program and designating a point-of-contact for academic and financial advising.\nClub/Association For Veterans - These institutions offer student-veteran clubs and associations on their campuses.\nVeteran Upward Bound Program - The Veteran Upward Bound Program is designed to motivate and assist veterans in the development of academic and other requisite skills necessary for acceptance and success in a program of post-secondary education. The program provides assessment and enhancement of basic skills through counseling, mentoring, tutoring, and academic instruction in the core subject areas.\n8 Keys To Veterans' Success - The \"8 Keys to Veterans' Success\" are steps that postsecondary institutions can take to assist veterans and service members in transitioning to higher education, completing their college programs, and obtaining career-ready skills. These postsecondary institutions have voluntarily affirmed their support for the 8 Keys.\nOffers ROTC Program -The Reserve Officers' Training Corps is one of the best opportunities for you to"}

Picking up a digital camera for the first time was a huge leap forward.\nThe first thing that struck me about the Concord Eye-Q 4360z from Concord Camera Corp. of Hollywood, Fla., was its size. Compared with the dimensions and heft of my Pentax, the Concord is small'at 100 mm by 61 mm by 38 mm'easily slipping into a shirt pocket.\nThere were several things I immediately liked about it. Getting started was easy. Both the Quick Start Guide and the more detailed user's manual were clear and walked me through setup with no glitches.\nThe camera is straightforward to use after that. You point, you shoot. The buttons for reviewing and deleting are quick and easy.\nI took the camera to lunch with some friends who have a new baby, and we were all happy with the shots.\nAt 4 megapixels, the camera has a wide range of picture resolutions to choose from. The 16M internal memory will hold up to 52 pictures in Normal setting, which is the one I used. The company recommends this setting for snapshot-sized prints.\nFor larger prints, the camera has a Fine setting and can hold about 20 of those shots.\nI did have problems lining up photos using the 1.5-inch TFT display, so I switched to the viewfinder. I was impressed that the viewfinder operated with the camera's 3X optical zoom, though not with the 6X digital zoom.\nDownloading the photos to my PC was as simple as a few mouse clicks. Then I was off to a party to celebrate another friend's marriage. The camera continued to be easy to use, and the slide switch on the back made for quick reviews and deletions of photos.\nBut after about 16 photos, it ran into a common problem: The batteries began to fail.\nThe camera came with a battery charger and two rechargeable batteries. I followed the instructions and charged the batteries for 24 hours before using the camera again.\nPerhaps this is why Concord sells the unit with a four-battery charger, so you can charge a couple extras.\nEven with dead batteries, I was still able to retrieve the photos and download them to my PC.\nAnother shortcoming: The camera did great with shots in the 15- to 20-foot range, but beyond that photos seemed to lose their crispness. The few landscape shots I took came out soft and lacked pop.\nThe power situation was the biggest disappointment for me. It would make me hesitate to carry along this camera on a trip where I wouldn't have access to the battery charger every night.\nIn short, I'm not giving up my Pentax, but the Concord makes a fun backup."}

Though I grew up between London and Qatar, my mother made the trip back to Syria to give birth to me and each of my siblings so she could be with her family.\nMy grandparents were the last of my immediate relatives to live in Palestine. They fled in 1948, in what we call the Nakba \u2013 the Catastrophe \u2013 with all their 20 children in tow. They settled into a new life in Syria, and talk of \u201cback home\u201d was what kept them going: stories filled with the romance of Palestinian life, culture and history. This was instilled in us.\nWe went back to visit my grandmother every year. I remember running through the markets, collecting bags of rice and flour, lentils and grains to prepare for meals. We called every shop owner Uncle or Auntie and we\u2019d often leave without paying; it would be settled at a later date. This is what I loved about the Middle East then \u2013 I felt freedom and trust everywhere.\nMy mother always says I was a little terror when my younger brother arrived. This is where the kitchen came into the picture. She\u2019d use cooking, which she had to do anyway, to keep me occupied. I loved it because I got to spend more time with her; little did I know that this would shape my future.\nThough I have never been to Palestine myself, I do feel defined by it. I was always told of our land, abundant with dates sweeter than honey, figs that are juicy and fragrant, olives that are large, plump, tangy and bitter, thyme so wild and fresh you could smell it in the streets and pastries drenched in orange blossom water, their aromas wafting through the streets. It was this that captured me.\nIn his book Gaza Writes Back, Palestinian author Refaat Alareer wrote: \u201cSometimes a homeland becomes a tale. We love the story because it is about our homeland and we love our homeland even more because of the story.\u201d I\u2019m sure many displaced Palestinians can relate to this. Since Palestine has been occupied, food has taken on huge importance. It is a means of connecting us to a past \u2013 and an identity \u2013 that is slowly vanishing. Food is a voice for Palestinians and this has spurred my cooking.\nEssential to Palestinian eating are bread and pastry. They are quick, cheap and filling. I remember making \u201cbeehive\u201d bread with my grandmother Najla, cutting the dough into balls, and stuffing these variously with halloumi, akkawi cheese, minced lamb and za\u2019atar. I\u2019d create my own stuffings too, with honey, thyme and cheese, or homemade fig or date jam. We\u2019d bake them sprinkled with sesame seeds, and they became a pull-apart bread to eat with almost anything.\nToday\u2019s recipe is the lovechild of the original beehive bread I made with Najla, and more familiar cinnamon buns. Like those pastries, they\u2019re swirled inside, but I\u2019ve replaced cinnamon with za\u2019atar \u2013 the fragrant mix of dried wild thyme, sesame seeds, marjoram and salt that Palestinians use as a seasoning \u2013 and slathered them with good olive oil. It is believed that za\u2019atar helps to stimulate the mind and memory, so we\u2019d eat it with bread everyday, and always before an exam.\n1 Line the bottom and sides of a roasting tin or large brownie tin, preferably around "}

What he found both confirmed what he suspected and surprised him.\nAccording to Barbosa\u2019s research, one neighborhood, Lagoas, was almost 90 percent white.\nNationwide, the share of Brazilians who identified as white in the census was only 48 percent.\nFor further confirmation, GlobalPost showed the study to a senior demographer at Brazil\u2019s National School of Statistical Sciences. He said it looks accurate and estimated that little has changed since that census.\nBarbosa posted his maps on a new blog and Facebook, where they were shared hundreds of times.\nThe Brazilian census has five (broad and oft-criticized) categories for race: \u201cbranco,\u201d Portuguese for white; \u201cpardo,\u201d literally brown for mixed-race with African descent; \u201cpreto,\u201d or black; \u201camarelos\u201d or yellow (yes, unbelievably) for people of Asian descent; and \u201cindigeno\u201d for indigenous peoples.\nApproximately 50 percent of the country's population identified as either pardo or preto (both also referred to as Afro-Brazilian). About half of Rio's population did as well.\nBarbosa also produced three maps showing each racial group individually in the South Zone.\nBarbosa said he spent a lot of time putting together the maps, and hopes they add to a growing conversation in Brazil about race, disparity and criminal justice issues. As GlobalPost recently reported, young black men are killed in overwhelmingly disproportionate numbers by police officers in Rio. Barbosa echoed activists who said race is seldom discussed by Brazil\u2019s policy makers.\nJose Eustaquio Alves, a demographer and professor at Brazil\u2019s National School of Statistical Sciences, said most Brazilian cities are similarly segregated.\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Rio, he said, is that non-white and white neighborhoods abut each other.\nThere are \u201cfavelas\u201d \u2014 poor, underdeveloped neighborhoods where residents are predominantly non-white \u2014 right alongside some of the most expensive real estate in Brazil. Typically, he said, favelas are out in the suburbs of Brazilian cities, where land is cheap and work commutes can be very long.\nAlves said Barbosa\u2019s mapping work has been done previously by other demographers, but that the accessibility of data online combined with free mapping software mean that anybody can now create sophisticated maps to illustrate demographic trends."}

It\u2019s turned on 24/7 which some enjoy, but others don\u2019t like. Thankfully it\u2019s customizable.\nAs millions get their new phone many will have questions and concerns. And while it may take a minute to get used to the always on screen, we\u2019d recommend keeping it. If not, read on for the simple instructions.\nWhen you turn off the Galaxy S8 or S8+ screen, it\u2019s still on. A small area displays the time, date, battery level and even some notifications. It\u2019s called an \u201cAlways-on Display\u201d but it\u2019s not for everyone. Luckily we can easily customize it a bit, or turn it off completely.\nThankfully almost every aspect of this device is customizable. Samsung really delivered. In settings, you\u2019ll find options, controls, or on/off switches for just about everything.\nTo disable the always on display feature we quickly need to head to Settings > Lock Screen & Security > Always On Display > and flip the switch to OFF. That\u2019s it. Here are more details and some screenshots to help you disable it.\nIt only takes a few taps in settings to disable this in the settings menu. Now the screen will completely turn off and show nothing. That said, users will need to tap the power button in order to quickly check notifications and such.\nBased on studies the average user turns their phone on over 150 times a day. Often just to check the time, weather or look at notifications. Rather than turn the entire phone on, let the Always-On display show this information at a glance. In the end, it should actually save you battery life. Samsung claims it uses less than 5% throughout an entire workday.\nIt even dims to a lower setting in a dark room or at night, and brighter during the day, making it easy to see at all times. Basically, it\u2019s worth using.\nAbove is an image of some of the options available for owners. There\u2019s no way to manually control the brightness or add new widgets (like a weather icon) but it\u2019s still pretty useful. Users can choose between 7-8 different clocks, backgrounds, calendars and more. There are even new \u201cfacewidgets\u201d where you can tap the clock and swipe over for more options, like music controls without waking up the device. Neat, right.\nSamsung also manually updates the Always-On Display app throughout the year with more features or options. So more could be coming soon. For now, try and get used to it, or disable the always on display with our instructions above.\nHow do I remove the text at the bottom of the always on screen??\nDo you know why the S8 goes completely dark during a phone call.

Moreover, separate litigation against AMC from other \u201cWalking Dead\u201d profit participants has since revealed evidence that AMC did not abide by the terms of a \u201cfavored nations\u201d clause in Darabont\u2019s contract, per Darabont\u2019s team.\nBransten noted that there was nothing stopping AMC\u2019s team from filing such a motion. But it was clear that AMC\u2019s team wanted the opportunity to lay out the legal reasoning for why they need to make the case for being allowed to submit supplemental information for the judge to consider as she rules on summary judgment.\n\u201cThe new allegations in case No. 2 have thrown a monkey wrench into this dispute as to what profits are due and owed to the plaintiffs under the agreement,\u201d said Orin Snyder, a Gibson Dunn attorney repping AMC.\nDarabont lawyer Jerry Bernstein, of Blank Rome, countered that AMC was seeking to impose a long delay on the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to delay the ruling on summary judgment for one day,\u201d Bernstein said.\nSnyder and Bernstein sparred early on during the short hearing, talking over each other. Bransten, meanwhile, was not amused when she spotted a member of the audience chewing gum and drinking coffee. \u201cNot in my courtroom,\u201d she scolded, sending her bailiff over to the offender with a trash can.\nAMC\u2019s team vowed to file the motion by March 8 and have the opposition and reply arguments wrapped up in 30 days.

That level of artificial intelligence, with machines doing the thinking instead of simply following commands, has eluded researchers for more than half a century.\nThe projects aimed at creating Web 3.0 all take advantage of increasingly powerful computers that can quickly and completely scour the Web.\nWeb 2.0, which describes the ability to seamlessly connect applications (like geographic mapping) and services (like photo-sharing) over the Internet, has in recent months become the focus of dot-com-style hype in Silicon Valley. But commercial interest in Web 3.0 \u2014 or the \u201csemantic Web,\u201d for the idea of adding meaning \u2014 is only now emerging.\nThe classic example of the Web 2.0 era is the \u201cmash-up\u201d \u2014 for example, connecting a rental-housing Web site with Google Maps to create a new, more useful service that automatically shows the location of each rental listing.\nUnder today\u2019s system, such a query can lead to hours of sifting \u2014 through lists of flights, hotel, car rentals \u2014 and the options are often at odds with one another. Under Web 3.0, the same search would ideally call up a complete vacation package that was planned as meticulously as if it had been assembled by a human travel agent.\nHow such systems will be built, and how soon they will begin providing meaningful answers, is now a matter of vigorous debate both among academic researchers and commercial technologists. Some are focused on creating a vast new structure to supplant the existing Web; others are developing pragmatic tools that extract meaning from the existing Web.\nBut all agree that if such systems emerge, they will instantly become more commercially valuable than today\u2019s search engines, which return thousands or even millions of documents but as a rule do not answer questions directly.\nToday researchers are pushing further. Mr. Spivack\u2019s company, Radar Networks, for example, is one of several working to exploit the content of social computing sites, which allow users to collaborate in gathering and adding their thoughts to a wide array of content, from travel to movies.\nRadar\u2019s technology is based on a next-generation database system that stores associations, such as one person\u2019s relationship to another (colleague, friend, brother), rather than specific items like text or numbers.\nOne example that hints at the potential of such systems is KnowItAll, a project by a group of University of Washington faculty members and students that has been financed by Google. One sample system created using the technology is Opine, which is designed to extract and aggregate user-posted information from product and review sites.\nOne demonstration project focusing on hotels \u201cunderstands\u201d concepts like room temperature, bed comfort and hotel price, and can distinguish between concepts like \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201calmost great\u201d and \u201cmostly O.K.\u201d to provide useful direct answers. Whereas today\u2019s travel recommendation sites force people to weed through long lists of comments and observations left by others, the Web. 3.0 system would weigh and rank all of the comments and find, by cognitive deduction, just the right hotel for a particular user.\nIn its current state, the Web is often described as being in the Lego phase, with all of its different parts"}

And while the idea that eating during late evening hours causes weight gain is largely a myth, there are numerous benefits to eating earlier -- benefits that go beyond less crowded restaurants.\nDuring later evening hours, people tend to eat high-calorie, low-nutrient foods that are easy to overeat, says Mary Flynn, a research dietitian at the Miriam Hospital, in Providence, Rhode Island. And if you skip meals earlier in the day or delay dinner, you're more likely to eat excessively in response to intense hunger. Bypassing your earliest meal of the day -- breakfast -- increases your body's response to the hormone insulin, which raises your risk for body fat storage and obesity.\nHeartburn is a tight or burning sensation in your chest, just behind your breastbone, that may worsen when you bend over or lie done. One way to avoid heartburn, says MayoClinic.com sleep specialist Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler, is to avoid large and fatty meals late in the day. Eating earlier allows your body time to digest food properly and lowers the risk of acidic stomach contents rising back up into your esophagus. This occurrence, also known as acid reflux, often accompanies heartburn. Lying down after eating makes heartburn worse, so leaving time between dinner and bedtime helps prevent it.\nHeartburn caused by eating near bedtime can interfere with restful sleep. Eating late -- particularly large amounts -- can also interfere with sleep by causing abdominal discomfort. Consuming too many liquids before bed, in the form of milk, juice, soup or other foods, can cause frequent waking to relieve your bladder. Rather than eating large meals before bed or going to bed hungry, which can also make sleeping difficult, Morgenthaler recommends eating a small, balanced snack. Cereal with low-fat milk, yogurt with granola and oatmeal are valuable options.\nEating throughout the day, starting with a balanced breakfast, promotes positive energy levels, mood and brain function, according to a \"Today's Dietitian\" article published in April 2009. Postponing meals, on the other hand, can zap your energy, leaving you with low blood sugar, exhaustion, low mood and a hefty appetite. To avoid these risks, aim for balanced meals and snacks at regular time intervals. Better sleep derived from earlier dinners also promotes positive daytime energy, making it easier to exercise and manage your weight. These attributes also play an important role in maintaining optimum energy levels.\nMcLaughlin, August. \"What Are the Benefits of Eating Early?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-eating-early-2467.html.

The sanctions freeze any assets in the United States and penalize US financial dealings with the officials.\nThe United States also revoked the visas of 49 Venezuelan officials and their family members, the State Department said.\nVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom Washington has recognized as interim president, had hoped to triumph in bringing in the stockpiles of food, which the United States coordinated with Colombia and Brazil.\nGuaido has said 300,000 people could die without an influx of aid into Venezuela.

A cabinet meeting prior to the massive public rally has heightened speculation of early elections in Telangana. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao could announce decision to dissolve assembly and go for early elections, sources have told NDTV.\nEven if the announcement does not come at the mega rally today, it is very clear that KCR is gearing up for elections before the end of 2018.\nThe Chief Minister has made major announcements for virtually every sector including the Rythu Bandhu or direct cash transfer scheme for farmers. Under this scheme farmers will get Rs 4000 per acre per season. The state government can now transfer cash to farmers ahead of the Rabi season. Out of Rs 12,000 crore allocated for this scheme, Rs 6000 crore has already reached the farmers' bank accounts.\nIn neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, in June, Chief Minister K Chandrababu Naidu increased subsidy under housing scheme for Dalits and raised free power limit from 50 to 100 units. At an outreach programme, Mr Naidu underscored the need for his party TDP, to win all seats in his state in 2019.\nKCR has also announced an insurance scheme for Telangana farmers.

He is also likely to raise doles for unemployed youth, and loans and grants for women enrolled in Self Help Groups.\nOpposition parties allege the ruling TRS is nervous and that is why the Chief Minister is announcing a slew of measures and organising massive rallies.\nAccording to estimates the additional sops could cost the state Rs 60,000 crore. \"They have pushed the state from being revenue rich to revenue deficit,\" said Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief Uttam Kumar Reddy.\nIn the last few days, there have been mass transfers of police officers, from the superintendent rank to deputy superintendent rank and inspectors, something that won't be possible after an election code of conduct cones into force.\nSources close to the Chief Minister say, September 6 could be the big announcement day as KCR, a fan of numerology, believes six as his lucky number."}
{"idx": "29394", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Kinder Morgan reported fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today. The energy infrastructure company had a busy quarter, to say the least, as it completed its consolidation merger with its former MLP affiliates. That merger, combined with turmoil in the oil market, created quite a lot to digest in the company&apos;s fourth-quarter report. Here are the highlights that matter most to investors.\nA look at the numbers that matterOn the surface it would appear that Kinder Morgan suffered a bad quarter. The company&apos;s earnings came in at just $0.08 per share, which missed estimates by $0.26 per share. Meanwhile, revenue of $3.95 billion came in about $350 million light. However, neither of those numbers really matter much to Kinder Morgan, as it&apos;s focused on distributable cash flow, which came in at $1.278 billion, or $0.60 per share. That&apos;s well above the $0.46 per share the company reported in the fourth quarter of last year and was more than enough to cover the company&apos;s dividend, which it actually boosted by 10% to $0.45 per share.\nSource: Chart by author. Data from Kinder Morgan&apos;s press release.\nAs we see on that chart, all but two of Kinder Morgan&apos;s now consolidated segments enjoyed strong year-over-year growth. The company&apos;s Natural Gas Pipeline segment continues to do the heavy lifting, as segment earnings were up 5% from last year&apos;s third quarter. Kinder Morgan enjoyed strong performance across most of its natural gas pipeline portfolio and expects continued strength in 2015. Meanwhile, the company also enjoyed robust growth in its Products Pipelines and Terminals segments, as segment earnings were up 11% and 25%, respectively. These gains were the results of both volume increases and acquisitions.\nThe two laggards this quarter were its Carbon Dioxide business and its Canadian operations. Lower oil prices were the culprit that dragged down the performance of the Carbon Dioxide segment, as oil production was strong and carbon dioxide production set a new record. That said, this segment is expected to be a drag on earnings in 2015 if oil prices don&apos;t improve. Finally, the company&apos;s Canadian operations were affected by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.\nLooking ahead Despite the weak oil market, Kinder Morgan expects 2015 to be a solid year. It reiterated its plan to declare $2 in dividends this year, as it still expects to end the year with substantial excess cash flow despite weaker-than-expected oil prices so far this year.\nOne of the reasons the company expects to meet its target is that it can use acquisitions to boost results. The company already has its first deal lined up, as it announced that it&apos;s acquiring a premier midstream position in the Bakken Shale play for $3 billion. The deal will be moderately accretive to cash available to pay dividends over the next two years before increasing to $0.06-$0.07 per share starting in 2017.\nThe final piece of important news is that the company announced that its COO, Steve Kean, will be promoted to CEO on June 1. It&apos;s a long-anticipated move, which should lead to a seamless transition. Founder, current CEO, and largest shareholder Richard Kinder will become the company&apos;s executive chairman and remain active in major decisions.\nKinder Morgan reported another solid quarter thanks"}

His methods were unconventional \u2013 what might be called laissez-faire television \u2013 in that he worked without script, with a single hand-held camera, while allowing his presenters\u2019 characters to emerge naturally as they grew into the medium.\nThe process was most marked with Floyd, never less than in his first outing, when he was filmed talking, drinking and cooking on a bucking trawler in the middle of the Channel in 1985. \u201cThis is probably the worst programme ever to come out of Plymouth\u201d was the snap judgment of some of Pritchard\u2019s colleagues as they watched, horrified, a somewhat drunk Floyd cooking up a monkfish tail for sceptical fishermen. But Pritchard knew, or hoped he knew, better, as he succeeded in promoting his work from local television to the BBC\u2019s national network.\nViewers took to the drinking, the constant banter between the chef and the film crew, the substitution of the camera lens for the audience\u2019s eye and the downright unexpectedness, if not disaster (cue the hot-air balloon crash-landing over the French Vosges mountains) of the scenario. After relations with Floyd soured, Pritchard worked his familiar magic with a second south-western chef, Stein.\nStein was not an immediately natural choice for media stardom. Again, the producer allowed him to be himself, to act naturally, to always film on location, never in a stultifying studio setting, and to embrace unlikely developments (the eruption on screen of Stein\u2019s dog Chalky) as well as occasional upsets. The partnership was enduring, with more than a dozen series and one-off programmes to its credit since the first airing of Taste of the Sea in 1995.\nWhile Pritchard\u2019s style was not without some precedent in British cookery television, it took it to new heights, as well as more successfully. It was the genesis of a certain school and left its watermark on many household names such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay and Nigella Lawson. Floyd always complained that he had spawned a nightmare, though no one, of course, could be more nightmarish than him.\nDavid was born in Southampton. His father, Arthur Pritchard, was a customs officer based along the coast in Weymouth, and his mother, Charlotte (nee Bee), later worked as an administrative assistant at Southampton University. They divorced in 1955, while David was still at the boarding school in Sussex to which he had been sent by Hampshire county council on account of his asthma. Returning to his home town to attend Mayfield Road secondary modern, he left at 16 with a single O-level, adding a second at technical college.\nAfter he had spent a few months working on a building site, his mother suggested a job with Southern, the local independent television company, as a film vault porter, definitely entry-level, carting large spools from one section to another. Evincing an interest in film editing, he taught himself the craft by emulation and imitation of his better-paid and senior colleagues.\nAt the end of the 1960s, by now an assistant film editor, Pritchard sought better prospects in Newcastle upon Tyne at Tyne Tees Television.

The flames worked their way up the home, engulfing the entire second floor. Firefighters made entry, but due to the building's nature as a multi-family dwelling, the additional walls made fighting the fire more difficult.\n\"This type of construction leads to worse things happening,\" Sieving said. \"Because of the way they built this house, the fire tends to run the walls straight to the attic, which is exactly what happened here. We kind of expected that, so that was our first strategy - get people in the attic.\"\nWith heavy fire on the second and third floor and flames shooting through the roof, the fire took a while to get under control but was eventually taken down by the conjoined efforts of the Mansfield Fire Department. According to Sieving, the building's owner had only recently acquired the home and was working on restoring it before the fire broke out.\nOne family that was living in the home escaped without injury. The cause of the fire is under investigation at this time.\nIt was a special day for Blake and Austin Dininger, even if they were not aware of it.\nJessicca Berry was a busy working mom to four daughters until she fell ill with two rare and debilitating dieases that effect her nervous system and her brain.

It begins with lesson planning, a process that involves establishing desired learner outcomes, designing strategies to teach their objectives, and developing tools to assess the effectiveness of their instruction. This advanced preparation is really only the beginning because teachers quickly realize that even the most well thought out lessons can, and usually do, have significant flaws. A skillful teacher can patch up some of these imperfections on the fly to salvage the lesson, but more often than not several trials and revisions are necessary to yield an effective final product.\nIt would be my hope that your administration reflects and reassesses its approach to education policy reform in a similar manner to ensure that public education is moving forward for our students by utilizing best-practice research in conjunction with feedback from educators like myself. This thoughtful and collaborative approach would go a long way toward repairing the strained relationship that has evolved between many educators and policymakers.\nI believe that primary strengths of your domestic policy agenda are your desired outcomes for public education. Under your leadership, your administration has sought to build and maintain a highly qualified teacher work force, been an advocate for equity in access to both early education and higher education, and pushed for the overhaul of NCLB to support struggling schools rather than punish them. These are among only a few of your objectives that should be maintained into your next term.\nTeacher quality is a fundamental pillar of any education system. So let's examine your policy objective to recruit, train, and retain exceptional teachers from my critical lens as an educator. One of the primary policy mechanisms with the aim of bolstering teacher quality was the Race to the Top program. We can use your home state of Illinois, where I happen to teach, as a case study to examine the impact of this federal policy.\nDealing with a state budget crisis, Illinois was eager to compete for federal dollars by rushing through the Performance Evaluation Reform Act with minimal input from educators. One positive result of the legislation was that our teacher-evaluation system, which was long overdue for a comprehensive overhaul, received attention from state lawmakers. Unfortunately, many of the policies promoted by Race to the Top were largely untested by current research, including the linkage of teacher evaluation to student-growth measures and the expansion of charter schools. In fact, recent studies have questioned the reliability of incorporating student-growth metrics into teacher evaluations. Studies have also emerged that suggest charter schools are fairing no better than public schools.\nFortunately, Mr. President, just as with the rough initial implementation of a new lesson plan, there is an opportunity now to regroup and refine policy strategies to move your public education vision forward. Alternative approaches to enhancing our teacher work force can be considered, such as creating incentives for higher education institutions to admit and recruit prospective teachers based on workforce demand and to strengthen their teacher-training curriculum.\nCurrently, many teacher preparation programs are churning out graduates in disciplines that already have an overabundance of teachers, while high-needs vacancies in areas such as science, special education, and bilingual education are left unfilled.

Normally, a new signee wouldn\u2019t be in the lineup, but Matthews is a former CFL rookie of the year and NFL playoff star, so his veteran savvy gets him in the lineup quickly.

All rights reserved.\nWhile peace negotiations continue in the Cuba's capital Havana, there are indications that the Colombian authorities are already setting out the way that the country will tackle the problems of transitional justice in the years following any successful conclusion of peace agreements. In this short contribution we set out concerns that the current Senate Bill (number 85 of 2013, submitted to Congress by Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinz\u00f3n Bueno in September 2013), which seeks to reform the military justice system, will exacerbate the challenge of post-conflict transitional justice in Colombia by implicitly offering a form of immunity to the military for serious breaches of international human rights and criminal law carried out during the armed conflict.\nAny conclusion of the peace negotiations, which will put to an end decades of armed conflict between the state, the FARC and ENL, will be the beginning of a long and potentially painful process of transitional justice. A significant part of this process will be the investigation of the truth surrounding the murders and forced disappearances of many innocent civilians, and the criminal prosecution of key perpetrators. The state\u2019s willingness to investigate and prosecute crimes committed by its own agents will be central to the process of reconciling Colombia\u2019s violence. Confronting the scale of the \u2018false positives\u2019 scandal and the collusion between state agents and military groups (including criminal gangs) will indicate the sincerity of Colombia\u2019s efforts to excavate the most difficult passages of its armed conflict.\nIn an open letter dated 8 July 2014 from Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch to Defence Minister Pinz\u00f3n, Vivanco argued that the proposed Military Justice law would \u201copen the door\u201d to, transferring false positives cases from the civilian to the military judicial system. Article 98 of the latest bill provides that the military justice system would \u201cexclusively handle\u201d violations of international humanitarian law by military personnel, except for genocide, crimes against humanity, forced displacement, sexual violence, forced disappearance, torture and extrajudicial execution.\nThe exemption of extrajudicial executions\u00ad\u2013which is not codified under the Colombian Criminal code\u2013could mean that \u201cdefense lawyers could request the immediate transfer of false positive cases to military courts by arguing that their clients are accused of 'homicide of protected persons,' 'aggravated homicide,' or 'homicide'\u2013all crimes that fall under military jurisdiction according to article 8 of the bil\u2013and not an 'extrajudicial execution'\". This uncertainty could lead to some legal chicanery resulting in cases being transferred to military courts, which may lead to widespread impunity.\nWhilst the literal wording of the proposed bill may not in itself give guarantees of immunity or imply impunity for military actions past and present\u2013as is often the case in Colombia\u2013attention must be paid to the ways laws are actually implemented. Human rights groups have already voiced concerns that the bill would constitute a \u201csetback in the fight against impunity\u201d. An illustrative example of the sorts of fears voiced by civil society is the illuminating recordings of a conversation between Henry Villarraga and Colonel R\u00f3binson Gonz\u00e1lez del R\u00edo.

When the orbiter began to run low on fuel, it smashed itself into Saturn rather than risk a wayward plunge that would contaminate the potentially habitable world.\nNow, from beyond the grave, the spacecraft has offered yet another prize for scientists. New analysis of Cassini data suggests those icy plumes shooting into space contain complex organic compounds \u2014 the essential building blocks of living beings.\nThe fact that an aging orbiter not designed for life detection was able to sense these molecules \u2014 which are among the largest and most complex organics found in the solar system \u2014 makes the icy moon an even more tantalizing target in the search for extraterrestrial life, said Cable, a research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved in the new research.\n\u201cThis is a powerful study with a powerful result,\u201d she said.\nThe findings published Wednesday in the journal Nature rely on data collected by two Cassini instruments \u2014 the Cosmic Dust Analyzer and the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer \u2014 as the spacecraft flew through Saturn's outermost ring and the plumes of Enceladus (pronounced \u201cen-SELL-a-dus\u201d).\nPrevious research using these instruments has detected small organic molecules such as methane, which consists of four hydrogen atoms attached to a single carbon. The INMS has also detected molecular hydrogen \u2014 a chemical characteristic of hydrothermal activity that provides important fuel for microbes living around seafloor vents on Earth.\nThe molecules reported in the new Nature paper are \u201corders of magnitude\u201d larger than anything that's been seen before, according to lead author Frank Postberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. There were stable carbon ring structures known as aromatics as well as chains of carbon atoms linked to hydrogen, oxygen, maybe even nitrogen.\nSome of the molecules sensed by the CDA were so large that the instrument couldn't analyze them. This suggests the organics Cassini found are only fragments of even bigger compounds, Postberg said. There may well be huge polymers \u2014 many-segmented molecules such as those that make up DNA and proteins \u2014 still waiting to be discovered.\n\u201cWe astrobiologists get excited about larger molecules and that sort of thing because it means that something is building upon itself and making itself more complex,\u201d said Kate Craft, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory who was not involved in the research.\nThe molecules Cassini has detected may be produced abiotically \u2014 without the involvement of life.

What should be the ideal diet plan for my mother?\nA:Your mother is having RA (seropositive), Vit A and Vit D deficiency. I presume, she must be taking treatment from a Rheumatologist to control the autoimmune inflammation, if not, please consult one. It has to be controlled with disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to avoid the rapid joint damage. Regarding the vit deficiencies, Vit D deficiency occurs due to the lack of sun exposure and Vit A deficiency usually occurs in individuals who are pure vegetarian, although there are other causes as well and has to be ruled out. As far as diet plan is concerned, taking 750-1000 ml of the milk per day and egg consumption can ward off the vit A deficiency, Non vegetarian food is also recommended for this purpose. Consuming Vit D in food supplements and good amount of sun exposure will help in reversing the Vit D deficiency. Calcium at least 1 gm/day is also recommended with vit D."}

This comes several days after one of the commissioners resigned after she said she wasn't receiving the information she needed to make decisions.\nThe Housing Authority is under scrutiny after two men--Derrick Roper and Calvin Witherspoon --died of carbon monoxide poisoning in their homes at the Allen Benedict Court apartments, a public housing complex which the authority oversees.\nOver 400 other residents had to be evacuated when multiple other gas and carbon monoxide leaks were found, which the fire department called \"severe and lethal\" conditions.\nLast week, Jennifer Rubin, who sat on the Housing Authority's board, abruptly resigned from the commission. Bessie Watson also stepped down, but that's because her term had expired.\n\u201cFundamentally, where it really came down to my decision, with everything else, cause there's always many complicating factors, is the fact that I was not, as a commissioner, provided the information I needed for governance purposes,\u201d Rubin said last week.\nShe said neither she nor the commission were made aware of severe maintenance problems at Allen Benedict.\nThe mayor and city council don't directly oversee the authority, but they do appoint the commissioners, who in turn hire the executive director, a position long held by Gilbert Walker.\nBenjamin said commissioners need to hold staff accountable if they're not getting the information they want, but admitted that may not be the case currently.\nBenjamin wouldn't say if the remaining commissioners might be replaced or removed.\n\u201cIf in fact we see some deficiencies or some challenges, we\u2019ll take them one by one,\" the mayor said.\nThe city is currently accepting applications for the three commission seats.\n\"We expect people who have relevant professional experience, who demonstrated a significant commitment to help build our community. We have some very specific skill sets for attorneys, real estate professionals, planners, people who understand the importance of leveraging public and private sector and philanthropic investment,\" Benjamin said while describing what he would consider a qualified applicant.\nSo far, only one member of Columbia's city council, Moe Baddourah, has called for a change in leadership for the Housing Authority.\nEven without having direct oversight, Mayor Benjamin said his office was working on solutions and long-term fixes to make sure this kind of situation does not happen again.\nBenjamin touched on his lobbying for special Section 8 vouchers for the displaced residents, humanitarian donation efforts of many throughout the city, and their work with the school districts to make sure displaced children had transport to and from their various schools.\n\"The most important and long term consequential work that we'll do however is work through the affordable housing task force that we're pulling together to help deal, in a long term comprehensive way with how we meet the needs of all our citizens. We have challenges across this community of workforce housing, affordable housing, people who work in the city ought to be able to live in the city,\" Benjamin told WLTX.\nMeanwhile, Columbia police continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the two men."}

With the objects in such similar weight categories, someastronomers are questioning whether those labels even apply.\n\"Whether this object should be called a 'planet' is upfor discussion, as it doesn't fit neatly into our current theories of planetformation,\" McLeod said. \"Most people have a good sense of what aplanet is: it orbits a star, is big enough to have become spherical, and ? thislast bit thanks to the Pluto debate ? is enough of a gravitational bully tohave cleared out other objects from its orbital path.\"\nAnother confusing aspect about this system is the apparentage of the smaller companion.\nThe weird object appears to have formed in less than 1million years, which is the approximate age of the browndwarf. But that's much faster than the predicted time it takes to buildplanets according to some theories.\n\"This is the youngest planetary-mass companion that hasbeen found so far, and its extreme youth provides constraints on how it couldhave formed,\" said co-researcher Kevin Luhman of the Center for Exoplanetsand Habitable Worlds at Pennsylvania State University. \"The formationmechanism of this companion in turn can tell us whether it is truly aplanet.\"\nScientists envision a few possible ways planets can form. Inone scenario, a disk of dust and gas surrounds a star, and that dust clumpstogether to form a rocky planet which then accumulates a shroud of gas aroundit. Another option is that a lump of gas in the disk collapses into a gaseousball to create a gas giant planet. Thirdly, instead of starting from a disk, aplanet might collapse directly from a cloud of gas and dust, the same way astar or brown dwarf would form.\nIn the case of the planet-like companion in the recentlyobserved system, researchers are favoring the third possibility because itcould explain how the companion formed so quickly.\nThe planet-like object was spotted in observations taken bythe HubbleSpace Telescope and the Gemini Observatory telescopes in Hawaii and Chile.The researchers detail their findings in the May 1 issue of the AstrophysicalJournal Letters."}

The Sun came up with 40 snapshots as we approach Sept. 28 and the 40th anniversary of Paul Henderson\u2019s Game 8 goal.\n1. Paul Henderson was among those Team Canada players who considered turning down the invitation to play. He and his wife planned a European vacation that summer, but his agent and series\u2019 poobah Alan Eagleson talked him into going.\n2. Ken Dryden was signing autographs before the series for an appreciative audience, except for one stern-looking young man who got his signature and walked away without saying thanks. A peeved Dryden was going to shout something until he saw the crest on his jacket and realized it was a Russian player.\n3. When actor John Bregar had to portray combative Bobby Clarke in the CBC mini-series about \u201972, he phoned Clarke to better understand how Clarke played on the edge. The right-shooting Bregar also had to learn to shoot left and had trouble delivering his lines through the special dental plate he was given to authenticate Clarke\u2019s gap-toothed grin.\n4. Recalling how the Penticton Vees targeted him in the 1955 world championships, Russian coach Vsevalod Bobrov ordered his team to take boxing lessons as part of their preparations.\n5. There were mind games right from the opening game in Montreal. Bobrov would not submit his starting lineup first, even though he was the visitor. Canadian coach Harry Sinden had wanted to put Henderson\u2019s checking line out in anticipation of matching Valeri Kharlamov. But when Bobrov stalled, Sinden went with Phil Esposito at centre, who scored 30 seconds after puck drop.\n6. Among those predicting an eight-game Canadian sweep was Canadiens\u2019 goaltending great Jacques Plante. He felt so sorry for Vladislav Tretiak before the series that he came to the Russian dressing room and gave him advice on facing the NHL shooters.\n7. Not only did Henderson score the last three winning goals of the series, he also took the first penalty at the 1:03 mark of Game 1.\n8. Months before his signing in the WHA prevented him from playing, Bobby Hull had warned Canada could lose the series. He cited the lack of NHL conditioning in early September and that the Russians would never have agreed to such as series without confidence they could win.\n9. With Hull out and Rob Gilbert nicking his No. 8, Bill Goldsworthy took Hull\u2019s famous No. 9.\n10. While all of Canada partied after Game 8 in Moscow, the Russians had their biggest celebration in the wee hours of the morning as Game 1 unfolded. Many took the next day off work. In his Moscow apartment, Boris Kharlamov, father of Valeri, was pouring vodka as his son led the 7-3 rout.\n11. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was at Game 1, as was a young lawyer who\u2019d become PM almost 12 years to the day: Brian Mulroney.\n12. A cartoon by the Montreal Gazette\u2019s Terry Mosher (a.k.a.

{"idx": "29427", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Online shopping is increasingly becoming the norm for consumers -- and that isn't necessarily good news for shoppers or companies.\nGallup has found that more than one-third (35%) of American adults are doing more of their shopping online than they were a year ago. The movement was in full effect over Thanksgiving weekend. The National Retail Federation reported that more consumers shopped online over the Black Friday weekend than in brick-and-mortar stores. And this year's Cyber Monday was one for the record books, with consumers spending almost $3 billion, according to the Adobe Digital Index.\nBut not all retailers had a great Cyber Monday -- and not because they were lacking in deals or customers. Major chains angered and frustrated shoppers when their websites failed to keep up with demand. Some Target customers were forced to wait in a \"virtual line\" on Cyber Monday, while Wal-Mart and Neiman Marcus also experienced technical difficulties over the Black Friday weekend.\nThese retailers invested a significant amount of time and money to promote their online deals. Yet when it came to delivering the ideal customer experience, they fell short -- and this lapse could have unfortunate side effects.\nGallup research has shown that the more a customer shops online, the more likely he or she is to become antagonistic toward a brand. Among retail customers overall, one in four are actively disengaged. But among customers who shop online more often and who shop the same or less offline, about one in three (32%) are actively disengaged.\nHaving a bad experience in a digital channel can also offset any goodwill a company has built up through its other channels. Customers no longer judge a brand by a singular experience in a channel, but take it as a sum of its parts. In a study of banking customers, for example, Gallup found that engagement dropped by 30 percentage points when these customers gave anything less than a \"5\" rating (on a 5-point scale, with \"5\" being the highest) to any specific banking channel, even if they gave every other channel a perfect score.\nOverall, retailers are struggling to engage their online customers -- and failing to provide access to their websites during the biggest online shopping weekend of the year does them no favors. Gallup research has revealed that just 16% of customers who shop online more often and shop the same or less offline are fully engaged.\nCustomers have limited tolerance for a company's online blunders. Online shopping is often devoid of any person-to-person contact, making it more difficult for companies to forge emotional relationships with their customers in the digital space. This scenario means they must try even harder to perfect their online presence and ensure that customers have an engaging user experience.\nImproving digital touchpoints. Retailers must ensure they can support all customers during an all-out promotion such as Cyber Monday. But a slow or hard-to-navigate website will always be a source of discontent for customers who shop or make purchases in an increasingly digital world. Getting the technology right is paramount to the customer experience. Retailers need to make it easy for customers to do business with them.\nOnce businesses ensure they have technology that works, they can look at other features and functionality that work to improve customer engagement. Gallup has studied the most powerful factors in creating customer engagement in an online environment and has found that customers prioritize service features above product features. Most importantly, online shoppers want to be able to count on the online retailer to resolve any problem that occurs. They also want great customer service, quality for the price and a smooth shopping experience.\nApproaching problems as engagement opportunities. When problems occur, the best companies use them as opportunities to emotionally engage their customers. But"}

There are important differences.\nPutin welcomed the world to Russia on Friday morning (EST) for the first game in the 2018 World Cup at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.\nIn keeping with the Russia's ambition to change its international image through this World Cup, Putin urged visitors to \"enjoy their stay in Russia, an open, hospitable and friendly country, and meet new friends - people with whom they share the same values.\"\nThe official party included Vladimir Putin and FIFA boss Gianni Infantino.\nIn essence to forget the stories the West likes to keep repeating.

But Robbie only does the big sporting events, as he proved by being the headline act at this year's V8 race around the streets of Adelaide.\nIt couldn\u2019t have been a better start for Russia.\nHe also found the time to flip the bird at a TV camera. Why? Who knows. He's Robbie Williams, just a mad 44-year-old teenage rebel.\nThe game itself was a much-needed triumph for Russia. It won 5-0. Sure, you could have pulled 11 people from the crowd, given them boots and a shirt and they would have been an improvement on Saudi Arabia.\nWhen someone does the rankings of the worst World Cup teams of all time the Saudis will top the list.

He could face up to 40 years in prison when he\u2019s sentenced Dec. 2, and he still faces similar charges in federal courts in Nevada and Georgia, his attorney said.\nSeleznev hacked into businesses, mostly pizza restaurants in Washington state, and stole millions of credit card numbers that he sold on underground internet forums, authorities said. The thefts led to almost $170 million in credit card losses around the world and made him \u201cone of the most prolific credit card traffickers in history,\u201d prosecutors said.\nHis lawyer, John Henry Browne, vowed to appeal, saying a key issue will be Seleznev\u2019s 2014 arrest by U.S. Secret Service agents in the Maldives that he called a kidnapping. The defense had tried to challenge the arrest, but the judge said the issue could not come up during trial.\nSeleznev had faced a 40-count indictment that charged him with running the hacking scheme from 2009 until his arrest in July 2014. The jury cleared him on two charges related to one of the Washington restaurants.\nU.S. Secret Service agents captured Seleznev as he and his girlfriend arrived at the Maldives airport on their way back to Russia. The agents flew him by private jet to Guam and then to Seattle, where he has been in custody.\nSeleznev was indicted on 29 felony charges in 2011, but a month later, he suffered a brain injury in a terrorist bombing in a cafe in Morocco. He was in a coma for two weeks and underwent a series of operations, according to a previous lawyer.\nProsecutors added 11 new counts in October 2014, including wire and bank fraud, hacking and identity theft.\nSitting at his keyboard in Vladivostok, Russia, and using the online nicknames \u201cTrack2,\u201d \u201dBulba\u201d and \u201c2Pac,\u201d Seleznev masterminded a scheme dating to 2008, Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said during closing arguments Wednesday.\nThe defense focused on challenging the evidence from Seleznev\u2019s laptop, seized by Secret Service agents during his arrest. His lawyers claim the agents mishandled the computer and failed to adequately secure it while it was kept in a vault in Seattle.\nThe defense\u2019s only witness testified that the machine may have been tampered with, and the attorneys said any evidence taken from it was suspect. They also said prosecutors failed to make a solid link between the hacks and Seleznev.\nThe investigation started in 2010 when a deli in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, was hacked. Over time, agents were able to link the computer viruses used to steal the credit card data to computer servers where the numbers were stored. They then connected those servers to Seleznev through his online nicknames and other sites he frequented.\nWhen he was arrested, agents found 1.7 million stolen credit cards on his laptop, along with the passwords to access those servers, prosecutors said.\nSeleznev \u201cleft his digital fingerprints all over the"}

Each time, the many fans and friends have urged the legendary PBS journalist to reconsider, and each time he did. But today, at age 83, Moyers announced his farewell, and this time it is real.\nMoyers ended his celebrated PBS interview program, Moyers and Company, in 2014. Since then, he\u2019s hosted BillMoyers.com, with original articles by Moyers and others on political topics. The website will continue to serve as the archive of the television journalism that Moyers has produced over the past 44 years.\nMoyers has been one of the most prolific and influential figures in American journalism. Not content just to diagnose and document corporate and political malpractice, Moyers regularly took his cameras and microphones to cities and towns where unions, community organizations, environmental groups, tenants rights activists, and others were waging grassroots campaigns for change. Moyers gave them a voice. He used TV as a tool to expose political and corporate wrongdoing and to tell stories about ordinary people working together for justice.\nHe also introduced America to great thinkers, activists, and everyday heroes typically ignored by mainstream media. He produced dozens of hard-hitting investigative documentaries uncovering corporate abuse of workers and consumers, the corrupting influence of money in politics, the dangers of the religious right, conservatives' attacks on scientists over global warming, and many other topics. A gifted storyteller, Moyers' TV shows, speeches, and magazine articles have roared with a combination of outrage and decency, exposing abuse and celebrating the country's history of activism.\nMoyers spent most of his broadcast career on public television, whose audience is considerably smaller than that of the major networks. But his influence\u2014through his documentaries, interviews, books, magazine articles, and speeches, with their ripple effects of his calls to conscience\u2014has been great nonetheless. He received over thirty-five Emmy Awards (including a Lifetime Emmy), a lifetime Peabody Award, an Alfred I. DuPont-Columbia University award, a George Polk Career Award (his third Polk award), induction into the Television Hall of Fame, and many other honors for his contributions to journalistic integrity and investigative reporting.\nMoyers came by his progressive class consciousness and moral outrage naturally. Neither of his parents went to high school. Dirt poor, they worked as farmers until they could not make it anymore because of bad weather and the boll weevil. When Moyers was born, the family lived in southeast Oklahoma, where his father was making $2 a day as a highway construction worker. When he got a job driving a creamery truck, they moved to Marshall, Texas.\nThe Great Depression knocked him down and almost out, and he struggled on one pittance paying job after another, until finally, late in life, he had a crack at a union job. His last paycheck was the most he'd ever taken home in a week, $96 and change, and he was proud of it. I saw then how unions struggled to preserve the middle class, and can make the difference between earning a living wage and being part of the working poor.\nWhen I was growing up, I never heard anyone pray, \u201cGive me this day my daily bread.\u201d It was always, \u201cGive us this day our daily bread.\u201d That stuck."}

This time, the band decided to actually stage the whole thing in the sky.\nThe new video for the band\u2019s song \u201cUpside Down & Inside Out,\u201d which premiered Thursday on Facebook (and has already racked up more than 2 million views there), captures their performance in zero gravity while flying over Russia in a special plane that\u2019s used to train cosmonauts.\nThe result of months of planning and sponsored by Russia\u2019s S7 Airlines, the video features the familiar ingredients of an OK Go shoot like intricate choreography, bright splashes of color, and a trippy visual twist. That twist this time is the result of filming inside a plane flying parabolic maneuvers, climbing and diving at such high speeds that guitarist Andy Ross says at certain points the occupants stop moving relative to the plane, creating brief periods of weightlessness.\n\u201cThe physics of this thing are wild,\u201d Ross tells Fast Company about the new video, which was co-directed by lead singer Damian Kulash\u2019s sister Trish Sie.\nIn it, Kulash can at one point be seen effortlessly flipping into another seat in the cabin. The bandmates start off banging away on laptops and then fling them away, the laptops floating lazily through the air around them.\nAs the video unfolds in what appears to be a fluid, continuous take, the view pulls back to include S7 air hostesses Tatyana Martynova and Anastasia Burdina, trained aerialist acrobats who help Kulash twirl around and later join the band in spinning and flipping through the air.\nThe end result is made possible thanks to a handful of quick stretches on the flight\u2014none longer than 27 seconds\u2014when the fliers experience weightlessness. Those half-minute bursts were all essentially strung together to create what seems like an entire gravity-free plane ride.\nAs anyone who\u2019s followed their career is probably aware, the band\u2019s videos have also served as a kind of unconventional billboard for a group that\u2019s used them to carve out a place for itself amid the music industry\u2019s noisy zeitgeist. Conceived around intricate gimmicks, optical illusions and the like, the productions have turned the musicians into YouTube stars, pushing the official OK Go YouTube channel past 213 million cumulative views, and ensured that each successive premier is a kind of splashy media event.\nAll of which is to say, the new video is but the latest reminder that OK Go is a band, yes, but also something more. Ross says the band sees itself a kind of freewheeling creative factory, where catchy songs exist alongside viral videos, and things like collaborations with airlines and experiments like OK Go working to encode its latest album, Hungry Ghosts\u2014from which \u201cUpside Down & Inside Out\u201d is taken\u2014onto strands of DNA.\nThe band actually had \u201cmake a weightless video\u201d among the more far-out ideas on its to-do list for years.

Because, in a typical liberal arts college, or any good college here, there is no concept of internships, or working with industry \u2013 you finish a three-year degree, you look for a job, and you do your Masters in something.

I\u2019m (also) a part of our academic faculty \u2013 this allows me to stay close to my students, it allows me to practice an approach where all the knowledge I have gained, over my 33 years in the corporate world, I am able to contextualise and therefore facilitate their learning better. And it\u2019s never too late to learn \u2013 I do courses every second day online, just to keep my own learnings updated.\nThe problem in India has been that colleges offer hotel management, which means you\u2019re restricting your career to hotels. There are so many more things you can do with food than just cook, which can become career choices. Still, a very talented chef is not necessarily a successful chef. Similarly, most successful chefs are not necessarily great chefs.

And a lot of our culinary infrastructure is geared towards building entrepreneurship in F&B.\nYou don\u2019t need academics, you need industry experts who are trained to facilitate learning. Industry interface with academia is critical to the success of both. We spend so much time with the kids, more to tell them what to prep for when they go to industry. And we tell industry the same. We tell them, \u201cThis is what our students have learnt in the first year, your job now as the employer \u2013 when they come for internship \u2013 is to make sure they can apply these learnings in industry.\u201d Whereas industry would typically say, \u201cOh, interns equal casual labour so let\u2019s get them to work.\u201d If we were to improve the whole internship experience of students, the graduate profile will improve on its own."}

It said it \"is committed to continue enhancing the democratic space, human rights (and) labor rights.\"\nIn announcing the measure on Monday, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom charged Cambodia with \"severe deficiencies when it comes to human rights and labor rights.\"\nThe European action begins a six-month monitoring process, and the withdrawal of privileges could be decided upon in a year.\nCambodia is one of several developing nations with which the EU has an \"Everything But Arms\" \u2014 EBA \u2014 scheme granting preferential access to the European market for things other than weapons.\nMomentum to review Cambodia's privileges grew after last July's general election, in which Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all 125 National Assembly seats. The EU and others charged the election was unfair and unfree because the sole credible opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, or CNRP, was dissolved in November 2017 by Cambodia's Supreme Court, generally seen as being under the government's influence.\nCambodia's statement Tuesday accused the EU of being \"narrow-mindedly focused on the existence of the dissolved CNRP and the fate of its leadership.\"\nIn a clear reference to the opposition group, it accused the EU of choosing to believe \"a handful of dishonest politicians who continuously try to find every means to destroy their own country and their people rather than respecting the voices of those who are legitimately elected.\"\nIt also said the European move \"takes the risk of negating 20 years' worth of development efforts\" that have helped pull millions of Cambodians out of poverty.\nEarlier Tuesday, Hun Sen posted on his Facebook page a softer response to the EU announcement.\nHe boasted of Cambodia's economic development and said the country does not rely solely on foreign aid, and would not give up its independence and sovereignty for it.\n\"But we want to be good friends with all the partner countries that want to see Cambodia make progress, without foreign interference in the country's internal affairs,\" he wrote.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Cambodia also took note of the European action.\n\"We share the EU's concerns about serious violations of freedom of expression, internationally recognized labor rights, and freedom of association.

{"idx": "29456", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Are we asking firefighters to do the impossible in containing wildfires without eliminating contributing building factors?\nFor most firefighters, the sights, sounds, smell and fury of the current California Wildfires are beyond our comprehension. There are at least 22 separate wind-driven fires currently throughout the state, with the worst being centered near Santa Rosa and the Napa Valley regions. These fires have resulted in over 20 deaths, 3,500 structures destroyed or damaged, and total devastation so severe that returning citizens cannot find landmarks or streets to find their way back to their own homes. Over 8,000 firefighters are reported to be on the fire lines.\nCalifornia wildfires are almost a yearly event. For as long as there has been a California, there have been wildfires during the dry season \u2013 some caused by nature, such as a lightning strike \u2013 some by human carelessness, such as a camp fire not properly extinguished \u2013 and some intentionally set by arsonists. But how do these fires grow to this magnitude? To answer that, we need to take a look using an historical approach.\nRapid response: Is it time to consider climate change and its effect on responders?\nThe Bel Air fire was the first to be captured on television and broadcast around the country on a relatively new daily phenomenon known at the Nightly Network News.\nIn addition, Bel Air was noted to be one of the first neighborhoods of the stars and many of the approximately 500 homes destroyed belonged to movie and television personalities.\nBut from a fire service standpoint, the Bel Air fire marked a turning point. Heavily criticized for the lack of command and coordination at this fire, the California fire service produced a system called \u201cFire Scope\u201d that provided the first true large scale command and control system that not only coordinated the fire attack, whether from ground forces, air units or task forces consisting of several engines, but also devised a method of rapid deployment of additional resources to combat these wildfires.\nFire Scope drew these resources from across the state and deployed some units either directly to staging areas near the fire scene, or directed units from a further region to move toward the fire but to then back-fill empty fire stations at strategic locations in order to maintain adequate coverage.\nFire Scope was also the forerunner of the Fire Ground Command system developed by the Phoenix Fire Department in the 1970s for use on structure fires, which then morphed into the \u201call hazard\u201d Incident Command System or ICS that post 9/11 became the National Incident Management System, or NIMS.\nAlong the way, Cal Fire also consolidated and reorganized into the largest single fire service entity in California. More recently, Cal Fire developed a fire triage system, whereby fire units can quickly determine which structures are defendable and which \u2013 due to a combination of construction, location, lack of water and weather conditions \u2013 cannot be saved.\nProbably one of the closest fires that mirror the devastation of the current Santa Rosa and Napa Valley fires occurred on Oct. 19, 1991, in Oakland, California. Oakland had experienced massive brush fires in 1923, 1970 and 1980, but the 1991 fire proved to be the worst of the lot.\nIt began as a small fire on a hillside that firefighters quickly contained, but embers stayed hidden in a thick area of pine needles and sprang to life again in the evening when the Santa Ana winds grew stronger. These winds changed direction several times overnight, each time spreading the fire"}

The group has received a $186 million federal grant for its work on the tests, but the state Department of Education has issued statements dismissing as a myth the idea of PARCC being used for federal control of education.\nDuring his press conference Tuesday, Scott also appeared to hedge when asked whether his logic could be used to get rid of the Common Core standards themselves.\nFlorida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant issued a statement Tuesday lambasting Scott for the move.\nMeanwhile, Sen. Dorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, filed legislation to prevent schools from gathering biometric information about children without their parents\u2019 consent. Some schools in the state have reportedly at least tested the use of biometric scans for security purposes, and opponents of Common Core have worried that it will lead to the collection of that kind of information.\nHukill said in a news release that the issue needs to be addressed because of schools collecting biometric information that could be used for such purposes as paying for lunches, recording attendance and boarding school buses.\nSupporters of Common Core have dismissed the idea that it will collect biometric information.\n\u2018Cause you\u2019re not welcome anymore\u2026.\nI would welcome input from the Federal Government and fail to see what conservatives are so afraid of other than a well-educated electorate.

His comments come at a time when the new administration of President Barack Obama has signaled a new willingness to engage Iran, whose relations with the previous administration were long strained. Obama last week pledged to rethink Washington's relationship with Teheran. And at his inauguration last month, Obama said his administration would reach out to rival states, saying \"we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has responded by saying Iran would welcome talks with the United States - but only if there was mutual respect. Iranian officials have said that would mean that the United States needs to stop making \"baseless\" accusations against the Islamic Republic in order to pave the way for talks between the two longtime adversaries. The US accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and secretly seeking to build nuclear weapons - charges Iran denies. Larijani, a conservative close to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said actions by the United States were creating obstacles in the way of any rapprochment. Specifically, he said the US has supported Iranian terrorist groups, disrespected Iran's rights and has repeatedly charged that Iran is seeking an atomic bomb. Iran has accused the United States of secretly supporting the People's Mujahedeen, an organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Iranian government. The US denies this and also considers the organization a terrorist group. According to IRNA, he said the problems between the two countries couldn't just be resolved \"through words. There is a need for action. The US needs to change the way it behaves toward the Iranian nation.\" Iranian officials have long argued that no talks will succeed unless Washington deals with Iran as an equal party and not seeking to impose its will on the Persian nation. Last week, Ahmadinejad declared that Iran is now a \"superpower\" - pointing to the recent launch of the first locally made satellite into space - and made clear it expects to be treated as an equal. The United States and Iran severed relations after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the takeover of the US Embassy in Teheran by hard-line Iranian students. Relations deteriorated even further after the Sept. 11 attacks when former President George W. Bush declared Iran belonged to an \"axis of evil,\" along with Iraq and North Korea. Ahmadinejad widened that gap after he was elected in 2005 and defied the US and its allies by pursuing Iran's controversial nuclear program."}

Along with their broadcast partners HBO and Showtime, the two promoters control boxing. They also despise each other. They had decided to stage two of the biggest fights of the year on the same night at the same time, about a mile from each other in Las Vegas.

He was half-way through The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, a \"Toltec wisdom book\" by don Miguel Ruiz. Alvarez is handsome and serially dates beauty queens.

They call Chavez Jr. \"son of a legend.\" He is the George W. Bush of boxing.\nSo on Friday, a little more than 24 hours before their fight, I found myself at the Wynn Hotel Encore Theatre to watch the Chavez-Martinez weigh-in. At a weigh-in, fighters strip down to their underwear and get on a scale to make sure they are at the proper fighting weight. Weigh-ins at big fights have become another way to hype a bout.

{"idx": "29469", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: This article reviews and critically assesses the Rome Statute's complex victim reparation and assistance regime. The regime is a dual one, characterized by its reliance both on reparations ordered by the International Criminal Court and assistance provided by the Trust Fund for Victims. Both approaches raise a series of quantitative, qualitative, scope and contextual problems which are very imperfectly answered at present. In particular, there is a risk that the broader needs of transitional justice will be omitted as falling neither under \"reparations\" or \"assistance.\" Rather than address the issue of the best reparations/assistance regime in the abstract, this article explores the real-world potential of a particular form of transitional practice, namely the construction of shrines, memorials and museums to commemorate victims of mass crimes. I conclude that there are complex ties between the construction of such \"monuments\" and memory, transitional justice, and victim expectations. Moreover, there is a discreet but constant practice of fitting the building of such commemorative monuments both within judicial theories, such as responsibility and reparation, and less formal processes of reckoning with the past, such as truth commissions. The experience of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in ordering monuments as reparations is highlighted as evidence of an innovative international best practice. This article seeks to assess how this experience could be transferred to the ICC/TFV context. I conclude that, although additional complexities would arise, there is no reason why the Rome Statute's victim reparation and assistance regime could not order or encourage the building of so-called \"sites of conscience.\" Such action would better manage victim expectations, make good use of scarce resources, address collective victim needs, make sense symbolically of the harm caused, provide a more complex narrative of events than international criminal verdicts, highlight multiple causes and responsibilities, and help distinguish the ICC and TFV's efforts from competing initiatives. It would, in other words, help better integrate international criminal justice with transitional justice goals.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric M\u00e9gret, Of Shrines, Memorials and Museums: Using the International Criminal Court's Victim Reparation and Assistance Regime to Promote Transitional Justice, 16 Buff.

According to the industry group, many mobiles are refurbished and sold offshore while the majority of what remains is more likely to be cluttering drawers in homes and offices than clogging the country's rubbish bins.\n\"Our view is that in the general public, the majority of people don't feel that dumping a battery of any sort into the rubbish bin is the right thing to do,\" said Brown.\nAMTA is currently making an attempt to find out how many batteries will end up in landfill as a part of its strategic review.\n\"We're conducting a survey to ascertain consumer behaviour and attitudes toward electronic waste and come up with some sound formula to calculate that,\" said Brown.\nSusie Brown, ACF sustainability campaigner agrees that mobile phones are more likely to be stored than dumped. However, she is concerned at the apparent lack of knowledge about the situation and she says that the batteries will end up in landfill eventually, unless consumers are given an adequate recycling scheme.\n\"That's a real issue from a resource waste point of view,\" said the ACF's Brown.\nAMTA and the ACF agree that recycling scheme isn't being promoted to the public enough.\n\"The biggest issue that consumers face is that they're not necessarily aware that they can recycle phones,\" said AMTA's Brown.\nBut reaching a consensus on how to promote the scheme may be harder to achieve.\nAMTA wants the state and federal governments to promote the scheme via schools and other community education programs.

That number is down nearly 10 percent from 349,000 in December, which saw the third highest total since the company began tracking foreclosure data in 2005.\nIn January, one in 409 homes were sent a filing, which includes default notices, scheduled foreclosure auctions and bank repossessions. Banks repossessed more than 87,000 homes last month, down 5 percent from December but still up 31 percent from January 2009.\nJanuary marked the 11th straight month with more than 300,000 properties receiving a foreclosure filing. The numbers could stay above that level as unemployed homeowners who have tried to keep up with their mortgages finally start missing monthly payments.\nMortgage financier Fannie Mae reported in late January that the rate of borrowers who have a conventional loan on a house and are seriously delinquent was 5.29 percent in November, more than doubling the rate of 2.13 percent in November 2008. Borrowers are considered seriously delinquent if they are past due by three months or more, or are in foreclosure.\n\"There&apos;s a lot of foreclosures in the pipeline, and the number is going to continue to get bigger,\" said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.\nLast month&apos;s foreclosure activity followed a pattern similar to that of a year ago, when a double-digit percentage increase in December was followed by a 10 percent drop in January.\nThe dip in January&apos;s numbers may be due to processing delays by lenders during the end-of-year holidays, said Rick Sharga, senior vice president of RealtyTrac, which is based in Irvine, Calif.\n\"I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an early sign of the coming of the end of the foreclosure crisis,\" Sharga said.\nA record 2.8 million households were threatened with foreclosure last year, and the numbers are expected to rise to between 3 and 3.5 million homes this year, RealtyTrac said.\nSlowing the foreclosure rate is a key step in the recovery of the real estate market and the overall economy. The foreclosure crisis forced the federal government and several states to come up with plans to prevent or delay the process to help delinquent borrowers.\nForeclosed homes are usually sold at steep discounts, so they often lower the value of surrounding properties. Cities lose property tax dollars from foreclosure homes that sit empty and from declining home values, straining local economies. Home prices have stabilized in some cities, but are still down 30 percent nationally from mid-2006.\nEconomic issues, such as unemployment or reduced income, are expected to be the main catalysts for foreclosures this year. Initially, subprime mortgages were mostly the culprit, but homeowners with good credit who took out conventional, fixed-rate loans are the fastest growing group of foreclosures.\nAmong states, Nevada posted the nation&apos;s highest foreclosure rate,"}

Welsh start-up Riversimple is aiming to have its hydrogen car on the market in 2018 following road testing.\nCalled the Rasa, the car boasts a 300-mile range and is super light-weight, coming in under 1,300 pounds.\nThe Rasa is currently a prototype, but it's been improved for testing for later this year.

{"idx": "29484", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Central Otago District Council wants water supply charges equalised across the district.\nCentral Otago District Council chief executive Phil Melhopt has written a report on the topic, to be considered at community board meetings this month. He has recommended boards agree to a change in funding, so the cost of schemes is spread equally across all council-run water and wastewater scheme users in the district.\nAs well, he suggested boards should give up their delegated authority on water services and hand decision-making over to a council committee. Boards effectively made all the decisions on water services in their respective areas, including how drinking water schemes were funded, Mr Melhopt said. Most water schemes were funded by targeted rates, which meant those who were connected to the scheme, paid for the scheme costs.\nThe targeted rates for water connections this year ranged from $52 a year in Clyde to 14 times that amount, $729, in Omakau. Wastewater annual charges ranged from $261 a year in Naseby to $534 a year in Alexandra.\nA decision on a different funding method would come down to ''whether or not it is fair for everyone to pay the same for water services or whether it's fair to ease the cost burden for those paying the highest rates for similar services,'' he said.\nThe district was facing significant expenditure in coming years to bring drinking water and wastewater schemes up to standard. Some water schemes frequently had ''boil water'' notices because of turbidity and needed to be upgraded and several wastewater schemes were being improved or due for an upgrade to meet improved discharge quality standards.\n''In recent times questions have been asked as to the fairness of the wide variation in targeted rates,'' Mr Melhopt said.\nBoards had to make their own funding arrangements to cover the capital costs of renewals and upgrades.\nThe funding could be spread across all the wastewater and water schemes in the district, on an average connected cost, Mr Melhopt said. Under the system, based on this year's figures, Alexandra, Omakau, Naseby, Ranfurly, Pisa and Roxburgh would all pay lower combined water and wastewater rates while Clyde and Cromwell communities would have an increase in rates. Another option was to partially fund it at district level and subsidise the scheme costs. He suggested the council's infrastructre committee was the appropriate group to govern a district-wide water infrastructure.\nCentral Otago Mayor Tony Lepper mentioned the report to Cromwell Community Board members last month and warned them not to ''rush into an opinion'' on the topic.\n''Think clearly and get views from the public before you rush into giving your thoughts on it,'' he told board members."}

At times, he has even kept his mouth shut behind closed doors, according to two senior administration officials, declining to express his views when they are at odds with those of the president.\nA political adviser to one right-leaning outside group called his lack of engagement on tariffs a \u201cbig time\u201d disappointment, and said the feeling was shared among free market Republicans.\nPence\u2019s low-key approach means some are coming to view him as a weak vice president, compared by some Republicans \u2014 unfavorably \u2014 to President George H.W. Bush\u2019s No. 2, Dan Quayle. But his hands-off style has endeared him to Trump, with whom Pence has avoided the sort of public clashes that led to the resignation earlier this week of his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the vice president\u2019s job to publicly criticize the president\u2019s policies.

Now we know it's happening at the 2019 New York Auto Show, and thanks to a couple new teasers, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect.\nSubaru put out a teaser for the 2020 Outback ahead of its formal debut at the 2019 New York Auto Show next week. The teaser shows off the lower bits of the new Outback, namely a chunk of the front end and a good bit of the dark cladding that underpins the Outback's design. There's a big ol' cargo rack up top, but that'll likely be offered as some sort of after-the-fact add-on.\nWhile Subaru didn't offer up any details about the new Outback, we can glean a fair bit of information from the Legacy's release. The Legacy kicked the 3.6-liter flat-six engine to the curb in favor of a 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four that puts out 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. The continuously variable transmission of yore sticks around, and all-wheel-drive remains standard because it wouldn't be a new Subaru without it (except for the joint-venture BRZ, natch).\nOh yes, the Outback will have a very large screen, too, fear not.\nExpect the Legacy's looks to transfer over, too. It's largely the same as before, but the front end and roof have been smoothed over, retaining its inoffensive aesthetic. On the tech front, based on the second teaser Subaru put out, the Legacy's 11.6-inch Starlink portrait infotainment screen makes an appearance. Subaru's EyeSight safety suite is standard on the Legacy, so I see no reason why it won't be on the Outback, too.\nThe guesswork will come to an end when Subaru unveils the 2020 Outback on April 17 at 11:15 a.m. ET from its stage at the New York Auto Show.

But co-defendant Laura Cook went free because the jurors couldn't agree on verdicts in her case.\nDuring the trial, the jury twice declared itself unable to reach a decision, and then returned with a verdict just minutes after its second such declaration.\nThat unusual jury behavior may have indicated that the government's case was less than totally persuasive, so that Laura Cook would have had a good chance of being acquitted in a retrial, acknowledged Jeff Robinson, one of her lawyers.\n\"It was a very difficult decision, but Laura did not feel she was capable of going through another trial,\" Robinson said after the one-hour hearing.\n\"Going through a federal trial is a stressful situation, and she wanted to end it.\"\nRather than retry the complex case, \"we believe the interests of justice are best served by settling this matter,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Westinghouse after U.S. District Judge James Robart accepted the 10-page plea agreement.\n\"It's a fair and equitable result,\" Westinghouse said.\nHe said the government will recommend a prison term of 15 months, but the sentencing judge is free to impose any term up to the three-year legal maximum.

{"idx": "29501", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Melbourne Theatre Company opened its 2004 season with a new production of Christopher Hampton\u2019s theatrical adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, the famous novel by Choderlos de Laclos which tells the story of two former lovers, Marquise de Merteuil (Josephine Byrne) and Le Viscomte de Valmont (Marcus Graham), who scheme to ruin the virtue of two piously devout women, the Pr\u00e9sidente de Tourvel (Asher Keddie) and C\u00e9cile Volanges (Jessica Gower).\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses was first published in 1782, seven years before the fall of the ancien regime and against the background of a stirring civil conflict now known as the French Revolution. Written so close to a time of war, Les Liaisons Dangereuses is itself particularly concerned with warfare and military strategy, and the never-ending quest for power even if it is only in the realm of romance and personal relationships. Even now, after the society and context in which the story takes place has long since disappeared, Les Liaisons Dangereuses offers a timely commentary on the nature of conflict, corruption and immorality.\nDirected by MTC\u2019s artistic director, Simon Phillips, Les Liaisons Dangereuses is a stylish and entertaining production. Often funny, elegantly fashioned lines bristle with malicious wit. The characters of Merteuil and Valmont both fascinate and repel as they engage in psychological combat, striving to out-do the other in capturing and destroying the souls. With impudence they wave their conquests in front of the other like spoils of war. But while the onstage jousting is absorbing as it is entertaining, the production does much more than just follow the boudoir antics and parlour skirmishes of the decadent upper class.\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses\u2019 irresistible appeal lies in the shocking contrast between the intense, disturbing sense of societal and individual moral decay, and the beautiful, polished exterior of civilised elegance. The set sparkles with a stark purity and acts as a reminder of these contradictions. Incandescent white costumes and props and sweet-faced cherubs aloft fluffy white clouds contrast with the evil games of conquest and revenge happening on stage.\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses is ultimately a moral tale, behind the tale of lust and betrayal lurks the question of the capacity of human beings to treat each other with respect, and the rightfulness of doing so. It is often said that there are no winners in war and the battles raged in Les Liaisons Dangereuses offer no exception. In the end, and hopefully not giving too much away, the Pr\u00e9sidente de Tourvel dies of grief and shame, Cecile, full of regret for her adultery with Valmont seeks salvation in a convent with the intention of becoming a nun, and Valmont gets his just deserts, slain in duel by Cecile\u2019s intended. In the MTC production, it is only the fate of the Marquise de Merteuil that is left in doubt. Audience members who had not read the book or seen the film would be left wondering whether she receives her comeuppance. The play does conclude, however, hinting at the impending downfall of the aristocracy\u2014that itself suggestive that a life lived in selfish excess, thoughtless to needs of others, is, ultimately, folly."}

Iowa Republican thinks so.\nIowa Republican wants to decriminalize psychedelic drugs like mushrooms to make it more accessible for medicinal purposes.\nJeff Shipley is new to the Iowa Capitol, but the lawmaker is ambitious: He wants to decriminalize psychedelic drugs, like mushrooms, to make them more accessible for medicinal purposes.\nShipley, of Fairfield, is a Republican with a libertarian bent. He doesn\u2019t think Iowans, or members of his party, should be surprised by a set of drug-related bills he's filed this month. The legalization measures appear to be among the first of their kind to be introduced in the Iowa Legislature.\nWhile it is not clear how many other statehouses are entertaining similar measures, there are active campaigns to make psychedelic mushrooms more accessible. There's a ballot measure underway in Oregon and election officials in the city of Denver received enough public signatures recently to put the issue of decriminalizing mushrooms on the ballot later this year. An effort in California did not get enough signatures to qualify for the ballot last year.\nShipley has an emoji of a mushroom on his Twitter page, where he describes himself as a sauerkraut salesman \u2014 his account name is @SauerkrautSales; he works for a company in Fairfield and he has 12 jars of sauerkraut at his chamber desk \u2014 and Wiener Dog Racing chairman, a reference to Shipley's work overseeing an annual local competition of dachshunds. In his spare time, he does stand-up comedy.\nBut Shipley is serious about the drug bills. He believes Iowans recovering from drug addictions and other health ailments could benefit from more accessibility to illegal drugs that could have medicinal purposes.\nOne measure he proposed would allow a state pharmacy board to reclassify ibogaine, psilocybin and MDMA for medicinal purposes, and remove related penalties when the drug use is for medicinal purposes.\nIbogaine has been studied as alternative treatment for drug addiction, according to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. Psilocybin is a psychedelic compound produced in mushrooms, and MDMA, also known as ecstasy, is a synthetic drug that alters mood and perception. Shipley believes MDMA could help veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Some studies have supported that belief.\nAnother bill he's pushing would remove psilocybin and psilocyn, which are hallucinogenic, from the list of substances classified as having no currently accepted medical treatment use.\nWill the bills find support?\nShipley is also a realist.\nRep. Jared Klein, R-Keota and chair of the House Public Safety Committee, said he doesn't expect the legislation to advance this year \u2014 or any time soon.\nSen. Joe Bolkcom, an Iowa City Democrat, has long been vocal about making medical marijuana more accessible.

So, the lira would literally be as as good as gold,\" Hanke told Kitco News.\nHanke noted that under this arrangement, inflation in Turkey would \"collapse,\" from 100% on an annual basis down to \"almost nothing, overnight,\" further stabilizing the lira.\nHe added that this currency board arrangement is Turkey's only option at preventing further lira depreciation at this point, as by definition, capital controls under a currency board with a fixed currency is not possible, and raising interest rates would also not be economically sound policy given the high inflation rate.\n\"There's no way that the lira will stabilize with the current system that they have. The inflation rate, as I measure it, is around 100% in Turkey right now, on an annual basis, and that implies that to get a real yield that's positive, you'd have to have interest rates over 100% and that of course, that will kill the Turkish economy,\" he said.\nHanke added that Turkey is no stranger to lira collapses, as their currency has witnessed similar rapid depreciation in the past.\n\"They're slow learners,\" he said."}

The country\u2019s premier tourist destination is seeking to capitalize on business tourism after a difficult decade marked by two terrorist attacks and the SARS and bird flu epidemics.\nIn Kendran village, in the center of Bali, everything is green. Delicate rice sprouts peek from terraced fields. Dense thickets of banana trees encroach the side of a road. Shaded gardens decorate the entrance of temples and houses. But despite its lush appearance, water in the village is in short supply.\nMade Ruta, one of Kendran\u2019s rice farmers, explains that the public water distribution company PDAM owns two of the three water sources located on the village\u2019s land. He says the local government demanded it prioritize the nearby tourist town of Ubud for water distribution. Thus, he says, for the past five years there has not been enough water during the dry season to properly irrigate all rice fields.\nEnvironmentalist Wayan Gendo Suarna, who chairs the Bali chapter of the Indonesian NGO Walhi, warns that a water crisis looms.\nWayan says that although consumption is highest in the South of the island, where the tourist facilities are located, there are no water resources there. Shortages now exist in the rural and mountainous North, closer to the water sources. He says local policies dictate that the tourism industry, which contributes most to the island\u2019s economy, should come before the needs of rice farmers.\nMade Ruta, the Kendran farmer, says the situation is unfortunate.\nNowadays, he says, there\u2019s not much harmony left in the village. In the peak of the dry season farmers may creep at night into their neighbor\u2019s fields to steal water. Because of this problem and the lure of better jobs in the tourist industry, many farmers are tempted to sell their land.\nBayu Susila, head of the environment NGO Bali Fokus, says that this is felt throughout Bali.\nBali\u2019s Hindu culture and unique agrarian lifestyle is the island\u2019s main tourist attraction. So Bayu warns that the erosion of the traditional way of life could have dire consequences.\nBali is a small island, about the size of the tiny U.S. state of Rhode Island.

Even those proposals face little hope of passage in the politically split Congress.\nA loose consensus has emerged that recognizes \"these killings are the shooter's responsibility, not the gun's responsibility,\" says U.S. Sen.

The fate of that historic tax credit remains uncertain in the current GOP tax plan, which the Senate hopes to push through before week's end.\nThe House removed the tax credit entirely from its bill, while the Senate has added a version of it back into its tax-reform language, though in a potentially weakened form and one that is still subject to alteration.\nFor small-town entrepreneurs like Jason Duff, a real estate entrepreneur from a county in the swing state of Ohio, where Trump received 76 percent of the vote last November, this tax irony is hitting hard: \"I am really impacted by the disappearance of the 20 percent federal historic-building tax credit,\" Duff said.\nHis company, Bellefontaine Ohio Properties \u2014 which operates stores, restaurants and other real estate \u2014 takes the risk of rehabbing old buildings on Main Street, and it's a risk the tax code has encouraged over the past four decades.\nThen-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cuts a ribbon during the grand opening ceremony of the Trump International Hotel-Old Post Office in Washington, D.C. in October 2016. The hotel was able to use a tax credit for the rehabbing of historic buildings.\n\"There's tons of evidence here on Main Street, from many who bought historic businesses, that it has really benefited their communities,\" Duff said.\nThe GOP tax-reform plan has included a narrative about wiping away tax benefits that have accrued for residents of blue states and affluent cities, but the historic tax credit (HTC) \u2014 which to date has facilitated the rehabilitation of more than 42,000 certified historic buildings and has attracted more than $84 billion in new private capital to the historic cores of cities and towns across the nation \u2014 is not a partisan issue. It is, on the other hand, important to entrepreneurs and investors revitalizing urban districts of former industrial towns and cities, as well as small towns across the country.\n\"It has not gotten enough attention relative to its size,\" said Brett Theodos, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. \"[HTCs] are not red- or blue-state things.\"\nDuff recently purchased three buildings in Bellefontaine that are slated for renovation in 2018, including an abandoned old theater where lines in the late 1930s stretched down the block. \"If the historic tax credit is not put back in legislation, these projects are in jeopardy. ... Right now I'm stopping conversations with architects and engineers, and uncertainty is probably the biggest fear,\" Duff said.\nThe Midwest communities that helped deliver the presidency to Trump are peppered with these properties, and while malls are really struggling, \"Main Street is coming back back strong,\" Duff said, helped by entrepreneurs investing in buildings that create urbanlike environments.\n\"We are Trumpland,\" Duff said of his Logan County, Ohio. \"I am seeing unemployment in our community nearing a record low, and I am the most optimistic about the local economy that I've been in 10 years, but we do have issues with opioid abuse and retraining and preparing workers for the future.

The typical worker earning the minimum wage is not a teenager and is not male. She is an adult woman. Adult women are the single biggest demographic group among minimum wage workers, far outnumbering teenagers of both genders and men of all ages.\nLess than half of all workers are women, but they account for 75 percent of workers in the 10 lowest-paid occupations and about 60 percent of minimum wage workers. And most women earning the minimum wage are not teenagers, or wives who can rely on a spouse\u2019s income.\nAbout three-quarters of female minimum wage workers are above the age of 20, and about three-quarters of these women are on their own. Many, of course, are working and taking care of children.\nWorking families headed by women make up 22 percent of all working families but 39 percent of low-income working families. There are 7.1 million working families with children headed by women, and 58 percent of them are low-income. Sixty-five percent of the children in female-headed working families are low-income. One of every three families that are headed by a woman with no husband present lives in poverty, and about 48 percent of all children in single-parent households headed by women live in poverty. A woman working full time at the current minimum wage earns less than $14,500 annually \u2013 more than $4,000 below the poverty line for a mother with two children.\nTwo-thirds of workers in jobs dependent on tips are women, disproportionately women of color. The tipped minimum wage is only $2.13 an hour and has been frozen for the last 21 years. This isn\u2019t an accident. Until 1991, Congress had always raised the tipped minimum wage in line with the regular minimum wage. Throughout the 1980s, the tipped minimum wage stood at 60 percent of the regular minimum wage. But in 1996, the restaurant industry lobbying association managed to decouple the two rates, and the tipped minimum wage has been frozen in time, falling by more than 40 percent since then.\nMany restaurant owners contend that the tipped minimum wage is just a technicality. By law, if an employee\u2019s tips, combined with the employer\u2019s direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour, do not equal the regular minimum wage, the employer is supposed to make up the difference for each hour of work. But often this does not happen.\nIn low-end restaurants, and even in more upscale places on slow days, many waiters are lucky to end up earning the regular minimum wage. And many restaurants require their servers to share a portion of their tips with other workers, like dishwashers and bus staff. In effect, many waiters end up subsidizing the wages of other workers, for the benefit of their employers.\nOn top of that, unscrupulous restaurant owners sometimes illegally withhold tip money that flows through credit cards on the pretext of creating a \u201creserve\u201d for errors by waiters.

The CDC said the disease is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of those who are not immune that are close to that person will be infected.\nUntil recently, the disease had been considered eradicated in the U.S.\n\u201cWith a lower rate of vaccinations, it has been on the incline,\u201d Stevenson said.\nEarly symptoms for the disease often mirror the cold and flu and can include a runny nose, watery eyes, coughing and a high fever. Between three and five days after transmission, a rash of flat red spots will appear starting at the head and move down the body, the CDC reported.\nJeannine Hatt, a doctor with TexomaCare-Pediatrics, said her practice was inundated with calls all morning Thursday from parents who were alarmed by the possible case of the measles.\n\u201cThe phones have been ringing off the wall about parents concerned that their child could be exposed and are asking if they can get their vaccines early,\u201d Hatt said.\nHatt said she heard rumors that the potential case of the measles may have originated at Wilson N. Jones Regional Medical Center. But Cathy Black, WNJ director of marketing and communications, said the hospital has not had any confirmed cases of the measles as of Thursday afternoon.\nIn most cases, doctors recommend that children are vaccinated for the measles, along with rubella, mumps and chicken pox, between 12 months and 15 months in age. A second booster is recommended between the ages of 4 years and 5 years. Between both vaccines, the protection is estimated to be about 97 percent, Hatt said.\nIf a child is expected to travel internationally during this period, Hatt said doctors often call for the first vaccination between the ages of 6 months and 11 months. This schedule can also be escalated in areas where an outbreak is ongoing.\nHowever, due to the nature of the pediatric immune system, these early shots would not replace the dose given at 12 months, and this recommended dose would still be needed."}

The problem is that it turns out not to be true.\nNear as I can reconstruct it, here is what happened: a reporter for U.S. News and World Report attended a panel in May 2009 where Plouffe spoke admiringly of Governor Huntsman and singled him out as a strong presidential candidate. (Chances are Plouffe already knew at this point that the president was looking to hire Huntsman as his ambassador to China, so that was a clever bit of gamesmanship.) The reporter, Nikki Schwab, quoted Plouffe, but this \u201cwee bit queasy\u201d business was her formulation, not Plouffe\u2019s, and did not appear in quotation marks.\nThen the Salt Lake City media, always eager for news about their governor, got into the act. The Deseret News published a piece that cited the U.S. News article in a way that left ambiguous whether the quote was from Plouffe or from the reporter. The local ABC affiliate then lifted that story, but left no doubt about the origin of the quote.\nFrom there, the bum \u201cfact\u201d got picked up by Washington media outlets, the blogosphere, and all sorts of other media.\nBai thankfully sets the record straight, even if he\u2019s too late to stop the error from appearing under his byline.\nIs it a series of honest mistakes, or is it indicative of pervasive laziness in newsrooms around the country?\nHow Much of Hoak-Dish Retrans Row is Hopper-Related?"}

{"idx": "29534", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For conservative investors who have a limited appetite for risk, yet still yearn for good growth opportunities, there may be an attractive option. Several major U.S. banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, and Goldman Sachs have entered the equity-linked note/CD space. Notes are essentially short-term bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer. CDs are backed by the issuer and indirectly by the U.S. government through FDIC insurance. While there exist a multitude of permutations of equity-linked notes and CDs, for those looking for conservative growth, there are some interesting alternatives. Several major banks are offering five-year notes that credit interest like uncapped index annuities. Several banks are currently quoting 110 to 120 percent participation in the S&P 500 index with a 30 percent downside buffer. Although index annuities typically provide a 100 percent downside buffer, according to AXIO, over the last 9,700 days, only 23 days had a five-year trailing return that was less than 30 percent. Therefore, a 30 percent buffer is probably going to protect all note holders from any loss. Additionally, the structured notes have attractive tax treatment. No income is accrued until the note matures, and when it does, the increased value of the notes are taxed as long-term capital gains. With greater than 100 percent participation in the S&P 500 and much less investment risk, these notes provide a pretty compelling opportunity even for aggressive investors. For those looking for FDIC insurance, structured CDs offer complete safety of principal, albeit with less upside. However, structured CDs and notes could lose value if not held to maturity. Current issues are offering 100 percent participation in the S&P 500 on five-year CDs with gains capped out at about 40 percent with no downside risk. With the average five-year return of the S&P 500 at 57.91 percent, structured CDs could pay substantially more than traditional CDs. Unlike structured notes, CDs will create annual taxable income, which will be taxed as ordinary income unless they are held in an IRA.

{"idx": "29540", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Home \u00bb At TMV \u00bb What is the difference between socialism and modern liberalism?\nWhat is the difference between socialism and modern liberalism?\nSo I just laid out in another post the classically liberal origins of modern liberalism and now a regular commenter at TMV has asked, perceptively, how is modern liberalism different from socialism. Surely socialism also has roots in classical liberalism too, so the common ancestry is of little meaning on its own.\nSo what is the difference between socialism and modern liberalism? There are two very different strains of socialism historically \u2013 revolutionary socialism promulgated by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. I. Lenin, and incrementalist or \u201cFabian\u201d socialism of the sort that took off in western Europe after World War II. Few outside the hopelessly uninformed and unhinged believe that modern liberalism is akin to revolutionary socialism or communism. But what about the more moderate Fabian socialism (Fabius Maximus was a Roman politician famous for his incrementalism and moderation)?\nThe difference is here: socialists believe in the abolition of private property. Modern liberals do not.\nAs recently as the 1980s the British Labour Party included the call for the abolition of private property in its official party platform. Socialist parties elsewhere in Europe \u2013 from Spain to France to Germany and on \u2013 either still call for the abolition of private property or did so until very recently.\nNote that abolition of private property does not mean progressive taxation or a generous social safety net. It does not mean old age pensions or even universal health care per se, though all socialist countries have those (Bismarck adopted the world\u2019s first welfare state to stave off the growing threat of German Socialists in the 1870s). No, socialism means the government literally takes possession of the means of production.\nIn practice, this has meant government ownership of telecommunications, power companies, transportation networks and in some cases health delivery systems (British NHS is socialist in a way most other national health care systems are not).\nIn America the best example of genuine socialism is the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA \u201cbought\u201d millions of acres of land and waterways, reconfigured rivers, built dams, and to this day continues to provide electricity, control floods, and create space for recreation. Knoxville is actually the third-best boating city in America after San Diego and Ft. Lauderdale thanks to the plethora of lakes in the area. Yes, in heavily Republican East Tennessee the greatest form of recreation is due to socialism.\nBut efforts to replicate the TVA in the Columbia River and the Missouri River failed for a variety of reasons. TVA is a case unto itself. And other previously government-owned entities have been privatized, while highly regulated utilized have been de-regulated by both liberal Democratic and conservative Republican politicians alike.\nThere is very little call for government ownership of property in America today, with the exception of national parks and wildlife refuges (and considering the land in these cases is to be used NOT for productive capacities but for preservation it\u2019s hard to really call them socialist either).\nThe closest the Obama Administration has come to socialism is the automotive bailout. But even that plan was initiated only because of bankruptcy in the private sector, and the ultimate goal is to release the company back to the private marketplace. It is emergency and short-term socialism, perhaps \u2013 but hardly more than that.\nAs for the banks \u2013 the other recipient of bailouts \u2013 the government decided against national"}

By contrast, the group spent roughly $25 million in 2014, $15 million in 2012 and $5 million in 2010.\nWhile environmentalists\u2019 generous spending in the last election cycle did not translate to a string of victories, they said that this year they were confident that a conservation-focused message could help sway voters in key demographic groups, including millennials, Latinos and African Americans, to back Clinton and other candidates.\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund is spending at least $1 million this election on activities, including ads and direct mailing to its members. In addition, the NRDC Action Fund political action committee has joined with LCV Action Fund and NextGen Climate to raise and contribute at least $7 million for federal and state candidates through two bundling programs, GiveGreen and GiveGreen in the States.\nBoth the Environmental Defense Action Fund, which is devoting $5 million, and the Sierra Club, which is spending $3.8 million, are ramping up their election activities this year. And in a recent interview, Steyer said his group would spend at least $55 million this cycle, though it could be much more than that.\nDemocrats, such as Clinton, will be the primary beneficiaries of environmental groups\u2019 largesse, though both LCV and the Sierra Club backed a Republican running in a North Carolina House primary, Jacob Walser, who lost, and both groups backed some state GOP candidates this year. EDF Action spokeswoman Sharyn Stein said her group is \u201cbacking candidates in both parties\u201d in this election, including Rep.

The Coyotes also are now 1-0 against ranked teams at the SCSC.\nUSD (5-1) built up a lead they would not squander by making the Cyclones uncomfortable at the offensive end and by asserting themselves under the boards against a team that starts no one under the height of 6 feet.\nThe Cyclones\u2019 lineup includes 6-1 Bridget Carleton, one of the country\u2019s best college players. She led Iowa State with 14 points but needed 19 shots to do it. Averaging a double-double going in, she had just three rebounds.\nThe Cyclones definitely gave the Coyotes a Top-25 taste of how things usually go in the fourth quarter by crunching a 60-42 USD lead with 5:37 to play down to 62-59 with 37 seconds remaining. But junior guard Madison McKeever, who\u2019d broken a four-minute Coyote scoreless streak half a minute earlier, made a pair of free throws with 14 seconds remaining to put USD up by five.\nUSD led 13-9 after one quarter and 35-18 at half. Themes were developing at the time. The Coyotes were outrebounding the Cyclones and outhustling them. It\u2019s not an unusual scenario for a solid mid-major to make a Big 12 team work a little bit, especially in the early-going. But the Coyotes backed it up by shooting well against a team that statistically defends the perimeter better than most teams in the country.\nUSD hit 12 of 28 on 3's with six different players hitting at least one.\n\u201cAnytime you are in a position to potentially upset a very talented, a very good and a very tough team, you need to win some battles,\u201d said USD coach Dawn Plitzuweit. \u201cThe rebounding battle was a really big one for us. \u2026 The next one was the field-goal percent for the defense. Holding teams under 38 percent is a goal for us, and they were at 37 percent. That\u2019s very challenging to do against Iowa State.\nFor many in the crowd, it was the first chance to see 6-foot-2 sophomore super-sub Hannah Sjevern. A transfer from New Mexico who sat out last season as a redshirt, she scored 10 points and added 10 rebounds in 23 minutes.\nWith Green Bay coming in on Saturday, the Coyotes will be encouraged to follow the same formula, though leaving out a 15-0 fourth-quarter run from the visitors will also be part of the plan.\n\"It's a real special opportunity to have a Big 12 perennial powerhouse to come in to the SCSC,\" Plitzuweit said. \"I think sometimes you get to the point where you really press to make things happen.

Jerry Brown and legislative leaders released a plan Monday to extend through 2030 California's cap-and-trade program, a key piece of the state's quest to fight climate change by drastically reducing emissions from greenhouse gases.\nThe deal updates how refineries, utilities and other carbon emitters can use pollution allowances and offsets, and it gives the California Air Resources Board power to set a price cap on carbon aimed at containing costs to businesses and consumers.\nBut it also prevents local air districts from placing further carbon emissions restrictions on polluters, a move some environmental groups decry as a concession to oil companies. The deal includes a companion bill aimed at reducing local air pollution.\nWith a bill now in print, lawmakers could vote on the deal as early as Thursday. The cap-and-trade reauthorization needs support from two-thirds of lawmakers to pass.\nCap-and-trade puts a limit on the state's overall greenhouse gas emissions and requires oil refineries, utilities, ports and other polluters to buy and trade allowances to emit carbon. By putting a price on carbon and reducing allowable emissions over time, it aims to incentivize polluters to reduce their emissions. Money from the program goes into a greenhouse gas reduction fund that pays for energy conservation efforts, transportation and housing projects and a high-speed rail, a pet project of Brown's.\nThe program is a key piece of California's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030.\nBrown, who has been extolling California's climate leadership on the world stage, is scrambling to cement cap and trade for another decade while satisfying competing interests at home. Environmental groups want to see more dramatic pollution reductions and business interests don't want to see a jump in costs, to industry or consumers.\n\"The Legislature is taking action to curb climate change and protect vulnerable communities from industrial poisons,\" Brown said in a statement announcing the deal.\nEnvironmental justice groups have charged businesses were too involved in crafting it.\n\"The oil lobby has had way too much influence on this legislation,\" Bill Magavern, policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, said outside the Capitol early Monday.\nTwo points of contention have centered on regulating local air pollution and how the state hands out allowances and offsets, which let businesses keep emitting greenhouse gases.\nThe state sells off allowances through auctions, with the next slated for August. But it also hands out some allowances for free to polluting industries, with the goal of helping them remain competitive and avoid price spikes for consumers.\nThe deal doesn't phase out free allowances as quickly as initially planned, a move critics say removes incentives to clean up emissions. But industry groups argue it will help ensure California consumers don't see drastically higher prices at the gas pump, in their utility bills or elsewhere. The deal will decrease those free allowances by 40 percent by 2030, Brown's office said.\nPolluters can also \"offset\" some of their emissions through projects to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, even outside of California. The deal decreases the allowable amount of offsets and encourages more building in California.\nUnder the plan, local air districts would be prevented from putting additional regulations on stationary sources of carbon emissions in their districts, a power several Democratic lawmakers in low-income communities near refineries and other pollution sources have fought to allow.\nBut"}

But while most of those stars appear to have roughly the mass of the sun, the galaxy as a whole weighs 600,000 times the mass of the sun. That means the normal matter stars are vastly outweighed by dark matter.\nInvisible dark matter has never been directly detected, but scientists think it exists based on the gravitational pull it exerts on the rest of the universe.\nTo parse how much regular matter and dark matter are in the galaxy, the researchers studied the motions of the visible light stars.\nIf the 1,000 or so stars were all there was to Segue 1, with just a smidgeon of dark matter, the stars should all move at about the same speed. But the Keck data show they do not. Instead of moving at a steady 130 miles per second (209 kilometers per second) relative to the Milky Way, some of the Segue 1 stars are moving at rates as slow as 121 miles per second (194 kilometers per second) while others are going as fast as 139 miles per second (224 kilometers per second).\n\"That tells you Segue 1 must have much more mass to accelerate the stars to those velocities,\" Yale University astronomer Marla Geha said in a statement.\nGeha, along with Joshua Simon from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and their colleagues first reported hints of the galaxy's dark matter content in 2008, but the new study provides stronger evidence. The researchers detailed their new findings in the May 2011 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.\nSegue 1 is not just interesting because of its dark nature, but because it represents an unusual collection of nearly primordial stars, the researchers said.\nOne way to tell how long ago a star formed is by its heavy element content, which can be gleaned by looking at the specific wavelengths of light emitted by a star.\nVery old or primitive stars come from a time when the universe was young and few large stars had yet grown old enough to fuse lightweight atoms like hydrogen and helium into heavier elements like iron and oxygen. Early, and therefore ancient, stars that formed from early gas clouds are therefore very low in heavy elements.\nThe researchers managed to gather iron data on six stars in Segue 1 with the Keck II telescope, and a seventh Segue 1 star was measured by an Australian team using the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Of those seven, three proved to have less than one 2,500th as much iron as our own sun.\n\"That suggests these are some of the oldest and least evolved stars that are known,\" Simon said.\nSearches for such primitive stars among the Milky Way's billions have yielded less than 30.\n\"In Segue 1 we already have 10 percent of the total in the Milky Way,\" Geha said. \"For studying these most primitive stars, dwarf galaxies are going to be very important.\"\nThe researchers hope Segue 1 will be able to shed more light on the mysterious nature of dark matter.\nSome researchers have been looking with the space-based Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope in hopes of catching sight of a faint glimmer of high-energy light called gamma rays, which could"}

Defense News added, \"inclusion of the EA-6B is notable, as that aircraft was officially retired by the Navy in 2015 in favor of the more advanced EA-18G Growler.\"\nSix Tomahawk cruise missiles were also launched from the Virginia-class USS John Warner submarine according to the Pentagon. The U.S. guided-missile destroyer USS Winston Churchill and another U.S. destroyer, the USS Donald Cook were deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as an apparent decoy to draw Russian and Syrian attention away from the three U.S. battleships which fired the other 60 Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf.\nThe cruiser USS Monterey fired 30 Tomahawks and the destroyer USS Laboon fired seven from the Red Sea, while the USS Higgins fired 23 Tomahawks from the North Arabian Gulf, according to McKenzie.\nThe bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his superpower ally Russia, but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war.\nThe air attack, denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression, was unlikely to alter the course of a multi-sided war that has killed at least half a million people.\nHe proclaimed on Twitter: \"Mission accomplished,\" echoing former President George W.

Radical new techniques were invented, like painting with oils, and perspective. Artists such as Botticelli, Gozzoli, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Ghiberti transformed the way we saw our world.\nBuildings were constructed that were bigger and better than ever before. Taking inspiration from the classical past, new rules were invented governing proportion and perspective. Magnificent temples to wealth were designed across Florence and the largest dome in the world was built by Filippo Brunelleschi, the brilliant engineer.\nMen no longer accepted at face value the teachings of the Church. Now they wanted to study the natural world, to discover for themselves the secrets of the universe. Leonardo da Vinci pioneered the study of human anatomy and Galileo Galilei rocked the Catholic establishment by announcing that the Earth revolved around the Sun.\nLiberated from the exclusive grasp of the Catholic Church, education filtered down to the upwardly mobile middle classes. Ancient texts, unread for more than 1,000-years, were devoured and debated. With the invention of printing, ideas swept across Europe faster than ever before, and thinkers and writers shared their opinions with the general public. Vasari recorded the lives of artists and the contribution of the Medici, in a precursor of today's PR.\nMachiavelli, the Godfather of Realpolitik, wrote the first modern manual for leadership, \u201cThe Prince\u201d, visualizing a pragmatic world in which the end always justified the means.\nThroughout Italy, republics and duchies blossomed under the glow of creative achievement. Around Europe, kings and princes turned their sights on the jewels of Italy and an era of total war was soon unleashed.\nIn this new world of communication and debate, the corruption and decadence of the Catholic Church was almost intolerable. Martin Luther becomes the first heretic to publish his theories worldwide. This German monk shattered centuries of reverence and assumption, paved the way for a revolution in faith and forever divided the Christian world prompting the Counter-Reformation.\nPeople still argue about what the Renaisssance meant, when it began and if it even existed. What is undeniable is that something extraordinary happened at the heart of the last millennium. It changed the face of western culture and left no doubt that the Medici were the patrons, the catalyst of genius."}

{"idx": "29562", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Historian Barbara Taylor and psychoanalyst Adam Phillips don't believe that nice people finish last. In their new book, On Kindness, the authors employ history, social theory and psychoanalysis to chart how kindness has become a pejorative word over the years. Taylor spoke with TIME from her home in London about how success doesn't require cruelty, why people distrust generous gestures and how President Obama might be bringing the virtue back.\nIn the book you use history and psychoanalysis to explain what kindness means today and how it has evolved. Why take that route?\nThere seems to be this idea that during difficult economic times like this one, people are more inclined to be kind to one another. What's your take on that notion?\nWhen Adam and I set out to write the book, of course, we had absolutely no idea that we were going to be publishing it in the middle of a global financial meltdown. Pushing the book out into the current situation has been fascinating because there's clearly a great deal of moral questioning going on and a lot of anxiety about the mentalities that have been encouraged over the last quarter-century: this whole \"greed is good\" and \"me first\" and the kind of triumphalism that has accompanied capitalism.\nDo you think kindness might sometimes hinder the pursuit of success or achievement?\nI don't think there is an incompatibility between kindness and leading a life that gives you satisfaction and pleasure. The core argument of the book, in a sense, is that one almost requires the other. Kindness is a huge source of pleasure for people. There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't make it a selfish emotion.\nWhy do you think people are suspicious of kindness?\nThere is a kind of folk wisdom these days that human beings are basically grasping, selfish, nasty creatures. That's how we look at people. That's what we suspect we're really like ourselves. So we're very wary about displays of kindness. The word nice kind of captures that suspicion. It doesn't have much meaning. [Niceness] could just be a masquerade, a piece of fakery. People think that a lot because that's the ethos of our age. I think people would gratefully give up that wariness given half a chance.\nPeople are very vulnerable creatures. We need each other. Kindness opens us up to other people in such a way that we really acutely experience our own vulnerability. If you close yourself off, if you neither give nor accept sympathy and fellow-feeling, then a defensive [or cruel] position can feel like the safest thing. Kindness is really seen as a sign of weakness.\nI think there's a proper set of anxieties about kindness. Opening yourself up to other people does entail risk. We can make it less risky if we don't organize society in such a way that only the most ruthless and rapacious get to the top.\nDo you think President Obama's rhetoric, and his emphasis on empathy in difficult times, might trickle down to engender the sort of kindness you stress in the book?\nSome have blamed the sharp increase in cases of depression and other mental illnesses on our increased social isolation. Do you think the lack of kindness you describe may have contributed to this?\nIt's this question of what it means for people to need each other and just how profound and deep that need runs. But it's often quite difficult to translate that need into action in one's life. The last few decades have seen a huge increase in the numbers of people who are living outside any kind of family framework. And it's not like people can replace that with warm, neighborly relationships"}

It's been a productive bye week for us. We take a simple approach to that. We wanted to provide all the men with what they need to move forward. In some instances, it's simply rest. In other instances, it's recuperation. In some instances, it's snaps. We had an opportunity to get some work in, particularly in situational football areas, red zone, third downs and so forth last week, particularly with some of our younger, less experienced players. I think it was a very productive week from that standpoint. You know how we measure production though. It's how we move forward with it. We are excited about doing that this week as we prepare for this week's challenge in the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\"From an injury standpoint, we are moving closer to health, not that we are looking for perfection in that area. We understand what this journey is about. We are simply going to assess the health of the men from week-to-week, and formulate a plan accordingly. Troy Polamalu was slowed, somewhat, during the bye week with some rib discomfort. We will see where the week takes us in terms of him. But we fully expect him to participate in the game. Ben Roethlisberger has a right thumb fracture. It's not the extent of say, Jay Cutler's. He's going to be able to play. Right now, it's unknown of how it's going to affect him and his play. We are going to sort through those things as we practice. He practiced in a limited capacity yesterday but those of us who know Ben, we know he is going to show and show for his teammates. The standard will be the standard in terms of his performance. LaMarr Woodley has worked in a limited capacity this week thus far, coming off his hamstring injury. We will continue to take his participation day-to-day. You can say the same thing about Arnaz Battle and his right hamstring injury. Emmanuel Sanders appears to be working his way back to us. I thought he had a productive day yesterday, but again, we will see how he responds to the work moving forward. We will make him available accordingly. We will continue to watch all these guys throughout the week. We are not ready to characterize any of these guys as out at this juncture.\"\nWhen you look at what is happening with quarterbacks around the league, how important is it to have solid depth at that position?\n\"I can't speak to everyone else's intentions. But it is an important component of team building for us. We acknowledge of course that injury is a part of the game, and unfortunately it occurs quite a bit at the position. We are comfortable with the men that we have at that position, that we are capable of playing winning football regardless of who is under center, and we consider ourselves fortunate in that area.\"\nIn practice Monday, did Ben let it go or was he just tossing? How did he throw?\n\"I thought he threw it pretty well. There is a pain tolerance issue. A comfortability issue. All of those things I think will be sorted out over the course of the week. To be honest with you, I am not overly concerned about his ability to be affective in the midst of this.\"\nIs there a concern with him taking snaps under center?\n\"Not at this juncture. No.\"\nHow has Antonio Brown come along in your view?\n\"I think, like I expect of all second-year men, he is improving"}

(He wanted a 48-inch fence to contain a dog.) He figured he'd found a way around the limit by putting a period iron fence on top of a concrete foundation. The planners didn't much like the foundation. The commission's design and neighborhood committees split against and for by divided votes.\nUPDATE: While the battle was pitched from the beginning as use of a foundation to exceed the fence height, Holmstrom said he'd persuaded the commission that this wasn't the right way to look at the issue. He said a foundation was necessary to have a level platform for his historic iron fence. He said he would backfill the yard on the house side of the fence so that in no place where the fence remains will it exceed the 40-inch height for which he'd obtained a permit.\nWith that explanation, and Holmstrom's agreement to remove 19 feet of the fence in the front of the house, compromise was reached and the commission approved the deal.\nHere's a complete rundown, including schematic drawing, of this particular fence saga.\nThat account doesn't begin to tell the whole fence story. Of how Holmstrom and another Quapaw Quarter resident on Scott Street who exceeded the fence limit had been unable to get variances from the Zoning Commission, a state-created agency that oversees zoning around the Capitol and Governor's Mansion. Of how Holmstrom, chief of staff, related his problems to a disagreeable Republican representative from far western Arkanss, Nate Bell. Of how Bell first held up the agency's budget and then tried to abolish the Capitol Zoning District Commission altogether. Of a court case lost by the other neighbor with a tall fence.

That data will be analyzed by lab scientists at Broad, then crunched by IBM\u2019s Watson supercomputer.\nThe goal, IBM and Broad executives said, is to scour the data to help answer one of the most difficult questions about cancer treatment: why some cancers respond to certain treatments and some don\u2019t. Drug resistance contributes to the 600,000 cancer deaths in the United States each year.\nSometimes patients don\u2019t respond to a treatment at all. Sometimes the drug works for a while, then stops being effective. Scientists believe that genetic differences can explain why drugs work in some cases but not others.\n\u201cYou get people through the first phase of treatment, and the cancer mutates, and all of a sudden you\u2019re trying to play whack-a-mole,\u201d said Kathy McGroddy-Goetz, vice president of partnerships and solutions for IBM Watson Health, which is headquartered in Cambridge.\nIBM and Broad said this is the largest study of its kind. Eventually, the research could help doctors prescribe more effective combinations of drugs for cancer patients. This could also help reduce spending on ineffective drugs, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient.\nAt Broad, as many as 100 people \u2014 including genomic experts, computational biologists, and physicians \u2014 will be involved in the research project with IBM.\nDr. Todd Golub, chief scientific officer at the Broad Institute, said researchers will obtain the \u201cgenomic fingerprints\u201d of tumors and compare them before patients are treated, and again after the tumors develop resistance to drugs. The molecular differences between the two tumor samples will help provide clues about why resistance occurs, he said.\nThe problem is common among patients who have skin, colon, lung, ovarian, and other cancers. \u201cUnfortunately, it appears that this problem of drug resistance is not an exception, it\u2019s more the rule. So we really need to understand it better,\u201d Golub said.\nBroad will enroll patients in the study with the help of hospitals and cancer centers throughout the country. The data that researchers develop will be shared with the broader scientific community, a concept that many experts consider key to helping accelerate cancer research.\nIBM will use the research data to develop software that it can sell to the doctors and hospitals. The New York-based company launched its Watson Health unit last year and has been quickly ramping up the business. Watson is a supercomputer that is constantly updated with new information, so its analyses improve over time. IBM uses Watson to sort through tomes of health care data, developing recommendations that can help doctors sift through drugs, clinical trials, and medical images."}

And they\u2019re right, this statement sums up cinema pretty effectively. Movies are inherently a reflection of our lives, and all films alter that reality to varying degrees. In many cases, this reflection is most prominent and least distorted in movies that feature non-professional, or first-time actors.\nMore often than not, the thing that draws people to watch a film is an A-list cast. And while established Oscar winners and household names are all well and good, sometimes first timers are the ones who deliver truly unforgettable performances. Often, the story of how said non-actor ended up in the film is as interesting as the movie itself. And even more frequently, these kinds of performances blur the lines between fiction and reality in new and creative ways.\nHeaven Knows What was directed by Josh and Benny Safdie and adapted for the screen by Josh Safdie and Ronald Bronstein from an unpublished memoir by Arielle Holmes titled \u201cMad Love In New York City.\u201d The story of how the film came together is quite something. While researching another project, Josh bumped into Holmes on the subway. He asked her if she\u2019d ever considered acting and then the two made plans to meet and talk more about the prospect. Entranced after hearing about her daily life and the cinematic way in which she described everything, Safdie started paying Holmes to write down her story.\nThe result was Heaven Knows What, in which Holmes plays Harley, a slightly fictionalized version of herself. The film starts with Harley\u2019s suicide attempt and then brings us along to observe the few days in her life that follow. Heaven Knows What gives viewers a stark portrait of the realities of homelessness and addiction in New York City. Almost all of the other actors in the film are Holmes\u2019 real-life friends, except for her boyfriend, Ilya. The Safdies cast Caleb Landry Jones in the role because the real Ilya was too difficult and volatile to work with.\nThe film is an incredibly raw and unique work that excels at so many things, but the stand out has to be Holmes\u2019 performance. She has a magnetic screen presence, especially when the Safdies continuously frame her in close-ups. Simply put, Holmes real life experience is invaluable to the film. While a more seasoned actress surely could\u2019ve taken on the role, I don\u2019t think anyone other than Holmes herself could\u2019ve achieved the resonance she does in this movie. The story is so personal, and Holmes makes it clear that it\u2019s imperative she be the one on-screen telling it. After watching Heaven Knows What you\u2019ll be happy to hear that Holmes has continued to pursue acting. She recently appeared in Andrea Arnold\u2018s American Honey (2016).\nClose-Up, directed by Abbas Kiarostami, is a difficult film to describe. Similarly to Heaven Knows What, the film tells a true story and uses the actual people the events happened to as actors. Though, Close-Up also has aspects of a documentary. The film tells the story of the Ahankhah family in Iran. One day, Mrs. Ahankhah is riding the bus when she meets Hossain Sabzian, a cinephile, who decides to pretend he is famous Iranian film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Once Mrs. Ahnkhah shares that her entire family is huge fans of his, he offers to come over and meet her sons.\nSabzian continues to visit the family and maintain his masquerade as Makhmalbaf.

The board approved putting the levy on the ballot on Jan. 15.\nThe two-year levy is expected to generate $644,300 per year to help respond to issues such as depression, teen suicide, violence in schools, alcohol and drug abuse and other youth issues. If the levy passes, it is projected to cost the owner of a $100,000 residence $10.50 per year.\nTammy Nicholl, executive director of the MHDAS board, said speaking with service providers involved with local schools, there has been a significant increase in mental health needs for students. Nicholl noted this need has reached a level beyond what a guidance counselor can handle.\n\u201cWe would really like to respond to that because we think kids need it,\u201d Nicholl said. \u201cThere are needs there and we want to be responsive to that. We want the schools to be a place where the learning environment is as healthy and positive and conducive to learning as possible and support what they\u2019re trying to do.\nGiven the number of suicides locally and throughout Ohio along with drug addiction, Nicholl said, prevention is the way to get ahead of these issues by providing these resources as early as possible.\nCurrently, Nicholl said the amount of time these services have been provided to local schools has increased this school year compared to the previous one.\nShe added Consolidated Care has a presence in almost all school districts in both counties with a representative able to provide behavioral health treatment services a few days a week.\nWith the additional levy funding, Nicholl said the board\u2019s proposal is to adopt a care team model.\nNicholl said the board wants to start providing improved services starting this fall with two therapists and social worker positions. When the new levy money comes in early 2021, the board would then expand the teams with behavioral support specialists and prevention service specialists.\nIf the levy fails, Nicholl said the board would not be able to implement the new program.\nThe last time the board had a levy on the ballot in November 2016, the replacement levy passed 57 percent to 42 percent in Champaign County. This 0.7-mill levy will be up for renewal in 2021.\n\u201cMy hope is that if we can pass the 0.3-mill additional levy, that in 2021 we would like to combine the two and have a 1-mill levy that would provide ongoing services,\u201d Nicholl said."}

It can also be contentious. But Dr. Pamela Ronald, professor of plant pathology at University of California, Davis, doesn't have time for controversy. She's too busy working toward an unassailable goal. \u201cI'm focused on the greatest challenge of our time,\" Ronald says, \u201cwhich is how to feed the growing population without further destroying the environment.\"\nTo that end, Ronald has made history. Twenty years ago, she and her colleagues at UC Davis isolated the plant-disease-battling Xa21 gene, found on the 11th chromosome of rice. The potential of this feat of genetic engineering was great; rice is relied upon to feed half the world. The New York Times heralded it a new agricultural era.\nIt's an era Ronald has continued to help define. In 2006, she worked with David Mackill and Kenong Xu at IRRI to isolate the rice gene Submergence Tolerance 1 QTL, dubbed \u201cSub1.\" Found in an ancient variety of rice, the Sub1 gene confers a flood tolerance trait to rice plants, allowing them to survive for up to two weeks underwater. A conventional rice plant will last only three or four days.\nThe following year, reporters from National Public Radio visited a village in northern Bangladesh after Monsoon flooding. Only one farmer, Gobindra Chandra Rai, had planted government-provided Sub1 seedlings developed by the International Rice Research Institute using precision breeding. The reporters encountered swaths of drowned plants surrounding Chandra Rai's plot of healthy, green stalks. Villagers crowded around, admiring the crop's success. When asked which farmers would plant Sub1 rice in the future, Chandra Rai exclaimed, \u201cEverybody.\" Last year, 3.5 million farmers in Asia were planting Sub1 rice.\nIn some circles, work such as Ronald's is regarded as nearly heroic. In other circles, plant genetics garners more misgivings than accolades. When \u201cgolden rice,\" engineered with Vitamin A to prevent starvation and blindness, was field-tested in the Philippines in 2013, protesters ripped up the plants. The New York Times reported that crops with similarly benign aims were being destroyed around the world, such as grapes imbued with anti-viral properties in France.\nRonald contends that the public would be less fearful if the conversation about genetically modified crops remained grounded in science. \u201cMany people don't realize almost everything we eat is genetically modified in some way,\" she says, explaining that there are many methods of altering food, some used throughout the history of farming. \u201cAlmost nothing we eat would survive in nature. It's a domesticated system.\"\nRonald notes that genetically engineered crops are deemed safe by widely respected organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Genetically engineered crops also get a nod for offering environmental advantages. A report issued last year by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found less insecticide use among farmers planting Bt cotton, genetically engineered for pest resistance. \u201cIn the scientific community,\" Ronald asserts, \u201cthe conclusion that modern genetic methods are no more risky than conventional methods, is accepted.\"\nThe secret to assuaging fear, Ronald supposes, may be to fill out the picture \"with the nitty gritty of"}

The live video chat site that connects you to other random users has recently begun blurring the images of others when you first see them, gradually un-blurring the screen over a few seconds, allowing you time to move on before seeing something you'd rather not. It's likely meant to fight back against the hordes of exhibitionists and male genitalia that have plagued the site. But is it too little, too late?\nWhen Chatroulette went offline for a week last month, many expected a new version that would clean up the service. Instead, version 2 was pretty much the same as version 1, and widely panned by the media.\nEven worse, the service has fallen behind in the video chat genre it created in terms of innovation. BlurryPeople, one of the many Chatroulette competitors out there, already implemented the same blurring function as Chatroulette earlier this month. On BlurryPeople, though, you get not a few seconds but a few minutes of time from blurred image to completely un-blurred to decide whether you want to keep chatting with the other person or click 'next' and move on.\nAfter chatting with someone, you're then able to rate them based on how 'friendly,' 'interesting' and 'good looking' they are. The ratings can then be used to filter the type of people you want to chat with in the future.\nIt's this sort of system and interface that Chatroulette version 2 needed to take the site to the next level and clean up its image. But the fall of Chatroulette may be a sign that the shine has worn off randomized video chat.\nThat's a shame, since there is something to be said for the serendipitous discovery of content on the Web, like with the newly launched Google Instant, which shows search results as you type your query, or its impressive imitator YouTube Instant, which does something similar for YouTube videos. I think there's a desire beyond mere curiosity that would motivate one to go onto a Chatroulette-type site: the chance to form new and different connections, even if they are fleeting. But the service would need to provide a safe environment and one where people don't have to worry so much about rejection when the other party decides to move on to another person. Internet anonymity, however, tends to bring out the worst in people, something Chatroulette unfortunately wasn't able to adequately prepare for."}

And the Army's European theater commander told Defense News last summer that one of his main priorities was to boost SHORAD capability to deter an intrusive Russia.\nThe new Army Space and Missile Defense Command commander, Lt. Gen. James Dickinson, said during an Association of the US Army missile defense conference in Arlington, Virginia, on Tuesday that the goal is to field SHORAD capability to Europe in fiscal year 2018.\nThe Army made headway in a review wrapped up last year that looked at possible SHORAD weapons from around the world in order to fill the critical gap in Europe.\nAt Eurosatory in Paris last June, then-Army Acquisition Chief Katrina McFarland called it an \"international scrub\" of every technology in the world that addresses the concern. And she added the Army is also working to address the gap in its own military labs, developing a launcher than can shoot a wide variety of missiles -- appropriately dubbed the Multi-Mission Launcher.\nThe MML will be integrated into the Indirect Fire Protection Capability that is being designed to defeat UAS, rockets, artillery and mortars and cruise missiles, but the weapon is still years away from prime time.\nCol.

Doug White, a TRADOC capabilities manager for the Air Defense Artillery Brigade, C-UAS and now SHORAD, explained the Army is focused on fielding quickly to Europe, but is also developing the future of the capability.\nThe service wants \"fixed\" and \"semi-fixed\" assets that defend critical combat enablers for the armed maneuver forces and also wants capability resident within the maneuvering force, he said.\nAvenger is still a capable system, White said, and, for example, defends the National Capital Region.

In fact, Erolin\u2019s \u201ciron\u201d is a handheld 3D scanner, and her digitised animals are now being used as teaching aids worldwide. Her enthusiasm for the work (which she has to squeeze between research into medical visualisation and haptics) is palpable. She is not just bringing animals back from the dead, but helping to bring a great collection back to life.\nIn 1884, the biologist and classicist D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson began assembling a teaching and research museum in Dundee. An energetic philanthropist and a natural diplomat, Thompson had a broad network of friends and contacts \u2013 among them members of Dundee\u2019s own whaling community, who provided him with extraordinary, then-unique specimens of Arctic fauna.\nIt\u2019s largely not a genuine problem though, in part because advances in digitisation are changing the priorities of collections worldwide. Even more importantly, it is generally acknowledged that Thompson has outgrown Dundee: he belongs to the world. Together with Charles Darwin, Thompson, who died in 1948, is the most culturally influential English-speaking biologist in history.\nWe have one book to thank for that: On Growth and Form, first published in 1917 \u2013 an event commemorated by an exhibition, A Sketch of the Universe: Art, science and the influence of D\u2019Arcy Thompson, at the Edinburgh City Art Centre.\nIn neither the first edition nor the revised and expanded 1942 version does Thompson talk much about Darwin, and even in the 1940s he considered genetics hardly more than a distraction. Thompson was pursuing an entirely different line: the way in which physical constraints and the initial conditions of life shape the development of plants and animals.\nThompson was fascinated by tiny, single-celled shelled organisms such as foraminifera and radiolaria. He was convinced (rightly) that their wildly diverse shell shapes play no evolutionary role: they arise at random, their beauty emerging from the self-organising properties of matter, not from any biological code.\nEven as geneticists like Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky were revealing the genetic mechanisms that constrain how living things evolve, Thompson was revealing the constraints and opportunities afforded to living things by physics and chemistry. Crudely put, genetics explains why dogs, say, look like other dogs. Thompson did something different: he glimpsed why dogs look the way they do.\nMost of Thompson\u2019s contemporaries were caught up in a genetic revolution, synthesising the seemingly incompatible demands of chromosomal genetics and Darwinian selection theory. No one ever seriously doubted Thompson\u2019s importance \u2013 his book has always been a classic text \u2013 but at the same time, few have ever quite known what to do with him.\nThompson himself (pictured above as morphed by artist Darren McFarlane) understood the problem; he described his landmark book as \u201call preface\u201d: the sketch of a territory he lacked the mathematical skill to penetrate.

He was waiting on customers as a cashier at 8 years old, building the restaurant\u2019s website at 11 years old and most importantly, he was watching his father run a business.\nAt an early age, he knew he wanted to become an entrepreneur like his father, and never looked back.\n\"I knew from a young age that I couldn't work for anyone else,\" says Ross Snyder, a business and marketing sophomore and entrepreneur at ASU. \"My dad owns his own restaurant, both of my grandparents owned their own businesses, so I was brought up with an entrepreneurial spirit.\"\n\"I knew that working for somebody on a nine to five was not for me,\" he says. \"I fell into this. I fell in love with this industry.\"\nAt just 19 years old, Snyder is the owner and founder of White Tie Productions, a full-service audio/visual (A/V), event production and creative media design company.\n\"The energy that's in the room, the content that we can create on the screens and the lighting that we can throw in the room is almost inspirational, and that's something that I'm really passionate about,\" Snyder says.\nHis process of forming the business began as a junior in high school when he was a member of a high school entrepreneur organization, DECA. There, he wrote the business plan to expand his work as a DJ into the company it is today. While serving as State President for Arizona's DECA chapter in his senior year, his proposed business plan turned into a real business.\nIt prepares them for careers in business, marketing, finance, hospitality and management through role play and written projects, like the business plan Snyder created.\nBecause of his experience with DECA and the connections he\u2019s made, he says his clientele is mostly non-profits, but he also works with corporations. Even though he\u2019s made several contacts, he still considers his small business as a startup. He relies on mass emails, friend-to-friend and word of mouth in order to expand his clientele, which he says is a current priority of his.\nGaining clientele is a continuous challenge for startups, especially in the niche A/V industry, but even more so for Snyder, he says, because of his young age.\n\"A lot of times I'll work with these non-profit clients, and they don't have the budget Coca-Cola or Intel has,\" Snyder says. \"These people have massive conferences, but they still need that look because they have that volume of people and they need to portray the same kind of message.\"\nKristi Kupchik, co-owner of Kristed Investments, LLC and former State Vice President for Arizona's DECA chapter, has known Snyder for almost three years, working closely with him to create a national campaign for DECA and entrepreneurship videos.\nSnyder says he finds solace in ASU\u2019s W.P. Carey School of Business because of other students\u2019 willingness to get their ideas off the ground. Although he came from a high school that believed in business, most students wanted to take the traditional route - get an education and then become an entrepreneur.\nSnyder says the environment that W.P. Carey fosters is very refreshing in that the foundation the school teaches is directly applicable to operating a business. They use methods"}

Rachel Hultin, who helped coordinate the grant in its final year, recruited other residents, including Wylie, to help its mission endure.\nWhile cycling is a viable alternative to driving, residents who cannot ride a bicycle on their own because of age, lack of resources or limited mobility end up with fewer options.\nBut last July, Hultin came across an online article about a European-based organization called Cycling Without Age that provides transportation to senior citizens in the community using pedicabs \u2014 bicycles with a bench in the front or a carriage in the back. When Hultin decided to share the article on Facebook, her fellow cyclers were struck with inspiration. \u201cPeople jumped all over it and were like, \u2018what can we do to make this happen here?\u2019\u201d Hultin said.\nThe advisory team began designing a pedicab for Wheat Ridge that would not only serve senior citizens but anyone looking for an alternative to driving. They intend to build a pedicab that will also act as a mobile bicycle repair shop to assist residents who want to cycle but lack the resources to keep their bike serviceable.\nIn the beginning of December, the team launched a crowdfunding campaign through ioby.org with the ultimate goal of raising $6,000 for the project, which they are calling Cycle Trooper. The team hopes their pedicab will be completed and ready for service by April or May.\nThe advisory team hopes to get the community involved by participating in city parades and charity events such as Ride for Reading where they deliver books on their on bicycles to children in under-served areas. But what they\u2019re particularly well-known for are their community cruises.\n\u201cThe cruiser rides are community-building events to get people out to see places they might not otherwise see, chat with like-minded people, raise awareness for bicycling and reignite that sense of freedom we got as kids when we were able to cruise around the neighborhood and have fun,\u201d Wylie said.\nWhen the team goes out on these cruises, they wear capes for high visibility and group identity, but mostly just for fun, Wylie said.\nThe team is accepting donations at ioby.org/project/cycletrooper until Jan. 19.

Playing for England is the pinnacle; players - no matter the profile - should want to meet up at all costs.\nBut make no mistake - Southgate simply cannot do without his drop-outs.\nKane, Alli, Sterling and Henderson will all be in Southgate's final 23-man squad for next summer's World Cup.\nWhat's more, all four will have prominent roles to play in Russia.\nHarry Winks and Fabian Delph, who also pulled out of the current squad, still have work to do to prove they are worthy of a place on the plane next summer.\nBut however commendable Southgate's rhetoric on blooding England's youth, a World Cup is no time for an experiment.\nThe likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Joe Gomez have done their World Cup ambitions no harm at all over the past 10 days.\nBut when push comes to shove; Southgate knows where his bread is buttered.\nYou suspect the presence of Kane and Co against the Brazilians wouldn't have made a blind bit of difference on how the game panned out.\nThe sight of Brazil keeping the football for minutes on end is a thing of beauty.\nWembley.

The 23 year-old soon-to-be mom continues to provide the same lovely vibes and feels that initially reeled us in. While the tape contains a mere runtime of 31 minutes, this 9-track EP is not to be taken for granted! The mixtape features the talents of Musiq Soulchild, 6LACK, Ty Dolla $ign, and Dom Kennedy (talk about stacked)!\nIn an era of music where singers want to be rappers and rappers want to be singers, \u201cWhile We Wait\u201d displays such genuine R&B appeal that is desperately needed in music today. The EP is raw, pure, transparent and so much more. Without much effort, Lani quickly gathers listeners and fans alike to remind us all of exactly who she is.\nKeeping that authentic R&B appeal at an all-time high, Lani goes back to her R&B roots with the tape\u2019s first track, \u201cFootsteps,\u201d featuring the legendary, Musiq Soulchild. Over serene production, and a classic Omarion sample, Kehlani bellows about a failed relationship that had the potential to work if mere effort were applied. Instead of chasing after Lani when times get tough, her love interest allows the rain to wash away the \u201cfootsteps\u201d she\u2019s left him to get back to her.\nAlthough the production is so soothing to the soul, the subject matter of the song ironically goes against it. Musiq arrives on the tune delivering the male perspective of the relationship. He acknowledges his faults and takes responsibility for the part he played in the relationship\u2019s downfall.\nHer passion blazes through the entire song and listeners will love that from beginning to end. The lyricism helps to tell a narrative that many will resonate with.\n\u201cNunya\u201d showcases a more \u201cflexin\u201d Kehlani. The story continues and at this point, she\u2019s now done with the previous relationship but her counterpart seems to still be worried about her whereabouts, her actions, and basically everything about her. Lani shuts it down telling him that, \u201cYou had your chance and you blew it\u2026 Let it go.\u201d With trademark Californian production, assistance from the LA native Dom Kennedy, and pure attitude, Lani makes crystal clear that whatever she does or does not do is none of anyone\u2019s business especially her old flame\u2019s. The song is definitely an anthem for ladies who dealt with significant others who took what they had for granted.\nFrom production, to vocals and lyrics, \u201cMorning Glory\u201d takes listeners to \u201cYou Should Be Here\u201d Kehlani. The message is simple, \u201cIf you cannot accept me when I\u2019m not put together, you simply do not deserve me when I\u2019m at the very top of my game.\u201d The song is very empowering for anyone! Kehlani takes her truth and wholeheartedly embraces it. The chorus is very contagious and the song really relays 90\u2019s TLC energy.\nThis record gives us some of that rapper Kehlani that we have heard on songs and features before. She does an amazing job mixing both singing and rapping in such a way that it is actually enjoyable!\nThe tape\u2019s fifth song, \u201cFeels\u201d is actually a personal favorite.

They found the place on Airbnb.com and arranged to stay for six weeks. Her first red flag: they didn't pay in full. Then came a text that read, \"I'm not leaving. I'm legally allowed to stay here.\"\n\"My heart sank, and it just felt like I was being bullied,\" Tschogl said.\nTschogl discovered that, under California law, a person who lives on the property for more than 30 days is considered a \"tenant,\" so she couldn't just kick them out.\n\"I just thought, uh-oh. This is no longer just a guest who is not paying. This is someone who might be a professional con artist or scammer,\" Tschogl said.\nTschogl has since hired a lawyer to help her evict the tenants. Airbnb couldn't get the men to pay up or leave, either.\nThe company told CBS News, \"We've worked closely with this host and provided our full support.

In a way, this felt good. I was separating the business and the personal.\nOver the years, I&apos;ve learned that this is not always the best approach. Recently, something happened to remind me of this point. I&apos;ve been working with a smart person to help me on a project. The person is an expert in an area I know nothing about. I respect their experience and perspectives.

It\u2019s time to try a brandy from closer to home.\nRachel Cole Gardner was working on her grandmother's farm in Upstate New York when she noticed some gangly apple trees around the property, trees that hadn't been pruned in years, adorned with tiny green bulbs.\nCurious, she tasted a few. \"They were very bitter, very tart \u2014 blech! \u2014 but I ended up pulling down 10 to 15 pounds of them and bringing them back here,\" says Gardner, co-founder of Republic Restoratives distillery in the District.\nThe apples sat in the distillery refrigerator until a bartender pushed them to the head of Gardner's to-do list by juicing them. Gardner added yeast and let the brew sit for a couple of months before distilling it into brandy. \"The whole space filled with this apple-y smell,\" she says. \"It made our space feel homey and really made us feel more connected to what we'd made.\"\nThat smell of apples conjures home for lots of Americans, which is funny, when you think about it. Few cliches have stumbled onto deeper truths like \"American as apple pie,\" which centers our national identity on fruit that originated in Asia and pastry traditions from Europe. Apple and other brandies were a large component of early American drinking. Distilled from grapes, apples or other fruits (as opposed to grain or sugar cane), they came from distilling traditions that settlers brought with them.\nIn the past few decades, those old roots have started producing new fruit.\nUntil quite recently, most domestic brandies \u2014 both the grape-based standard and those from other fruits \u2014 have languished in the elegant shadow of such European forebears as cognac and Calvados. That image of sophisticated sipping even crept into hip-hop, with Ice Cube sippin' on Courvoisier and Jay-Z praising Remy on the rocks; millions heard Tupac Shakur's posthumous profession of loyalty to Hennessy. The titans of rap have long been directing people to brandy, every drop of it French. French brandy had quality and cachet, whereas domestic brandies were thought of (sometimes justly) as cheap, adulterated and sweet \u2014 far removed from the complexity of their European ancestors.\nBut American brandy had an earlier act. Made from the fruits that grew well in their regions, brandy had a big role in our drinking and cocktail culture (the earliest known was being distilled in New York in 1640) before Prohibition came along and wiped it off the map.\nAmong apple brandy makers, only Laird & Company of New Jersey survived, diverting into legal apple products during Prohibition.

{"idx": "29628", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: A chipped wood surface helps defend your driveway from erosion and keeps dust down.\n4 What Vegetables Can Be Grown in Wood Chips?\nA dirt driveway with no surfacing is, at best, a big dust generator and, at worst, a flooding and erosion risk. Non-pavement surfacing materials include gravel, rubber mulch and organic mulches, including wood chips. Of the three, only wood chips can be obtained for nothing -- or almost nothing when delivery cost or equipment rental is a factor. They make an attractive, stable road base that holds soil in place and compacts into the ground to make a firm driving surface. Creation of a wood-chip driveway is a permanent work in progress because this organic surface biodegrades over time and needs new chips added periodically.\nA dirt driveway in decent condition seldom needs much work before layering on wood chips. The wood chips themselves help correct minor problems like ridges or mild runoff damage because they decelerate future runoff water and collect the soil it was carrying. More severe problems, like deep erosion cuts or a roadbed that is more than an inch or two lower than the surrounding landscape should be repaired before laying down the chips. When heavy equipment is used to make repairs, only enough to dirt to get the job done should be moved. Wind and water do their best erosion work on soil that has been disturbed. Soil brought in to raise the roadbed should include a mix of different-sized particles.\nWood chips are available through a variety of municipal recycling and chipping programs or may be made on-site from the products of a homeowner's tree trimmings, construction projects and brush abatement. Homeowners who have to clear brush or fallen trees on their property can kill two birds with one stone by renting or borrowing a chipper to both clear their property and surface the drive at once. Retail sources for wood chips include landscaping products companies, materials companies and tree removal companies. Wood chips are usually sold by the cubic yard.\nApplication of wood chips is a simple matter of spreading them evenly over the driveway surface. A driveway should be covered to a depth of at least 2 inches, but might need it thicker if the driveway surface is below the surrounding soil level. Soil that is particularly mushy in rainy weather or below level, requires a thicker layer -- as much as 6 inches is fine. Some of the chips push into the soil when it is wet. When having the material delivered by truck, the load can be dumped directly on the driveway, preferably at the highest point if the driveway climbs a slope, and spread with a broad landscape rake to save labor. A snow shovel also works well for moving wood chips around.\nDuring the first rainy season, a wood-chip driveway is likely to require additional wood chips. The wood chips in some places push into the soil and some pop out of the roadbed, disturbed by car tires. Chips can also become partially buried with soil. These changes are positive; they mean the chips are mixing with the soil to fill in low spots and give you a firmer year-round driving surface. The driveway needs to be maintained with a rake, pushing chips that spill over to the roadway back into the drive. Chips may also need to be added each spring to maintain your preferred depth.\nJo, Billie. \"How to Create a Wood Chip Driveway.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/create-wood-chip-driveway-32638.html.

They are good at organising sporting events,\u201d said Padukone, who won the All England crown in 1980.\nApart from Browne and Padukone, British Deputy High Commissioner Ian Felton and Olympian U\u2008Vimal Kumar were also present. Bangalore International School students performed the Olympic song and message before former player Vimal showed the youngsters the basics of badminton.\nBrowne then played badminton with Padukone. \u201cHe continues to inspire sports players of all ages with his leadership, dedication and his world-class academy. I am honoured to have the chance to play against a champion such as Prakash Padukone,\u201d Browne said.\nThe event will move to Chennai and then to Hyderabad before winding up in New Delhi."}

To learn more about the nature of technology, engineering and industrial design, of course.\nIt\u2019s kind of a beautiful thing, actually: staring at a gadget\u2019s ugliest internal parts to learn its secrets.\nTo celebrate teardown culture, we hosted a contest in collaboration with teardown company iFixit, and 19 people participated (20, if you include a hilariously failed attempt). The rules were simple: Disassemble a Sony gadget, take photos of each step, and post the results.\nWhy Sony? Because the company makes some of the most elegantly designed hardware out there, and we were curious to see what lurked beneath the products' sleek exteriors. Also because Sony told iFixit that it doesn't like its products being torn apart publicly like this, and we couldn't resist a challenge like that.\nIFixit is handing out two awards to the winners: a PS3 Slim for \u201cBest Overall Teardown,\u201d and a PSP Go for \u201cMost Creative Teardown,\u201d Check out photos of the two winners, as well as eight other teardowns we found thoughtful, clever and impressive.\nThanks to all 20 who participated!\nThe winner of \u201cMost Creative Teardown\u201d goes to iFixit author Bac, who disassembled a vintage Sony TR-63 transistor radio. Not only were we shocked at the author\u2019s ballsiness for ripping up this valuable antique; we were wowed by the old-school circuit board, which looks like an array of colorful beetles and worms.\niFixit author Baq deserves an honorable mention for his bold teardown of the Sony DSC-H2 digital camera. Components include a logic board, a mess of ribbon cables, an imaging processor, a really puny viewfinder screen and several other parts \u2013 not to mention a dangerous capacitor from the flash unit. Overall, a freaky looking teardown, and we doubt Baq will ever put this camera back together \u2014 but kudos for bravery.\nAn autopsy of another old CD player, the Sony D822-K Car Discman, reveals that an amber light is used to illuminate the puny part of the screen that displays track information. Who uses amber lights anymore?\nVideo projectors look simple on the outside, but they\u2019re gnarly beasts inside. Disassembling the Sony VPL-ES1 projector took 22 steps. The guts include an LCD assembly, cooling ducts, an automatic lens with a motor attached, a lamp and more.\nWe\u2019ve all banged an alarm clock really hard at one point in our lives. Here\u2019s what the Sony Dream Machine would look like smashed apart.

The Sony MDR-IF33K cordless stereo earphone system didn\u2019t try very hard with looks on the outside: It just looks like a big antenna. But its insides are a lot cooler.

The president says he needs $5.7 billion to finish a wall, and Congress has offered him money to maintain and expand the existing system. There's a lot of misinformation about this wall, the money and another possible government shutdown.\nPresident Trump made a campaign promise for a border wall, 35 to 40 feet tall, running from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean, which would stop all illegal immigrants, all terrorists and all contraband from crossing our southern border.\nSome political supporters of Republican Donald Trump think this border wall could be completed with the requested $5.7 billion. That promise is gone for good and has been for a long time. Some possible prototypes of a small size \u201cwall\u201d were built but none have been adopted or constructed at any point along the border.\nFor the border, last year, Republicans gave the Department of Homeland Security $1.375 billion. The money funded repair projects and an extension of existing fencing. One of the projects fell behind schedule and remains uncompleted. Yet, some Republicans lie about the projects.\nThe four projects included a steel bollard wall, a primary pedestrian wall, a secondary border wall and a levee wall system. When and if all the repairs, replacements and extensions are completed, we would have worked on 84 miles of fence.\nFor this year, 2019, the Democrats offered him the same amount of money as the Republicans in 2018, $1.375 billion. The president rejected that money and shut down the government. The immediate economic cost of the shutdown exceeded the $5.7 billion. That was fiscally irresponsible .\nHad the Republican Congress of 2018 or the 2019 Congress given President Trump $5.7 billion, that broken promise of a wall would still be a broken campaign promise. There's no wall being planned. The uncompleted projects are merely repairs, upgrades and extensions of existing fence. The huge new money could have been used to hide cost over-runs on bad promises and poor execution of old plans.\nNo money. No wall. No more lies."}

Is there any form of Palestinian resistance to the occupation, the colonization and the siege, so innocuous that it would not win condemnation from Israel\u2019s backers and self-appointed mediators in the West? After a century of struggle, the Palestinian people are hopelessly divided, abandoned by the Arab governments, their land colonized or under siege, and their options limited by the traps of the Oslo\u2019s agreements.\nThe first Intifada was the revolution that the Palestinians waited for after the 1967 war, if not after 1948. No gun was fired or bomb detonated \u2013 only demonstrations and stones at the symbols of occupation. The Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including the refugees for whom camps had been their own reality in their daily life for too long, were not afraid to put themselves and their own children at risk because life under occupation, military rule and the settlers\u2019 harassment had proven that there was no safe place to hide the children. They declined to live under occupation, and chose to fight actively with stones against power far stronger than their own.\nThey were reckoning with the losses and wounds that their uprising inflected as the consequences of their commitment to live free. They let the children take part in the demonstrations, and the kids learnt to overcome their fear because they saw themselves as other than passive victims, by participating in the protests. The children learned to defy their complacent elders and not to fear the IDF gunfire. After many confrontations, the children of the first Intifada did not talk about pop stars and sports, only clashes, prisoners, and the latest martyrs. After great sacrifices in facing the Israeli repression, they suspended the resistance option and tried the so-called \u201cpeace process\u201d at the advice of their leaders in Tunisia and Israel\u2019s Western allies. What did they get? Oslo!\nThe Palestinian leaders were allowed to return from exile, but they effectively gave up almost all of the West Bank and Jerusalem except for some enclaves \u2013 Bantustans or cantons in a rising sea of settlements in exchange for a phantom state and the trappings of sovereignty. Israel has relied on the PA to repress resistance from the Islamist right, nationalist left, or dissent factions within Fatah. \u201cSecurity coordination\u201d between the PA and the occupying army that provokes resentment and shame among the Palestinian people meant that PA forces did Israel\u2019s bidding by removing any perceived threats to the occupation in the territory under the PA partial control. It allowed Israel to feel confident about conducting arrests, assassination and home demolitions within the West Bank, in areas that the Oslo agreements had placed under the direct control of the PA.\nBesides turning the West Bank into a captive market, the Paris Protocol allowed Israel to have almost complete control over the PA economy, to collect custom duties on goods destined for the PA markets, and determine what the PA is permitted to import and export. Israel succeeded in creating a client state that it continues to control through the rents distributed to the PA via international donors and a strategy of territorial fragmentation and containment.\nThe PA secures loyalties among constituents by offering access to resources of economic survival but no freedom from occupation.

That went well enough that I decided to give both shows a shot for 2014.\nI knew LBCC had two shows, but I always ended up at the Fall one. For whatever reason I never could find the time to attend the Spring show. I kinda expected the Expo to be the same size and in the same place as the Con, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\nSince Long Beach is only an hour drive from the house, I decided to set up early. I was surprised that the unloading dock from last year wasn\u2019t available so I parked (having to pay, even as an exhibiter) and went to check things out. From there I discovered why the unloading dock wasn\u2019t available- because the expo was being held in the upstairs section of the convention center (some other event was using the main hall). That seemed a bit weird to me. After making the trek up the stairs I wondered how many people would get lost and give up trying to find the expo.\nAfter getting my badges (at least that part was easy), I had to make the not so fun trek back down in the blazing hot sun to the parking garage, grab all my stuff from the car, and make my way all the way back up to the show floor. Again, NOT FUN.\nThis was the first time I had prints to showcase, so an upside of setting up was discovering the table had room for all the books in addition to the prints binder. VERY COOL!\nAnother downside was the small aisle behind the creators (the back-to-back space). I realized that if I set up my standing banners and wire shelves it would make things difficult for my neighbors and me to move around, not to mention potential claustrophobia status for everyone. To be a good neighbor, I decided against setting up my banners.\nWith set up finished, I shut the studio down and made my way home.\nDay one started off well as I discovered that my friends and fellow convention circuit goers Chris & Chrissy Callahan (RoboChuck) were behind me at a slight angle. Their placement was in a row that was pretty much far off the beaten path, but we all remained hopeful that traffic would make it to them (it didn\u2019t, but more on that later).\nSettling in, I met my neighbors Gavin Andazola (The Stone Legacy) and Rachel Walker (Edge of the World Art) who became great people for conversation in the slow moments of the show day.\nFor a smaller show, traffic was actually pretty decent for a first day. Many postcard flyers were passed out and a few sales were made. The lull periods weren\u2019t too terrible as my myriad of neighbors beside and behind me were awesome to converse with (although many of my neighbors used their standing banners anyway, I was glad I didn\u2019t to become the hub of the socializing circle).\nThere were a lot of cool cosplayers out, some I met at previous shows (and it\u2019s always great to see familiar faces at these events). All in all, Saturday didn\u2019t do gangbuster numbers, but it was good from a promotional stand to get the word out. The last day of the show usually"}

Yes, in most neighborhoods that's why children run with purpose. In parts of Chicago, children run from gunfire. They know the sound. They know they should duck. Kanari Gentry Bowers, 12 years old, is in a West Englewood elementary schoolyard with classmates early Saturday evening when they hear shots. Kanari knows to duck, her uncle says, but the kids scatter. Kanari is struck in the head by a bullet.\n\u2022A half-hour later, members of a family sit in a parked minivan while running an early Saturday evening errand. Nothing could be less remarkable. But it's the Parkway Gardens neighborhood. There is gunfire. The mom in the vehicle asks: Is everyone OK? There is no answer from 11-year-old Takiya Holmes in the back seat. She's been hit in the head by a bullet.\nTwo preteen girls shot in the head in Chicago on a Saturday evening, 4 miles apart in South Side neighborhoods. The horror isn't easy to process. How does this happen? What are the odds? But there is no simple explanation, no pattern behind the coincidence of these separate tragedies. There is, however, an epidemic of gun violence in Chicago neighborhoods that fells victims of every age.\nThe numbers: Last year was the city's bloodiest year for violence in two decades. Chicago had 762 homicides and 4,367 shootings. Of those shot, 76 were children younger than 15 \u2014 three of them fatally \u2014 according to Tribune data. This year, so far, shootings are up 8 percent and homicides down 20 percent; nine children younger than 15 have been shot.\nMuch of the city's gun violence in neighborhoods on the South and West sides traces to gangs and drugs. There are feuds, fights over territory or, we suppose, other motives. Mostly there is indifference to life and the safety of others. Shooters take aim or spray a target zone while on foot or in a vehicle. Anyone within blocks, outside or inside, risks being caught in the crossfire or struck by a stray bullet.\nAs we write, Kanari and Takiya remain in critical condition and police have no one in custody. The girls' families, shocked, sickened, each took time to speak out, with grace and defiance, about the terrible toll of violence not just on their lives but on their communities.\n\"Kids can't even play in a school playground,\" Djuan Donald, Kanari's uncle, said. \"That was my 'moo moo.' That's what we called each other. ... She didn't deserve none of this. I want some answers. Please stop; put down these guns. Ya'll are taking our lives from us. And it hurts. \u2026 Over a piece of street that doesn't belong to you? Ya'll fighting over squads, cliques and gangs?\"\nAnd this from Patsy Holmes, Takiya's grandmother, according to the Sun-Times: \"This has got to stop. These babies are dying, and for what? They was just shooting at someone and that vehicle just happened to catch one of the bullets. We all have to come together as a city and make sure we get this under control because this is getting out of hand.\"\nThey are right about what happened to Kanari and Takiya. And they are right about Chicago. This has got to stop.\nWhen will Chicago keep our children safe?"}

In 2006, Pereira was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence and given a notice to appear in immigration court, but it didn\u2019t include specifics about his hearing. More than a year later, a mailer with that information was sent to him but got returned as undeliverable, and an immigration judge ordered him deported when he didn\u2019t show up.\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, saying a notice that doesn\u2019t list the time and place of a hearing isn\u2019t a notice under the law, and that Pereira was building up time in the country toward his application all the while. Without listing time and place, \u201cthe Government cannot reasonably expect the noncitizen to appear for his removal proceedings,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the majority decision.\nSince the ruling, immigration lawyers have been arguing that the undated notices their clients received in recent years aren\u2019t valid. In some cases, they\u2019re asking for deportation cases to be thrown out entirely, and in others, for a deportation order to be wiped from immigrants\u2019 records so they can get another chance to argue they should be allowed to remain in the country.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really order someone deported for not showing up when you didn\u2019t tell them when to show up,\u201d McKinney said.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, which seeks to carry out deportations for the government, has been pushing back. The agency that forms part of the Department of Homeland Security, has been litigating the issue and appealing judges\u2019 decisions to throw out deportation cases, according to ICE.\nIn a Los Angeles courtroom, immigration judge Lori Bass received so many requests she scheduled up a special hearing to handle them. In Arlington, Virginia, an immigration judge held an impromptu group hearing to address 20 such requests, which accounted for about half that session\u2019s docket, said immigration attorney Parastoo Zahedi.\nJudge Dana Marks, president emeritus of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said a significant number of cases are affected and with judges taking different views the issue will likely wind back up in the courts. In the last month, she said she\u2019s seen about 50 such motions in her immigration court in San Francisco.\nThe ruling\u2019s impact has also stretched beyond the immigration courts. A federal judge in Spokane, Washington dismissed an indictment against 30-year-old farmworker Jose Virgen-Ponce for illegally re-entering the United States after finding he was improperly deported to Mexico two years ago on an incomplete notice."}

DeSmith shone in 29 games for WBS last year, recording a 21-5-3 record with a 2.01 goals against average - which ranked first in the AHL - and a .926 save percentage.\nDeSmith was named to the AHL All-Rookie team and earned a share of the Harry Holmes Memorial Award alongside Tristan Jarry, which recognizes the AHL's best goaltending duo. After spending time in Wheeling and Wilkes-Barre, DeSmith earned his first NHL contract with the Penguins on July 1.\nAntti Niemi being placed on waivers and claimed by the Florida Panthers this week opened the door for DeSmith the opportunity to serve as the Penguins' backup goaltender to Matt Murray.

Now She Can Legally Say She Was Never Prosecuted for It.\nFormer Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer Betty Shelby scored a second legal win last week, when a judge agreed to remove from the public record all documents related to her trial in the shooting death of 43-year-old Terrance Crutcher. Shelby was acquitted in May of manslaughter charges stemming from an encounter with Crutcher in September 2016.\nUnder Oklahoma law, the judge\u2019s decision to expunge her record means Shelby can legally deny she was ever arrested or prosecuted for the shooting, and all records related to the incident will remain under court seal. I talked to Tulsa civil rights attorney J. Spencer Bryan and criminal defense attorney Bob Wyatt to further discuss the law and its implications in such cases.\nI searched for Shelby\u2019s case in Tulsa County\u2019s courts database and found nothing. Now, if asked about Shelby\u2019s arrest and prosecution, the Tulsa police and Tulsa County prosecutor\u2019s office will be obligated to deny it ever happened.\nWill the shooting follow her to her next police gig?\nThat depends where she goes. Police agencies in Oklahoma will still have access to Shelby\u2019s arrest record, but not her court file. Whether out-of-state agencies can see she was arrested depends on whether the data was put into the FBI\u2019s national database, says Shelby\u2019s attorney, Shannon McMurray. State and local authorities cannot share the information, though, and Shelby\u2019s arrest and prosecution won\u2019t appear in court records searches or a criminal background checks, Wyatt says. So a prospective police employer outside the state would have to rely on Shelby and her attorneys for information.\nA few weeks after retiring from the Tulsa PD, Shelby took a volunteer gig at the Roger\u2019s County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2014that was in August, the same month a Washington Post special investigation found that, since 2006, more than 450 officers fired for misconduct have been reinstated or hired by other police departments. Expungements in use-of-force cases, Bryan says, facilitate such transitions.\nCould the Crutcher shooting be used against Shelby in future court proceedings?\nOnly if they are in Tulsa County. If Shelby were to be charged with a crime while working at a department elsewhere, even if the prosecutor could get a judge to grant access to the records, the trial judge would almost certainly not let a jury see them, Bryan says: \u201cIt just adds another layer of hiding an officer\u2019s history from the public.\u201d An individual or an attorney pursuing a civil rights claim against Shelby (as Crutcher\u2019s family is) faces the same obstacles.\nBryan says this is the first he\u2019s heard of an officer seeking an expungement after being acquitted of a crime in Oklahoma, but he\u2019s \u201csure\u201d cops have done it in lower-profile cases. Most states have a process whereby criminal defendants who have been acquitted, had a case dismissed, or have completed probation can have their record expunged, he says.\nWhat about when an officer\u2019s use of force is deemed justifiable by an internal review? Are those records available?\nGenerally, no. In Tulsa, \u201cif there was information contained in the police file, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get it unless you filed a lawsuit and then subpoenaed those records or requested them,\u201d Bryan told me.

He also recommended that the U.S. threaten to attack the Syrian government\u2019s air force and airfields.\nPetraeus said that these moves are needed to counter the Russian government\u2019s recent measures backing the Syrian government, which has been the target of imperialist intervention and of the Islamic State. That conflict has cost hundreds of thousands of Syrian lives and has driven millions from their homes. Petraeus said that U.S. imperialism must vie with both Iran and Russia in Syria, whatever the cost to the people there.\nYes, ex-general, ex-CIA Director Petraeus is indeed a convicted felon. He pleaded guilty in April this year to giving classified information to his biographer. But unlike hero whistleblowers Chelsea Manning \u2014 sentenced to decades in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes in Iraq \u2014 and Edward Snowden \u2014 forced into exile for exposing how U.S. agencies spy on everyone \u2014 Petraeus was let off with a fine and probation.\nThat \u201csteep price\u201d does not include Wall Street\u2019s rich rewards to Petraeus, who was named chair of the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts hedge fund\u2019s KKR Global Institute. Nor does it include lucrative positions at City University of New York, at the University of Southern California and at Harvard.\nUnder the George W. Bush administration, Petraeus commanded the 101st Airborne Division in the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In 2007, he became the commanding general of the Multi-National Force-Iraq. He implemented the infamous \u201csurge,\u201d a big escalation in the U.S. war in Iraq against Iraqi resistance to the occupation. He also oversaw the torture programs at U.S. military prisons in Iraq.\nUnder Obama, Petraeus became commander of the U.S. Central Command, responsible for overseeing wars throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, including Syria, Iraq and Pakistan. In 2011, he was named head of the CIA, a position he held until the scandal broke in late 2012.\nEven following his conviction, Petraeus remains the darling of the militarist politicians and the Pentagon general staff.

Most attend underserved schools and many have personally experienced the struggles of poverty.\n\u201cThey can easily find themselves caught between the expectations of their families and teachers and the desire to fit in among friends,\u201d said Cross.\nThe camp aims to make an impact at a crucial point in students\u2019 lives, added Cross. Research shows that early intervention for middle-schoolers can make a huge impact on their success in high school and likelihood to attend college.\nCamp Launch is designed to spark academic and career interests in STEM fields, with interactive and highly engaging courses that get students tinkering and discovering. In addition to Lego Robotics and Engineering, this year students also had the opportunity to learn about the medical sciences through a new Pre-med course.\nTo complement their STEM studies, students take a Personal Development course that helps them explore their values, goals and interests. Two doctoral students in W&M\u2019s counseling program, Edith Gonzalez and Victor Tuazon, are leading these classes using a curriculum developed by another counseling student and the Center for Gifted Education.\nMaintaining connections with their fellow campers and with Camp Launch staff will be easier for this year\u2019s group of students because at the end of camp, each of them will take home a new tablet computer. Thanks to generous private funding, these tablets will keep students connected to their camp experience and allow them \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to take their learning into their own hands.\nThe camp was originally funded through a grant from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which provided start-up funds and three years of support for the program. Camp Launch also benefits from ongoing in-kind support from participating school divisions, area businesses and the William & Mary community.\nIn 2016, alumni Nancy Briggs Petters \u201981 and Mike Petters M.B.A. \u201993 made a generous $1 million gift that ensured Camp Launch could continue to help students. The private funds have allowed the camp\u2019s directors to broaden the reach of the program and develop new plans for the future.\nCross and Kim are now focused on refining the program\u2019s offerings and expanding the partnerships that will enable them to serve more students.

I am looking forward to the Australian tour. We have enough time for some preparation also before the start of the first Test match. Hopefully, we do not have any injuries before the start of the Test series,\" he said at a pre-tour media conference here.\nQuite typically, Dhoni declined to take too much cognizance of Australia's defeat to New Zealand in the Hobart Test, but rather focus on his team and its preparations.\n\"We have to play to the kind of talent that we have got and do not worry about such things (Australia's loss to New Zealand). We need to work on our strengths and weakness. We are more concerned about where we need to work on and not worry about what kind of opposition we are playing,\" Dhoni asserted.\nThe captain expressed confidence in his bowlers while rejecting the theory that bowling is one of India's major weaknesses.\n\"Our bowlers are talented. Of course, when you do not have your main bowlers, you need a bit of time. Once the youngsters play more and more games, they get experienced at the top levels. I think talent-wise we are there. We have a good exposure for the youngsters who are part of the side now touring Australia,\" he said.\nWhile conceding that there is always scope for improvement in all departments of the game, Dhoni opined that it was part of the process and even the experienced players always looked to improve.\n\"We would like to improve in all the three departments. Catching will be very crucial. Last series that we played in India, we did not have so many catching fielders. We need to have a bit more of them.\n\"They say catches win matches. It is true so that will be one of the areas where we have to work on. On big grounds, running between wickets is also necessary. All these small things help you put pressure on the opposition,\" the skipper said.\nOn a query regarding the England tour that saw the Indian team hit by a lot of injuries, Dhoni said it was different this time around.\n\"If you see the injury list, it is quite blank as of now. More often than not, the 15 or 16 who are in the team will be ready for selection to play. That takes a bit of pressure off and you need not worry about the playing eleven that much as most players get their berths on merit.\n\"Apart from that, the batting line-up is quite the same. Bowling-wise we have got Umesh Yadav, who can bowl at over 140 kmph. I think it looks like a good pack. We need to do well on the field rather than looking at it as to how we look on paper,\" Dhoni said.\nFielding a question on possible \"fireworks\" like the one on the 2008 tour involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds, both of whom will be missing this time around, Dhoni felt that the likes of V"}

Currently names can be put on hold for 60 days without payment, allowing \"speculators\" to shop names around for resale buyers before they even own them.\nBut the proposal also includes a controversial provision that gives special rights to \"famous\" trademark holders around the globe, which observers say could be very problematic.\nThe WIPO report will be passed on to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the nonprofit corporation recognized by the Commerce Department to oversee the technical underpinnings of the Net and to foster competition in the domain name registration market.\nOfficials at WIPO hope the system will be adopted quickly and increase consumer confidence in the Internet as a safe place to do business.\n\"We think the report is, in may ways, the first step toward introducing some order in respect of a practice that we think nobody defended in the course of the whole process,\" Francis Gurry, WIPO assistant director general, told Reuters. \"Everyone agreed that cybersquatting was an abusive practice and was abusive because it was undermining consumer confidence.\"\nCybersquatters were among the first to realize the commercial potential of a Net storefront. Many scooped up valuable names and were able to resell them later for big money. Speculators, on the other hand, have been known to hold thousands of names while they look for buyers and then to let the registrations expire if no one bites.\nA lot of these registrations have led to trademark disputes. Companies from Microsoft to Apple have wrangled with lesser-known entities or individuals over \".com\" names.\nUnder the WIPO proposals all domain name registrants would have to provide accurate contact information so that owners could be reached quickly if a dispute arose over their name.\n\"A domain name should not be activated by a registration authority unless it was satisfied that payment of the registration fee had been received,\" the report also states.\nThis would require the world's primary registrar, Network Solutions (NSI), to dramatically change its registration system.\n\"We received the paper on Friday. We are assessing what the outcome for NSI will be as we speak,\" said NSI spokesman Brian O'Shaughnessy.\nThe WIPO report also calls for owners of \"famous and well-known\" brands to be granted \"exclusions\" so that their name can't be registered by anyone else. The system would be administered by international arbitrators, and complainants could take their cases to court if they were unhappy with the rulings.\nLegal experts agree that the paper is a step in the right direction, but they say the proposed special treatment for famous names is sticky.\n\"[The proposal] will discourage pure speculators,\" said Mark Radcliffe, an attorney with Gray, Cary, Ware & Freidenrich. \"But the famous marks section is very controversial, because how do you tell when a mark is famous internationally?

{"idx": "29675", "prompt": "Continue the following text: An electronic cyberart trend has been bobbing in and out of the video game psyche for the last two decades, and it\u2019s seeing an upswing with modern independent game developers. Games like MirrorMoon EP, Race the Sun, Fract, and Smash Hit have adopted this low-fi movement\u2019s visual genetics and have ensured its influential spread to another generation of players. Like the current explosion of the retro inspired sprite movement, its simplicity makes it convenient for developers working on a small budget looking for a quick turn around from the prototype stage to final product launch. In exchange, it commands an art direction that is purposeful, with an intent that is honestly crafted.\nIt\u2019s a style that gaming culture introduced to mainstream audiences in the early \u201980s, but its exposure was not tied to a video game per say, but more a movie about video games: Tron.\nTron\u2019s legacy is best known as a major introduction of 3D computer graphics technology in feature film special effects. For many, it was also an early glimpse into a new abstract fantasy world of cyber-consciousness, a world where rudimentary electronic building blocks would try to imitate real world objects in electric color. This visual style, however, wouldn\u2019t pick up in video games until at least a decade later, when the capability to create real-time graphics out of primitive 3D polygon models would become more accessible.\nOne of the biggest video game influences of this style came out of Sega\u2019s last big development renaissance in the late 1990\u2019s, with the release of Tetsuya Mizuguchi\u2019s Rez on the Dreamcast. We can cite games that used this art direction before Rez, but these didn\u2019t resonate with developers and players to the same degree. When I ask people to name this visual style, the same two descriptors come out of their mouths: Tron-like and Rez-like.\nCurious about the recent growth of this art style within games, I\u2019ve reached out to four indie developers who have all created vastly different interactive experiences from each other, but whose art direction shares this very distinctive low-fi 3D cyber look \u2014 and asked for their perspectives on this fascinating visual style. In part one we\u2019ll cover a little bit of naming convention and art history, then dive right into the distinctive visual characteristics of this art direction.\nAbove: Oppressive MCP goons in Tron.\nWhile I was digging for information on this style, it surprised me that I did not run into a term for it. Referring to this art style as \u201cTron-like\u201d and \u201cRez-like\u201d is too informal and sloppy. It needs a name. I eventually had to scrape by with a few discussions on the Internet, hoping someone had coined a good name for the style, which also disappointingly fizzled out without a solid recommendation.\nThen I decided to coin a name myself, pieced together with two words that stuck out while combing for a proper term: \u201cDigital Futurism\u201d.\nThose words resonate with what I feel a \u201cTron/Rez-like\u201d art direction is. A few types of Futurism exist, but they all share a key element of being fascinated with the possibilities of forward-thinking designs, architecture, and ideas. Tron also employed several concept artists who were heavily influenced by the look of the original movement, including Syd Mead who is a famous concept artist for other Futurist influenced films such as Alien and Blade Runner (and is coined as a \u201cVisual Futurist\u201d).\nAbove: Syd Mead illustration for U.S."}

Merton, one of the most influential sociologists of the 20th century, whose coinage of terms like ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' and ''role models'' filtered from his academic pursuits into everyday language, died yesterday. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.\nMr. Merton gained his pioneering reputation as a sociologist of science, exploring how scientists behave and what it is that motivates, rewards, and intimidates them. By laying out his ''ethos of science'' in 1942, he replaced the entrenched stereotypical views that had long held scientists to be eccentric geniuses largely unbound by rules or norms. It was this body of work that contributed to Mr. Merton's becoming the first sociologist to win a National Medal of Science in 1994.\nBut his explorations over 70-odd years extended across an extraordinary range of interests that included the workings of the mass media, the anatomy of racism, the social perspectives of ''insiders'' vs. ''outsiders,'' history, literature and etymology. Though carried out with the detachment he admired in Emile Durkheim, the French architect of modern sociology, Mr. Merton's inquiries often bore important consequences in real life as well as in academics.\nHe spent much of his professional life at Columbia University, where along with his collaborator of 35 years, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, who died in 1976, he developed the Bureau of Applied Social Research, where the early focus groups originated. The course of his career paralleled the growth and acceptance of sociology as a bona fide academic discipline. As late as 1939 there were fewer than a 1,000 sociologists in the United States, but soon after Mr. Merton was elected president of the American Sociological Association in 1957, the group had 4,500 members.\nAnother of Mr. Merton's contributions to sociology was his emphasis on what he termed ''theories of the middle range.'' By these he meant undertakings that steered clear of grand speculative and abstract doctrines while also avoiding pedantic inquiries that were unlikely to yield significant results. What he preferred were initiatives that might yield findings of consequence and that open lines of further inquiry. In his own writings he favored the essay form, ''which provides scope for asides and correlatives,'' he said, over the more common and streamlined scientific paper.\nOne early example of such illuminating insight appeared in a paper called ''Social Structure and Anomie'' that he wrote as a graduate student at Harvard in 1936 and then kept revising over the next decade.\nMr. Merton had asked himself what it was that brought about anomie, a state in which, according to Mr. Durkheim, the breakdown of social standards threatened social cohesion. In a breakthrough that spawned many lines of inquiry, Mr. Merton suggested that anomie was likely to arise when society's members were denied adequate means of achieving the very cultural goals that their society projected, like wealth, power, fame or enlightenment. Among the spinoffs of this work were Mr. Merton's own writings on the ranges of deviant behavior and crime.\nA tall, pipe-smoking scholar, Mr. Merton often used the trajectory of his life story, from slum to academic achievement, as material illustrating the workings of serendipity, chance and coincidence, which so long"}

And that message was that gang violence had moved into the upper middle class enclaves of the Island, into the kinds of communities where the locals assume that crime is somebody else\u2019s problem.\nMara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) is unfortunately becoming everybody\u2019s problem. This plague that came to Long Island from El Salvador by way of the streets of Los Angeles follows the same migratory patterns as the Salvadoran immigrant community that it preys upon, fanning out across the United States from ethnic enclaves in California.\nUntil recently, MS-13 wasn\u2019t that big a player in East Coast gang culture. The reason for its weak position in the East Coast crime world was obvious: It wasn\u2019t very well organized. MS-13 was comprised of a group of cliques that operated independently of each other.\nNo more. Law enforcement officials now report that gang members from across the country have come together to unite affiliated groups up and down the East Coast. The leadership for these cliques is now coming from as far away as California and even from El Salvador.\nLos Angeles and New York law enforcement and even politicians are aware of the impact of MS-13 on their streets and on their crime statistics. So they\u2019ve taken action. The results are usually not stellar, but at least these cities have recognized that MS-13 is a problem. Unfortunately, the leadership of MS-13 is not stupid. Once the heat comes down hard in L.A. and New York, they head for new turf, choosing Midwestern and Southern and suburban cities where gangs \u201care not an issue\u201d and local officials and authorities are in denial.\nAnd once MS-13 takes hold in a community, it grows fast. The gang reportedly has some 300 members in suburban Long Island. A few years back it didn\u2019t have any.\nOnce MS-13 shows up on the radar, some local officials and authorities will take action. In Nassau County, for example, a joint gang task force headed by the FBI and comprised of local police departments, has arrested 16 leaders of MS-13. They were charged with two murders, assault, conspiracy, and firearms violations.\nSuch investigations aren\u2019t easy because MS-13 has a pretty strident zero-tolerance policy toward anyone who informs the cops of their activities.\nCourt papers reveal that one of the Nassau County defendants was captured in a secretly recorded telephone conversation detailing how he killed a male victim because he had provided law enforcement officials with information and that he had \u201cput one in his chest and three in the head.\u201d In another recorded conversation, a second defendant said he killed a young female because, in part, she had also provided information to law enforcement.\nThe senseless violence of MS-13 has shocked the local citizens of Nassau County, so the Nassau County Executive appointed a \u201cgang czar\u201d to deal with the increasing gang problem.\nA seasoned, dedicated officer, the new \u201cczar,\u201d in reality, will find it difficult to accomplish what he has been mandated to do. His department, like many across the nation, is at its lowest staffing levels in recent history, and he has been given no additional personnel or resources to combat the problem.

As cities and nation states battle to alleviate poverty, HIV or recession, higher and vocational education is under huge pressure from world governments to play a key role in easing these blazing issues and securing their global position. As global markets develop rapidly, governments perceive that innovation and economic growth will be generated from growing global networks of researchers, students and institutions. But this challenges the traditional roles of universities and colleges and requires these educational institutions to change their purpose and practice of higher education.\nWhen the rest of the world thinks higher education is a solution to today's concerns, British Council thinks no different. British Council believes that international higher and vocational education is critical for the well being and prosperity of nations, institutions and individuals. The British Council authority in the field of international higher and vocational education is helping to shape the future global landscape of the sector by engaging with policy makers, education professionals and key decision makers to contribute to the sector's growth worldwide.\nINSPIRE- International Strategic Partnerships in Research and Education is a British Council funded project that aims to significantly strengthen the academic and research partnerships between the Higher Education Institutions in UK and strategic selection of countries in Central and South Asia (CSA). The principal aim of INSPIRE is to support a transformational increase in the number and scope of Higher Education partnerships between the UK and the Universities in the CSA region. Under its INSPIRE project, British Council sent two delegates, Professor Dr M Muhibur Rahman, Member, University Grants Commission of Bangladesh and Professor Dr M Anwar Hossain, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dhaka University, to an international conference titled ' 5th Going Global Conference 2011'.\nGoing Global Conference attract important figures across the world.\nGoing Global is one of the world's largest international educational conferences attracting policy makers, education professionals and key decision makers from the higher and vocational educational sectors across the world. Usually held in the UK, this time the conference was held in Hong Kong from March 10 to 12, 2011.\nGoing Global Conference 2011 attracted more than 1100 delegates and 15 Ministers of Education, 50 International Vice Chancellors and Presidents and the British Minister for Universities and Science and the conference reinforced British Council's role as a global convenor of real influence. The theme of this year's conference was 'World Education: the new powerhouse?' The sub- themes that were discussed under the main theme were investing for return, regional education hubs, new purposes and universities and colleges.\nThe Going Global Conference 2011 included presentations, debates, discussions, questions and answers sessions by Speakers from different countries. Two plenary and 32 parallel sessions were also held.\nWhen asked what changes could be brought to the education system in Bangladesh to cope with the transition worldwide, the two delegates shared that there are rooms and scopes for modifications in the system. For instance, they talked about outsourcing universities in Bangladesh, like Monash University in Malaysia. They also suggested that Bangladesh Government should increase the percentage allocated for education in the country's yearly budget, build collaborations with universities that will act as a synergy to pull resources, and remodel the existing educational policies.\nThe 6th Going Global Conference will be held in the year 2012 in London.

{"idx": "29694", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The global drugs trade is evolving faster than authorities can cope with and as it spreads to new frontiers, the consensus on how to tackle global drugs trafficking, production and use is increasingly split.\n\"The drug trade is becoming truly more global,\" Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, said. \"New countries have emerged as crucial new demand places. For example Brazil and Argentina arguably now have per capita drug consumption on a par with the U.S.\"\nRussia is still in the midst of \"major heroin epidemic\" that has lasted many years, she said, and China too was \"robustly back\" as a drug-consuming country. Meanwhile, West and East Africa had become the new crossroads in drug trafficking as entry points to the European market and beyond, she said.\nFelbab-Brown added that it is increasingly difficult to achieve a co-ordinated international drug policy.\n\"It's going to be very difficult to imagine how that will [be achieved]. In 2016, the United Nations will once again go through its periodic reviews of drug policy,\" she said.\n\"But beyond that how one deals with supply side and trafficking - there is really not any consensus at all.\" In fact increasingly, the opposite appears to be the case, she said.\nAccording to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and European crime-fighting agency Europol, the annual global drugs trade is worth around $435 billion a year, with the annual cocaine trade worth $84 billion.\nGlobally, organized crime accounts for 1.5 percent of global gross domestic product and is worth around $870 billion and of that, drugs account for 50 percent of international organized crime income.\nProblematically for global authorities, drug markets are extremely fluid and flexible and able to regroup easily elsewhere when the authorities interrupt their networks, Felbab-Brown said.\nMore worryingly, there is little global consensus on dealing with the drugs supply. In Latin American countries such as Uruguay, Guatemala and even Mexico, which struggles with drug- and gang-related crime, governments are considering relaxing their legislation on drugs.\n\"[Drug] flows are going across the world while increasingly the political realities are changing, particularly in Latin America where very different regimes are breaking with the existing global counter-narcotic regimes,\" she said.\nAnn Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium, said that two major shifts had occurred in the drugs trade.\nDrug trade routes had shifted due to interdiction by certain authorities, while uncontrolled synthetic drugs that can be created in labs anywhere are on the rise.\n\"The policy response has been to try to reduce and stop the supply, but all it's done is shift trade or production elsewhere,\" she told CNBC.\nExamples of such shifts are traditional bastions of opium-growing territories shifting from South East Asia to Afghanistan. Elsewhere, cocaine traffickers are now using West Africa to get their drugs to European markets, earning countries like Guinea-Bissau the ignominious title of a \"narco-state.\"\nAt the 2016 UN convention on international drug policy Fordham expected to see a further divergence by global governments over drug policies.\n\"I expect we're going to see a further breaking of the consensus over drugs with more governments shifting direction to the stance taking by some Latin American governments to decriminalize drug use. Other governments, however, such as Russia and China, will continue with their hard-line, zero-tolerance policies.\"\n\"For instance"}

You get searched by the guards, who are straight out of Arstotzka, and they find your USB drives, your memory cards, your tablets, your phones. If they\u2019re locked, they make you unlock them, and hand over your social media passwords to boot.\nMeanwhile, I just carried gigabytes of important documents for the plucky resistance without a second glance. That\u2019s because I created the ultimate physical memory card stash, and played Tetris on it while I waited in line.\nThis is a really simple way to protect your digital information when going across patrolled borders, checkpoints, and anywhere else you can\u2019t trust a USB key or phone to stay safe. It involved opening up a Game Boy cartridge (though any other classic game cartridge with enough space will work), securing a microSD card inside it, and closing it again.\nMicroSD cards are tiny, so you can conceivably hide them anywhere. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be secure, though. Stash them in your shoe, in your wallet, in your pocket; they\u2019ll be found right away. You could crack open any object with enough space to hold the card and screw it shut again, but even then the card is vulnerable. Anything that clearly has a Philips head screw holding it closed can be opened by anyone with a Philips head screwdriver the right size, and you can bet that border guards have screwdrivers.\nThat\u2019s the beauty of using a game cartridge. These are closed using Gamebit fasteners, screws with security heads designed not to be easily opened. Not only will the prodding security officer not likely have a Gamebit driver to open up your cartridge, he probably will assume you don\u2019t, either. For all intents and purposes, that cartridge is a sealed plastic brick.\nSo, naturally, you need a Gamebit. Specifically a 3.8mm Gamebit, which you can find online easily. On its own, a Gamebit is about $9, and you need a bit driver to use it. I prefer to go the professional route with the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit.

It has 3.8 and 4.5mm Gamebits, plus a slew of Torx Security, spanner, JIS, triangle, tri-point, and pentalobe bits (and Philips, hex, and Torx, of course). But for this, you only need the 3.8mm Gamebit.\nTake any Game Boy cartridge and flip it over. Unscrew the single Gamebit and keep track of where you put it.

After demonetisation, it is the backdoor enforcement of Aadhaar identification for children to qualify for midday meals.\nThe move is threatening to take the shape of the next direct conflict between academic policy implementation and the practical problem of unintended consequences on the ground.\nAdded to the mix is the evident violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s orders that Aadhaar cannot be made a mandatory requirement for government welfare schemes.\nWhile midday meals are the most emotive of the schemes to which the unique identification under Aadhaar has been made mandatory, Business Standard has reported that 14 similar notifications have been made under 11 schemes, including schemes involving access to primary and secondary education. Interestingly, the news was broken not in the \u201cmainstream\u201d print media but by online paper Scroll.in.\nEffective July 1, 2017, a student without the Aadhaar ID would not be fed the midday meal given free in school. \u201cIndividuals desirous of availing the benefits under the (midday meal) scheme offered at the schools are required to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar authentication,\u201d reads the gazette notification.\nThis is a disastrous approach. Indeed, there will be arguments for it.

The scheme also provides part-time employment to an estimated 2.53 million workers for implementation of the scheme.\nMidday meals are provided to school children under the food security law, substantially using central government funds granted to state governments and then down to local municipal governments that run schools.\nThe costs are shared broadly in a 60:40 ratio in most states and in the north-eastern states and in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir in a 90:10 ratio.\nCentral government funding in the last Budget for this is a mere Rs 10,000 crore (Rs 100 billion), with a marginal increase of Rs 300 crore (Rs 3 billion) since the last Budget.\nThe idea of a midday meal is to ensure basic nutrition to schoolchildren since it is under-nourishment that essentially leads to lack of absorption of education in formative years.\nThere is no credible and rigorous evidence of any material leakage under the scheme. Every scheme, public or private, will be gamed to see if benefits can be wrongly extracted.\nIf the response to any leakage, real or potential, material or immaterial, is to indulge in carpet-bombing by threatening the"}

The uncertainty of Davis' active status coupled with a finger injury enabled Okafor to crack the team's starting lineup back on Jan. 21 and remain there for nine straight days.\nOkafor, drafted by the 76ers third overall in 2015, responded by averaging 18.2 points and 9.7 rebounds over those nine games before missing two contests with a sprained left ankle. He and Davis started in New Orleans' latest version of the twin towers upon his return on Feb. 12. Okafor then got the start in Saturday's 128-115 home victory over the Los Angeles Lakers while Davis rested on the second night of back-to-back games.\nThe Pelicans said the decision to sit Davis against the Lakers had nothing to do with Los Angeles reportedly being his preferred trade destination. The Lakers made an aggressive push to acquire him at the trade deadline. However, New Orleans wouldn't agree to a deal.\nBut in Davis' absence on Saturday, Okafor scored 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting and blocked a shot in just 13 minutes of action. Now, he'll face the Sixers (38-22) Monday night at the Smoothie King Arena.\nBut Okafor has had more lows than highs since being drafted by the Sixers.\nOne could argue that he would have been better off had they never selected him. The Sixers were the wrong team for him based on both his position and the team's culture at the time.\nBasketball-wise, it didn't make a lot of sense to draft him. The team already had two young promising centers in Nerlens Noel and Joel Embiid.\nOn a team loaded with young guys, he didn't have the veteran teammate who might have steered him to make wiser choices. By his third season, the Sixers decided that Okafor, who had been hampered by knee injuries and defensive woes, wasn't even a rotation player.\nT.J.

They stopped for dinner at an IHOP on the way home. And when they arrived at their apartment building in a quiet residential section of Queens, the narcotics agents following them got a warrant to go inside.\nThey found several suitcases loaded with brick-shaped bundles of what appeared to be heroin. But lab tests determined that most of it - 141 pounds - was pure fentanyl, a synthetic and supremely dangerous opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin.\nIt was the largest fentanyl seizure in U.S. history. There was enough inside the apartment to kill 32 million people, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\nThe married couple who were arrested, Rogelio Alvarado-Robles, 55, and Blanca Flores-Solis, 52, had no criminal record in the United States. They had flown to New York a few weeks earlier with Mexican passports. They had no weapons.\nBut they were drug cartel emissaries, investigators said, sent to broker the sale of tens of millions of dollars' worth of narcotics, like pharmaceutical executives on a business trip.\nDEA agents say recent arrests reflect an emerging pattern, as Mexican trafficking groups attempt to turn New York City into their Northeast distribution hub. They operate with quasi-corporate sophistication and an inconspicuous, transient presence, sending sales teams to deliver staggering quantities of drugs and then quietly disappear.\nThis year, narcotics agents have seized more than 350 pounds of pure fentanyl in New York City, 10 times as much as they did in 2016. A calculated business decision appears to be behind the boom.\n\"The cartels realize that fentanyl is much more profitable than heroin,\" said James Hunt, head of the DEA's New York Division.\nUnlike heroin, whose raw opium base must be collected from poppy growers in remote mountain valleys, fentanyl can be made in clandestine labs using relatively inexpensive chemicals. And because it is so much more potent, it can be diluted with cutting agents to make exponentially more street-level doses, whether in powder form or ersatz pills pressed to resemble brands such as OxyContin and Percoset.\n\"These guys are evil businessmen, but they are still businessmen,\" Hunt said. \"I don't know of any other product where you could invest $3,000 and make millions.\"\nMore than 60,000 people died from overdoses in the United States last year, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and deaths from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl increased fivefold.\nAccording to DEA intelligence gleaned from wiretaps, about 80 percent of the fentanyl seized in the New York area appears to be linked to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. The organization remains North America's dominant trafficking group, even as its leader, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, awaits trial in a maximum-security jail in Lower Manhattan.\nSinaloa's smuggling machine has carried on without Guzman, meaning his legal defense may be funded in part with profits from fentanyl sales made just a few"}

Why did critics turn against him?\nWhat is the most familiar piece of classical music? The most thoroughly roasted chestnut? A piece so overplayed that it has passed into the automatic schlock-recognition zone of every American? Surely it is the final, galloping section of Rossini\u2019s \u201cWilliam Tell\u201d Overture\u2014the Lone Ranger music, the musical image of righteousness on horseback. The music seems almost a joke. But there was one conductor who rode this piece as if his life, and the lives of his players, depended on it.\nI remember my parents calling me out of my bedroom. The year was 1952, so I must have been eight. On our television, a tiny black-and-white screen sunk into a large mahogany console, an old man with a full head of white hair and an elegantly clipped mustache was beating time with his right arm and leading a furious performance of the horse music. I certainly knew the tune (\u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d TV series began running in 1949), but I didn\u2019t know it could sound like this\u2014the skittering string figures played with amazing speed and clean articulation, the entire piece brought off with precision and power, the muscular timpani strokes outlining phrases and asserting a blood-raising pressure under the crescendos. You can easily see this performance right now, exactly as I did, on YouTube: Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony in the televised concert of March 15, 1952. If you listen with good headphones, the sound, though hard-edged, is solid and clear, and the astonishing performance comes through. Toscanini was then two weeks shy of his eighty-fifth birthday.\nFor many years, Arturo Toscanini was the pinnacle of musical excitement for classical-music lovers in this country\u2014and also for many casual listeners, who enjoyed the sensation of having their pulse rate raised. He was at the center of an American experiment in art and commerce that now scarcely seems credible: late in the Depression, in 1937, RCA, which owned two NBC radio networks, created a virtuoso orchestra especially for him, and kept it going until 1954. The NBC Symphony gave concerts in New York that were broadcast on national radio, and then, starting in 1948, on national television.\nRCA hyped Toscanini, and the media responded gratefully, some would say shamelessly: Toscanini was widely profiled and photographed, lionized and domesticated by Life and countless other publications. His NBC years were probably the high-water mark of classical music\u2019s popularity in America. Some of that popularity was doubtless swelled by the excruciating and often condescending music explainers ubiquitous on the radio, in books, in schools, all eager to sell great music to the masses. Still, it was not unusual for earnest middle-class children to struggle with an upright at home, to sing Handel in a school chorus, to play Mendelssohn in the school orchestra. At the time, both amateur and professional musicians, listening to the NBC Symphony broadcasts, did their best to play along.\nRCA issued dozens of recordings made by Toscanini and the orchestra (most of them from broadcasts), as well as selected performances made with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, with Toscanini\u2019s white face and"}

The first Holmes and Watson mystery, A Study in Scarlet, was published in 1887.\nSince then, the inhabitants of 221B Baker Street have remained hugely popular and recent film and television adaptations of the stories have introduced them to a new generation.\nBut there are some Sherlock Holmes fans for whom reading a book or watching a film is simply not enough to satisfy their enthusiasm. The Sherlock Holmes Society has a current membership of almost 1,200 people from all over the world, and many of them spend their free time re-enacting the key moments of their hero's life.\nAnd so this week, more than 70 of them, many aged over 70 themselves, were on a pilgrimage to Meiringen in Switzerland, home of the Reichenbach Falls, and scene of the final struggle between Sherlock Holmes and his arch enemy, the evil Professor James Moriarty, often called \"the Napoleon of crime\".\nConan Doyle couldn't have chosen a more dramatic spot to stage the encounter. The falls plummet 250 metres down into the valley and such is the power of the water that it has created great holes and cavities in the rock.\nAnd the spot where Holmes and Moriarty are supposed to have met - now handily marked with a little statue of the detective - is the most dramatic of all. The water plunges down a full 90 metres.\nOn their pilgrimage, members of the Sherlock Holmes Society are determined to add their own drama to the occasion. The society's president is Guy Marriott, a retired London lawyer, resplendent in the green dress uniform of the King of Bohemia.\n\"The King of Bohemia appears in an early short story called A Scandal in Bohemia. The king employs Sherlock Holmes to recover some compromising photographs of him with an opera singer.\"\nWe each choose the character we like to play, he says. \"I like to dress up so a military uniform really is very suitable.\"\nIn fact, a love of dressing up is something all the Sherlock Holmes Society members clearly share, and since not everyone can be Holmes himself, or Watson, or Moriarty, even the most obscure characters are joining the pilgrimage.\nJonathan McCafferty, a former barrister, has chosen to be Cardinal Tosca. The Cardinal rates just one brief mention in just one Conan Doyle story, but Mr McCafferty sees this as an advantage.\n\"Since nothing whatsoever is known about me other than that I am a cardinal, every other possibility remains,\" he says. \"Whether I was a good cardinal or given to extreme acts of wickedness and mischief is unknown. I favour mischief.\"\nAnd his costume? \"My outfit can best be described by the single word - red.

Southampton back then only had one contribution circuit back to the London PO tower, I\u2019m told there were sometimes occasions when both the BBC and TVS required its use ?\nI grew up with Yorkshire Television and never knew that YTV never broadcast in 405 lines and down converted their 405 signal from 625. I suppose it makes sense as, when they started in 1968, it would have been known that 625 lines was just around the corner. Would this have meant a better quality picture for 405 line viewers?\nAt some point, believe that all 405 line transmitters were fed by a downconverted 625 feed, meaning that YTV would no longer have had to do this.\nSpeaking as an average viewer, no there wouldn't have been much of a discernable difference.\nHowever, speaking as someone who has worked in broadcast technology (on a freelance basis), I can usually tell whether a programme was made in 405 or 625 when watching on one of my restored 405-line sets as I can see the subtle effects of 625-line video interpolated down to 405, whereas no-one would be able to for material originated in 405 (even if the source for a DVD release has been upconverted from 405 to 625 at some point by the archive of the production company and then converted back down to 405 by my Aurora converter).

{"idx": "29716", "prompt": "Continue the following text: When I was in training to be a psychologist, I never imagined that my work would come to focus so often on helping teenagers who are facing grievous loss. But death intrudes on adolescence far more than one might expect and while some of the difficulties these teenagers confront can be readily anticipated, others are so specific to the experience of being a teenager that adults can easily overlook them.\nAlmost any widow can attest that within a year after her spouse\u2019s death, a surprising number of acquaintances start acting as if she were never married at all. Like adults, adolescents tend to move on quickly from other people\u2019s losses, but time moves faster for teenagers. When I\u2019m talking with a grieving teenager, perhaps one whose mother died only three months ago, I\u2019ve stopped assuming that her weary eyes and hard-set jaw are the outward signs of pure sadness. I know that can also be the look of a teenager gearing up to tell me about the misery and aggravation of sitting through an entire lunch period listening to her friends gripe about their own mothers. Three months ago hardly appears in even the kindest teenager\u2019s rear view mirror.\nThough the reality of death sinks in slowly for anyone who is bereaved, it also unfolds differently for adolescents. I was a rookie psychologist, fresh out of graduate school, when a senior colleague encouraged me to work with the assumption that all teenagers secretly fear that they\u2019re crazy. The comment surprised me at the time, but I\u2019ve come to believe that it\u2019s true. Parents aren\u2019t alone in wondering how their rational fifth grader evolved into an eighth grader who easily becomes unglued. Teenagers notice their own instability and worry about what it means.\nLike grieving adults, bereaved teenagers can find themselves reaching for the phone to call or text someone who has recently died. For grown-ups, these are painful, poignant moments. For teenagers, these moments are also painful and poignant. But they can be scary too. When I\u2019m with teenagers who are in mourning, I look for openings \u2014 the confession of numbness, or disbelief that the death has really happened \u2014 to point out the good health in their distortions and help them recognize and appreciate their adaptive psychological defenses. I say: \u201cThis is your mind doing its job to protect you, to keep you from becoming overwhelmed. A brilliant, invisible system allows you to be in touch with your loss for as long as you can manage, then sets it aside and saves it for later. You can count on your instincts to get you through this.\u201d Done right, such comments can help grieving teenagers feel better, not worse, about the hidden workings of their minds.\nGrief is isolating for everyone, but especially so for teenagers. At 45, I can turn to my mother for comfort when I learn of a friend\u2019s death. At 16, the same impulse would have run against my need to hold her at a distance. Had I given in, let my adolescent self seek my mother\u2019s support, I certainly would have pushed her away before the moment became more babyish than I could stand . I would have told her that I was fine, told her to leave me alone, even if I was still miles from feeling O.K.\nAnd grieving teenagers can\u2019t always lean on their friends, either. When teenagers mourn in groups over the loss of one of their own, they can have a hard time being gentle and generous with one another. Unlike adults, most teenagers are still figuring out how they fit into their social"}
{"idx": "29717", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Reaching milestones tracks your marketing progress.\n3 What Are the Most Important Project Closure Activities?\nThe typical life cycle of a business project includes several key milestones that mark significant points in the process. Although the specifics of various projects differ, many of the critical points are similar, whether you're managing the development of a new software program or constructing a building. These checkpoints in the planning, building and completion stages help you determine if the project is on track.\nAll projects have a work plan that lays out the specific steps and actions that are necessary to complete the project. By choosing specific steps in that plan as your key milestones, you are able to keep track of your progress toward completion. You likely know the end date or expected delivery date for the project, but you'll want to track your progress throughout the project. Assigning specific completion dates for each milestone helps you determine if you are staying on track to meet the final deadline. Without milestones built into the work plan, you may not realize until it's too late that you won't finish on time.\nThe ends of each phase of the project create natural milestones for tracking purposes. For example, a software-development project typically includes planning, developing, testing and deploying the software. The end of each phase represents a pivotal stage in the project. Another way to identify the key milestones is to examine the plan to determine which actions are required before the next step is possible. In a construction project, the foundation must be completed before the walls can go up. You may need to pass certain inspections during the construction process before you are able to move forward. Look for the critical actions that play a pivotal role in keeping the project moving as your milestones.\nThe identified milestones need an assigned completion date to monitor your progress. Calculate the total amount of time available for the project. Look at each section of work leading up to each milestone so you are able to estimate how long it should take to complete. Use this information to divide the total project time among each of the milestones. Calculate the due dates for each milestone based on the time allotted.\nThe milestones themselves won't keep your project on track. You need to regularly monitor the project activities and compare them with your milestones to ensure your employees are staying on track. If you find the project falls behind or you begin missing key milestones, evaluate where the project is falling off course. If you aren't able to extend the project's timeline, determine how you can make up ground to get back on track.\nFrost, Shelley. \"Key Milestones in Projects.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/key-milestones-projects-34472.html.

You might also think that these are the kinds of things that a person can do. However, you might not think of chimpanzees as persons.\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project does. Since 2013, the group has been working on behalf of two chimpanzees, Kiko and Tommy, currently being held in cages by their \u201cowners\u201d without the company of other chimpanzees. It is asking the courts to rule that Kiko and Tommy have the right to bodily liberty and to order their immediate release into a sanctuary where they can live out the rest of their lives with other chimpanzees.\nThe problem is that under current United States law, one is either a \u201cperson\u201d or a \u201cthing.\u201d There is no third option. If you are a person, you have the capacity for rights, including the right to habeas corpus relief, which protects you from unlawful confinement. If you are a thing, you do not have the capacity for rights. And unfortunately, even though they are sensitive, intelligent, social beings, Kiko and Tommy are considered things under the law.\nIn response, the Nonhuman Rights Project is taking a bold position: It is arguing that if every being must be either a person or a thing, then Kiko and Tommy are persons, not things. I agree, and many other philosophers do, too.\nIn February, a group of philosophers, including me, submitted an amicus curiae brief to the New York Court of Appeals in support of legal personhood for Kiko and Tommy. (Members of the group contributed to this article as well.) The court is considering whether to allow the case to proceed.\nThe idea of nonhuman personhood might seem confusing at first, since we tend to use the terms \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d interchangeably. But they are not equivalent. \u201cHuman\u201d is best understood as a biological concept that refers, at present, to a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens. In contrast, \u201cperson\u201d is best understood as a moral and legal concept that refers to an individual who can hold moral and legal rights.\nThe question, then, is: If \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d are not interchangeable, why might someone think that only humans can be persons?\nOne view is that only humans can be persons because humanity is the basis of personhood. However, this view is implausible. There is nothing special about species in and of themselves. They are morally arbitrary taxonomic categories. There is a great deal of variability within species, similarity among species and change in species over time.\nWhen we think about the basis of our own personhood, we do not think about how we happen to be classified in a biology textbook. Instead, we think about features of our lives such as conscious experience, emotionality, a sense of self and bonds of care and interdependence. When it comes to whether one should be treated as a person or a thing, these kinds of features, and not their genetic bases or evolutionary histories, are what matter. This is why we can all know that we have rights without having to check our genes.\nAnother view is that only humans can be persons because only humans have the ability to use language and reason in abstract and sophisticated ways.

See more from the 2019 Index.\nLaos\u2019s economic freedom score is 57.4, making its economy the 110th freest in the 2019 Index. Its overall score has increased by 3.8 points, with a significant increase in trade freedom and higher scores for government spending, fiscal health, labor freedom, and property rights far surpassing a decline in business freedom. Laos is ranked 24th among 43 countries in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, and its overall score is below the regional and world averages.\nThe government professes a desire to achieve upper-middle-income status by 2030, but the business environment remains opaque. Politically connected vested interests block entry into some sectors, and actions to increase state control (for example, by reducing land concession tenures) do not inspire investor confidence. Deeper institutional and systemic reforms are needed to overcome such obstacles to economic freedom as weak property rights, pervasive corruption, burdensome bureaucracy, and government interference and regulatory controls.\nRead more about Laos Economy.\nLaos is a one-party state. The Communist government took power in 1975 and destroyed the economy in the early years of its rule. Minimal liberalization to advance its \u201cstate-managed, market-orientated economy,\u201d begun in 1986, has yielded some progress, but civil liberties remain heavily restricted. The National Assembly elected 79-year-old Bounnhang Vorachith to a five-year term as president of Laos and general secretary of the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party in 2016. Approximately 80 percent of the rural population works in subsistence farming. The economy relies heavily on such capital-intensive natural resource exports as copper, gold, and timber. It also has benefited from high-profile foreign direct investment in hydropower dams along the environmentally sensitive Mekong River.\nProtections for property rights are weak, titles are unclear, and some areas practice communal titling. The judicial system is inefficient, underdeveloped, corrupt, and controlled by the ruling party. Corruption and graft are often found among government officials in Laos. Despite passage of several anticorruption laws, enforcement remains weak, and no high-profile cases have ever been brought to trial.\nThe top personal and corporate income tax rates are 24 percent. Other taxes include vehicle and excise taxes. The overall tax burden equals 12.8 percent of total domestic income. Over the past three years, government spending has amounted to 22.1 percent of the country\u2019s output (GDP), and budget deficits have averaged 4.0 percent of GDP. Public debt is equivalent to 62.8 percent of GDP.\nThe poor regulatory infrastructure continues to impede private-sector development. The labor market does not promote flexibility or economic diversification and does not provide dynamic employment opportunities for the growing labor supply. The government influences many prices through subsidies and state-owned enterprises to advance its socialist \u201cstate-managed, market-orientated economy,\u201d especially in the hydropower and mining sectors.\nThe combined value of exports and imports is equal to 75.8 percent of GDP.

I explained why and she told me that her then 15-year-old son had recently had corrective surgery on his spine due to his scoliosis.\n\u201cI thought I had left it far too late for surgery but she advised me to look into it and gave me the name of a fantastic surgeon based at the Northern General Hospital.

The district attorney did so.\nBut the district again refused to make them public and filed suit against the pair. District officials said then, and reiterated Friday, that they were seeking clarity from the courts, not trying to be vindictive to people seeking public records.\nFriday, Multnomah District Judge Judith Matarazzo provided that clarity. From the bench, she verbally granted the two women's legal motions. She ordered the school district to make public a document showing the names of employees on leave and the date the leave began.\nDisclosure of the records is important, Sordyl said, because administrative leave is intended to be a short short-term paid exile while allegations against an employee are checked. The district normally is forced to pay both the employee on leave and a second person to do the employee's work while he or she is away.\nA well-run human resources shop would quickly complete an investigation and clear the employee to return to work or else demote or terminate him or her, Sordyl said. Instead, under the leadership of former top HR attorney Stephanie Harper, she said, the district let accused employees languish on expensive paid leave for as long as three years.\nSlovic, first at Willamette Week, then at The Portland Tribune, exposed paid administrative leaves for educators that stretched longer than two years.\nSordyl said release of the records will benefit the public. \"They will gain transparency. It will also prompt the district to start handling their HR issues in a timely manner instead of paying two people to do one job.\"\nMatarazzo is expected to issue a written ruling next week, said Jeff Merrick, attorney for Sordyl.\nSlovic declined to comment and said her attorney was unavailable Friday afternoon.\nThe school district, meanwhile, is already preparing the records for release, spokesman Harry Esteve said.\nJulia Brim Edwards, the school board chair who took office last July, said via email, \"This lawsuit was yet another issue left over from the previous district administration.

It was a heroic effort demanding great courage from hundreds of thousands of young Americans. It was also a tragic mistake that ended because of the courageous stand against it taken by hundreds of thousands of young Americans. Kerry represents both sides of this awkward equation. He won five decorations for injury and heroism, but then became its antithesis as spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.\nIn Bush's case, there's also the touchy little matter of what happened after April 1972, when he seemed to have disappeared, with two years of his Guard duty still to go. Apparently he got permission to move to Alabama in order to work on the Senate campaign of one of his father's friends. There is no record of him reporting for duty there. By this time young Bush was a fully trained Air Force pilot, having completed the mandatory two-year training program, yet at this point he let his pilot status lapse. More than a year later -- some eight months before his Guard commitment was up -- Bush received an honorable discharge, just in time to start Harvard Business School.\nShould we care? Unequivocally, yes. Presidential elections are mostly about character, not ideology. No one who reaches late middle age is exactly the same person he was in his early 20s, but the tendencies that mark the passage from youth to adulthood can provide important information about later behavior. That Bush used family connections to get into the National Guard and then apparently left when it suited him suggests a pattern of evasion or indifference that would repeat itself in later years.\nWhich brings us to the second aspect of Vietnam that most Americans would prefer to forget, but which Bush perfectly exemplifies. Beginning about 40 years ago, the U.S. government lied repeatedly to Americans about the danger North Vietnam and the Vietcong posed to American security, trumping up a casus belli in the Gulf of Tonkin. Vietnam thus marked the beginning of a four-decade-long plunge in Americans' trust of our government.\nAs president, Bush has replicated this sordid history. He lied about the danger Saddam Hussein posed to American security and came up with his own trumped up \"weapons of mass destruction.\" Invading Iraq to stop global terrorism has been as disconnected from the goal as sending Americans to Vietnam to stop global communism. As it did in Vietnam, the war in Iraq drags on without a clear vision of what we ultimately want to achieve there. We don't have the slightest idea how to establish a democracy that will ally itself with the United States in years ahead; we don't even know how to extricate ourselves from the morass without unleashing a vicious tribal war. And as was the case 40 years ago, much of the rest of the world is appalled by America's shoot-first, ask-questions-later belligerence.\nThe radical conservatives in the Bush administration who pushed the United States into Iraq were intent on erasing the legacy of America's impotence and humiliation in Vietnam. Yet they are in the process of re-creating it. And in so doing they are resurrecting the memories of Vietnam.\nThe two men who are likely to square off against each other in November represent the best and the worst of that national nightmare. Republicans are fond of equating themselves with patriotism, but there's little doubt which of these two men defines the term."}

The part obviously went to Jude Law, but it appears that Reeves almost signed on.Keanu fans have been wanting to see him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years now and have been expressing their desires on social media. And why not? The actor would make for a great addition to the MCU in just about any capacity. However, the actor has his own John Wick franchise, which fans are just as excited about.\nWhile fans want to see Keanu Reeves in the MCU, that can still happen at some point down the line. MCU Phase 4 will begin with Spider-Man: Far From Home, so there's going to be a lot of new characters that will need to be cast. With that being said, seeing Reeves in Captain Marvel would have been pretty badass. Charles Murphy says that it was almost a reality. He explains.\n\"If not for John Wick 3, he'd have been Yon-Rogg. He was set to take the role and then, when he had to drop out, they moved SUPER QUICK on Jude Law.\"\nJude Law was a great choice to take on the role of Yon-Rogg, though his character has not been officially confirmed at this time. Law and Brie Larson have an excellent chemistry, which is clearly visible in the trailers that we have seen for Captain Marvel. The movie is now less than a month from hitting theaters, so we'll have a much better idea about Law's performance and whether or not Keanu Reeves could have done a better job soon.\nAs for Keanu Reeves, the first trailer for John Wick 3 was recently released and Wick fans were pleasantly surprised with what they saw. Director Chad Stahelski promised that the third installment will be much bigger and bloodier than the previous installments, and he was not kidding. The trailers show that the director delivered on his promise. Both Stahelski and Reeves have ideas to keep the franchise moving forward, so it might be hard to nail the actor down for a future in the MCU if the John Wick franchise keeps building on its success.\nCaptain Marvel hits theaters on March 8th, while John Wick 3 debuts on May 17th, a few weeks after Avengers: Endgame lands. It's going to be a crazy year for Brie Larson, who stars in both of the next MCU projects and Keanu Reeves, who is reportedly getting ready to jump into the long-awaited Bill & Ted 3. Reeves and Alex Winter have stated that production on the sequel is supposed to start early this year, which would mean that it has to happen soon, especially is they are going to make that holiday 2019 release window that has been hinted at.

But despite decades of trying, scientists have failed to capture a single speck of dark matter, in part because they don\u2019t have a clear idea of what it actually is.\nBut what if the solution to the mystery of dark matter is that dark matter doesn\u2019t actually exist? What if this ghostly stuff is just a phantom of astronomers\u2019 imaginations? Could there be another answer to the puzzles dark matter was invoked to solve?\nSince the 1930s, astronomers have suspected that galaxies contain more mass that we can account for. That\u2019s because, when astronomers clock the speed of stars circling around the center of the Milky Way and of galaxies moving in distant clusters, they all seem to be going too fast. They are going so fast that they should overtake the force of gravity tugging them inward and fly out into the void beyond. Yet something holds them back.\nThat \u201csomething,\u201d most astronomers believe, is dark matter: matter we can\u2019t see yet which has enough mass to keep those speeding stars in stable galactic orbits. But what is dark matter? Scientists have largely ruled out all known materials. The consensus is that dark matter must be a new species of particle, one that interacts only very weakly with all the known forces of the universe except gravity, with which it interacts as strongly as ordinary matter does. Dark matter is invisible and intangible, its presence detectable only via the gravitational pull it exerts.\nMOND ). The assumption is that at large scales, the laws of gravity are different from Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. \u201cMOND merely tweaks the way a known force, gravity, works\u2014we don\u2019t have to accept that the universe is filled with invisible mass,\u201d McGaugh said.\nHowever, critics point out that dark matter beats out MOND on other astronomical puzzles. \u201cThe biggest problem is perhaps clusters of galaxies\u2014though MOND works well in individual galaxies, it doesn\u2019t fit clusters terribly well,\u201d McGaugh said.\nSkeptics of MOND, however, point at the Bullet Cluster , two colliding clusters of galaxies. There is a clear separation of luminous and unseen matter seen there exactly matches what one would expect with the dark matter model\u2014dark matter, being largely intangible even to itself, would \u201cfeel\u201d the forces of the collision very differently than ordinary matter. MOND advocates say that although unseen matter could be involved, it might again be unseen forms of ordinary matter .\nMaps of the cosmic microwave background\u2014radiation left over from the Big Bang\u2014also provide strong support for dark matter. Temperature aberrations seen in the cosmic microwave background seem to reflect the presence of both ordinary matter, which interacts with both matter and radiation, and dark matter, which influences matter but is essentially invisible to radiation.\nSo MOND advocates have a difficult task: Their theory must explain all the puzzles that dark matter has already solved, and it must present a new way of accounting for everything Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity currently explains. For instance, general relativity proposes that matter and energy curve spacetime, creating the effect we know of as gravity. Massive bodies curve spacetime enough to visibly bend light, an effect known as gravitational lensing that astronomers have witnessed for decades. \u201cWe cannot explain the phenomenon of gravitational lensing without general relativity, and this is where MOND spectacularly fails,\u201d Natarajan said.\nThis is the first"}

The face of a little girl he witnessed during the devastation of that day haunted him in his dreams.\nIt turns out, Zimmermann\u2019s fellow Army veterans were experiencing the same mysterious symptoms and over a two-year stretch, several people in his unit took their lives.\nZimmermann, 47, understands why, at points in his own struggle, he\u2019s stared down into the same dark place.\nTwo years ago, Zimmermann just happened to visit a traveling military memorial that stopped near his Minnesota town. The Eyes of Freedom features 23 life-size portrait of the fallen Lima Company marines, an Ohio marine reserve unit among the hardest hit in the Iraq War.\nOvercome with emotion after seeing the faces of the fallen, he turned to leave, but was stopped by Mike Strahle, a Marine veteran in charge of taking the Eyes of Freedom memorial from state to state. Strahle narrowly survived the roadside bomb that killed many of his fellow Lima Company marines.\nHe saw a familiar sorrow in Zimmermann\u2019s eyes that day, and struck up a conversation with him. Their friendship was born in the presence of those paintings.\n\u201cWe have got so many veterans are choosing the wrong way out, that\u2019s a tragedy in of itself. Meeting Brian and hearing Brian\u2019s story was, I guess, the final straw,\u201d said Strahle.\nStrahle introduced Zimmermann to the artist who spent several years painting the Eyes of Freedom memorial, Anita Miller, 57, of Lyons, Colorado.\nMiller was seeking a subject for her next project.

I said I would have done anything to help them, and then she said, 'You have to do this,'\u201d said Zimmermann.\nThat day, he made her a promise, despite his own despair, he would live to see the project through.\nMiller met Zimmermann on a trip home to visit family in her native state of Minnesota, and spoke to him often by phone.

Leading the charge in the circa-\u00a31000 market comes Epson with its feature-rich TW2900, a no-nonsense projector that tries to take the fear out of huge home cinema.\nIt does that primarily with a novel lens shift system. Two manual levers sit above the lens - play around with them to create a huge (up to 300-inch) and accurate image on a screen or wall even if the TW2900 itself is placed well off-centre. It makes it possible to consider placing it on a small table or shelf, though its meaty dimensions probably preclude the latter option.\nSmall projectors can often be hot and noisy, problems that the TW2900 skillfully avoids despite its high brightness (1600 ANSI lumens) that allows it to be used in less-than-blackout conditions.\nImage-wise, the TW2900 is a good value performer. Using 3LCD tech, it's fitted with an all-new D7 panel and features a 10-bit Pixelworks video processor alongside a feast of connectivity options. A couple of HDMI inputs seems reasonable at this price, especially since a games console can be hooked-up via its Component video input. Also available on the TW2900's rear are ports for S-Video, Composite video and a D-Sub 15-pin input for a PC. Also back there is a RS-232 port so control of the TW2900 can be built into expensive \"one button\" home cinema control systems from the likes of Crestron and AMX. You know the kind of thing - press \"movie\" and the blinds fall, the lights dim and the movie starts playing.\nBack in the real world, the TW2900 makes a good stab at Blu-ray, showing more than enough detail and sharpness from Full HD sources to make movies very enjoyable. We've seen other projectors draw out more detail - and produce a more contrast-heavy picture - but not at this low price.\nBrighter fare is handled supremely well, and aside from occasional blur and flicker over tiny moving objects, the picture is excellent; colours are rich and close-ups of people realistic. It's all very cinematic, but it could do with a slightly smoother feel.\nIt's the kind of picture you'd find selling for over \u00a32,000 barely a year ago, though Epson is by no means alone in issuing value-busting Full HD 1080p models.\nIf the TW2900's price and lack of pure brilliance makes it well suited to the mass market, there is a nod to home cinema nuts with bigger ambitions. Just like the Philips 21:9 LCD TV we've reviewed previously, the TW2900 can be adapted to watch Cinemascope-size movies (also called letterbox or anamorphic 2.35:1) via a special anamorphic wide mode, though for that you will need to buy a third party anamorphic lens. These go for at least a few grand, and if you're prepared to spend that much, it's probably best to go for a higher-end projector, too.\nWhat the TW2900 lacks in perfect contrast and detailing it"}
{"idx": "29755", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Palo Alto, California to require EV charging infrastructure in new homes.\nShould Governments Require Every New Home to Be Wired for Electric-Car Charging?\nPalo Alto officials say it costs far less to pre-wire a new home for electric-car charging than it does to add that wiring after that house is built.\nTo some, it\u2019s a classic case of liberal big-government overreach. To city officials in Palo Alto\u2014home to Tesla Motors and a longtime electric-vehicle hotspot\u2014it\u2019s common sense.\nAs the Palo Alto Daily News\u2019 Jason Green reported, the Palo Alto City Council voted 9-0 last week to draw up an ordinance requiring every new single-family home to come pre-wired for electric-vehicle chargers. That means adding the necessary circuitry for residents to install a 240-volt \u201clevel 2\u201d charging station, as opposed to simply plugging their electric cars into a standard household socket. The former is significantly faster and more efficient.\nSo should it be legally mandated? To conservative critics, policies like Palo Alto\u2019s smack of \u201cpicking winners\u201d in the technology industry, rather than letting the free market sort it out. One can imagine how angry liberals would be if some Republican city council mandated that new homes come equipped with the necessary infrastructure for a petroleum gas station in the garage.\nIn fact, though, residential car charging is far more feasible, given that homes already tap into the grid for electricity. Adding the wiring for electric-vehicle charging would tack on only about $200 to the cost of a new single-family home, the city\u2019s staff estimates. In a city where the median home price tops $1.5 million, that\u2019s a vanishingly small sum. And here\u2019s the logic that attracted the city council: It\u2019s much easier to pre-wire a house for electric-car charging than it is to retrofit a house once it\u2019s built. The latter can cost four times as much, and might deter a lot of people from getting an electric car.\nFor a city like Palo Alto, the policy seems to make economic sense. It\u2019s full of residents who want to be green and have money to spare, but lack the appetite for more radical environmentally friendly policies, like high-density housing or public transit infrastructure. If you\u2019re going to keep building single-family homes, a nudge here or there to encourage those homeowners to drive electric cars seems like the least you could do to minimize the environmental impact. Besides, the city\u2019s public charging stations are already in high demand. The proposed ordinance would offload some of the supply burden onto the city\u2019s wealthiest new residents.\nMeanwhile, as plugincars.com notes, Palo Alto\u2019s ordinance would dovetail with a pair of pending statewide bills that would require similar pre-wiring in new businesses, shopping centers, and apartment complexes. If approved, those would help set up the state to continue to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption. Already, sales of the pricey Tesla Model S have outstripped those of several other major luxury car makers in California. More affordable plug-in cars like the Nissan Leaf also see their greatest sales figures in California.\nIn the worst-case scenario for Palo Alto and California, demand for electric cars fizzles for some reason, the city and the state will be left with a bunch of charging stations that almost no one uses, and a bunch of homeowners and businesses will have wasted a few hundred bucks. In the best case, electric cars turn out to"}

Both have contributed greatly to movie history, particularly in the sci-fi genre. Where would we be today without Scott's Alien and Blade Runner, or without Cameron's Aliens and the first two Terminator films?\nCurrently in the making is Scott's upcoming film adaptation Forever War, which is based on the 1974 award-winning science fiction novel written by Joe Haldeman. It tells the tale of an interstellar war between humans and the enigmatic Tauran species. The book offered a mix of action and and in-depth storytelling, dealing with such things as the inhumanity of war, the bureaucracy that goes with it, and notions of time/space travel.\nAnd, to bring all that to life onscreen, Scott is looking to follow in the technological footsteps of James Cameron's Avatar.\nI'm filming a book by Joe Haldeman called Forever War. I've got a good writer doing it. I've seen some of James Cameron's work [on Avatar], and I've got to go 3D. It's going to be phenomenal.\nIt's interesting to see one legend of the film world being inspired by another. It certainly seems like Scott misses the good old days of filming on the Alien ship Nostromo, or shooting Harrison Ford in the 2019 dystopian Los Angeles of Blade Runner. Cameron clearly has something rather special up his sleeve with Avatar, and I am ultra-curious to find out just how that one turns out.\nBut as far as Forever War goes, it seems like a plot cut very much from the same science fiction cloth as Avatar. Although not too similar as to mistake one for the other, it still takes place in space and both will undoubtedly have copious amounts of special effects. Of course, it's been said that Forever War (the book) was meant to reflect upon Joe Haldeman's service in Vietnam through a \"space opera filter.\" It'll be interesting to see how that \"reflection\" translates to a big-screen sci-fi epic.\nSimilarities aside, any excuse for Scott to get back to his science fiction roots is a welcome one in my books. He created his best work while working in the sci-fi genre, and with some original source material to build off of (although I wonder just who that \"good writer\" is that will be adapting the script), and the fact that Scott is to go the 3D route, Forever War could turn out to be something pretty great."}

The idea was to use a cell phone to call the Cohens\u2019 landline, posing as Cohen\u2019s teammate Dominic, using Dominic\u2019s caller I.D.

I tried to \"be cool\" with them, I tried to bribe them. Finally, I tried to \"get on their level.\"\nOne student didn't feel like taking notes and started protesting before they snapped at me, saying something I took to be rude. Instead of trying to diffuse the situation, I made some not-very-clever, wannabe-snappy comeback. The student turned red, eyes watering, and stormed out.\nLater, when I went to debrief the day with my vice principal, I told him how mad the student had made me and how I didn't want to be disrespected.\nHe listened thoughtfully and empathetically. Then, he said, \"I get where you're coming from. You shouldn't have to be disrespected. What you do need to remember, though, is that you are the adult in the room. At the end of the day, you model and create the boundaries of what respect looks like for you and your students. If you model respect, you'll get respect back, but you're in a much better place to find that respect, even when it's hard, than a group of teenagers.\"\nI blinked at him, realizing that I had never clearly understood that concept before.\nThen, I hung my head in shame.\nYes, being disrespected by a student felt frustrating and hurtful, but I was also older, (seemingly) wiser, and had a lot less to deal with than my students.\nWhat I realized was that I had spent years learning how to be a peer to other kids, not learning to lead and guide them with love. That would take time, work, and the understanding that love doesn't always mean letting kids do what they want in the moment, because they're still developing. Ultimately, I'm the adult in the room, and that means it's my charge to ensure my students make thoughtful choices and see me model my best self in any given situation.\nThis is the story that keeps coming to mind as I read and watched the events that took place between Nathan Phillips and the students of Covington Catholic High School.

Our reliance on FBR needs reduction and greater resource generation by the province should be the number one priority. He stated said that he wants technology to be introduced in departments to help reduce expenditures and convert governmental assets into revenue. He further stated that he wants to introduce E-Procurement into departments so that there is less human intervention and expects the same in PRA. He also shed light on the austerity measures taken by the government and stressed the need for reduction in its expenditures in order to increase revenue.\nDr. Hafeez Pasha in his remarks said PRA is far ahead in its performance and has the capability to generate huge revenue compared to FBR. Though the law and order situation due to the War on Terror and the power crisis brought a downfall in the growth rate of the economy of the nation as well as the province but now the environment is conducive to stabilize its economy through better planning and adaptive measures.\nThe seminar was organized by PRA in collaboration with GIZ and was attended by dignitaries from various renowned multinationals including Ufone, Telenor, PTCL, Mobilink, Zong , Honda Altas along with researchers from ICAP. The members of panel discussion also included Hamid Yaqoob Sheikh (Finance Secretary Punjab), Naeem Sheikh (Ex-President ICAP), Hafeez Pasha (Ex Federal Minister), Javed Ahmed (Chairman PRA), Nasir Salam (Tax Director Mobilink) & Stephen Shield ( Global director ACCA), Tayyab Hussain ( Honda Altas).\nThe purpose of arranging the pre-budget seminar was to bring all the stake holders on one platform in order to share views before finalizing the budget. During the seminar some reservations and apprehensions were raised and discussed paving the ground for formulation of a consensus- oriented and progressive budget. The recommendation from panelist included standardization of tax rate in telecom sector as well as greater focus on agriculture sector.\nIn his address, Chairperson PRA, Javed Ahmed stated that PRA is working on plans to broaden its tax base while extending its outreach and providing taxpayers better facilities.\nHe stated that PRA shall also be working on plans to achieve risk based audits and expects it to adapt to a full automation monitoring system in the form of eIMS (Electronic Invoice Monitoring System) for different services similar to its successful Restaurant Invoice Monitoring System (RIMS). He also said that PRA is working on the full digitization of Punjab Revenue Authority as this is the only solution to curb corruption and hopes to move towards negative list for sales tax on services in order to simplify understanding and compliance of the law and eliminate anomalies. PRA managed to achieve a record Rs.109 Billion in FY 2017-18 and expects to achieve this year\u2019s target."}

The two great populist currents of the moment \u2014 really a single current with two faces, Donald Trump\u2019s and Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u2014 are resolutely opposed to free trade. Mrs. Clinton, a sometime supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration during her service as secretary of state, is walking sideways away from it.\nBut there is a problem with the Goldberg Treaty, which is that most of the relevant barriers to trade are not, contra Trump et al., tariffs. Nor are they quotas or other explicitly trade-inhibiting policies, though these do exist and so require liberalization. In truth, countries such as China do not for the most part apply extraordinary tariffs to U.S. goods, and such tariffs as they do apply have been reduced in recent years, not as the result of any get-tough trade policy pursued by the United States but because of the complaints of Chinese consumers, who may spend their lives immersed in nationalist propaganda but who still do not enjoy paying artificially high prices for household goods. Beijing recently cut the tariff on imported cosmetics, proof again that the two most dangerous places to stand are between a politician and a microphone or between a woman and her favorite lipstick.\nMore typical are the difficulties that U.S. automakers have had in cracking the Japanese market. Japan has no import duties on automobiles, but U.S. makers complain of other problems, particularly the difficulty of establishing dealer networks to help them connect with potential Japanese buyers. The relevant laws are complex, they are in Japanese, some aspects of them (such as commercial zoning rules) vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, etc. Dealing with that is a great deal of work, and it is very expensive, though the Japanese domestic auto lobby does point out that while the number of dealers selling U.S.-made cars has declined by 74 percent in the past couple of decades, the number of dealerships selling European-made cars has increased by almost the same proportion. European marques make cars that are more like domestic Japanese cars (the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association reports that 93 percent of Japanese passenger cars have engines smaller than two liters, while U.S.-made cars are mostly larger than that), and European manufacturers have found it easier to comply with Japan\u2019s safety and emissions rules.\nThese are not issues that can be resolved by a one-sentence free-trade pact.\nConsider the question of military procurement: The United States, like many other countries, prefers to buy its military hardware from domestic sources when possible. There are some defensible and obvious reasons for this, though they sometimes are overstated. That disadvantages European armament-makers and aerospace firms. Many countries do not have those kinds of rules, not because they have a stronger commitment to free trade but because they do not have domestic industries capable of supplying their demands. (The uniforms of the mighty Kuwaiti air force were made, for a time, by Georgio Armani.) Other countries maintain preferential procurement policies to benefit domestic farmers, who in many parts of the world, such as India, are desperately poor. Some countries subsidize pharmaceuticals or put controls on their prices, others have unusually stringent environmental or safety standards.\nThere are exactly two ways to sort out these issues, and neither of them is a simple, one-page trade treaty, as attractive as that might be in principle. The first option is that these differences, and the processes for resolving them, are cod"}

The opposition Green Movement also staged counter-demonstrations despite the attacks and intimidating tactics used by Iran\u2019s police, Revolutionary Guards, and Basij militia. Many opposition leaders were attacked by thugs when they tried to meet with protesters. Presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi and former President Mohamed Khatami were physically beaten.\nOpposition sources charged that the police also fired tear gas and shots at an opposition rally led by Mir Hossein Mousavi, Ahmadinejad\u2019s chief rival in the fraudulent presidential elections last June.\nAhmadinejad yesterday also made a phone call to Syrian leader Bashar Assad in which he warned Israel against attacking Syria, Lebanon or elsewhere in the region. \u201cIf the Zionist regime should repeat its mistakes and initiate a military operation, then it must be resisted with full force to put an end to it once and for all.\u201d Tensions have been rising along Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon, which was the battlefield for a 34-day war between Israel and the Hezbollah terrorist group in 2006. Hezbollah has been supplied with thousands of Iranian-made rockets and other weapons and has regained its military muscle in southern Lebanon after losing many gunmen and much territory in 2006. Ahmadinejad\u2019s phone call is a pointed signal to Israel that if it launches a preventive strike at Iran\u2019s nuclear program, then Tehran will order Hezbollah to launch terrorist and rocket attacks against Israel.\nIran\u2019s provocative defiance of five U.N. Security Council resolutions and three sets of sanctions now puts additional pressure on the United States and other concerned countries to respond with much stronger sanctions. But China, which has opposed additional sanctions under the pretense that more sanctions would derail negotiations, is not likely to be cooperative.\nAnd Russia also has defended Iran\u2019s interests at the Security Council and cannot be trusted to support effective sanctions against Iran.\nThe United States is pushing for the strongest possible sanctions at the U.N. Security Council but the end result of these efforts will not approach the \u201ccrippling sanctions\u201d that the Obama Administration has promised. Washington therefore must think outside the U.N. box and press its allies and other countries to impose stronger sanctions outside the U.N. framework. Iran would be hard hit by bans on foreign investment, gasoline exports, trade with firms affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other measures undertaken by the European Union, Japan, India, the Gulf Cooperation Council or other countries.\nBut before it can ask other countries to impose stronger sanctions, the Obama Administration should support stronger U.S. sanctions which both houses of Congress have voted to approve.\nThe Obama Administration also should take a lesson from Ronald Reagan and support Iran\u2019s freedom-seeking opposition movement.\nAn Israeli Preventive Attack on Iran\u2019s Nuclear Sites: Implications for the United States."}

Sure, Hamels was signed with a focus on the future, but the Phillies seemingly weren\u2019t ready to give up on the present.\nThen they were swept by the Atlanta Braves and their plans did a 180. When they gave Hamels $144 million, they were telling their fans that they are willing to spend whatever is necessary. After one lost weekend, they appear to have buyer\u2019s remorse.\nNow the Phillies appear willing to trade just about anybody on their roster not named Hamels, Roy Halladay or Carlos Ruiz. They want to get younger and they want to reduce payroll.\nBy today 4 p.m. ET nonwaiver trading deadline, they likely will have moved starter Joe Blanton, outfielders Shane Victorino and Juan Pierre, and utilityman Ty Wigginton. It is possible they could also trade right fielder Hunter Pence and, if things fall their way, starter Cliff Lee and shortstop Jimmy Rollins will be on different teams, too.\nTo change plans so dramatically and abruptly is a formula for trouble.

But look at what they have done with Lee over the past three years, and you have to wonder. If they handle everyone like they have jerked around Lee, they are bound to run into trouble sooner or later.\nTrade deadline, 2009: The Phillies acquire Lee from the Cleveland Indians in a five-player deal. Lee dominates the postseason to the tune of a 1.56 ERA and 4-0 record that includes two wins over the Yankees in the World Series. The Phillies fall short of winning the World Series but are thrilled to have Lee on their side for another year at an affordable $8 million.\nDecember, 2009: The Phillies are even more thrilled to finally trade for Roy Halladay, so they ship Lee to Seattle Mariners to make the deal work. Amaro says he would like to keep both aces but is concerned that he won\u2019t be able to afford Lee when he reaches free agency the following year.\nDecember, 2010: Amaro gets Lee back with a five-year, $120 million deal when the Yankees and Texas Rangers were offering more.\nJuly 25, 2012: The Phillies extended their third and youngest ace, Cole Hamels, with a six-year, $144 million deal that gives them a trio of $20-million-a-year starters.

In fact, the pressure has driven BABA stock down 17% year-to-date. And the strengthening U.S. dollar and reports of a potential cooling of the Chinese economy have added to the uncertainty surrounding BABA in the past few weeks.\nHowever, despite the recent doom-and-gloom, long-term investors may consider investing in Alibaba stock, especially as the company gets closer to report earnings on Nov. 2.\nAs one of the most successful IPO\u2019s of the past few years, and with a market cap of $380 billion, Alibaba has become a highly regarded global company.

Alibaba offers a compelling long-term investment. Yet, between now and Nov. 2, when BABA reports earnings, the markets are likely to continue to be volatile, especially as many other tech heavyweights also release quarterly reports.\nAfter investors\u2019 harsh response in 2018 to the uncertainty over the threat of upcoming trade wars with China, Alibaba stock has suffered from a damaging technical picture.

Kristina Monllos, Adweek\u2019s senior editor, brand marketing, caught up with Brooks to discuss Casper and his priorities for the brand.\n\"It\u2019s important to seize opportunities that expand your business in the short term, but this must be balanced with investing in the future and planning ahead for the next wave of disruption.\"\nAdweek: Many of the direct-to-consumer brands start with one unique item and then end up adding much more to their offering. How do you do that while staying true to the brand? What makes now the right time to expand?\nJeff Brooks: Casper\u2019s goal from day one was to bring better sleep to more people. We started with one universally comfortable mattress, but we knew there was more to achieving a great night\u2019s sleep than the mattress alone. So we view it as intuitive to expand into adjacent categories that enable or promote better sleep. In addition to offering several mattresses, we now offer pillows, bedding, bedroom furniture and other accessories. We constantly challenge ourselves to raise the bar on all things sleep, and the pipeline has some very exciting initiatives underway.\nThe key for us in managing expansion is relatively simple. Everything we invent and make must address a real consumer need, be core to our vision of becoming the world\u2019s first end-to-end sleep company and deliver on the brand\u2019s origins of bringing simplicity, transparency and joy to a category that historically would not be characterized as such.\nWith that in mind, over the last year, there\u2019s been a real focus on growth for brand marketers. How are you approaching growth? What tactics are you using other than product expansion?\nExpanding the product portfolio is only part of the growth plan. We are equally focused on service design, creating new types of experiences for consumers that promote great sleep. Our recent launch of The Dreamery in NYC and our partnership with American Airlines are great examples of this.\nExpanding our physical presence has also played a key role in our growth. Today we own and operate over 20 stores across the U.S. and Canada and have plans to aggressively scale the fleet over the next few years. This comes at a time when many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers in the category are shrinking their footprints. Additionally, our wholesale partnerships with brands like Target, Hudson\u2019s Bay and Nordstrom, to name a few, are proving to be a terrific way to introduce our brand and products to new audiences.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest issue facing the CMO today?\nThe growth mandate is increasingly falling on the CMO in many organizations. This is certainly true for Casper, where marketing has played a significant role in the brand\u2019s success to date.

Circles also offers respite care for its participants\u2019 caregivers, allowing them the time to work, run errands and look after their own health.\nFounded by community leaders in Moscow and Pullman with the help of Gritman Medical Center, Circles opened its doors July 1, 2001, after securing a three-year federal rural health outreach grant totaling $600,000.\nSharon Benson, author of the grant proposal and the former co-director of Circles of Caring, said Medicare was supposed to take over funding for the program after the three-year period. Instead, Gritman funded the program until 2012, spending about $3.8 million.\nPrieur, an in-home caregiver, said she saw firsthand how vital Circles\u2019 services were to the Moscow-Pullman community, so she fought to continue the program when Gritman no longer could fully support the service.\nCircles of Caring, now run by participants\u2019 families with the help of local donors, re-opened its doors Jan. 1, 2013, in Moscow. The organization moved to Pullman in September 2014.\nHollie Mooney, a registered nurse who is the executive director of Circles, said the program focuses on holistic health, with staff monitoring participants\u2019 physical, social and cognitive functioning.\nPrieur said the social component of Circles is what helps participants thrive even as their illnesses progress.\nMooney, along with Circles\u2019 certified nursing assistants and volunteers, makes sure participants\u2019 basic needs are met.

Prieur said having a respite care option made it possible to keep her mother out of a long-term care facility while easing her own burden as a caregiver.\nMooney said when she first started working at Circles, she could see what a difference the program made in the lives of participants and their families.

There are 1,300 apps on AppExchange. So far one million have been installed (some are free, some you pay for).\nThese are nice add-ons, good for Benioff's CRM stake in the ground, but not necessarily technology that takes Salesforce beyond the business of software that enables sales.\nBut now AppExchange is more than an extension of Salesforce's core. I see this big shift coming in a little startup called Cloudwords.\nCloudwords' co-founders Michael Meinhardt and Scott Yancey had an insight a while back that goes something like this: Every company needs content translated into multiple languages -- this becomes more acute as even tiny shops act globally -- and the translation business is big (around $20 billion), fragmented, and opaque. It is a big pain to do this basic task on a regular basis, but you have to.\nCloudwords aims to change that by vetting translation services and letting them bid, openly. As a result, projects usually cost less. Meinhardt says projects that used to take three weeks to get done now take just two days. Customers can provide Yelp-like feedback on translators, aiding future customers. Meinhardt has signed up several customers already, but is betting big on Salesforce. Cloudwords just put itself on AppExchange. Far as I can tell (and Salesforce didn't disagree), Cloudwords is the first example of a marketplace being launched inside AppExchange.\nLet me explain: Cloudwords has contracts with some 30 translation agency that now are exposed to Salesforce's over 100,000 customers. It is as if Cloudwords was running an auction in a window-less basement, hoping interested bidders would eventually see the sign on the lobby directory and find it, and now has that same auction at a massive, buzzing industry trade show that happens every day. (Meinhardt and Yancey would no doubt dispute my basement analogy, as Cloudwords is on the Web.) Meanwhile, the 30 firms that Cloudwords is bringing to AppExchange likely would not have gone there otherwise. They don't think of themselves as software companies, and aren't for the most part. But their customers are inside AppExchange searching for services to help them run their businesses better.\nBenioff wants Salesforce to be bigger than sales. He has talked about becoming the next Microsoft. To do that, or some modern cloud-era version of that, he has to be the destination for all flavors of software and services. If Cloudwords wins big on AppExchange, others will follow. And AppExchange will evolove into the best business software bazaar in town.\nPerhaps Benioff has known this all along. He backed Cloudwords early on (co-founder Yancey worked for him at Salesforce for nearly a decade). Cloudwords has raised a total of $3 million from Benioff and others including Salesforce's founding CTO Dave Moellenhoff."}

{"idx": "29799", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Linguists and data scientists see a new way to study language and communication in our little digital ideograms.\nTwo years ago, Sanjaya Wijeratne\u2014a computer science PhD student at Wright State University\u2014noticed something odd in his research. He was studying the communication of gang members on Twitter. Among the grandstanding about drugs and money, he found gang members repeatedly dropping the \u26fd emoji in their tweets.\nThat moment caused Wijeratne to redirect his PhD research toward emoji. This week, he put together the first interdisciplinary academic conference on emoji in research.\nAt Stanford University this week, a collection of linguists, data scientists, computer researchers, and emoji enthusiasts gathered for the International Workshop on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media, itself a smaller piece of the AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media. They brought with them research on how emoji are changing the way we communicate online, how gender and political affiliation are reproduced online through emoji, and the challenges emoji pose for natural-language processing in computers. The assembled academics also debated basic questions about the nature of emoji: Like, if emoji is something akin to a language, why can\u2019t anyone agree on what individual emoji mean?\nEmoji, which have grown from an original set of 176 characters to a collection of over 3,000 unique icons, present both opportunities and challenges to the academics who study them. Most agree that the icons are not quite a language\u2014the emoji vocabulary is made up almost entirely of nouns, and there\u2019s no real grammar or syntax to govern their use\u2014but their influence on internet communication is massive. By 2015, half of all comments on Instagram included an emoji. On Messenger, Facebook\u2019s messaging app, over 5 billion emoji are sent and received every day. From an academic point of view, that presents a wealth of data to understand communication, behavior, and language online.\nBut the academic research on emoji has, until recently, been limited. Earlier gatherings like EmojiCon, which will have its second conference this summer, have brought emoji conversations to the mainstream. But that event\u2014a \u201ccelebration of all things emoji\u201d\u2014courts a popular audience, and feels less like a formal conference and more like a party made for Instagram. This week's Workshop on Emoji Understanding, on the other hand, brought the focus squarely back into academia. The day-long event included a series of paper presentations that privileged data sets and citations over emoji-shaped balloons, and asked more questions than it could answer.\nTyler Schnoebelen, who gave the keynote speech on Monday, says conversations about emoji have been too often painted with a broad brush. There\u2019s the utopian vision: emoji as a \"universal language,\" the great democratizer and harbinger of communication across class, culture, and geography. And then there\u2019s the doomsday vision: emoji as the destruction of language, a political tool, a new way to send violent threats. The nuance often gets lost in between. We have hardly any research to tell us who uses emoji, when, why, and how that use has changed over time. We know even less about what emoji can reveal in disaster scenarios, campaigns, or educational settings; even linguists, who have looked at emoticons and other internet-born languages for decades, don't have a consensus on what emoji mean for the future of language.\nNow, researchers are beginning to turn more seriously toward those research questions.

This would loose so much water into the oceans that they would rise by a truly catastrophic 13 to 20 feet. There, among other things, would go most of Florida and a sizable chunk of Manhattan.\nScientists have been unable to point with confidence to any instance in which it has happened in the past, in any sort of climate that compares with today's or with the climate that is expected in the decades and centuries just ahead.\nIn the past, natural forces have caused the earth's temperature to vary widely. All the planet's permanent ice virtually disappeared during the super-high temperatures of the Cretaceous period, which ended some 65 million years ago. The extent to which it may have melted periodically since permanent ice became re-established as early as 15 million to 20 million years ago has been unclear.\nNow a new study by investigators in Sweden and the United States has turned up what is described as evidence that the West Antarctic ice sheet, or part of it, did indeed collapse at least once during an ancient interglacial period, or interval of warmth between ice ages. The world is in another such interglacial period now, and many scientists believe its warmth will be intensified by emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide.\nThe researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden and the California Institute of Technology, led by Dr. Reed P. Scherer, analyzed sediments recovered from the area beneath the West Antarctic ice and determined that they contained the remains of tiny marine algae called diatoms, along with a chemical tracer called beryllium-10.\nTogether, they report in the current issue of the journal Science, these clues ''provide evidence that marine conditions prevailed deep within the West Antarctic interior'' at some time within the last two million years. This, they wrote, suggests that the West Antarctic ice sheet had collapsed to some degree at least once within the same period. The researchers nominate an unusually long interglacial interval about 400,000 years ago as the most likely time for the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet.\nDr. Scherer had made similar findings earlier on the basis of diatoms alone, but the findings were criticized on the ground that the diatoms could have got into the sediment samples by other means than melting of the ice. That is true of the new study as well, said Dr. Lloyd Burckle, a micropaleontologist who works with diatoms at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.\nBut others said the new evidence, while not conclusive, was strong. Collapse of the ice sheet is the best explanation for the placement of the diatoms and the beryllium-10, said Dr. Richard Alley, a paleoclimatologist at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Scherer's ''original result was correct and he has strengthened it,'' Dr. Alley said.\nThe significance of the finding, he said, is that it ''strengthens the possibility''"}

Gwartney will retire Feb. 1, 2012, he announced Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2011.\nTown Assessor Ted Gwartney, who led Greenwich through two property revaluations during the real estate boom and bust, has decided to retire, and will step down Feb. 1 from the position he has held for nine years.\nGwartney, 71, said he and his wife are planning to join their children and other family members in California.\n\"It has been a pleasure and an honor to have served the Town of Greenwich for the past nine years,\" Gwartney wrote in an email Tuesday to Board of Estimate and Taxation Chairman Stephen Walko, First Selectman Peter Tesei and other town officials. \"This is a unique community, with many extraordinary residents.

From 1990 to 1995, he assisted in setting up assessment systems in the former Soviet Union, including in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. He also created the assessment system for British Columbia in Canada.\nDuring Gwartney's tenure, Greenwich was an intriguing place for an assessor.\n\"It was interesting because we saw the property values really climbing in 2005 when we did that reval,\" Gwartney said, \"and then they had dropped off by 18 percent when we did the 2010 revaluation.\"\nTesei, who served as BET chairman when Gwartney was hired, said he has done an excellent job.\n\"He's done a fantastic job of overseeing two revaluations and responding to the public in a very professional, yet thoughtful and clear, way on subjects that are not necessarily always easy,\" Tesei said. \"We have not had major issues. I think that he did a lot of pre-planning and early education. Because of that, we were in a position to not have the uproar that occurred several revals ago, when people were not clear as to what the environment would be in terms of values.\"\nWalko said Gwartney, with his quiet demeanor, did a good job of making sure the information on the grand list was correct and accurately reflected Greenwich's various neighborhoods. Gwartney also had to answer questions from residents about the revaluations, explaining why, for example, the value of shoreline properties went up more than backcountry properties.\n\"I think that Ted has served this town well as our assessor,\" Walko said. \"We have successfully undertaken two revals under his leadership, and I think his technical expertise was excellent.\"\nThe BET is responsible for the action of the assessor's office.\n\"It's a large task and a very critical part of the BET's function,\" Walko said. \"Quite frankly, it's overlooked because budgets tend to dominate the headlines.\"\nTo find Gwartney's replacement, Tesei said the BET will likely"}

Their advice and information is available around the world on their website.\nOne important area for discussion is how to prevent leg pain, a condition also called lameness.\nNigel Cook is with the Dairyland Initiative.\nSpeaking in a cow barn, Cook explains that a bed of sand can provide a good place for cows to lie down during the day.\n\u201cThe deep, soft bedding of sand creates an environment where cows can rest half the day, and that is incredibly important to cows.\"\nThe researchers advise farmers to provide bigger stalls, the areas where cows are kept in a barn. They also say farmers should use more fans to keep the animals cool, and feed all their cows at the same time.\nAnd researchers say it is a good idea to keep cows with their usual group of friends when it comes time for them to give birth. This helps lessen the stress for the cows.\nMitch Breunig owns the Mystic Valley Dairy in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. He says he used the advice to improve the conditions for his 400 cows.\n\"If you take away their stress, they actually produce more milk. And then the other thing that actually is interesting is they do it by eating less feed.\"\nSince he made the changes, Breunig says the dairy\u2019s production has increased.

{"idx": "29816", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Rigid metal awnings can last for years.\nOutdoor awnings provide shade on hot summer days, protect you and your home from rain and wind, and increase overall energy efficiency. From simple rigid awnings to retractable models, awnings come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and materials. While traditional awnings were often made from wood, metal or cotton canvas, their modern cousins often feature more durable materials that require significantly less maintenance.\nAcrylic and acrylic-coated synthetic fabrics are capable of holding up much longer than traditional canvas. They tend to reduce fading and repel water effectively. Homeowners can choose from 100 percent acrylic fabrics, polyester fabrics coated with acrylic and cotton-polyester blends with an acrylic coating. Uncoated polyester tends to be unsuitable for awnings because it is more susceptible to sun damage. Acrylic and polyester awning fabrics are usually opaque and relatively heavy. They work well in areas with high humidity and resist mildew and damage from ultraviolet light.\nAwning fabrics can also be coated with vinyl. These materials tend to be slightly heavier than acrylic and acrylic-coated materials. They also have greater translucency, making them a good choice for backlit and illuminated awnings. According to Fabric Architecture Magazine, vinyl-laminated polyester is a good choice for areas with sustained high humidity. Vinyl-coated polyester, which has a thinner protective layer, also resists UV light and mildew but is less effective in humid environments. Vinyl-coated fabrics come in a relatively limited range of styles and colors compared to acrylic fabrics.\nSteel and aluminum awnings were extremely common during the 1950s through the 1970s. They offer a slick, low-maintenance surface that could be painted to match the home. Steel awnings often require regular repainting to prevent rust, however, and aluminum is easy to dent. Metal awnings may also require more careful cleaning than fabric alternatives, especially if they have molded ridges or other areas that could collect dirt. This kind of awning cannot be rolled up, but some kinds come with hinges and can fold up or down.\nFiberglass awnings are a lighter alternative to steel or aluminum. This kind of awning is molded with the color in the material, preventing the need to repaint but reducing your ability to change its look. Fiberglass awnings can be opaque or slightly translucent. Translucent models admit some light, reducing the risk of a \u201cblackout\u201d effect. Over time, fiberglass awnings can become brittle or crack and may need to be replaced.\nHistorically, wood and natural fiber canvas awnings were used in many buildings. These materials offer the advantage of being relatively inexpensive but require more maintenance and more frequent replacement than modern materials. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, canvas awnings may need to be re-covered as often as every five to seven years. Wood and raw canvas also pose an increased risk of fire damage in areas where wildfires are a concern. California state law requires homeowners to use fireproof material such as treated cotton canvas for all awnings and other outdoor fabric structures.\nPalmer, G.D.. \"What Types of Material Are Outdoor Awnings Made Of?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/types-material-outdoor-awnings-"}

It is the result of a lot of hard work and talented people. We are in the midst of a vast expansion of our research and have successfully raised extra income from the private sector as well as government sources.\"\nThe London School of Economics, meanwhile, secures second place in the rankings, narrowly ahead of Oxford University and Imperial College London.\nOxford was quick to release a statement stressing it still has more academic staff working in world-class research departments than any other UK university. Dr Colin Lucas, the university's vice-chancellor, said: \"The RAE 2001 has confirmed that, among those UK universities with the full range of academic disciplines, Oxford and Cambridge remain clear leaders of the field.\"\nBut the 2001 research assessment exercise is likely to be best remembered as the competition that became the victim of its own success. The results suggest that 55% of the 50,000 researchers reviewed by panels of academic referees now work in university departments that are judged to contain work of international excellence. On average, academic institutions improved their average research rating by 0.8 compared with the results of the 1996 assessment.\nUnveiling the results for England this week, the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, Sir Howard Newby, estimated that an extra \u00a3200m a year would have to be found if departments were to be funded on the same basis as before. \"Overall we think that this is an excellent outcome, but it has been so good that we are unable to fully fund the outcome.\"\nA major dilemma, Sir Howard admitted, was how to fund both world-class research departments, as well as up and coming research units in new universities. He wants the funding council to delay any funding decisions for a year, and lobby for more money on the forthcoming Whitehall spending review. He said: \"I would hope that the Treasury would recognise that the RAE has been a spectacular success in improving the quality of research in the UK.\"\nUniversities, however, many of whom have invested heavily in the assessment, will face an uncertain financial future if the funding chiefs put off the decision for another year. Cambridge, for example, is predicting it will be \u00a35m in the red this year. \"We are going into deficit this year like a lot of large universities,\" Sir Alec said. \"This would be difficult to cope with, if the ratings are not fully rewarded.\"\nUniversities were far more selective in the numbers of researchers and departments submitted to the 2001 assessment compared with previous exercises - a sign of more strategic research management, according to funding chiefs. The four funding bodies in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland received 2,600 departmental submissions, about 400 less than in 1996"}

A child immigrant \u2014 he fled Hungary when he was just 12 \u2014 Vajna operated several successful businesses in the U.S. and Hong Kong, including a photography studio, a chain of movie theaters and even a wig-design business, before teaming with the Lebanese-born Mario Kassar to form Carolco Pictures in 1976.\nTheir first project was The Sicilian Cross, a 1976 Italian film starring Roger Moore. After a series of mostly forgettable genre films, Kassar and Vajna, in 1980, paid Warner Bros. a reported $383,000 for the option rights to David Morrell's 1972 novel First Blood. The resulting 1982 movie \u2014 starring Sylvester Stallone as troubled Vietnam veteran John Rambo \u2014 cost $14 million to make and went on to gross $125 million worldwide. Overnight, Carolco was a major Hollywood player.\nVajna and Kassar were masters of securing financing for star-driven action films from the international market, and the pair were among the most successful producers of the 1980s, with two successful Rambo sequels and films such as Angel Heart, Red Heat and Total Recall. Rambo: First Blood Part II, which was made for a reported $25 million, grossed more than $300 million worldwide, making it one of the most profitable films of all time. In 1982, Vajna was a founder, and then president, of the American Film Marketing Association.\nVajna left Carolco in 1989, selling his interest to Kassar and setting up his own venture, Cinergi Pictures. The company had a number of hits, including Die Hard With a Vengeance and the Madonna musical Evita. The latter also won three Golden Globes \u2014 including best motion picture, comedy or musical and an Oscar for best original song. But a string of box office bombs \u2014 including Renaissance Man, Judge Dredd and Deep Rising \u2014 forced Vajna to shutter the company in 1998.\nCarolco, which went on to produce films such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day without Vajna, collapsed in 1995 following such flops as Showgirls and Cutthroat Island. Vajna and Kassar would reteam in 2003 to form C-2 Pictures to bring back the Terminator franchise with Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines.\nVajna remained connected to his Hungarian homeland his entire life. He pushed for several of his films \u2014 including Red Heat and Evita \u2014 to shoot in Budapest and, in 2002, founded the visual effects firm DIGIC Pictures in Hungary.\nFrom 2011, when he was appointed the government commissioner for the Hungarian film industry by Hungarian prime minister Victor Orban, Vajna oversaw a revival of the local film business.

Created under the auspices of the European Union, the accord is the culmination of 10 rounds of delicate negotiations that have lasted for six months.\nEU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele called the move \u201chistoric\u201d, while Jelko Kacin, former Information Secretary of Slovenia and current EU official in charge of Serbia\u2019s entry into the EU compared the event to the \u201cend of the Cold War\u201d.\nOn Friday, EU Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton told reporters in Brussels, \u201cWhat we are seeing is a step away from the past and, for both of them, a step closer to Europe\u201d, referring to the fact that the document effectively opens the door for Serbia to begin negotiations for EU membership, the political ambition of all its governments since the downfall of former dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000.\nFor Kosovo Prime Minister Thaci, the signing of the accord means, among other things, \u201cthe healing of wounds\u201d, since it hinged upon the degree of autonomy Pristina was willing to grant to predominantly Serb regions in the north.\nUntil Yugoslavia fell apart in a series of bloody separatist conflicts in 1991, Kosovo \u2013 currently populated by 1.7 million ethnic Albanians and 100,000 Serbs \u2013 was a part of Serbia and under direct rule of the Serb minority in Belgrade.\nAn armed rebellion of ethnic Albanians aimed at obtaining independence from Belgrade in the 1990s led to brutal repression by Milosevic\u2019s security forces, leaving 13,000 people dead.\nIn 1999, over a period of 11 weeks, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) dropped 50,000 bombs on 116 locations in southern Serbia and the Kosovo region in an effort to push out Milosevic\u2019s forces.

Bearing the company\u2019s logo with the motto \u201cService before self\u201d on one side and the five branches of the military on the other side, the coin is a powerful symbol of inclusion for the company\u2019s veterans who are transitioning to corporate life.\nThere are many reasons to hire military veterans\u2014they are well disciplined, well trained and highly skilled team players, said Pyzyk, a Northwestern Mutual manager and 25-year Air Force reservist who deployed to Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004.\nBut businesses are discovering that the ability to retain that military talent is as important as the ability to acquire it . That\u2019s why some 46 percent of companies surveyed by Diversity Best Practices in 2011 offer employee resource groups (ERGs) for veterans. These networks, or affinity groups, are more than just social clubs; they must align with a company\u2019s corporate mission and business strategy.\nNorthwestern Mutual\u2019s Veterans ERG was created with the mission of helping the company recruit and retain veterans. \u201cThe Military Veterans Employee Resource Group was formulated in recognition that our veterans really do make outstanding employees,\u201d said Ron Joelson, executive vice president and chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual and executive sponsor of the ERG.\nThe ERG not only encourages the employment of veterans, it also helps to support military families, Joelson noted\u2014his own son graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2010 and is currently serving overseas.\nIn addition, the ERG serves an important role in helping veterans transition to corporate life. Military members have a strong bond forged by a shared commitment to voluntarily defend their country at all costs, even if it means the ultimate sacrifice, Pyzyk said.\nPyzyk missed that feeling of shared experience when she retired from the military. She noted it's much more difficult to forge similar bonds in a corporate environment, where people head out the door at the end of the day and go on with their lives.\nWhen Northwestern Mutual created its ERG for veterans, however, something changed. At the first informal meeting in the cafeteria, 20 employees from across the company began to re-create those bonds by sharing their military experiences. \u201cIt was the most powerful hour and a half I\u2019ve had at the company to date,\u201d Pyzyk said.\nToday, the Veterans ERG has more than 200 members and is open to any employee who wants to join. Northwestern Mutual\u2019s corporate emphasis on service to the community also has eased the transition for veterans who were trained to work consistently toward the betterment of a community, Pyzyk said.\nThis spring the group will run a 5k race to help raise money for Wisconsin\u2019s first Fisher House, a home for military families who want to be"}

She said she could not comment on Piatek\u2019s case or on the letter from the press freedom watchdog groups, as she was not familiar with either.\nPrior to his book, in a July 2016 article for the Forward, Piatek documented Macierewicz\u2019s role, before his ascension to the defense ministry, as the founder, editor-in-chief, co-owner of and, frequently, author for the far-right newspaper G\u0142os (Voice). During the 1990s, when Macierewicz was most actively involved in the publication, the paper routinely ran anti-Semitic articles and cartoons.\nPiatek\u2019s book, \u201cMacierewicz and His Secrets,\u201d contains further allegations about the defense minister who, as the Polish military\u2019s civilian chief on the front line with Russia, works closely with NATO, of which Poland is a member.\nAccording to Piatek\u2019s book, Macierewicz, a purportedly hard-line, anti-Russian political leader in Poland\u2019s nationalist government, has a long history of ties to paramilitary organizations that recruited pro-Russian neo-Nazi youngsters and members of an openly pro-Kremlin party into its ranks. Piatek reports that the defense minister has incorporated these militias into Poland\u2019s civil defense forces. As part of these forces, the militia groups, he writes, were deployed in NATO\u2019s 2016 Anaconda military exercise \u2014 the largest NATO maneuvers near Russia\u2019s borders since the end of the Cold War.\nThe book also alleges long-standing ties between Macierewicz and individuals who work with the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, as well as members of the Russian mafia.\nIn his in-depth article last year for the Forward, Piatek reviewed Macierewicz\u2019s record as director and editor-in-chief of Glos and found 43 anti-Semitic articles, some signed by Macierewicz himself, in 1996 alone.\nOne article penned by Macierewicz denounced as \u201ca brazen lie and a defamation\u201d the documented slaughter of 40 Polish Jewish survivors of the Holocaust by their non-Jewish Polish neighbors in Kielce when they returned to the town in 1946, after World War II.\nAnother, in June 1996, blamed \u201cJewish circles\u201d for the finding by historians across"}

State funding for public schools\u2014especially those serving large numbers of ELLs and poor children\u2014has not kept pace with rising enrollment and increasing academic demands, a Texas state judge said on Monday.\nDavid Hinojosa, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, said in a call with reporters earlier today that the ruling was \"incredible\" and bodes well for districts like the 12,000-student San Benito Independent school district which sits right on the Mexican border in South Texas and where a quarter of students are ELLs. MALDEF represented five school districts and the parents of four English-language-learner students in the suit that was eventually joined by scores of other plaintiffs.\nRoughly 600 school districts\u2014some two-thirds of the public school systems in the state\u2014ended up joining the lawsuit that was filed after Texas lawmakers slashed education spending by more than $5.4 billion over the last couple of years, forcing major job cuts and bigger class sizes.\nIn San Benito, Superintendent Antonio Limon said those cutbacks have meant having to eliminate bilingual paraprofessionals who worked with ELLs, as well as delaying the purchase of updated curricular materials for English-learners. Hinojosa said that statewide, the budget cuts have made it harder for poorer districts to hire highly sought-after bilingual and ESL teachers.\nThis school finance lawsuit is the fifth filed in Texas since 1984, said Hinojosa, who is the regional counsel for MALDEF's Southwest region. The ruling, of course, is expected to be appealed, so it will likely be months, if not years, before the case is settled."}

The current record of 7.4 million iPhones was set in the quarter that ended September 30, 2009. At the time, Ezra Gottheil of Technology Business Research, dubbed the quarter, during which Apple also sold a record number of Macs, \"spectacular.\"\nIn 2010, Apple will do even better, said Marshall, who has put the year's global iPhone sales at more than 37 million, an increase of 35% over his estimate of 27.7 million for calendar year 2009. Again, the upside for Apple is its potential to rapidly grow international sales.\n\"Despite the enormous success of the iPhone since inception in July 2007, we strongly believe the device is still in its infancy with respect to penetrating the global post-paid subscriber market,\" Marshall said. \"Our analysis indicates that while the iPhone currently enjoys 5% penetration of AT&T's post-paid subscriber base, the penetration of its current international carrier partners' post-paid subscriber base is only 0.8%.\"\nEven so, Marshall wasn't about to belittle the iPhone's impact in the US, and on AT&T's revenues. Saying that the iPhone's importance to the US wireless market \"cannot be overstated,\" he said his analysis showed that the iPhone is \"by far the single most important driver of the post-paid subscriber addition market in the US today.\"\nMarshall's numbers for 2010 aren't out in left field. Today, Gene Munster, senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray, pegged 2010's iPhone number at 36 million, just 4% under Marshall's estimate. According to AppleInsider, which quoted Munster's note to customers, his estimate for 2009 is 25.7 million, again slightly under Marshall's.\nApple will unveil its fourth quarter earnings later this month when it holds a conference call with reporters and analysts."}

This is a real setback; the program has produced a remarkable track record in a short period of time.\nMayor Kurt L. Schmoke, the Greater Baltimore Committee and Baltimoreans United In Leadership Development created CollegeBound in 1988. Its mission was to increase the number of city students attending college by removing some of the financial impediments. In its short history, it has provided assistance to nearly 1,600 city students. Without this aid, virtually none of these students would have been able to attend college.\nWith a new semester starting within weeks, CollegeBound needs $150,000 to meet a growing demand. It also needs extra funds to provide financial assistance to another two dozen students who have qualified for help. These students do not need large amounts because the program provides only \"last dollar\" assistance. Its grants cover the shortfall created when the family contribution and the college aid packages are less than the cost of tuition, room and board and books.\nThe program also provides assistance to cover the cost of taking the Scholastic Aptitude Tests and filing college applications. Its small staff guides city high students through the thicket of college and financial assistance forms. The organization has also organized trips so city students can visit colleges.\nCollegeBound is in the midst of an endowment drive. It currently has raised about $13 million of its $25 million goal. The cause of the immediate financial squeeze is the nation's modest interest rates. CollegeBound's interest income, which is used to cover annual operating expenses, is much lower than projected.\nThe first beneficiaries of this program are finishing college this year. None of the students who qualified for assistance this year should be turned away. Immediate financial attention must be focused on them. But long-term, CollegeBound has to augment its endowment to ensure a more secure financial footing. The investment this program makes in college education today will bear returns for our community for decades to come. It needs our support."}

{"idx": "29858", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The Federal Trade Commission's Telemarketing Sales Rule puts consumers in charge of how they want to receive telemarketing communications. Beginning Sept. 1, 2009, Federal Trade Commission regulations will require that automated sales communications can only be delivered to recipients who have already provided their express written consent to receive them. Here, Knowledge Center contributor Mark Friedman explains how to create a successful preference and opt-in program for more targeted, effective marketing communications.\nIn 2008, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) adopted an amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) citing consumer protection against unwanted marketing communications. As of Dec. 1, 2008, all prerecorded telemarketing sales calls must provide an automated, interactive opt-out feature for consumers. More significantly, beginning Sept. 1, 2009, automated sales communications can only be delivered to those recipients who have provided their express written consent to receive them.\nHaving an existing business relationship (EBR) will no longer suffice as sufficient approval for organizations to attempt to sell a good or service via an automated, prerecorded message. The FTC's telemarketing amendment is a unique opportunity for organizations because it combines both critical and strategic issues: the urgency of a time deadline (that is, they must obtain permission by September 1, 2009) and a strategic opportunity that can impact long-term success by enabling more targeted, effective marketing.\nThe FTC's amended TSR is a game changer. Organizations need to act quickly to maximize the percentage of consumers that they will be able to cost-effectively reach via automated calls to sell their goods and services.\nCompanies establish a brand impression with their customers; the better and stronger the brand impression, generally the more profitable the relationship for the organization. Customer communications plays a major role in forming that brand impression. Yet how many organizations really know how each one of their customers prefers to be contacted? And under what circumstances?\nFor example, if you are running a special sale on an item your customers might be interested in purchasing, would they prefer to find out via e-mail? Voice message? Text message? Direct mail? Some combination of these? What if you wanted to make a special offer to members of your loyalty/reward program; how would your customers want to hear about this offer?\nEach consumer has his or her own communication preferences. Some consumers want to receive e-mails; others would prefer voice or text messages, and still others would prefer to be called on their mobile phones. And many would prefer to receive communications through a combination of channels. It is important to ask consumers directly how they want to be communicated with so that you can develop a communication strategy that encompasses their preferences.\nCommunications are all about getting consumers to act. And here's the point: if you know in advance what their preferences are, you will be in a much better position to have your communications break through and be acted upon. This will mean more market share, more revenue and more profit.\nOnce an organization determines the individual communication preferences of its consumers, it can then secure express written consent (that is, their permission) from these consumers. As a result, organizations will be well positioned to deliver relevant information to consumers who have expressed an interest in their goods or services."}

Second strike capability was housed mostly in nuclear submarines that cruised the ocean floors.\nBy 1988, the U.S. had about 23,5000 nuclear bombs in reserve, the U.S.S.R about 33,000. Overkill, to put it euphemistically.\nFeeling maddened by MAD, I joined several anti-nuclear organizations, received all their newsletters (this was of course in snail-mail days): Union of Concerned Scientists, Council for a Livable World, Natural Resources Defense Council, and more. I saved all these mailings in huge boxes in my attic.\nComing to anti-nuclear activism from the academic field of semiotics, I got interested in the discourse of the nuclear weapons debate. I subscribed to magazines on both sides of the debate and bought piles of books on the topic. I saved all these materials in huge boxes in my attic.\nBut I also began studying nonviolence, inspired by Thomas Merton. The spirituality of nonviolence taught me to seek the good in the \u201cenemy,\u201d that in my case wasn\u2019t the Soviet Union but rather the pro-nuclear people in my own country. I subscribed to periodicals like Fellowship and Sojourners to learn more about the spirituality and practice of nonviolence.

But I would also say we have to be a department that continues to get better. So that's what I'm dedicated to, that's what we're dedicated to. As we move along, there's always lessons to be learned and if we don't get better from those lessons then we've failed. The protest march [on March 4] was different in a lot of ways to a lot of the marches that we have. There was property damage, there was at one point some flames and fire that somebody was holding over cars. There was confrontation.\nThat's an interesting word. I would just say this: The things that we are implementing and moving forward with, I think we will not have that in the future. But in terms of a \"mistake,\" I mean, I wish it hadn't happened and I hope it doesn't happen in the future and I think there's better ways that we can implement things that will avoid that. For example, better communication with the media, better communication with our pastors that are oftentimes in these protests trying to ensure that they stay safe, and better communication with all the protesters so there's clear direction and clear information about what's getting ready to happen.\nI don't know that will ever be at a ending because I think as a community and as a department, we have to always keep looking [at] how we can get better... I know we can be a lot farther than we are right now. We often talk about officer-involved shootings and things like Stephon Clark being shot, and those are obviously important because it's taking somebody's life. But I think the underlying, more broad thing is just the relationship between certain segments of our community and the police department. And that has to get better. There has to be a level of trust that's earned. You can't just ask for it and it appears. You have to earn it.\nIt's a two step process and the first step has been completed and we've released that.

Delivery might be scheduled to coincide with grandparents' dates of arrival from out of town, or before Dad must ship out for Iraq.\n\"It's clearly a different attitude than we've had in the past,\" she said.\nThere are several complicating factors, Crawford said. The documentary states that people tend to underestimate the impact of premature births, especially late pre-term births. They tend to overestimate how accurately a due date can be determined.\nShepherd said there can be real consequences. They can include immediate physical challenges, including underdeveloped lungs and long-term problems involving learning and behavioral disabilities, for example.\nAnd even if a mother gets an ultrasound within the first 16 weeks -- the best way to accurately determine the due date -- the date can be off by two weeks either way.\nThose two weeks can be crucial, she said.\n\"It's an issue of planning and control,\" she said. Planning is good. But, \"You can take it too far if you don't pay attention to the science.\"\nShe said the science dictates that the best practice is to not give birth before 39 weeks.\nMothers, tired at the end of even the most ideal pregnancy, need to get support from their doctors and their families that \"if it is at all possible, you need to go to your due date.\"\n\"If people know how important it is they would make different decisions,\" she said."}

Both plans are intended to blunt the recession with a combination of tax cuts and government spending on public works and other programs to create more than three million jobs.\nBut the competing bills now reflect substantially different approaches. The House puts greater emphasis on helping states and localities avoid wide-scale cuts in services and layoffs of public employees. The Senate cut $40 billion of that aid from its bill, which is expected to be approved Tuesday.\nThe Senate plan, reached in an agreement late Friday between Democrats and three moderate Republicans, focuses somewhat more heavily on tax cuts, provides far less generous health care subsidies for the unemployed and lowers a proposed increase in food stamps.\nTo help allay Republican concerns about the cost, the Senate proposal even scales back President Obama\u2019s signature middle-class tax cut. The Senate plan also creates new tax incentives to encourage Americans to buy homes and cars within the next year.\nRepublican opponents continued to rail against the stimulus plan on the Senate floor on Saturday, though it appeared they would not have the votes to stop it.\nThe negotiations in Congress will test whether Democrats, who say they won a mandate in November to pursue their goals, are willing to give up some favored long-term policy initiatives to win over more Republican votes.\nThe talks will also test whether any but the most moderate Republicans will be willing to support the Obama administration, or whether they will simply recoil in an opposition stance.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, who was in Williamsburg, Va., on a retreat with her fellow House Democrats on Friday, called the emerging Senate cuts to the stimulus program \u201cvery damaging\u201d and said she was \u201cvery much opposed to them.\u201d But after the Senate reached a deal, Ms. Pelosi expressed resolve to complete the legislation in the days ahead.\nMr. Obama, who has made the economic recovery effort the centerpiece of his agenda, is expected to take a stronger hand in the negotiations and will embark on an aggressive public lobbying campaign.\nHe will hold a meeting in Indiana on Monday, followed by a formal White House news conference, the first of his term, in prime time on Monday night. He will pitch the plan again on Tuesday in Florida and on Wednesday in Virginia.\nIn his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, the president praised the Senate deal and urged quick passage of a final bill.\nAlso on Monday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is expected to announce the broad outlines of a rescue plan for the financial industry. The administration hopes that the announcement will quiet some critics in Congress who say not enough is being done for the housing sector.\nAfter Senate Democrats reached their deal with moderate Republicans on Friday, Republicans who are more conservative refused to put the legislative process on a fast track.\nSenator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, insisted that the deal required careful deliberation and said he would spend the weekend reviewing it, even though it was all but certain that he would not support the measure.\nAs a result, the Senate met for a rare Saturday session, and Republicans delivered some of their harshest criticism of Mr. Obama since he took office, suggesting that he was pressing Congress to act irresponsibly by warning of imminent catastrophe.\nThe majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada"}

Kit is an important and engrossing discussion on a wide range of both Israeli and US missile defense issues. We delve into why the US Army and Navy are purchasing the jointly developed Rafael/Raytheon Iron Dome system that successfully destroyed an Iranian Surface to Surface Missile aimed at the Golan. The Iron Dome was designed to address short range rockets, mortars and demonstrated a capability to take down tactical missiles on the battlefield as well. We also raised the issue of why the intermediate level of the Israeli air defense umbrella- David\u2019s Sling \u2013 has not been able to address missile threats from Syria. Bryen points out that the jointly developed Arrow -3 system was successfully tested recently is directed at destruction of nuclear equipped missiles in the exo-atmosphere. He also drew attention to the recent joint India-Israeli successful test of the surface ship Barak -8 missile system. We ask Bryen about the US Army purchase of the Israeli -developed sophisticated Trophy System for protection of armored forces that had its origins in the Second Lebanon War, when Israel tanks faced the Russian Kornet anti-tank weapons that Hezbollah used. The US Army has heretofore failed to come up with a domestic \u2013 developed system that had the advanced capabilities of the Trophy system. Bryen answers questions about the Russian developed advanced S-400 system that to date has no US/NATO equivalent with the ability to fire multiple missiles and advanced radar acquisition capabilities. The Russians have one S-400 system installed at the Hmeimim air base in Syria. The so-called \u2018red phone\u2019 deconfliction arrangements between Israel and Russia enables Israel to undertake missions against Iranian targets in Syria, which Bryen said Russia wants to prevent entrenchment. What is truly disturbing is the discussion with Bryen about the realities of an inadequate US Missile defense system. The most recent US Missile Defense Review tried to rationalize using the Stealthy F-35 equipped with a possible SM-3 missile to attack ICBMs in the critical boost phase. Bryen says the US may already have that capability in the fleet of 100 B-1 bombers capable of carrying upwards of four anti-ICBM missiles in its bays. Use of possible laser systems is impractical because of the large power requirements and intervals to reload shot. Bryen says that the US lacks an adequate missile defense system, which begs development of a new system, instead of the shoot to kill THAAD and Ground Based Mid-Course interceptors installed in South Korea and Vandenberg AFB in California and at Fort Wainwright in Alaska. When asked about the US suspension of the Intermedia Nuclear Force Treaty, Bryen suggests it is the Russian development of a new longer range 500-kilometer cruise missile recently unveiled. We also discuss both Russian and Chinese development of so-called Hypersonic missiles; i.e., anything that exceeds Mach 5 speed. He also points that there are no missile defense systems slated for installation on the vulnerable East and Gulf Coasts in the US. Hence, Bryen says, in effect \u201cUS missile defense is a myth\u201d."}

The storm dumped rain shin-high and hurled three-meter storm surges against the barrier island shores that faced the mainland, destroying roads and 1,100 homes.\nAfter the storm, a young ecologist then at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill named Rachel K. Gittman decided to survey the affected areas. Gittman had worked as an environmental consultant for the U.S. Navy on a shoreline-stabilization project and had been shocked to discover how little information existed on coastal resilience. \u201cThe more I researched, the more I realized that we just don\u2019t know very much,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo much policy and management is being made without the underlying science.\u201d She decided to make shorelines her specialty.\nWhat Gittman found was eye-opening. Along the hard-hit shorelines, three quarters of the bulkheads were damaged. The walls, typically concrete and about two meters high, are the standard homeowner defense against the sea in many parts of the country. Yet none of the natural marsh shorelines were impaired. The marshes, which extended 10 to 40 meters from the shore, had lost no sediment or elevation from Irene. Although the storm initially reduced the density of their vegetation by more than a third, a year later the greenery had bounced back and was as thick as ever in many cases.\nGittman\u2019s study confirmed what many experts had begun to suspect. \u201cArmored\u201d shorelines such as bulkheads offer less protection against big storms than people think. By reflecting wave energy instead of dispersing it, they tend to wear away at the base, which causes them to gradually tilt seaward. Although they still function well in typical storms, they often backfire when high storm surges overtop them, causing them to breach or collapse, releasing an entire backyard into the sea.\nIn a later study, Gittman and other researchers surveyed 689 waterfront owners and found that the 37 percent of properties protected by bulkheads had suffered 93 percent of the damage. And bulkhead owners routinely had four times the annual maintenance costs of residents who relied on nature instead. Salt marshes bent but did not break.\nIn recent years more scientists and policy makers have come to believe that \u201cliving shorelines\u201d\u2014natural communities of salt marsh, mangrove, oyster reef, beach and coral reef\u2014can be surprisingly effective in a battle coastal residents have been losing for years. U.S. shores are disintegrating as higher seas, stronger storms and runaway development trigger an epidemic of erosion and flood damage. Every day waves bite off another 89 hectares of the country.

Tiger Woods has done it again. Woods is a Masters champion for the fifth time in his illustrious, storied career.\nAfter an 11-year drought, golf's most polarizing and popular figure has added another major to his dossier, outlasting a star-studded leaderboard on Sunday by posting a final round 2-under 70 to win the 2019 Masters. It's his first major win since the 2008 U.S. Open, 15th of his career and first at Augusta National since 2005. With five green jackets now in his Augusta locker, Woods is second all-time at the pristine course behind only Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986.\nWoods began the day T2 and in the final pairing for the first time since 2007, but he sat two strokes off leader Francesco Molinari, who had been steady all week. Molinari led throughout much of the day, in fact, until double-bogeys on No. 12 and No. 15 opened a small window for Tiger to pounce -- and pounce he did. Woods birdied the par-5 13th hole and par-5 15th for the third time this week, then birdied the par-3 16th with a near-hole-in-one. He walked up to No. 17 with a two-stroke lead on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, and when Koepka missed a birdie putt on 18 that would have put pressure on Woods, Tiger was able to clinch it with a bogey on the final hole.\n\"I was just trying to plod my way around the golf course all day, then all of a sudden I had the lead, and coming up 18, it was just trying to make a 5,\" said Woods. \"When I tapped the putt in, I don't know what I did, but I know I screamed. And then I was just looking for Joey. I shook the guys' hands and then found Joey, and it was a pretty big embrace. To have my kids there, it's come full circle. My dad was here in 1997 and now i'm the dad with two kids there.\"\nWoods becomes a five-time Masters winner on Sunday, which stands alone as the second-most in the sport's history ahead of Arnold Palmer. Only Jack Nicklaus, who won six, has more. The victory marks Woods' first at Augusta since 2005, when he capped an incredible decade of dominance at the event he also won in 1997, 2000 and 2001.\n\"It's overwhelming,\" said Woods of winning for a fifth time. \"I think just because of what has transpired, and last year i was just very lucky to be playing again. The previous dinner, the champions dinner, I was really struggling and missed a couple years of not playing this great tournament. To now be the champion, 22 years between wins is a long time.

Part of the money was also used to acquire seven capuchin monkeys in late 1965, according to an article in the Jan. 20, 1966, Humboldt Standard newspaper.\nThe llamas and peccaries came from Fleishhacker Zoo in San Francisco and a 9-year-old chimpanzee named Ziggy was bought for $300 from a private dealer in San Rafael. Zookeeper Fred Hennefer and park foreman Ben Adan transported the animals from the Bay Area to Eureka.\nThe two llamas were both males weighing close to 200 pounds each and were obtained for $350. Zoo staffers weren\u2019t sure what gender the peccaries were at the time of purchase, according to the Humboldt Standard.\nZiggy joined one of the zoo\u2019s most famous residents, Bill the chimpanzee, who lived at the local zoo for 50 years. Bill was at least 62 years old when he died in 2007, according to the Sequoia Park Zoo website. Ziggy died in 1996.\nAlso new to the Eureka zoo in early 1966 was a snake pit, which housed two boa constrictors acquired in late 1965. According to the Humboldt Standard article, zoo officials also expected to purchase two Sitka deer and one axis deer from an Oregon deer farm later in 1966.\nAccording to current zoo director Gretchen Ziegler, there are now 184 animals housed at Sequoia Park Zoo.

Athletes of pro football accomplish feats that seem impossible to us mere mortals as we watch the games unfold from the comforts of our living rooms or tucked away in the stands. With so many unique entities inhabiting the football universe, it's hard to truly decipher who the truly transcendent players are. Oddly enough, sometimes we understand it best with what disappoints us, rather than what impresses us.\nOn Monday there was that sense of foolish disappointment looking at the box score for Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt. Wait, he only tallied 101 rushing yards in Kansas City's 29-20 victory over the Redskins? No 50-yard runs or end-zone trips? We'd come to expect more, after all, from the player who took his first 47 career carries for 401 yards and scored six total touchdowns.\nIt's in the moments when you realize that a workhorse-like 25-touch, 121 total-yardage game internally registers as a letdown that reality sets in. Hunt is in the middle of a truly special season.\nThe NFL just witnessed a transcendent season from a rookie running back last season. Drafting Ezekiel Elliott with the fourth-overall pick, and the subsequent selection of Dak Prescott, changed the trajectory of the Dallas Cowboys. Elliott was a tone-setter for the 2016 Cowboys, an engine for their drive to the NFC's No. 1 seed while quickly becoming the story of the season. Through four games, it's not outrageous to suggest that Hunt, a third-round draft pick, is set to have an even better campaign.\nAll running backs are products of their environment. No rusher can truly function without proper blocking and even great backs -- see Todd Gurley's 2016 -- can be foiled when planted in a poisonous offensive soil. The mark of a good back is being able to succeed in well-established conditions and getting the yards blocked for them. The great backs are the ones who create yards beyond just what they're given.\nHunt has been the best back this season at creating on his own. Through the first four games, he's gained an average of 6.1 more yards after a defender closes within one yard of him (NFL average is 3.6), leading the NFL among running backs with more than 25 carries.\nFor comparison's sake, Elliott in 2016 averaged 4.4 yards after defenders closed within a yard of him. He ranked third in that category among backs with more than 200 carries. Elliott is a special player in the open field, a threat to break tackles and take any run for six. So far, Hunt looks like Elliott's equal in that regard.\nIn his first few games it was easy to say that Hunt's stats were boosted by big runs. Indeed, plays like the 69-yard run against the Chargers to close out a Week 3 contest did boost his overall statistical finish.\nHowever, what we saw out of Hunt against Washington was a more sustaining runner. While the massive highlight reel runs didn't come in waves, he consistently gained positive yardage, going down for a loss on only two carries. Hunt stacked"}

However, the EUR/USD pared the overnight rally to 1.4441 and the single-currency may face additional headwinds over the near-term as European policy struggle to address the risk for contagion.\nDuring the unscheduled meeting on May 6, the EU pledged to review the lending terms of the EUR 110B bailout for Greece in order to avoid the region's first sovereign debt restructuring, but the record-high financing costs faced by the European periphery will continue to bear down on market sentiment as investors fear the a breakup of the monetary union. In turn, the small correction in the single-currency could be short-lived, and the EUR/USD may continue to push lower over the near-term as it breaks out of the upward trend from earlier this year. As the euro-dollar struggles to hold above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 high to the 2010 low around 1.4430-50, the overnight rally may taper off going into the North American trade, but speculation for higher borrowing costs may help to prop out the single-currency as the European Central Bank sticks to its one and only mandate to ensure price stability. Despite the ongoing turmoil within Europe's financial system, market participants still see the ECB raising the benchmark interest rate by 75bp over the next 12-months according to Credit Suisse overnight index swaps, and the EUR/USD may face range-bound price action in the coming days as investors weigh the prospects for future policy.\nThe British Pound struggled to hold its ground as home prices in the U.K. marked the biggest decline in seven-months, and the GBP/USD may threaten the upward trend from earlier this year as we are likely to see the Bank of England maintain a dovish outlook in its quarterly inflation report, which is due out on May 11. As growth and inflation cools, BoE Governor Mervyn King should retain a neutral tone for future policy, and the central bank head may talk down speculation for higher borrowing in the U.K. as he aims to encourage a sustainable recovery. As the GBP/USD approaches the 50-Day SMA at 1.6286, we may see the near-term reversal in the exchange rate gather pace later this week, and the sterling may face additional selling pressures over the near-term as the DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index now highlights a bearish outlook for the pair. The contrarian indicator suggests we will see additional declines in the exchange rate as retail traders are now net long against the GBP/USD, and comment from the BoE will certainly dictate future price action for the pair as investors weigh the outlook for monetary policy.\nAs equity futures foreshadow a higher open for the U.S. market, the rebound in risk appetite should carry into the North American trade, and the U.S. dollar may lose ground throughout the day as investors move into higher-yielding currencies.

{"idx": "29918", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Washington, D.C.- Radio Free Asia (RFA) conducted an exclusive interview with Le Quang Liem, a long-standing leader of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church in Vietnam. RFA recently learned that the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has accused him of espionage on behalf of unnamed foreign powers. RFA contacted Liem in Ho Chi Minh City and spoke with him on the morning of August 28. The interview was aired in its entirety on August 28 during the 9 to 10 p.m. broadcast to Vietnam. Among his remarks to RFA's Vietnamese service, Le Quang Liem, 80, shared several important pieces of information. The government of Vietnam accuses him, through an intensive press campaign, of being the henchman of foreign powers to plot the \"overthrow of the legal and constitutional government of Vietnam.\" This campaign began in April. Conversely, the CPV had also informally sought Liem's cooperation to be made chairman of an advisory committee on religious questions. \"I have refused and said it will not do. Why, they asked me. I said that... a religion should be independent and not be an appurtenance of the government. Let them organize a public conference gathering all the major leaders of the Hoa Hao in the nation - the conference can even be presided over by a government person - and let them present their opinions. Only then can we know what they want. And to start with, the government should not interfere or try to guide them one way or the other. This will not do.\" He also spoke of his rebuff of an attempt to draw him into a scheme that would have embarrassed the government on April 30 - the anniversary of the fall of Saigon. In response to the suggestion Liem said, \"my stand is a purely religious stand, I do not engage in politics and I do not cause disturbances. My struggle, while very tough, is also non-violent. I believe that all violence and sabotage only causes misery to people and harms them.\" Even if a grenade can kill a communist leader, he would be replaced right away by another, according to Mr. Liem. \"That is why I believe that killing people is not the solution whereas the real need of the Vietnamese people at the present time is freedom, the restoration of freedom.

We will investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HIV-infected patients and evaluate their relationship to antiretroviral (ARV) plasma concentrations as a means of individualizing treatment based on race/ethnicity. Project goal: The objective of this project is to determine the frequency of CYP3A5 polymorphism at the 6986A>G locus among different racial/ethnic groups, and to examine the relationship of this polymorphism to trough plasma concentrations of ATV and LPV in substance abusers versus non-substance abusers. CYP3A5 plays an important role in drug metabolism of a wide variety of substrates such as HIV-1 PIs. CYP3A5 expression is highly polymorphic and enzyme activity varies among different populations depending on their racial ancestry. The main limitation of PIs is the interpatient variability in their pharmacokinetics (PK) which results primarily from interindividual variation in activity of cytochrome CYP3A. The HIV-1 PIs, ATV and LPV, are widely used in potent ARV therapy. Thus, the central hypothesis of this study is that CYP3A5 genotype is correlated with the extent of drug metabolism of specific ARV therapy and genotype-based therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial for patients by facilitating the attainment of target plasma ARV concentrations."}

They are dust-covered reminders of the the chili suppers that took place before home games, when townswomen brought in their cream pies and chocolate steam cakes.\nThe locker rooms are suffocating, barely wide enough for two players going opposite directions to pass.

But in the 1950s, players would leave them unlatched so they could sneak in to shoot in the dark gym.\nThe producers of \u201cHoosiers\u201d saw the magic.

{"idx": "29929", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Josh Gilder put himself on the map recently. He wrote the speech that Ronald Reagan, poised dramatically under a bust of Lenin, delivered to students at Moscow State University. The event was a highpoint of the Moscow summit.\nNow Josh Gilder is working for George Bush - crafting the first of many speeches which he hopes will help put the vice-president over the top in the fall elections.\n``I'm struggling with the transition, because I'm writing for a candidate versus the President,'' says the youthful Mr. Gilder, even though he is not a newcomer to the Bush operation. He worked as a Bush speechriter for two years before being tapped for the presidential job in late 1985.\nThe struggle is understandable. The President's delivery is so impeccable that even a bad speech can be made to sound good. Vice-President Bush, on the other hand, does not have the reputation of a good speaker, especially when he is viewed on television.\nBush, he adds, although he is younger than Reagan, is a more old-fashioned politician who got his experience on the stump in Texas, delivering extemporaneous remarks on the back of a pick-up truck five times a day. Reagan, by contrast, is a politician of the television age.\nIf Bush does not come through well on TV, says Gilder, his strengths lie in his knowledge of the issues and the fact that he is an honest man. ``He couldn't dissemble if he tried,'' says the speechwriter.\nIt is clear that Gilder already is thinking in terms of Bush as a doer, perhaps in response to the Democrats' effort to build up Dukakis as a pragmatic manager. ``Reagan is the great visionary and Bush is the man that can implement that vision,'' he says.\nHe cites the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Arms) Treaty. The ``vision'' was the two-track policy of negotiation and deployment that led to the treaty. But it was George Bush who convinced the allies to move ahead with deployment of the nuclear missiles in the face of domestic opposition.\nA political speechwriter does not make up his own ideas, of course. He seeks to capture and embody his client's views and values. In the case of Reagan, says Gilder, he went back to the President's 1964 ``A Time for Choice'' speech in support of Barry Goldwater to understand his most fundamental views.\nIt helps, of course, to share those views. Although he attended Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts institution where he studied literature and music, Gilder is an unabashed conservative. After graduation he wrote for such conservative periodicals as American Spectator, the Wall Street Journal, and New Criterion.\nAfter joining the White House in 1983, Gilder's first speech for Bush was for a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating entrepreneurs. Later he wrote more substantial pieces, including the speech Bush delivered at a foreign policy conference in Vienna in 1983 on Yalta, in which he declared that the West would never accept the division of Europe.\nDuring his two years with Bush, he says, the vice-president penned a great deal himself. Sometimes he wrote out his ideas on a legal pad aboard a plane and handed it to a writer for crafting just before a public appearance.\nThere is an art to writing for presidents and politicians. Gilder takes issue on which - when writing for someone for who is not a brilliant speaker - short, choppy sentences are called for.\nSpeechwriting for the President is not a"}

Just three days prior, vandals had spray-painted \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d on grave markers in Deir Yassin\u2019s cemetery.\nAs the participants carried the names along what was once the main street of a thriving Palestinian village, it was most often children who stopped to listen to Zochrot\u2019s Umar Al-Ghubari recount the significance of a particular location along the way, or to read the names of the dead.\nThe Deir Yassin massacre was a pivotal moment of the Nakba and in the lead-up to the 1948 War. Some 100-200 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed by the extremist Zionist militias the Irgun (Etzel) and Stern Gang (Lehi). Some were shot in battle, others executed. Others were killed when grenades were thrown into their houses. In some cases, whole families were gunned down.\nExact numbers of the dead were disputed from the start, as even the perpetrators of the massacre inflated the death toll in order to sow terror throughout other Palestinian communities so that they would flee their homes. Other villages did indeed flee in fear, but the massacre also cemented the motivation of neighboring Arab countries to fight rather than accept partition.\nA member of the Hagana Zionist militia present for Thursday\u2019s procession recounted his role in the massacre: removing the bodies after the Irgun and Stern Gang had done most of the dirty work. He described it as the worst thing he ever experienced.\nMy grandmother\u2019s cousin, Naziha Radwan, was six at the time of the massacre. She survived by covering herself in her grandmother\u2019s blood, hiding beneath stiffened bodies and pretending to be dead.\nIt was hard to imagine these horrific events taking place on what now is a busy city street lined with shops and restaurants, eventually terminating in a park with playgrounds, basketball courts, and the Kfar Shaul mental hospital, whose buildings include a few of the original homes that were once the center of the village. Across the valley lies the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. In the aftermath of the massacre, prominent Jewish scholars, including Martin Buber, urged Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to leave Deir Yassin uninhabited, or at least that its settlement be postponed, writing that it had become \u201cinfamous throughout the"}

I was then inspired by Tim Ferris to live a 4-hour workweek. But my business only took off when I forced myself (OK, was forced) to go on vacation.\nBut then I had to stop and smell the roses. My wife and I now go on vacation every two months, whether it's a road trip, a domestic flight, an international trip or renting a house with friends. I wish I could say, \u201cIt\u2019s the best business decision I've ever made!\u201d But she still has to twist my arm a bit. Vacations still need to be forced into my schedule.\nYet, time after time, going on vacation proves to be the ultimate business strategy.\nOf course, I've had to make changes. If I didn\u2019t, my practice would\u2019ve completely fallen apart. These improvements have enabled us to sustain our lifestyle and afforded me time to work on my side hustles.\nI haven\u2019t figured it all out yet, but I am determined to do so. Here are some of the tools and techniques I use.\n1. Prioritize your vacation as a SMART goal.\nGeorge T. Doran has been credited with coining SMART goals. Vacation plans are naturally \"SMART.\" They are Specific, Measurable, Assigned, Realistic and Time-Bound. Pick the place, set the date, pay for the trip and go.\nIf you think about it, none of us really have 365 days a year to work. Weekends and work holidays erase more than 100. What you really have is 200 days a year to make it happen. Plan and prioritize accordingly.\n2. Create recurring and passive income streams.\nAre you beholden to billable hours? Then you don't own a business \u2014 you have a job with no paid vacation.\nI productized my service so clients can subscribe by credit card. Now I get paid even while I'm away. Paying percentage points to my processing vendors is worth it.\nIf you hate billing and collections like I do, create subscribers, not customers. Passive income is even better (via investments, affiliate arrangements, etc.).\n4. Hire the right partners, managers and experts.\nYou and your team should be able to work from anywhere.\nCaptain Jean-Luc Picard had his number one. Who's yours? Hire your No. 1 as quickly as possible to help out when you're away. He or she can be a virtual assistant, but a vested right-hand COO \"commander\" has worked better for me. All of my businesses have been partnerships. Like marriages, making them work is worth it.\n5. Identify vulnerabilities and continuously improve.\nNothing shows cracks in your processes like going on vacation. Of course, this presumes your team follows standard operating procedures. But it's your responsibility as the owner to work on your business systems, as Michael Gerber advises.\nSystems are more than just checklists. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline, wants us to leverage our systems' interdependencies. The best systems create whole value beyond the sum of its parts. A business is a system of systems; it's much more valuable when the owner isn't its key vulnerability.\n6. Return refreshed and rejuvenated.\nSome of our vacations are more hectic than day-to-day business life. And many"}

{"idx": "29942", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Benchmarking guru Howard Rubin says companies get it wrong when valuing their IT. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they must change.\nIn times of economic crisis, companies are quick to slash IT costs. With fears of a recession looming over the corporate world, CIOs are facing the axe once again. But no matter how many times CIOs proclaim their strategic value--or the strategic value of their departments--businesses too often view IT as a cost, plain and simple.\nIT executives have been rallying against that perception for years, but they're getting little attention. Howard Rubin says it's about time that changed.\nAn IT benchmarking pioneer and self-proclaimed \"metrics arms dealer,\" Rubin is a former fellow with corporate strategy consultancy Norton, Nolan & Co., where he developed metrics for application portfolios and helped create the balanced business scorecard. He also serves as a senior adviser to Gartner and a research affiliate to the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management. A former executive vice president of META Group and professor emeritus of computer science at Hunter College of the City University of New York, Rubin has been an IT adviser to the U.S., Canadian, Indian and other governments.\nRubin says businesses see better results when they make sound IT investments during economic downturns. When they don't, they run the risk of falling behind competitors. And the cost of catching up, he says, can be insurmountable.\nBut CIOs are as guilty as their bosses in misinterpreting the true value of IT investments. To turn the tables, Rubin says, IT executives must recast the conventional language around IT expenditures and strategy.\nRubin recently spoke with CIO Insight online editor Brian P. Watson about what companies do wrong in valuing their IT investments, and what CIOs must do to change that perception. What follows is an edited transcript of their discussion.\nCIO INSIGHT: What's the biggest problem today with the way companies view their IT investments?\nRubin: It's been a long-term problem: Most companies view their IT investment as a cost and therefore they try to minimize the cost.\nCorporate leaders always ask me how they can use benchmarks to compare themselves with their peers, and how they can compare against best in class. Best in class, in conventional wisdom, is typically who's doing IT for the least amount of dollars, relative to revenue, relative to operating expense. Best in class sometimes is synonymous with who's the low cost in IT. That's a big problem, because the low cost may not be the best user of IT. When people talk about understanding how to calibrate themselves, they need to redefine best in class in terms of the aspirations of the business. Best in class could be, what's the spending pattern of the companies that are most profitable in our industry the last three years, or what are the spending patterns of the companies that have increased their business performance earnings per share the last three years?\nCompanies treat IT like a cost and look for outside validation to drive costs down. They really should be looking at the outcome. What should I do with my IT strategy, my IT investment; am I maximizing return? That's better from a business perspective.\nCompanies understand that IT produces value. But they view IT as a cost because it's so much harder to figure out where the value shows up in terms they can get their hands on. They gravitate to what's tangible, and what's tangible is the budget item.\nWhen you look at annual reports, go to"}

Judging by the fretful litany of symptoms that pops up in my newsfeed during flu season, this is still a socially acceptable response to illness.\nThe Internet is also an acceptable outlet for admissions of physical insecurities, personal failings, and up-to-the-minute reporting on any and all inconveniences. This isn\u2019t new. People love to whine. In Stalinist Russia, though it could be deadly, there was a culture of public complaint. Stores might not have had items on the shelves, but they did have comment books. Criticism and self-criticism were practices not only encouraged, but outright demanded of conscious citizens.\nThankfully, the stakes are not so high for my peers.

I know this because I\u2019ve done my fair share of sobbing into the virtual void and no one said anything about it to my face. The only problem is that, while the behavior may now seem appropriate, whining will forever be a petty, unpleasant, primitive mode of expressing oneself. Even condensed and abbreviated for social media, it still grates.\nWe will probably always be allowed to indulge our primal need to complain about lack of money, lack of sleep, bad weather, and bad traffic. Everyone experiences these. When it comes to the very specific grievances of our vastly different lives, however, there\u2019s no reason for us to expect anyone to be interested. Even if we were to catch people\u2019s attention with our incessant grumbling, we can\u2019t expect them to solve our problems for us. Crowdsourcing is not that effective.\nFor many Millenials, then, it\u2019s a matter of confession.

The situation begs itself to be shared. And when it is, we\u2019re relieved to see how we\u2019re all such amateurs.

At ground level, Forest Service markers show the ongoing, powerful march of vegetation: In some areas it\ufffds advancing as fast as 5 feet a year.\nBut this isn\ufffdt a natural calamity. It\ufffds almost entirely man-made.\nIts genesis is in the attempts, going back as far as the 1930s, to stabilize certain areas of the dunes near towns or ports or to build roads or parking lots on the sand.\nTo do so, the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies before it, planted European beachgrass and Scotch broom and many trees. Tellingly, the trees introduced by humans form perfect rows.\nEveryone now agrees that was an ecological mistake. The invasive species created a mountainous foredune at the point where the beach and the dunes meet, behind which wetlands replaced what had been dry, open sand. There and elsewhere vegetation has proliferated.\nSo what happens to the areas of illicit OHV trails, if the Forest Service shuts them to OHV use?\nIn areas still dominated by native vegetation, environmentalists and the Forest Service hope native species will overgrow the trails.

In Colorado and Washington, medical marijuana measures passed, but one in Arizona was rejected.\nThere were 10 questions on the ballot and seven passed.\nRejected was Question 8 to bounce the lieutenant governor from the job as president of the Senate where he or she steers the course of debate.\nAlso turned down were Question 6 to allow a tax break on property that conserved water and Question 7 that would have imposed a sales tax on items purchased from local government stores.\nThere was overwhelming approval for Question 5 to limit the length of the Legislature, which in 1995 and 1997, both lasted 169 days.\nSenate Majority Leader William Raggio, R-Reno, a leading proponent, said leadership has already set a timetable to conduct its business within the 120 day limit. There will be deadlines for each house to pass its bills, except in certain cases. And committee actions must be taken by certain dates.\nThe 1997 session cost a record $15.5 million, and this is expected to reduce the cost several million dollars.\nAlthough opposed by most law enforcement officer, Question 9 on medical marijuana handily won passage 58-41 percent. But it must be approved again at the 2000 election before it is written into the Constitution. It is patterned after the California initiative, which has run into trouble from federal law enforcement officials.\nBut the Justice Department has agreed to take another look at the possibility of allowing a government-supervised use of marijuana as a treatment for certain sick people. This would be a major reversal of the policy of the department, which since January has filed suit seeking to close at least six California \"marijuana clubs\" that supply members, including disease sufferers, with the drug.\n--Question 1: changed the Constitution to resolve a conflict when competing issues appear on the election ballot and both win. The one with the most votes is considered victorious.\n--Question 2: Removed the state Judicial Discipline Commission from under the authority of the Nevada Supreme Court and put it under the Legislature. The commission was given more independence in setting its rules and has the authority now to open investigations without waiting for a complaint.\n--Question 3: The Legislature is now empowered to allow district judges to hold court outside the county seat. The impetus for the change came from Nye County where the population center of Pahrump is more than 100 miles from Tonopah, the county seat. But this could apply in Clark County to such places as Laughlin and Mesquite.\n--Question 4: An advisory ballot issue whether Nevada Day should be changed from Oct. 31 to the last Friday in October so there will be a three-day weekend. It will be up to the 1999 Legislature to change the law, if it wants.\n--Question 17: The Nevada Constitution will now have the so-called \"scarlet letter\" on term limits.

But why do we celebrate Easter and why is it so late this year?\nEaster is only days away with many getting ready for some time off work and school thanks to the bank holiday in the UK. The holiday, which is celebrated across the world, will start with Good Friday on April 19 and end on Easter Monday on April 22. Then celebration means Britons can soon tuck into copious amounts of chocolate eggs - but do you know why Easter is being celebrated?\nEaster is a Christian holiday that celebrates the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nIn the New Testament of the Bible, the event is said to have occurred three days after Jesus was crucified by the Romans and died in roughly 30 AD.\nJesus was arrested by the Roman authorities, essentially because he claimed to be the \u201cSon of God\u201d, and was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate.\nJesus\u2019 death by crucifixion, marked by the Christian holiday Good Friday and subsequent resurrection three days later is said to have been done to prove that he was the living son of God.\nEaster also concludes the \u201cPassion of Christ\u201d - a series of events and holidays that begins with Lent.\nLent is a 40-day fasting period which comes before Easter in the Christian and is a time for reflection in Christian traditions as well as for preparations before the celebration of Easter begins.\nLent ends of Holy Thursday, which celebrates Jesus\u2019 Last Supper with his 12 apostles.\nThe Easter holiday in the UK begin on Good Friday on which Jesus\u2019 crucifixion is observed and end on Easter Sunday.\nEaster is a moveable celebration so it can be hard to keep up to date on when it starts.\nEaster falls on the first Sunday after the Full Moon date, based on mathematical calculations, that falls on or after March 21.\nIn 325 AD the Council of Nicaea ruled Easter would be held on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox.\nHowever, if a the Full Moon falls on a Sunday, then Passover begins on a Sunday, so Easter is then delayed by a week to make sure it still occurs after Passover.\nEaster can be celebrated at anytime between March 22 and April 25, and this year\u2019s holiday is coming towards the end.\nEaster Sunday in 2019 will fall on April 21, meaning Good Friday will be on April 19 and the Easter bank holiday on April 22.\nThis is different from other Christian celebrations such as Christmas, which falls on the same date every year."}

I\u2019m a huge and longtime fan of Pinker\u2019s, and his book The Blank Slate was, for me, a revelation. [Pinker]\u2019s become a deep and important critic of the visceral hostility to nature and science now so sadly prevalent on the left and right, a defender of reason and the Enlightenment against the \u2018social justice\u2019 movements on campus, and his new book is a near-relentless defense of modernity.\n\u201cI sat there for an hour slowly being buried in a fast-accumulating snowdrift of irrefutable statistics showing [amazing] human progress: the decline of violence and war, the rise and rise of democracy, the astonishing gains against poverty of the last couple of decades, the rise of tolerance and erosion of cruelty, lengthening lifespans, revolutions in health, huge increases in safety, and on and on. It was one emphatic graph after another that bludgeoned my current depression into a kind of forced rational cheeriness.\u201d In other words, this guy Pinker had been accumulating data to show that \u2014 in a universal way all over the world \u2014 all of our problems are getting better.\nBut how many of you when I said, \u201cThe decline of violence and war,\u201d responded, \u201cWait a minute! There is not any decline\u2026\u201d?

What do you mean less war? What do you mean less violence?\u201d Well, statistically, worldwide war is happening much less \u2014 so is violence \u2014 according to the stats.\nBut in your living experience, it\u2019s kind of contradictory because it doesn\u2019t seem so, but that\u2019s the point.

What that means is we have forgotten the human flourishing, we\u2019ve forgotten the goodness, we have forgotten the happiness, the contentment that comes from a common idea of morality. My word in this case for virtue, and a concept of morality that is based our nature.\nThese two paragraphs to me are dynamite. In the first place, \u201cour gloom is largely self-imposed and is entirely a function of our media and news diets.\u201d I could not agree more!

Of those, about 370,000 are said to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition \u2014 it means they are 10 times more likely to die than malnourished children because their immune system has been dramatically weakened.\nAs that figure continues to rise, images like this are emerging from the country, where a civil war broke out last year.\nDespite some international attention, the situation has continued to deteriorate. The conflict has pushed the country to the brink of famine; in many remote villages, mothers themselves are too malnourished to feed their children.\nMajed Ayyash, a 21-month-old child who suffered from severe malnutrition, is one of the fortunate ones in the country's capital, Sanaa, because his family managed to get him to a hospital.\nBut even when families manage to get their children medical help, the remaining doctors and nurses are forced to work with limited supplies and almost no equipment. A number of medical facilities in the country have been frequently targeted by airstrikes.\nFootage obtained by Save the Children \u2014 the UK-based humanitarian group has operated in the country since 1963 and supports 160 facilities there \u2014 and provided to BuzzFeed News shows children on ventilators, struggling even as they receive treatment in a Sanaa hospital.\nA full-blown civil war began in February last year after Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee Sanaa. Since then, the Houthis have continuously clashed with Hadi, who is supported by local militia and tribespeople in the predominantly Sunni south of the country. Hadi says the Houthis are proxies for Iran, an allegation that Iran has denied. As a result, the Saudi-led coalition that has offered its support to Hadi has been engaged in airstrikes that have claimed thousands of lives, many of them civilians.\nYemen, which imports 90% of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world before the outbreak of war, according to the Associated Press. Nearly 18 months into a Saudi-led blockade, the situation has become worse.\nThis is 2-year-old Hanadi Dawod. He had acute malnutrition because his family was unable to afford food for him.\nSince the beginning of the war last year, the average cost of a food basket has gone up by 26%. Since April, the price has increased by 13%, according to a World Food Program Market Watch report in July. The situation has become so dire that according to Doctors Without Borders, it had to increase its staff's wages by up to 50% in some regions just so they could continue to buy food.\nIn March, 10 out of 22 governorates in Yemen were considered on the brink of famine. Now, all but two are, according to a recent BBC report.\nAli Mohammed al-Tawaari, a six-month-old boy, was being treated in Sanaa for acute malnutrition and other complications.\n\"If you look at his face, you"}

Of the last 46 slams, all but eight have been won by Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer.\nA career-best victory over Federer in the quarter-finals followed by an epic semi-final against John Isner kept Anderson on court for nearly 11 hours so it was no surprise that he was not as his best to start with.\nBut he made a real fight of it in the third set where he held five set points.\n"}

The facility was known as \"High Street Haunted House\" due to frequent ghost sightings. Only its facade was preserved as a monument. Chung was substituting for an overnight guard in the complex, more commonly known as the High Street Haunted House. He was found unconscious at 9.30am by his colleague who called in the police. Paramedics declared Chung dead upon arrival. He started his shift at 11pm Sunday and had been patrolling until 1am. He had not been seen since then. Chung's family could not contact him and reported him missing at 8am. He had heart disease and asthma. Police took his medication for investigations. A post-mortem examination will be carried out. The complex was previously a female ward for mental health patients in 1939, and became a mental health outpatient clinic after the opening of the Castle Peak Hospital in 1961. Following its vacancy in 1971, the building was later badly damaged by two fires that were said to have been started by trespassers. The building was repurposed and became the Sai Ying Pun Community Complex in 1998, and its granite facade in the style of early Baroque architecture was preserved. The complex is now a historic building. It was coined as the \"High Street Haunted House\" because there were rumors of it being used as an execution hall by Japanese troops during World War II and only became a mental health facility after the war. Two film stars, Jacky Cheung Hok-yau and Eric Tsang Chi-wai, were rumored to have been at the center of a scare while on location during filming of Blood Brother. Cheung was said to have been waiting to be filmed but staff said they saw him enter the building. An old man was also seen loitering around and suddenly disappeared soon after. Tsang got scared and told the crew to burn incense if they wanted to film anything at the location again."}

A raid in Brussels' Forrest neighborhood last Tuesday killed an Algerian with suspected ISIS ties, but Abdeslam was believed to have escaped back to his childhood haunt of Molenbeek, a largely Muslim immigrant neighborhood just outside central Brussels.

We had a chance to talk Gunsmith with Michael, as well as hear about what&apos;s in his personal gun collection.\nHow many options are there for weapons customization in GRFS?\nThere are 52 guns in the game, each with up to 10 points of customization. There are 20 million plus possible combinations that the user can choose from.\nWhat are some of the real weapons that have inspired you in developing GRFS?\nAll the weapons in the game are either based on real firearms or inspired by real firearms. In the event we get our hands on the actual gun, we use that information about recoil impulses, muzzle climb, maneuverability, etc., and try to incorporate that into the weapon design in the game.\nWhat are some of the highlights of your personal collection?\nMy personal favorite right now is a bolt action rifle that I just rebuilt from the ground up. It&apos;s nothing special, but knowing that I took the rifle from a pile of parts to a completed gun capable of shooting accurately 800 yards out is pretty gratifying.\nWhat&apos;s your favorite Ghost Recon Future Soldier feature?\nCall me biased, but I would have to say Gunsmith is my favorite feature. I love having the ability to customize my weapons according to my personal preferences and play style. My favorite map has to be Alpha, which is inspired by the location of the Ghost Recon Alpha short film. For me, the map size is perfect for 6 vs. 6, and the multiple elevation levels and flanking routes are great for my play style.\nFor more on Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and for the chance to win great prizes, including your own copy of the game, go to complex.com/teamghost."}

Under the \"start here\" are the words \"Oakland Community College\" and under the \"finish here\" are the words \"Oakland University.\"\nIt's part of a advertising campaign to convince students to start their higher-education careers at OCC and then go to Oakland University to finish up the last two years. It's a unique push for cooperation instead of competition for students.\nBut it's more than just a billboard. It's a reflection of new OCC chancellor Peter Provenzano's philosophy: It's not about competing with other institutions for students, its about cooperating with them to make it the best possible outcome for students.\n\"There are hundreds of ways to compete, but thousands of ways to collaborate,\" he told the Free Press recently.\nMore: Why aren't there more Michigan community college graduates?\nMore: Retirement payout for Wayne County Community College District leader?\nOakland University likes the partnership as well.\n\"It's a visible demonstration of a close relationship we have with OCC,\" said John Young, Oakland University's vice president of communications and marketing. \"For students who aren't sure what to do, it says to them it should be straightforward to start at OCC and finish up at Oakland University. It acknowledges that there's a large segment of students who aren't coming here and spending four straight years here and then being done.\"\nThe partnership makes sense for the two public institutions. More than 40 percent of Oakland University's students come from Oakland County. Oakland University is the leading destination for students transferring from OCC.\nIt also makes sense for students to transfer \u2014 tuition at OCC is $92 per credit hour for Oakland County residents. The base tuition rate for in-state students at Oakland University is just under $430 per credit hour.\nOCC has a similar partnership with Walsh College.\nThese efforts differentiate OCC from many in Michigan's community college system who have been lobbying for years for Michigan's legislature to change laws to allow them to offer four-year degrees.\n\"I understand why some (community colleges), especially those in rural areas, want to offer four-year degrees,\" Provenzano said, noting there are often no other options in those counties. That's not the case in Oakland County.\n\"We have a unique niche. We want to be the connector. The future of higher education is like a super highway. There are lots of entrance and exits ramps.\"\nProvenzano is new in his role. After getting bumped up from chief financial officer to interim chancellor in May 2017 after then-chancellor Timothy Meyer was suddenly let go, Provenzano was named the permanent chancellor in January 2018. He was formally installed last week in a traditional academic ceremony attended by students, staff, faculty and representatives from other higher-education institutions.\nOCC is one of the largest community colleges in the state, depending on how students are counted, with an unduplicated headcount of more than 30,000 students and an annual expense budget of more than $168 million.\nProvenzano didn't always see himself running a college.\nHe started out as an auditor for Plante & Moran.

While the result of the learning process is not to be dismissed, it is quite simply the joy of the learning journey that motivates Learners -- the process of learning is not the means to an end, but the end itself. It isn\u2019t necessarily the usefulness of the information that excites those with Learner talents; that is more of a hallmark of Input. It\u2019s taking a class, signing up for a webinar series, reading a series of articles that delve deeply into a topic, getting an advanced degree -- these are activities that light up Learners. People high in Learner are inquisitive, but this is not typically expressed in asking a lot of random questions about any or all topics. Rather, satisfying the inquisitive itch for a Learner typically takes the form of deep and thorough exploration through individual research online or in the library, taking a class, or spending regular time with a subject matter expert. Learners can take pleasure in random learning opportunities like online classes, seminars, lecture series or workshops. But those with high Learner may also seek to become subject matter experts themselves, learning whatever they need to in order to achieve mastery. Lifelong learning comes naturally and is a primary motivator -- you\u2019re never too old to learn something new.\n\u2022 You love to learn -- and you love to help others learn as well, which makes you a natural teacher. You individualize your approach so others can learn in the way that best suits them.\n\u2022 Your willingness to learn makes you open to change, and you learn all you can about the changes that will affect you and your team -- which makes you a great resource.\n\u2022 When others on your team are resistant to or fearful of change, you can break the information down for them and help them learn what they need to do to grow.\n\u2022 Your Learner talents may lead you to mastery of a particular subject area. Your expertise can help improve processes, troubleshoot problems or set a new, more productive course.\n\u2022 Because the process of learning excites you sometimes more than the subject matter itself, you might wander off into areas that are irrelevant to your and your team\u2019s performance.\n\u2022 Just because you love to learn, and you see knowledge as its own benefit, don\u2019t assume that is true for others. Some desire to learn only enough to get the job done.\n\u2022 Depending on your other themes, you may prefer to learn alone and can get lost in your world of learning. Bring others along -- share your learning.\n\u2022 Having mastery of a particular subject area does not necessarily make you the only expert in the room. Ask for and value the opinions and ideas of others.\n\u2022 The Power and Edge of Learner: Those with Learner among their Signature Themes find a deep satisfaction in putting the time and effort into learning a new skill, concept or methodology. This makes them valuable resources for their teams as they research, study and explore innovative new concepts that can help the team win.\n\u2022 The Vulnerabilities of Learner: Often, for those with strong Learner talents, learning is its own objective. Without proper focus, this can make learning, while enjoyable, irrelevant to the task at hand.\n\u2022 What are you learning about at the moment?

Many of these patients show up at hospitals with minor infections, sore throats, skin rashes, allergies, and back pain. Such visits can add to wait times in emergency rooms and drive up costs. Hospitals are many times more expensive than doctors\u2019 offices, urgent care clinics, and retail clinics.\nEmployers said they will tackle the issue by better educating their workers about the most appropriate places to get health care, and by designing insurance plans that discourage unnecessary trips to the emergency room. They have not yet detailed what these incentives might be, but the incentives could include lower out-of-pocket costs for visiting a primary-care doctor, higher costs for visiting a hospital \u2014 or both.\nThe initiative represents the first time that so many Massachusetts employers have coalesced around a particular driver of health care spending. It has the support of 20 business groups including Associated Industries of Massachusetts, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and Retailers Association of Massachusetts.\nHospitals, insurers, and the state Health Policy Commission \u2014 which tracks health spending \u2014 also back the effort.\nMillions of Massachusetts residents get health insurance through work, with their employers paying a significant portion of those costs. Business owners frequently complain that rising health care costs hamper their ability to hire and grow.\nState officials and academics have long tracked the inappropriate use of emergency rooms. But Massachusetts has not made progress in curbing unnecessary emergency room visits in at least five years, according to the Health Policy Commission \u2014 even though the vast majority of state residents have health insurance, and many have access to new walk-in clinics and telehealth services that provide alternatives to hospital care.\n\u201cUnfortunately, for many individuals, the emergency department becomes their main source of primary care,\u201d said David Seltz, executive director of the Health Policy Commission.\nThe Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians supports the business community\u2019s effort, but objects to estimates that peg avoidable emergency room visits at more than 40 percent. The group prefers a much lower estimate \u2014 3.3 percent \u2014 which was calculated using a much narrower definition.\nDr. Scott Weiner, president of the emergency physicians group, noted that it\u2019s much easier to call a visit \u201cavoidable\u201d after the fact. A patient who thinks he is suffering a heart attack may actually have severe heartburn, for example, but he wouldn\u2019t know that until he sees a physician, Weiner noted.\nBackers of the initiative said they will be careful not to make emergency room visits so expensive that they deter people from going to the hospital when they may be seriously ill.\nEileen McAnneny, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said employer groups will create a toolkit that explains \u201cin plain English\u201d the different locations where their workers can get medical care, and the different costs of those sites.\n\u201cI think this is the start of something big,\u201d McAnneny said of the initiative.\nEducating workers is an important strategy for tackling health costs, said Amy Rosenthal, executive director of the Boston-"}
