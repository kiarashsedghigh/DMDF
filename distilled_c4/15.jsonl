Less than a year ago, she was on a school bus in Pakistan when a man with a gun got on and said, \u201cWhere is Malala?\u201d He shot her in the face; the bullet entered near an eye and ended up near her left shoulder. \u201cThey shot my friends, too,\u201d Yousafzai told the audience at the United Nations.\nThey thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices. The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear, and hopelessness died. Strength, power, and courage was born.\nYousafzai\u2019s delivery was as compelling as her words\u2014watch the video. She has an air of control about her, and self-possession, that goes beyond fearlessness. Speaking of the Taliban gunman who tried to kill her, she said that she was not seeking revenge. \u201cEven if there is a gun in my hand, and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him,\u201d she said\u2014and one believed her, not because as a child she would be too meek or gentle but because she knew, intuitively, that it was not the way to impose her will. \u201cThe power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them.\u201d She knew that she, in the end, was the stronger one.\nAnd yet Yousafzai can\u2019t go home; nor, as the Times has reported, has there been a pause in attacks on schools that educate girls in Pakistan. Many have been bombed. British doctors saved Yousafzai\u2019s life, and she is now in school in Birmingham.\n\u201cI am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same. My dreams are the same,\u201d Yousafzai said. One hopes that those ambitions will remain limitless. She was wearing a shawl, she said, that Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, had worn before she was murdered. Yousafzai could run a country someday; she might do almost anything. \u201cOne child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation is the only solution. Education first.\u201d With time, perhaps, for a birthday party."}

They recovered to 13-13, fell behind 14-13, levelled the game at 14-14 on a cross-court volley nick by McArthur, and then lost 15-14 on a cross-court backhand winner by Samper.\nThroughout the match, the main players were Samper on the left wall exchanging cross-courts with McArthur, while Stout and Badan saw comparatively little of the ball.\nWith the match tied at 2-2, McArthur and Stout adopted a disciplined and unrelenting approach and turned a 6-4 lead into 10-5, then 12-7, eventually winning the game 15-7 on the back of two winners by McArthur.\nThe match had lasted 1hr 40min. Stout and McArthur were happy to avenge their loss to Badan and Samper in five games in the quarter-finals of the Big Apple Open in October.\nCoincidentally, Badan and Stout had partnered each other to win the Westchester Country Club Pro Doubles Tournament last month, the biggest doubles win of Stout\u2019s career.\nThe ranking points Stout gained from that tournament moved him up to a career-high No 6 Squash Doubles Association A ranking."}

Horner's quest for public information, labeled as \"criminal\" by one Obama agency head, will be detailed in his upcoming book, \"The Liberal War on Transparency.\"\nVery recently, Horner uncovered emails including two from July 2009 that connected Bill Lambrecht, an environmental reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to the late Stephen H. Schneider, who was a Melvin and Joan Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies at Stanford and curator of ClimateChange.net.\nSchneider used to appear in network news reports warning about global warming, claiming that humans were making heat waves worse and criticizing cars (\"humans using the atmosphere as a free place to dump our tailpipe waste\"). He also claimed \"[climate] contrarians are given disproportionate representation in the media\" - something Business & Media Institute analysis disproved.\nLambrecht contacted Schneider after U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) introduced legislation to stop the U.S. from contributing to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UN IPCC) over fiscal waste and \"dubious science.\" In its 2007 report the IPCC included an \"unfounded\" claim (from the activist World Wildlife Fund) that Himalayan glaciers could \"disappear by 2035.\" In 2010, New Scientist magazine admitted the claim was \"speculative.\"\nIt is clear from Lambrecht's email that he didn't just want to get the other point of view; he actively wanted to challenge the assertion that climate alarmism was based on \"junk science.\" He wrote to Schneider saying: \"I realize that this news release [from Luetkemeyer] is very incremental in the broader picture but it seems important not to let representations like this stand unchallenged. I know you are busy, but would it be okay to phone you shortly with regard to the suggestion of 'junk science'.\"\n\"This is a tame, if typical, example, obtained thanks to FOIA requests, of a casual and all too common bias shown by nominal news journalists who, in truth, cover energy and environment subjects as liberal activists,\" Horner told the Business & Media Institute. \"I also obtained examples that were so staggering, even reprehensible in the candor and content of their ideological -- but also quite personal -- bias that I decided this ought to be a growth area for FOIA: exposing collusion between journalists, activist government employees and axe-grinding academics as they promote their shared agenda.\"\nThe argument that skeptics don't have peer-reviewed papers has been used by climate alarmists for a long time, but the ClimateGate scandal reveals that they were actively trying to prevent scientific journals from accepting papers from people like Cato's Pat Michaels. As Cato noted in a 2010 Policy Report, one of Michael's papers (coauthored by Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas) \"provoked the scientists at East Anglia to, as they expressed in their private e-mails, 'stop considering Climate Research"}

Her husband had died in a cave-in and she got a little money, enough to go on living in the cabin. She chopped her own wood and hauled her own water and once in awhile someone would come to visit, but not very often.\nOne evening after supper she was at the creek getting a couple of buckets of water to wash up with. It was in the fall. She always left the door open a bit so she wouldn't have to put the buckets down to open it because the knob was difficult and it took two hands to open. So she got back, it couldn't have been more than five or ten minutes, and pushed open the door and there was a porcupine on the table eating up the rest of her supper. Well, Mrs. Schuster went into quite a tizzy trying to shoo that por cupine out of there but porcupines don't normally shoo very easily. They have their defences so well set up they don't think to run away when someone comes up to them. They rather tend to want to get in a corner, curl up, and let whoever it is take a bite of quills if they want to.\nMrs. Schuster got the porcupine off the table all right but then he went under the bed, and poke as she would with the broom, she couldn't get him to budge out of there.\nShe left the door open then, lit her lamp as it was now dark and went to wash her dishes at the other end of the cabin. It was, as I say, a little cabin, one room, a table in the middle, a bed and a stove at either end, so she couldn't go very far away from the bed without leaving the cabin. But she did up her dishes and banked the fire in the stove.\nShe went out to the outhouse and came back and looked under the bed but the porcupine hadn't budged. She poked at him again with the broom but he didn't even wiggle. She stood awhile by the stove and wondered what to do but there seemed to be nothing else she could do. So she carefully got into bed, left the door open and tried to sleep.\nMRS.

Concessions are expensive, seating is tricky, arguably too many trailers are shown and sometimes there are inconsiderate people who use their phone or even talk during the feature presentation. However, those problems are a cakewalk compared to what one theater chain has in store. They're going to build a legitimate playground within some of its theaters, and as you would guess, that plan is already being widely criticized. Take a look at the construction already underway.\nAccording to The Los Angeles Times, Mexico-based theater chain Cinepolis is installing playgrounds into two of its Southern California theaters, and they will open next week in time for Beauty and the Beast, a blockbuster which can be enjoyed by young and older viewers alike. These theaters will cater to children ages 3 to 12, and along with the playground seen above that stretches around the auditorium, there will also be a play area set up in front of the screen and bean bag chairs. EW is also reporting that these theaters will sell \"elevated snack favorites,\" like Cheeto, chili and caramel popcorn flavors.\nEach theater costs approximately $500,000 to retrofit, and seeing a movie in that theater will cost $3 more than a regular ticket. These child-friendly theaters, known as Cinepolis Junior, were introduced in Mexico in 2014, and have since expanded to theaters in Spain, Costa Rica and Guatemala. Cinepolis USA Chief Executive Adrian Mijares Elizondo said that these theaters are intended to make kids \"more comfortable and welcome,\" as they can have more fun while their parents watch the movie.\nIf ever there was a need for an audible sigh, it's now. Need I state the obvious? A theater is not the venue for children to be playing around, let alone on a jungle gym! If your kid can't sit still for that long, then they need to work off that excess energy at an actual playground and limit their movie-watching time to at home until they're well-behaved enough to calmly watch a 90-120 minute feature. I would also say this endeavor would lose money with all the dissatisfied customers, but parents know what they're walking into when they enter such a hellscape.\nBy the way, I'm not the only person who feels this way. Here are some of the reactions online about Cinepolis' playground theaters.\nThen there's the unfortunate fact that we have to specify what kind of movie theaters we're talking about now.\nSaddened to add the phrase \"movie theater jungle gym\" to my vocabulary today.\nAnd then there's the question of whether the folks behind this idea are taking pleasure in our pain.\nThat morally offends me.

The country has five million Muslims - the largest number in Europe - and many of them inhabit the low-income, high crime banlieues of Paris, which are routinely stigmatized as \u201cno go areas\u201d. The Charlie Hebdo attackers - the brothers Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi - spent their young adulthoods in these bleak, high-rise housing estates, where unemployment rates hover around 25%. Orphaned at an early age and poorly educated, the Kouachis worked in soulless menial jobs and got involved in petty crime. They were perfect targets for preachers of extremist ideologies. Meanwhile, Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a police officer then several more hostages in a Paris supermarket, also lived in a Paris banlieue and was imprisoned for petty thefts.\nThe concern is that these disenfranchised areas of French cities will incubate more and more terrorists. There is evidence that a growing number of French Muslims feel alienated from society and are turning to jihadist causes. More than 1,000 French citizens have left, or plan to leave, to join jihadist groups in Syria or Iraq, according to the French Interior Ministry. This is more than any other European nation.\nMeanwhile, France\u2019s prisons are full of Muslims. Although only 8% of the French population are from a Muslim background, they make up 60% of prisoners. By comparison, in England and Wales, Muslims account for 14% of the prison population and 5% of the population nationwide, according to Home Office statistics.\nPrison is the major breeding ground for jihadists in France. Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi was radicalized during his time at Fleury-M\u00e9rogis prison, south of Paris in 2005-06. Whilst serving time, Ch\u00e9rif met Djamel Beghal, a jihadist convicted for attempting to bomb the US embassy in Paris in 2001. Beghal also influenced Amedy Coulibaly during a stint in prison. Coulibaby later said in a secret 2007 video that prison was \u201cthe best school for criminality\u201d.\nPamela Jackson, a US professor of sociology and co-author of Benchmarking Muslims Wellbeing in Europe, says the French state has done little to tackle discrimination.\nJackson says other European nations have been more proactive. She points to the work of the Canadian political philosophers Keith Banting and Will Kymlicka whose Banting/Kymlicka Multicultural Policy Index compares the inclusion policies of 21 Western countries. On eight indicators, countries are rated 0, 0.5, or 1.0. When the eight scores are added up, the UK has an overall mark of 5.5, way ahead of Germany on 2.5 and France on 2.

Opposing his outspoken pro-development philosophy gave a renewed sense of purpose and vigor to a movement that had lost much of its luster and militancy during the Carter years.\nBut Feb. 21 on NBC Television's ''Meet the Press,'' the unpredictable Watt dropped an environmental bombshell. He announced that the Reagan administration will seek legislation to ban energy and mineral development in the nation's wilderness areas through the end of the century. His remarks were totally unexpected by environmentalists and the mining and oil industries, which have been key actors in the often acrimonious debate over the fate of the nation's wilderness.\nEnvironmentalists have been arguing that the relatively small amounts of oil and gas contained in US wilderness areas do not jus-tify opening up of these areas for exploitation. Many in the oil and gas industry counter that these resources should be developed wherever they are found. Further, the industry argues that the current world oil glut is only temporary - and that once petroleum supplies become tight the US may once again be forced to consider drilling in the wilderness areas. Similar arguments have raged over the exploitation of hard rock minerals.\nAt the heart of this controversy is the National Wilderness System, established in 1964. Wilderness areas are not parks. They are generally remote, roadless areas set aside to be maintained in a totally natural state, ''untrammeled by man.'' This system currently consists of 80 million acres that have been designated and 61 million acres that have been proposed for wilderness.\n''Mr. Watt and the administration have finally realized that the public overwhelmingly supports keeping wilderness areas sacrosanct,'' elaborated Wilderness Society co-worker Gordon Roberts.\nPast statements by Secretary Watt and internal Department of Interior memorandums clearly show that much of Mr. Watt's efforts in the past have been directed at ''opening up'' the public lands, including wilderness areas, to development. The Wilderness Act allows leasing for oil and gas, but no previous interior secretary had considered these activities in accord with wilderness management. As a result, there are over 1,000 lease applications pending and some 40 have been issued, although there has been no drilling as yet. Mr. Watt and his lieutenants repeatedly had promised private industry that these applications would be processed without delay, but carefully refrained from promising that they would be granted.\n''The proposal by Secretary Watt seems to be an approach deserving careful study toward resolving what has been a difficult issue for a long time,'' begins the closely worded response of the American Petroleum Institute (API).\nAlthough the API spokesman would not comment further, he admitted that the new policy came as a surprise. Environmentalists, speculating about the motive for this highly publicized new policy, believe that the controversy over exploratory oil and gas leasing in the Washakie Wilderness adjacent to Yellowstone National Park played a pivotal role in the administration's decision to take a new wilderness tact in this election year.\nWhen Interior Department recommendations to allow leasing in this area were announced last year, Wyoming's all-Republican congressional delegation, with its strong conservative credentials, surprised Mr. Watt and the White House by publicly opposing such a policy. Just last week the Wyoming delegation introduced legislation to declare this wilderness area off limits. They"}

He was a party leader, sure, and an attractive spokesman, but his plans for health-care entitlements are controversial. A tendency to upstage the man in charge, too -- look how uneasy his relationship is with Speaker of the House John Boehner, his nominal leader.\nIf the Economy's to Blame, Why Are Tablets Surging Even as PCs Crash?\nDid the Twitter of China Just Convince the Communist Party to Reform Its Labor Camps?\nOn August 11, he was introduced as the Republican vice-presidential candidate.\nRyan has a tendency to move fast. He was elected to the national legislature at age 28 in 1999, but I began covering him 10 years later, when he charged himself with articulating his party's intellectual opposition to a newly-elected President Obama. He helped turn the House back to Republican control in 2010, becoming the chairman of the Budget Committee. I remember congratulating a magazine writer who became a Ryan speechwriter during this time for joining a rising operation.\nHe's got a nose for the big issue. Ryan's formative years in Washington after college were spent absorbing conservative economic doctrine that convinced him of the importance of a dramatically limited public sector. But as member and then chairman of the Budget Committee, he had little official responsibility: The committee sets broad spending levels in consultation with party leaders. Nonetheless, he's famous for his plans to privatize and reduce spending on Medicare, America's public senior health-insurance plan. Ryan made entitlements his cause when he realized they were a big driver of government spending, which left the members of his party ostensibly responsible for overseeing the programs rather miffed.\nHe knows a bipartisan deal sounds nice. Ryan has frequently praised a debt reduction plan released by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson commission in 2010, and dinged Obama for not accepting its recommendations outright. He doesn't always mention that as a member of the commission, he voted against the plan because it increased taxes as well as cutting spending. While he has collaborated with Democrats like former budget director Alice Rivlin and Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on health-care-reform plans. He doesn't always mention that both collaborators have decried Romney's plans.\nHe manages expectations. The Martyrology of Paul Ryan is long and varied; he is well-versed in clearing ground ahead of proposals that cut social spending on the poor and seniors. \"We are we are giving them a political weapon to go against us,\" he said after introducing one budget plan. \"But they will have to lie and demagogue to make it a weapon.\" Democrats cut his plan to ribbons in the press, but Ryan got courage points for handing them the knife. I'm not sure why the media likes this.\nHe loves numbers.* Despite regular panic about American students' math scores, don't let anyone tell you this is a country that doesn't love its math (it's not the same as being numerate).

In the two years since \u201cEpisode VII,\u201d theories have ranged from possible, unlikely, to straight up baffling.

This could also explain why Luke exiled himself to Ahch-To (the island we find him on at the end of \u201cForce Awakens\u201d). He\u2019s not mourning the death of all his students, but that he couldn\u2019t save them from the Dark Side.\nRey\u2019s origin is subject to countless Internet theories. She\u2019s Darth Vader reincarnated, she was the result of a virgin birth just like Anakin, she hatched from an egg (more on that later). It seems highly unlikely that the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d flicks would retread the much maligned immaculate conception plot from the prequels, but the theory that Rey is a Kenobi\u2026 that\u2019s not that crazy.\nThe main argument for this theory is that the episodic \u201cStar Wars\u201d tales have always revolved around one theme: family. And more specifically, it has (for better or worse) always centered around the Skywalker and Kenobi dynamic. Obi-Wan raises Anakin, trains Anakin, is betrayed by Anakin and ultimately is killed by Anakin all while becoming a sort of father figure to Luke. That theme would be easy to continue if Rey and Kylo Ren continue to clash, as Kenobis and Skywalkers seem destined to do.\nAnd yes, we are implying that Old Ben took up with a lover in the sand dunes of Tatooine \u2014 Jedi code or not, he\u2019s only human.\nFrom what we heard about him in \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d and what we\u2019ve seen of him in \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d trailers, it seems like there\u2019s something wrong with Luke. Some fans believe that his failure with Kylo Ren has forced him to slip to the Dark Side himself.\nPeople are backing up the theory that Luke is now a villain with \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d poster. Throughout the series, every poster for every film has always featured the villain looming as the largest image in the background. In the upcoming film, that\u2019s Luke.

Considering what these Canadians have done for Wagner in the past, I was expecting people to boo before the curtain went up.\nNEW YORK \u2022 Fran\u00e7ois Girard and Michael Levine collaborating on a new Parsifal? Considering what these Canadians have done for Wagner in the past, I was expecting people to boo before the curtain went up.\nParsifal that managed to update and universalize the drama in a single stroke.\nThe updating, happily, was mild. As darkness lifted in the opening minutes, the assembled squires and knights of the holy grail were revealed to be wearing business suits. Then off came the jackets and ties and shoes, and we understood that this tale from Arthurian times should be received as an allegory valid for our own.\nTo the right of the white-shirted men on a barren stage were silent women dressed in black, representing the half of the human population that is not much heard from in Wagner\u2019s valedictory opera. This might sound like exactly the kind of directorial point-making we need less of these days, but Girard\u2019s stagecraft proved oddly in harmony with the story and music. One sensed that this Quebecer making his Met debut had accepted, and even sympathized with, the profoundly religious ethos of the piece.\nWhich is to say that the Lord\u2019s Supper as celebrated by the knights in Act 1 was devout; that Kundry washed the feet of Parsifal in earnest; that the Holy Grail was a holy grail; that the spear was blocked as the sorcerer Klingsor actually tried to thrust it; that the kiss with which Kundry tempted Parsifal was a kiss. Goodness, the swan slain by this Pure Fool (to translate from the untranslatable German) was a swan.\nGranted, Parsifal did not cross himself. Presumably Girard judged this gesture to be too literal for modern use. But the Flower Maidens struck subtle cruciform poses with the spears they held evocatively upright in Act 2. While the Christian message was abstract, it was vivid.\nLevine\u2019s sets were starkly impressive. Much of the imagery resided in an HD screen showing Peter Flaherty\u2019s videos of grey, scudding clouds, planets in formation or rolling hills evocative of human flesh. Klingsor\u2019s domain was at the bottom of a great crevice where the redemptive blood of the Saviour, like the spear Klingsor has seized, was put to no good use.\nForget about flowers in Act 3, which remained relentlessly bleak. This was a debatable choice. But those who expected to witness one outrage after another (possibly prompted by an inflammatory New York Times headline) got responsible and meaningful symbolism instead.\nThey also got a superb cast. Tenor Jonas Kaufmann seemed a sullen teen on his first appearance, lacking only a skateboard; but this dramatic posture permitted him (and his voice) to grow in brilliance and heroism. Baritone Peter Mattei was deeply sympathetic as the wounded Amfortas and bass-baritone Evgeny Nitkin made a palpably malicious Klingsor. Soprano Katarina Dalayan as Kundry had her flinty moments but hers also was a committed and believable portrayal.\nBass Ren\u00e9 Pape was predictably magnificent as Gurnemanz.

He banks at Wells Fargo; I bank at Bank of America and Chase.\nRecently we have decided to make sure that each of us has the appropriate beneficiaries and powers of attorney on our accounts. We met with a Wells Fargo banker at a branch in Tucson, Arizona, who gave me power of attorney on my husband\u2019s accounts, but took me off as the beneficiary, since the banker said that I could not be both.\nThe Wells Fargo banker assured me that the power of attorney designation trumps the beneficiary and that the durable power of attorney will provide access to the accounts even after my husband dies. However, through my research, I recognized that these designations are different and that a power of attorney ceases once the person dies. When my husband passes away, there is no provision for me under the power of attorney designation to have access to these accounts.\nMy husband and I went to another Wells Fargo Branch to rectify the problem. During that session, the Wells Fargo branch manager confirmed that I could, in fact, be the power of attorney and the payable-on-death beneficiary. However, the Wells Fargo systems can\u2019t accommodate two designations, so they advised me to continue as the power of attorney and made permanent notes in the system that I was the beneficiary.\nA Wells Fargo representative said I could not receive this in writing, nor could I take a photo of the permanent notes screen. Although I confirmed the situation in an email, I remain uncomfortable with this non-formal arrangement. I would like to continue to be both the power of attorney and beneficiary, and have it designated as such in a written document from Wells Fargo on Wells Fargo letterhead. Can you help me with my beneficiary problem?\nA: Before I answer your question, I\u2019d like to congratulate you and your husband for keeping your finances separate. That\u2019s such a smart thing to do, and I wish more couples would follow your lead.\nYou\u2019re right \u2014 a power of attorney and a beneficiary designation are not the same thing. Wells Fargo should have offered a way to have both of them on your husband\u2019s account when you asked for help. The trouble, it seems, is technological. In an email to you, Wells Fargo noted that while it showed both designations in its internal system, it could not reflect your status externally, in your account.\nAnd before you say: \u201cShouldn\u2019t a big bank like Wells Fargo be able to do that?\u201d let me tell you about my experience of opening a bank account for my nonprofit organization. Oh, the bureaucracy! Wells Fargo has an online department that can handle your application, or you can visit a branch in person to apply for an account, but the two don\u2019t share information on applications. What should have taken just an hour stretched into several weeks, as both departments bickered over which one should handle my request.\nThe shortcut? A brief, polite email to one of the Wells Fargo executive contacts I list on my consumer-advocacy site: https://www.elliott.org/company-contacts/wells-fargo/. Your beneficiary problem is something the bank should be able to take care of with minimum hassle. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t work for you.\nI contacted Wells Fargo on your behalf.

{"idx": "15056", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: As Colorado goes, so goes the nation?\nThe Colorado turnaround in 2008 was nothing short of phenomenal: a once rock-solid Republican state went Democratic in a big way. And members of both parties are still scratching their heads over what happened. Adam Schrager and Rob Witwer have dug into the question for their book \u201cThe Blueprint: How the Democrats Won Colorado and Why Republicans Everywhere Should Care,\u201d due out April 20 from Fulcrum Publishing. Schrager, who covers politics for, KUSA-TV, the NBC affiliate in Denver, and Witwer, a former Republican member of the Colorado House, show how the state flipped and how the Democrats are working to take the model nationwide.\nIn 2004, Republicans controlled Colorado government at every level. Four years later, the opposite was true.\nWhile national trends played a part, they could not explain the stunning reversal in this once-solid GOP stronghold. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard wrote, \"there's something unique going on in Colorado that, if copied in other states, has the potential to produce sweeping Democratic gains nationwide,\" he wrote. He dubbed that \"something\" the \"Colorado Model.\"\nWhile pundits focus on who controls Congress in 2011, progressives are quietly aiming higher. Using the Colorado Model, they are targeting individual state legislative races not only to affect state-level policy, but to capture an even bigger prize: control over Congressional redistricting plans, which will determine the composition of Congress for the next decade.\nYet the Colorado Model is even bigger than redistricting. For progressives, it\u2019s about building a coordinated, sustainable infrastructure that will carry Democrats for years to come, in good years and bad.\nUnder the auspices of the George Soros-funded Democracy Alliance, a Washington, D.C-based group called the \u201cCommittee on States\u201d has committed $110 million to export the Colorado Model to places like Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming \u2013 all in time for the 2010 election cycle.\nThe origins of the Colorado Model can be traced to four multi-millionaires and a team of scrappy, savvy political consultants who in 2004 cleverly used changes in campaign finance law to build a better political mousetrap. The four multi-millionaires are: Rutt Bridges, whose rags-to-riches path led him from Georgia to Colorado where he sold his software company for what he said was \u201cmore money than I could spend in my life\u201d; Tim Gill, the openly gay founder of Quark Xpress whose visit to a legislative hearing room led him to conclude that \u201csomebody\u2019s gotta go\u201d; Jared Polis, the Princeton-educated dot-com wunderkind who brought a businesslike mentality to elections; and Pat Stryker, a minivan-driving billionaire heiress.\nThis \u201cGang of Four\u201d and their advisors understood that campaign finance reform made the state Democratic Party obsolete, and in its place they built a thriving network of nonprofit organizations that worked in perfect harmony to upend Colorado\u2019s political establishment.\nThey forged an unprecedented alliance that focused progressive organizations in one common direction: winning state legislative races. In 2004, they bucked national trends and delivered both houses of the state legislature to Democrats. In 2006, they upped the ante by funding a network of dozens of nonprofits that would become the foundation of a long-term political infrastructure designed to ensure that conserv"}

And in this case, there has been more than one haymaker.\nWarner Bros. has released five films in a row that have underperformed at the box office, including Jack the Giant Slayer, a roughly $195-million production that has flopped, tallying $55 million in domestic receipts after three weeks of release.\nThe film's tepid performance and last weekend's disappointing opening for The Incredible Burt Wonderstone mark an unusual rough patch for Warner Bros., which has historically been among the most successful studios.

Governments should also gradually phase out tax breaks on corporate debt, while lowering the corporate tax rate, the magazine said.\nThe Economist has a global circulation of more than 1.5 million subscribers, and NPR reported in 2006 that nearly 2 out of 3 of its American subscribers earned more than $100,000 a year.\nHalf of the rich world\u2019s governments let their citizens write off interest payments on mortgages from their taxable income, according to The Economist.\nThe Economist also argues that the mortgage interest deduction doesn\u2019t achieve its purported goal of increasing homeownership.\n\u201cThe shares of people owning their own homes in America and Switzerland, two countries with vast subsidies, are 65 percent and 44 percent respectively \u2014 no more than in other advanced economies like Britain and Canada that offer no tax break,\u201d The Economist wrote.\nMoreover, studies suggest that the mortgage interest deduction magnifies inequality, The Economist noted.\nIn the U.S., the mortgage interest deduction costs the government at least $70 billion a year in revenue, and 77 percent of those benefits went to homeowners with incomes above $100,000 in 2012, according to a 2013 study conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nThe best way to get rid of the mortgage interest deduction is to gradually scale back the subsidy, like Britain did in the 1990s, The Economist said.\nThe National Association of Realtors regards the mortgage interest deduction as sacrosanct, and has lobbied aggressively against proposed changes to the tax break over the years.\nNAR has claimed in the past that any changes to the mortgage interest deduction could depreciate home prices by up to 15 percent.\nThe Economist concedes that reducing or eliminating the mortgage interest write-off would likely dent U.S. home values. That\u2019s a particularly unpalatable prospect given that a large share of U.S. homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, the magazine notes.\nBut slashing the mortgage tax break would pay off in the long run, The Economist argues.\n\u201cWithout a tax break, people would borrow less to buy houses and banks would lend less against property,\u201d The Economist said. That would cause investors to pour more money into businesses and ideas that \u201cenhance productivity\u201d and boost economic growth.\nMortgages would grow more expensive and \u201cthe 20th century\u2019s obsession with homeownership might ebb,\u201d The Economist wrote in another article that fleshed out the thesis of its cover story.\nBut more affordable homes would also help the young and poor, and financial innovations would emerge that could compensate for costlier mortgages, the magazine said.\nBusinesses such as PRIMARQ, for example, might offer shared-equity mortgages that could put homes within reach of more prospective buyers.\nPRIMARQ enables buyers to obtain down payment assistance from an investor. In return, an investor earns an equity stake in the buyer\u2019s property, and"}

Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that \"Kim Jong Un and his forces are very good at camouflage concealment and deception.\"\nHe added that Pyongyang has yet to fine-tune its missile guidance and control systems and hasn't shown the \"capacity to strike the United States with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.\"\nThe latest missile was launched from Mupyong-ni in Chagang province, in northern North Korea.\nPyongyang first tested a prototype ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-14, on July 4 in a flight that lasted 37 minutes, raising alarms that it had achieved a breakthrough in its missile program.\nThe high arc of the trajectory led U.S. analysts to conclude for the first time that Pyongyang had attained the capability of building a missile that could reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii.\nAlthough Pyongyang has developed and tested nuclear weapons, it is not known to have developed a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop an ICBM or robust enough to survive the missile's fiery reentry into the atmosphere.\nBut the string of underground nuclear tests and increasingly sophisticated missile flights have led to concerns it could soon develop the capability to launch a nuclear-armed missile at American military targets in Asia \u2014 or even the U.S. mainland.\nGiven that progress, U.S. intelligence agencies recently cut their projections of how long it would take Pyongyang to build a missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland from four years to one year.\nThe Pentagon vowed Friday to defend regional allies and noted that the missile did not threaten North America.\n\"Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad,\" Pentagon spokesman"}

A show can take its time delving into different chapters of any single narrative, broadening and deepening perspectives that other adaptations may have given short shrift. But in trying to be comprehensive, a show can also default to tried-and-true tropes by flattening the characters into facsimiles rather than fleshing them out as people.\nSuch is the conflict at play in \u201cI Am the Night,\u201d TNT\u2019s ambitious new noir drama, created by Sam Sheridan and executive produced by \u201cWonder Woman\u201d helmer Patty Jenkins (who directed the first two episodes). The limited series is inspired by the extraordinary real life of Fauna Hodel, a white girl who grew up in Nevada thinking she was mixed race after a wealthy family gave her to a black casino attendant shortly after her birth. She later discovered the deeply unsettling reasons why by unraveling the gnarled knots of her ancestry, revealing links to some of Hollywood\u2019s most enduring mysteries.\nAnd so \u201cI Am the Night\u201d shines the spotlight squarely on Fauna, portrayed by India Eisley with wide-eyed naivet\u00e9 that occasionally crystallizes into a flinty determination to get to the bottom of her complicated origin story. After leaving Jimmy Lee (Golden Brooks), her increasingly resentful mother figure, Fauna sets out to find the truth, which is much more slippery and disturbing than she could have ever imagined. Fauna\u2019s journey eventually collides with that of Jay Singletary (Chris Pine), a shellshocked Korean War veteran and journalist whose hard-news days are behind him \u2014 largely because he went after the elusive Hodel (Jefferson Mays) and failed to pin him down.\n\u201cI Am the Night\u201d reunites Jenkins and Pine, who worked together on \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and its upcoming sequel. It\u2019s easy to see why they continue to gravitate to each other. Jenkins casts Pine in roles that make use of his obvious handsomeness without making it the prime focus. Jay isn\u2019t based on any single person, but he will seem familiar to anyone with even glancing knowledge of noir detective stories. He\u2019s charming but flawed, smart but cocky, gruff but ultimately too caring to screw anyone but the bad guys over. Pine throws himself into the part with his usual gusto, giving Jay a manic edge that keeps him from floating too far into clich\u00e9.\nThat does not, unfortunately, hold true for the rest of the series, which proves to be the kind of drama wherein a revelation drops and a dramatic peal of thunder isn\u2019t far behind. \u201cI Am the Night\u201d isn\u2019t one for subtleties; Brooks, Mays and Connie Nielsen as a pontificating socialite lean so hard into the melodrama of their roles that there\u2019s practically no scenery left after they\u2019ve chewed it to the ground.\nBut every once in a while, \u201cI Am the Night\u201d clicks into a propulsive and exciting gear. (This happens most often under the watchful eye of Victoria Mahoney, tapping in to direct two episodes that reveal her skill for pushing tension to its breaking point.) It\u2019s hard to argue the merits of a slick thriller starring a talent such as Pine, even when it gets carried away. Sometimes, after all, getting carried away by a magnetic mystery is exactly the point.\nLimited series, 60 mins. 6 episodes"}

This is a cynical moral trap.\nBlack Star Publisher\u2019s Note: This is the original version of an open letter submitted by the author to The Monitor (www.monitor.co.ug), which published an abridged version on May 25. The author formerly was UN Under-Secretary General/Special Representative To The Secretary General of the United Nations for Children and Armed Conflict; he is also the 2005 recipient of The Sydney Peace Prize.\nI am very shocked by this blatant falsehood and disinformation. No clarifications have followed this or previous disinformation. I see that LRA and the Museveni regime have now joined together in orchestrating this smear campaign.\nThe purpose of this vicious campaign of smear and vilification against me is to intimidate me (and others who dare to speak the truth about Museveni\u2019s Uganda), to silence and discredit my message and revelations.\nAs you know, I have never been a member or supporter of LRA. For a detailed discussion of all aspects of this subject, I refer you to my recent interview in The Weekly Observer (29 March). On the contrary, I have always condemned in the strongest terms, massacres, maiming and abduction of children by LRA. Similarly, I have exposed and denounced the horrendous crimes committed by the Museveni regime, specifically its genocide and trail of massacres.\nCertain narratives have been carefully fashioned to promote disinformation. I reject, for example, the invidious narrative, which is vigorously promoted by the Museveni regime and bears a simple formula: If you are ethnic Acoli, then, by definition, you are LRA. By the same logic, LRA is portrayed as representing the Acoli! This is an integral part of the campaign of ethnic demonisation and the stratagem of divide-and-rule.\nI also reject the notion that: If you condemn LRA atrocities, this means that you are pro-Museveni; and if you expose Museveni \u2018s genocide and other crimes, then you must be LRA supporter! This is a cynical moral trap. It is a contrived dichotomy, a false choice, which has only comforted a deep culture of silence and impunity.\nIt is imperative that the leaderships of both the Museveni regime and LRA be held fully accountable for what they have done. In Lwo jurisprudence, there is no contradiction between accountability and reconciliation. Indeed, the two are aligned. Above all, impunity (atimo nyong, do!) is never, ever accepted.\nThat is why I am very disturbed by Joseph Kony\u2019s persistent denials of LRA atrocities and abduction of children. How painful for victims and families to hear these incredible denials. I urge Kony to personally and directly level with the victim communities. I urge him to own up to the abductions and other atrocities committed by his men.\nKony needs to reciprocate the incredible magnanimity manifested by the victim communities. Although they have suffered unbelievably, they have chosen the painful path of dialogue and accountability, leading to forgiveness and reconciliation.

{"idx": "15078", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: While so many aspects of communication are focusing on digital channels like social platforms, mobile contact, and even text messages, we find that those mediums only work for some donors and volunteers. Others prefer email and phone calls. The challenge then becomes determining if you should take on an omnichannel approach or focus your strategies on specific areas. After all, you don\u2019t want to alienate any demographic or lose any opportunities to achieve your donor and fundraising goals in 2017.\nOur own approach this year is to migrate to an omnichannel approach where we develop a set of key messages across traditional and digital channels. That way, we capture all interested demographics. Plus, it\u2019s a way to illustrate to our target audience that we understand and value its communication preferences. What we have done is decrease the money spent on traditional marketing practices and started to thoughtfully test out some paid ad placements on sites like Facebook to gauge response.\nWe\u2019ve also focused on email as a renewed preferred platform for nonprofits, donors and volunteers for numerous reasons. In surveying our key constituents, we have found that most of them read their emails regularly on their smartphones and contact is much more targeted there than via social media. After running email campaigns that have shared specific success stories, we have realized a surge in donations, showing us that it is reaching our audience and moving them to action. However, we still plan on continuing to utilize multiple channels because we also have noticed that there are shifts in platform preferences so this makes sure we cover all the bases.\nSimilarly to the channel dilemma, new technology offers donors more ways than ever to send donations, yet there are new challenges in terms of determining compliance with all payment and reporting regulations. This can get costly, especially considering the tight budgets nonprofits operate under, and donors want to know that their payment information is safe from hacking and data breaches.\nThis year we're exploring the idea of a mobile app that integrates digital payments for all types of donors. Creating this channel addresses the digital audience from the first challenge while providing a payment platform that can integrate with numerous secure methods, and help track our efforts in a more efficient way. Another option is to consider the payment solutions available that work with specific industries and types of organizations. This can also assist a nonprofit with designing a secure, affordable and convenient payment system to attract and reassure donors.\nWhatever political side you take, the fact of the matter is that whenever a government changes in terms of the political party in office, there is a level of uncertainty about the direction the new leadership will take. This change often impacts numerous industries and organizations, especially in regards to specific laws tied to taxes and economic policies. The challenge then becomes how to conduct any long-range planning for the year as a nonprofit.\nThe answer here is that we are still sketching out our annual objectives and metrics in terms of what we would like to accomplish as well as continuing to forge ahead with our tactical approach for each quarter. However, we are building in more flexibility within each quarter so that we can make adjustments and respond to any potential policy changes that might occur.\nIt is important to not freeze and wait, but look ahead and just have multiple options in case there should be anything that inhibits the original plan. Clearly, certain actions still have to be taken if we are to continue attracting and retaining donors, locating talent and volunteers to assist us, and making decisions about what we can do to fulfill our objectives to provide support to those who need our help."}

Under the leadership of Sharon J. Letterman, NBJC\u2019s new Executive Director, who cleverly had a hand in NBJC receiving the invitation, twenty-five of us on December 17th arrived at the Southeast Gate at Alexander Hamilton Place and East Executive Avenue for our 6:00 p.m. tour.\nOnce in the White House, tours were self-guided. However, the United States Secret Service officers were posted in every room not only for security reasons but they were also there to provide historical information about each room in the White House.\nLuckily, NBJC\u2019s had its own White House historian on our tour, Dr. Sylvia Rhue, Director of Religious Affairs at NBJC. Rhue became a self-made White House historian when she found out that her enslaved maternal great- great-grandmother was born in Blair House, the official state guesthouse of the President.\nFrancis Preston Blair, Sr. (1791- 1876) prominent politician and editor of the Washington Globe in the 1800\u2019s, had three sons: Montgomery, James and Francis Jr. And Francis Preston Blair, Sr. is a great-great-grandfather of America\u2019s film and stage actor of the 60\u2019s Montgomery Clift, who was bisexual, who might also be Rhue\u2019s great-great cousin.\nMontgomery Blair (1813- 1883), Rhue\u2019s family lineage, was a cabinet member of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s administration during the Civil War serving as Postmaster- General from 1861-1864. Rhue suspects that her great-great- grandmother was either Blair\u2019s illegitimate child or a child born to a slave family working for the Blairs.\nRev. Deborah L. Johnson, a lesbian, and founder and president of Inner Light Ministries, a transdenominational spiritual community of more than 1,500 people in Northern California, was also with the NBJC\u2019s contingent on the tour.\nFor Rhue and Johnson the Holiday Open House Tour allow them to imagine what life must have been for their enslaved relatives working in and around the White House and D.C.\nThe White House was built between 1792 and 1800.

When I went through rehab, many of us were depressed, but some went home and vegetated while others did whatever it took to reclaim their lives. I've long wondered about the difference between those who survive adversity, and even thrive, and those who don't.\nI know one thing. It's not about strength or weakness. Frankly, I hate that measure as it implies that those who do well have a better character than those who don't. Not true.\nHere's what is true. Resilience is partly about luck. In my case, I had a career to return to, a family and the kind of health insurance that afforded me the luxury of not worrying about paying for my equipment. Professor Ann Masten at the University of Minnesota found that children's success in several developmental tasks was related to resources they had in childhood \u2014 intelligence, parenting quality and socioeconomic status.\nNow we know that overinvolved parenting contributes to making children less resilient. But that is only a small part of the story of resilience.\nThere is a far more important factor. Almost all studies of resilience have addressed the value of good relationships with caring adults either in the family or outside of it. This could happen through teachers, mentoring programs, religious groups or distant relatives but it is these relationships that are critical in fostering resilience.\nEighteen-year-old Dana Young was just 13 when her family was evicted from their apartment because her mother had been using drugs and couldn't pay the rent.

Shortly after the news was announced, Ben Affleck jumped on social media to wish director Matt Reeves well with taking the caped crusader into the future.\nThe tweet was later confirmed to be Ben Affleck's goodbye to the character. Affleck was introduced as the caped crusader in the 2016 DC Superhero adventure Batman v Superman, and later played Bruce Wayne once again in 2017's Justice League. He also reprised the role for a glorified cameo in Suicide Squad.\nThe Batman will follow the adventures of a younger Bruce Wayne. The story was set to follow Batman in his later years, with Ben Affleck originally attached to direct and co-write the script alongside Geoff Johns. While the pair did finish a draft of the screenplay, they could never get it where it needed to be. Affleck later removed himself from directing, handing the reigns over to Matt Reeves, though still presumably attached to star at the time.\nThere has been much back and forth about Ben Affleck's ultimate involvement in The Batman.

While Lig Duncan and Justin Taylor have both helpfully shared a bit about what paedobaptists believe, this debate has rather been about whether our local churches must have clear stances on this issue.\nArguing for a more rigorous approach, we have seen Wayne Grudem (who also started the whole thing), Mark Dever, and his 9Marks buddy, Aaron Menikoff, while on the other side we have had comments from John Piper, Abraham Piper, John Bunyan, and now in this post, Sam Storms.\nI and many others have very deliberately steered clear of joining in the debate because, for some reason, I\u2019m finding it one that is very stimulating and interesting to observe from the touchline.

For a first-time buyer, the process can be intimidating, but the best place to start the mortgage process is to get preapproved by a lender. Here are some tips on the process.\nA preapproval (or prequalification) letter is a document from a lender stating that they are tentatively willing to lend you up to a specific amount of money. Different lenders use the terms prequalification and preapproval differently. Some lenders may only offer a prequalification, while others may only offer preapproval. For simplicity, we use the word preapproval here.\nA preapproval letter is not a guaranteed loan offer, but it does let a seller know that you\u2019re likely to get financing. Sellers frequently require a preapproval letter before accepting your offer on a house. Without preapproval, you could lose out on a house you really like to another buyer who is preapproved.\nLenders typically check your credit before issuing a preapproval letter, and the letter may have an expiration date on it (typically 30 to 60 days). Because of the expiration, some home shoppers wait until they\u2019re ready to start shopping before getting preapproved. But getting preapproved early in the process is a good way to spot potential issues (such as errors on your credit report) in time to correct them.\nEvery lender is different, so find out what you need to do and what documentation they require in order to preapprove you.\nDifferent lenders may request different levels of information and documentation. Some lenders base preapproval letters solely on the information you provide. Others dig into the details with you up front so that you have all the documentation you need. This can prevent delays and surprises later.\nAll lenders require documentation if you decide to apply for a loan, so it\u2019s better to know now that you need an additional document than when you\u2019re about to close on your dream home.\nLenders preapprove you based on your income, assets, debts and credit record, but your financial life is much more complicated than that. Only you can decide how much you\u2019re comfortable spending.\nIf a lender preapproves you for more than you had planned to spend, you can still use the preapproval letter to shop for homes. If you\u2019re happy with the amount you planned to spend, stick with your original budget.\nIf you\u2019re preapproved for less than you planned to spend on a home, talk with the lender. Ask if there was a particular factor (your income, for example) that limited the preapproval amount. You may need to adjust your home price expectations.\nIf you\u2019re declined for preapproval, don\u2019t despair. Find out why and work to improve your chances in the future.\nIf your credit score was too low, ask for a copy of the score the lender used. If preapproval was denied based on your score, the lender must send you a notice with the score along with instructions on obtaining a free copy of your credit report.\nIf you were turned down because of negative information on your credit report, check your report for errors and get them corrected.

I hate to say we've seen it all before, but we've seen it all before - drug addicts from the city, drug addicts from the suburbs, cops pulled off street duty for relatively minor cases, cases dismissed because cops or other witnesses don't show up. One defendant, his case a perfect candidate for expeditious treatment in District Court, asked for a jury trial in Circuit Court only because he showed up without an attorney and didn't know what else to do.\nI drop by the Edward F. Borgerding District Court Building on Wabash Avenue, Judge Jack I. Lesser presiding, about 9:40 a.m.\nThe first case I catch is that of Defendant Williams. Tall, 20-year-old woman in a charcoal sweater, tight black jeans and confusing hair. She's from Harford County. In August, she brought her problems to the city and overdosed on heroin in a house in Southwest Baltimore. Paramedics took her to a hospital. Police charged her with possession. In methadone maintenance now, she claims to have learned her lesson. \"You're lucky to be alive,\" Lesser tells her. He puts Williams on supervised probation, with drug screening, for 18 months, orders her to stay in treatment and to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings twice a week.\nNext case: Preliminary hearing for Defendant Brown, male, 20 years old. He wears a dirty T-shirt, baggy jeans, handcuffs and shackles. Arrested last month and charged with driving a stolen car into two other vehicles and a guy on a bicycle. The guy on the bicycle had a fractured collarbone and liver damage. Police said the car Brown was driving had been taken in an armed carjacking Jan. 18 - by someone else. Why Brown had the car is not explained. The state requests a postponement; some witnesses have failed to appear. Lesser sets bail at $75,000 and sets another hearing date for March 15.\nDefendant Johnson, male, 40 years old. Must have dressed for court in a hurry - red T-shirt over a long-sleeved gray sweat shirt, blue gym shorts over long johns, white tube socks and black work boots. Been in jail since Jan. 18. Allegedly lifted five cans of Maxwell House from the Stop Shop & Save on Edmondson Avenue. Lesser finds him guilty and notes Johnson's record of thefts and possession of illegal drugs, as well as other charges set for March hearings in the city and Baltimore County. Lesser sentences him to time served - 35 days.\nDefendant Davis. Also charged with shoplifting. Fails to appear. Lesser issues a warrant for her arrest.\nDefendant Daly. We never hear what he's charged with. The victim of whatever he did is not in the courtroom. Dismissed.\nDefendant Stevens. He looks like the actor Steve Buscemi, older and balding. He wears a cable-knit sweater and jeans. Charged with possession of heroin. Already on probation for some other crime. Two weeks ago, Lesser told him to get an attorney. But he didn't. So here's Stevens again, sans counsel. \"The state says they're ready to proceed,\" warns Lesser. What's a defendant without a clue"}

The proposal may have been from an obscenely rich family who showered her with gold and hence the promise of a wonderful life ahead, especially in the eyes of her mum (Sajida Syed), but it doesn\u2019t take long for Uswa to realise that her concerns about marrying someone she doesn\u2019t know were valid and that she has gotten herself into a stifling mess.\nFinally, we have a play depicting minority issues and culture. The story is about a peaceful Christian community living in the St Joseph\u2019s Christian Colony since before Partition. Maryam Pereira (Sadia Khan) is a confident Christian girl who teaches at a college and is the breadwinner of her family. She takes a stand for her community against the land mafia, led by the heavily Pushto-accented Sadiq Khan (Ayub Khosa) and Hakim Khan (Rasheed Naz), a feudal who wants to acquire the colony and build an office tower there.\nSadiq Khan\u2019s son Ali Khan (Ahsan Khan) arrives from abroad with progressive ideas and joins Maryam\u2019s college as a professor. Sufyan (Emmad Irfani), the brother of Maryam\u2019s best friend, loves and wants to marry her but prioritising the crises that her community is going through, Maryam refuses to marry him. Sadiq Khan has his roving eye on Maryam and starts harassing her by making undesirable phone calls. Maryam shares her community issues with Ali and he promises to help her.

Though scientists do not yet fully know what causes this form of dementia, researchers have found how brain cell connections are destroyed in early stages of the disease.\nResearchers found that synaptic levels of NCAM2 in the brain were low in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.\nThe researchers, led by scientists at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, say their findings could lead to more research into possible treatments.\nThey publish their work the journal Nature Communications.\nAlzheimer's disease was first discovered by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906, after he observed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who died of an odd mental illness, symptoms of which included memory loss and unpredictable behavior.\nUpon examining her brain after death, Dr. Alzheimer found abnormal clumps - now known as amyloid plaques - and tangled fibers - now called tau tangles.\nThe leader of this latest study, Dr. Vladimir Sytnyk, from the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, explains that loss of synapses - which connect brain neurons - is one of the first changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\"Synapses are required for all brain functions,\" he says, \"and particularly for learning and forming memories.\"\nHe adds that synapse loss occurs very early in Alzheimer's disease, long before the nerve cells die, when only mild cognitive impairment is noticeable.\nTo further investigate brain changes related to Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Sytnyk and colleagues looked at a brain protein called neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2), which is part of a family of molecules that connects synapse membranes, helping maintain synaptic connections between neurons.\nBy studying brain tissue from people with and without the condition who had died, the team found that synaptic levels of NCAM2 in the hippocampus were low in the individuals with the disease.\nIn Alzheimer's, most of the damage appears to take place in the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that is essential in forming memories.\nAdditionally, through mice studies, the researchers found that NCAM2 was broken down by beta-amyloid proteins, which are the abnormal clumps that build up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.\n\"We have identified a new molecular mechanism, which directly contributes to this synapse loss,\" says Dr. Sytnyk, \"a discovery we hope could eventually lead to earlier diagnosis of the disease and new treatments.\"\n\"Our research shows the loss of synapses is linked to the loss of NCAM2 as a result of the toxic effects of beta-amyloid. It opens up a new avenue for research on possible treatments that can prevent the destruction of NCAM2 in the brain.\"\nGiven that the number of people with Alzheimer's disease is projected to increase three-fold by 2050, bringing the total to 14 million Americans, finding treatments for the condition is immensely important.\nMedical News Today recently reported that changes in humor could herald dementia.\nA\u03b2-dependent reduction of NCAM2-mediated synaptic adhesion contributes to synapse loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Vladimir Sytnyk et al., Nature Communications, doi:10.103"}

The club's biggest fundraiser of the year is fast-approaching, and to get in the spirit, the club played a little Trivial Pursuit. While some of the questions were left unanswered, overall the club made a good showing with some of the difficult ques- tions from an old Trivial Pursuit game.\nMore importantly, the members discussed the upcoming trivia contest.\nThis Spring's event will be held on Saturday, March 9th, at the American Legion in Carmi. The first question will be asked promptly at six pm, and the night should wrap up around eight. As in year's past, there will be four rounds of ten ques- tions each. The questions will come from such categories as: history, sports, the Bible, science, food, language, pop culture, and any other categories that might pop up. Theoretically the questions get harder as the night goes on, but that is up for dispute. The points do get higher as the night rolls along, meaning that even if a team does poorly in the first or second round, they can recover and come back to win by scoring good marks in the final two rounds.\nThe cost to play is only forty dollars for a four-person team, and there will be cash prizes awarded to the top three finishers. First prize claims one hundred dollars, second place grabs sixty dollars, and third place gets their money back with a forty-dollar cash prize.\nFinger foods will be pro- vided for the players and the spectators.\nThe largest amount of teams so far has been fourteen, this year the Rotarians are pushing hard to get at least sixteen teams on board. If you are interested in fielding a team, it can be made up of friends, neighbors, coworkers, church members, any com- bination you can come up with.\nThe money raised from this event goes to help support many, many groups and causes in the Carmi area, including: The Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, White County Build, the Baptist Children's Home, and many more.\nThe Carmi Rotary club urges you to make plans to be part of the Spring Trivia, Saturday, March 9th at the American Legion in Carmi.\nThe Carmi Rotary club meets every Thursday at noon at the First United Methodist Church on Main Street in Carmi.

It is the day when the common people of France, despairing their grievances would never be addressed, stormed the Bastille It was a turning point for the French Revolution, and is celebrated annually with parades, fireworks and general festivity.\nThis year the salute at the military parade down the Champs Elysees was taken jointly by the new President of France Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump. France is the U.S.\u2019s oldest ally \u2014 the French navy and French troops helped American colonists defeat the British and achieve independence over 240 years ago.\nThe two leaders have one significant fact in common: both took on their political establishment and won; Trump even took on the media. Both now are happy to partner against ISIS in Syria, and both favor better relations with Russia. Trump had a two-hour meeting with Putin at the G-20 meeting; Macron met with Putin twice, first at Versailles and then again at the G-20.\nTrump also talked trade with Macron and even suggested something new on the Paris Climate Accord.\nBack home, another storm in a teacup. Some Russian promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. He met with Donald Trump Jr. and had little to offer.

It has nearly eradicated river blindness (Guinea worm) in Africa, and is fighting other neglected tropical diseases like trachoma. It also monitors foreign elections when asked, fights for human rights, and for peaceful conflict resolution.\nWhile one can disagree strongly with Trump\u2019s policies on health care and climate change and a lot more, one knows they are his policies.

{"idx": "15112", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low.\nWhat can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency\u2019s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes.\nAppeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.\nSenior executives have no right to grieve a performance rating. Instead, they may request a higher-level review and may submit a response to the agency\u2019s performance review board (PRB), which must consider the comments in making a recommendation to the agency about the final rating.\nA senior executive who suspects an unfair low rating is advised to read the procedure, including what is likely to be a five-day or shorter time limit on comments to the PRB. The work on the PRB submission should start well before the rating is received.\nEmployees who are in a unit represented by a union have a negotiated collective bargaining agreement with a grievance procedure, and likely a specific procedure for grieving performance ratings. Read the agreement and start working with your union shop steward if you suspect trouble on the horizon.\nUnions may appeal an unfair rating to an arbitrator if the employee and union are dissatisfied with the response in using the grievance procedure. Arbitration, however, is expensive, and a union is likely to use it for a performance rating only in significant cases. The threat of arbitration often makes management look carefully at the merits of the union\u2019s arguments.\nEmployees not covered by union representation have an administrative grievance procedure by which they can complain about a low rating. Read the procedure, which should be available from human resources or the agency\u2019s intranet. The procedure has short deadlines and explains to whom and how the grievance is filed and what appeals there are in the agency of the initial decisions. Some agencies have special procedures for grieving performance appraisals. There is no appeal outside the agency from an adverse decision against the employee on a performance rating grievance.\nAn employee who believes a lowered rating is the result of illegal discrimination or reprisal may use the EEO system; an employee who believes the performance rating is for whistle-blower reprisal or another prohibited personnel practice may file with the Office of Special Counsel.\nOne of the difficulties with either of these methods is the amount of time the review process takes. Another is that the employee claiming discrimination or reprisal bears the burden of proof. The obvious advantage is that outside pressure can be brought on an otherwise stubborn agency to fairly review the performance rating.\nSeveral cautions about using both EEO and a grievance procedure: Most grievance procedures have a provision to stop processing the grievance if an EEO complaint is filed. Federal labor law requires those covered by a negotiated grievance procedure to choose between the grievance procedure and EEO. Finally, the 45-day time limit for contacting an EEO counselor to complain in the EEO process starts from the day the employee receives the rating, not from the date of a grievance decision.\nFocus your grievance on specific examples of how your performance met or exceeded standards. Include evidence of your compliance with expectations set by your supervisor. General complaints about mistreatment or unfairness are unlikely to be effective."}
{"idx": "15113", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Is Now the Time to Buy New York Community Bancorp?\nCould a major dividend cut be looming? And does that even matter over the long term?\nOver the last three months, New York Community Bancorp's (NYSE:NYCB) stock has been hammered. Here's why, what it means, and my views on whether now is the right time to buy.\nFor years, New York Community Bancorp has intentionally kept its total assets below the key regulatory threshold at $50 billion, waiting to find a suitable acquisition target to leap frog that threshold, and propel the bank into the heightened regulatory landscape. During this wait-and-see period, the bank has been paying out a huge percentage of its income -- 89% from 2010 to 2014 -- as dividends. Those incredible payouts resulted in exceptional yields, making New York Community a favorite of bank investors everywhere.\nOn October 29 of last year, though, the bank announced an agreement to acquire Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE:AF). The bank had found its ticket into the world of $50+ billion banks and the Federal Reserve's annual comprehensive capital analysis and review process, or CCAR. In other words, as a $50+ billion bank, the Fed will now have a say in how much New York Community Bancorp can pay out in dividends, and it looks like a major dividend cut may be coming.\nThe prospect of a dividend cut has sent many dividend investors running. However, for long-term investors, I think this change is not nearly the bad news the market would have you believe.\nAt the time of this writing, New York Community Bancorp's dividend yields 4.4%. If that is cut by two thirds -- quite an aggressive decline -- it would still yield 2.9%. That's more than the S&P 500 average of 2.27%, more than PNC Financial Services' (NYSE: PNC) 2.37%, slightly less than Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC) 2.99%, and still competitive with BB&T's (NYSE: BBT) 3.31%.\nNew York Community may not be a go-to dividend stock going forward, but it will still have an attractive yield in line with, or better than, many other options.\nOne-time expenses related to the Astoria acquisition and a debt restructuring caused New York Community's fourth quarter to end the year on a somewhat ugly note. However, excluding those non-recurring expenses and looking at the company's real operating performance reveals a very strong quarter and year.\nFor example, the company originated $3.7 billion in loans to be held on its balance sheet in the quarter, driving the annual total to $12.7 billion in loan production, records on both a quarterly and annual basis. Excluding one-time expenses, the company returned 1.18% on assets and 9.98% on equity in the quarter.\nThe bank's efficiency ratio -- a measure of the costs it takes to produce revenue -- remained quite strong at 41%, again excluding for the one-time merger-related costs. A lower efficiency ratio indicates better efficiency, and NYCB has a solid lead even over industry-powerhouse Wells Fargo.\nIn terms of valuation, the market is attempting to price in the changing dynamic in the company's dividend, while also taking into account New York Community's strong fundamentals.\nOn a forward basis, the bank's price-to-earnings ratio continues to command a premium"}

The price will be adjusted for the assumption of options and other items, Amazon said.\n\"Like Twitch, we obsess over customers and like to think differently, and we look forward to learning from them and helping them move even faster,\" Bezos said in Amazon's announcement.\nThe acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year.\nIt gives Amazon a big platform for streaming video. Twitch, which was founded in 2011, ranked fourth in U.S. peak Internet traffic in February with a 1.8 percent share, according to data from DeepField. Twitch says its site last month attracted more than 55 million visitors who watched more than 15 billion minutes of content produced by more than 1 million people.\nTwitch generates revenue both by placing ads within its videos and through a subscription program for watching videos. The site lets people upload their video game sessions from their PCs and from consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation 4.\nBeyond hosting video of games themselves, Twitch has also served as a digital venue for events such as the gaming competition The International and the gaming conference E3.\nThe acquisition marked a surprising development for Twitch, which reportedly had been in talks with Google to be acquired for some time. But those talks cooled in recent weeks, according to earlier reports.\n\"This is a big deal,\" said Lewis Ward, an industry analyst at IDC who studies gaming and consumer technology. \"It will reverberate for years to come in the gaming community,\" he said.\nAcquiring Twitch gives Amazon deep access to a massive base of loyal gamers and streaming-video users, who could become lucrative targets for advertising. Swooping in and acquiring Twitch may have been the e-retailer's way of keeping the potential rewards out of Google's hands, Ward said.\nAmazon also may be looking to integrate Twitch content into its growing lineup of hardware devices, such as its new Fire phone and Kindle tablets. It could become a way for Amazon to draw gamers into other Amazon services as more gamers gravitate toward mobile devices and away from consoles, Ward said.\nAlso, with Amazon Web Services for cloud computing, Amazon seems poised to provide a robust infrastructure for Twitch to continue its growth."}

On the lower end, consumers will probably be pooling their resources to take advantage of specials on goods such as groceries, which will help them to budget as we go into the busy festive season,\u201d he predicts.\nOne of the advantages of Black Friday is the opportunity for brands to get consumers in store, even those who typically avoid shopping, says Van Rensburg. It\u2019s about drawing them in with a great deal and then getting them to maximise their spending as they\u2019re exposed to the other specials on offer. Another is that it results in a sizeable boost in sales that would usually take weeks to achieve.\nSA is not the only African country where Black Friday is gaining traction. According to Christele Chokossa, senior research analyst at market research provider Euromonitor International, Black Friday is increasingly being recognised across the continent. It was piloted locally by online retailer Takealot in 2012 in SA, with Checkers following suit in 2014, though Black Friday only reached its current heights in 2015. Online retailers such as Jumia pioneered Black Friday in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, with the first Nigerian Black Friday taking place in 2013.\nHowever, while Black Friday and Cyber Monday are becoming more popular in Sub-Saharan Africa, the deals offered by local retailers still fail to compare favourably to Black Friday offers in other regions, particularly the United States, says Chokossa.\nDespite this she predicts that Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately become as important, if not more important, than the Christmas holidays in terms of shopping days, with consumers showing increasing interest in online shopping. Many SA shoppers have already changed their purchasing patterns by shifting their Christmas shopping to November to capitalise on Black Friday discounts. As a result, many retailers have relooked their strategic direction to increase and maintain traffic during this time.\nA good sales performance during this time of the year puts a retailer in a strong position for the next year, says Euromonitor International\u2019s Amanda Bourlier. Conversely, weak performance during the end-of-year shopping season puts the retailer in a difficult position, especially if they have had a mediocre year.\nBourlier says consumers shop differently over the holiday season. The fact that they\u2019re often pressed for time means they are open to trying new services that could save them time and visiting retailers that they wouldn\u2019t normally go to. So the holiday season is an important time to target consumers by promoting new services and channels, she says.\nLook out for Redzone Black Friday specials on silver, gold and digital memberships, including a 25% discount on digital membership.\nMost major retailers realise the importance of taking part in Black Friday, agrees Klyne Maharaj, head of brand at Superbalist.

Romero\u2019s monumental 1978 classic Dawn of the Dead is in any way superior to its source material. Romero\u2019s original is a bloody, angry, unforgettable social allegory tucked inside a lively adventure film\u2014a celluloid cri de coeur hasn\u2019t dimmed in volume on the way up to its fortieth anniversary, as Chris Alexander passionately wrote in a very personal essay earlier this week, and the waves of Dawn\u2019s resonance can still be felt today in every corner of pop culture and serious film study.\nIt\u2019s this beatification of the original Dawn that drowns out any deeper examination of the merits found in the remake, and there are indeed many. Dawn 04 is generally acknowledged to be a high point of the remake wave that washed over horror fans during the previous decade, though often waved off as a dumber, louder kid brother compared to Dawn 78; it\u2019s frequently dismissed as \u201ca pretty good action movie\u201d before talk goes back to the enduring greatness of Romero\u2019s version. In this, genuine consideration of Dawn 04 as it stands on its own is often overlooked, and it\u2019s better late than never to address this mistake.\nThat opening sequence. Dawn 04 sports one of the meanest, most kinetic kickoffs in horror, with Snyder announcing himself to filmgoers in the form of a suburban summer idyll shattered by a flailing, gnashing, monster-child pelting itself against shellshocked nurse Anna (Sarah Polley). Dawn 78 eased the audience gradually into the chaos of a zombie takeover, assuming that Johnny and Barbara\u2019s graveyard surprise in NOTLD sufficiently startled audiences. Dawn 78\u2019s newscasters and were police aware of the zombie mission statement from the jump\u2014there was no such briefing provided for poor Anna, and the adrenalized zombie assault that she endures before the credits even kick in serves as one hell of a fierce reintroduction.\nAnna meets up with Officer Kenneth (an imperious Ving Rhames, never better) and they proceed to sequester themselves in a Milwaukee mall with a number of other survivors in hopes that a rescue will arrive. For those unaware of her day gig, Polley is a child actor-turned-writer/director involved most often with talky, serious-minded arthouse fare. Her Canadian citizenship made her attractive to Dawn 04\u2019s Toronto production in terms of meeting government-mandated casting quotas, and Polley said at the time she was thrilled with the chance to take a departure and topline a more action-oriented project. The Dawn of the Dead remake thus landed a tremendous, highly-experienced actress to fill the customary horror heroine uniform of blood-spattered white tank top; Polley\u2019s face fresher than her remake contemporaries in that she didn\u2019t graduate to a feature film lead through putting in time on teen television melodramas, or feel that she was slumming it by doing horror and then letting that attitude to seep through in her performance (yes, that was a dig at the Nightmare on Elm Street remake\u2019s Rooney Mara).

They threaten us injury and insult, maybe even eat us. Communities of lore with a troll in their midst banish them, like Billy Goat Gruff triumphing over the troll under the bridge by head-butting him into the swift flowing river.\nThe artist, Thomas Dambo, may refer to Isak as a pile of recycled materials, but Isak Heartstone is so much more than that. He has taken on the epic proportions of the trolls of mythology, causing delight to many, woe to some, and conflict to all.\nIn many ways, Isak Heartstone is a microcosm of the current ills in our nation. He has become a scapegoat for our fear and loathing of outsiders, engendering anxiety, fury and calls for deportation.\nIn order to manage the huge numbers of people coming to visit Isak, the town of Breckenridge responded by building a wall around the Wellington neighborhood. Though much more porous than the wall envisioned at the southern border by our president, the imposing buck and rail fence sent a very clear message: you who visit the troll are an outsider, stay only in your lane.\nWhat had once been considered a friendly and welcoming community, Breckenridge was forced into the opposite position.\nIn order to funnel the masses of visitors, the town of Breckenridge closed a trail. Not just a trail closure for resource damage, which was extensive on the western end of the path to Isak, but the town closed a trail because too many people were using it. A trail that everyone in the Wellington and Lincoln Park neighborhoods had a right to use was boarded up and closed off because the troll-seekers were using it as a shortcut to the bus stop. Now no one could use it.\nClosing a trail because too many people are on it sets a terrible precedent for the future of our community\u2019s trail system. As a longtime trails advocate who remembers the days when developers were allowed to close trails, this raised my ire. I\u2019d fought for trails and access for years, and I was ready to go to battle again.\nIsak the troll, as trolls do, caused us to betray our community values.\nSo the solution is banishment. Banishment is an age-old human reaction to an intractable problem. Cultures throughout humankind adopted the custom of the scapegoat or burning man. Heap your ill thoughts on it, pin your gloom to its sleeve, pour your burdens onto its head. And banish it. Or in the case of the Wickerman tradition, a modern day Zozobra or Burning Man, torch it.\nFortunately, the final solution of burning Isak is not being considered, as he would not be able to be rebuilt. Isak arrived as a face, hands and feet, created in the artist\u2019s studio. Volunteers helped make the armature and sheathing for the body. A stone heart was installed.\nIsak can be taken apart and rebuilt. Whether he is rebuilt in Breckenridge remains to be seen. Ultimately it is the artist\u2019s purview.

He agreed last week at a debate with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton that the United States should consider leaving the pact if it could not be renegotiated.\nOn Monday, a memorandum surfaced, obtained by The Associated Press, showing that Austan D. Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago who is Mr. Obama\u2019s senior economic policy adviser, met officials last month at the Canadian consulate in Chicago.\nCampaign officials said the memorandum inaccurately described Professor Goolsbee\u2019s comments, as well as Mr. Obama\u2019s position.\n\u201cAt no point did anyone in our campaign convey to anyone that there had been any backing away from Obama\u2019s position on Nafta,\u201d a campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, said Monday.\nMr. De Mora did not respond to requests for an interview, nor did Professor Goolsbee, who campaign officials said was unavailable for comment.\nNevertheless, the controversy, which drew fierce attacks from Mrs. Clinton and Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee, put Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign on the defensive at a crucial moment. He and Mrs. Clinton are locked in a tight battle for the Ohio primary on Tuesday.\nThe memorandum exposed Mr. Obama to accusations of hypocrisy on a touchstone issue, although Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have engaged in posturing on Nafta as they scrapped for votes in Ohio. The two have used language that has been much more hostile in tone on free trade than the nuanced positions that they had staked out in the past.\nThe memorandum raises questions about the transparency and the ability of the campaign to address problems before they grow.\nThe controversy began last week when CTV, a Canadian television network, reported that an Obama official had called the Canadian ambassador in Washington to play down the significance of Mr. Obama\u2019s criticism of Nafta.\nThe campaign and the Canadian Embassy issued denials that were, it appears, technically accurate. But they were incomplete because they did not address Mr. Goolsbee\u2019s meeting with Canadian officials.\nABC News then reported that the Nafta conversation involved the Canadian consul general in Chicago, Georges Rioux, not the ambassador. ABC News identified Professor Goolsbee as the official who met the Canadians.\nMr. Burton issued another strong denial, although he declined to respond to a question about Professor Goolsbee\u2019s discussions with Canadian officials.\nThe spokesman focused instead on the CTV report and attacks from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign based on it.\nWhen the memorandum emerged, it confirmed the meeting and that Nafta was discussed.\nOn Monday, Mr. Burton stood by his earlier statements, adding that the policy articulated in the memorandum does not contradict anything that Mr. Obama has said on Nafta in the campaign.\nMr. Obama reiterated that point at a news conference in San Antonio, saying he favors free trade but wants to renegotiate existing agreements to include safeguards for the environment and labor rights.\nBut in Ohio, his tone has been harsher.

Barkley seems to be a quick study, though, and he showed some real chops in leading a second-half field-goal drive. He converted a fourth-and-5 with an 18-yard pass to Ronald Johnson and a third-and-15 with another 18-yarder up the right sideline to Travon Patterson.\nThoughts: Mustain also led a second-half scoring drive, but the running game did most of the work, with five rushes and a penalty accounting for the final 47 yards.

A salient one is the investment channel.\nIn many countries in the world, including some of the most advanced economies, if a non-citizen, non-resident invests a sufficiently large amount (possibly millions of dollars), they earn permanent residency.\nThe green card is partially a generic reward for undertaking actions that are beneficial to the local economy, and partially a tailored incentive: a foreign investor will feel far more comfortable injecting capital if they can monitor their investment first hand, reside in the same country, and be afforded access to the same legal protections as those interacting with the investments.\nA more subtle - but potentially more important - factor is knowledge transfer. Gulf labour markets make it extremely easy, by global standards, for foreigners to enter the workforce. In the case of high-skilled workers, this represents a potential gold mine for building the talents of locals in the labour market. Working alongside competent foreigners offers nationals the opportunity to absorb their skills and benefit from their experience at an accelerated rate. This is a key reason why almost all global industries working at the cutting edge feature internationally diverse work teams, with Silicon Valley being the standard bearer.\nThe problem with the Gulf model is that the flexibility cuts both ways: while it is easy for foreigners to secure an opportunity, it is also easy for them to lose one. Their residency is tied to having a job, and contracts are typically capped at two years, which makes them inevitably insecure about their economic situation.\nMore importantly, from the perspective of knowledge transfer, the Gulf governments have explicit plans to create jobs for nationals at the expense of foreigners. This makes migrant workers constantly look over their shoulder and fear that a competent sub-ordinate citizen is being groomed to succeed them. As a result, foreigners have very little incentive to engage in the \u201cenabling\u201d knowledge transfer that policymakers envisage, and may even have an incentive to undermine it.\nEconomics 101: Will VAT diversify UAE government revenues?\nEconomics 101: Is Saudi Arabia right to pursue austerity?\nEconomics 101: Do wars ever make economic sense?\nEconomics 101: What lies behind the Arabian Gulf states\u2019 appetite for mega projects?\nIn contrast, in the US, green card holders are no less attractive to prospective employers than citizens, meaning that foreigners need not fear signing their own economic death warrant by building the skills of their colleagues. An appreciation of this dynamic may have contributed to the Saudi government\u2019s decision to pave the way for permanent residents.\nA recent paper by Shai Bernstein and Timothy McQuade of Stanford University and Richard Townsend of the University of California at San Diego, suggests an additional channel for Gulf policymakers to keep in mind when they consider permanent residency.\nUsing firm-level data on innovation and employee characteristics, the researchers find that economic insecurity adversely affects innovation. They begin by noting that much of the technological progress realised by companies is the result of bottom-up efforts by innovative workers. However,"}

While a majority of printers don't support RT, the compatibility lists reveal wider support for the Windows 8 OS, which is the successor to Windows 7 and written for x86 processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\nMicrosoft explained that it was changing the Windows 8 and RT printing architecture to reduce system overhead and simplify the printing process. Windows RT tablets such as Microsoft's Surface have limited resources as ARM's 32-bit processors have a memory ceiling of up to 4GB. Existing Windows applications will work on Windows 8 but not RT, an issue that also extends to device drivers.\n\"We really wanted to ensure that we didn't negatively impact ARM systems by running unnecessary services, and we wanted to reduce system resource usage, while still providing support for as many devices as possible,\" wrote Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows and Windows Live Division in the blog entry dated July 25.\nHP has listed 200 LaserJet and ColorJet laser printers and multipurpose devices, of which only 34 are fully compatible with Windows RT, while a majority are compatible with Windows 8. The printers and multifunction devices not compatible with RT total 83, and 83 offer \"limited support\" for RT. HP has not yet released a compatibility list for inkjet printers.\nLimited support may mean that RT users won't be able to take advantage of advanced printing features such automatic duplexing, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. However users will still be able to do basic printing.\nDell's compatibility list of inkjet and laser printers has only 32 of 110 printers supporting RT. Only two of 36 inkjets are supported by RT, while a larger ratio of monochrome and color laser printers support RT. The printers compatible with RT also support Windows 8.\nBeyond printers, incompatibility of drivers with RT may extend to other peripherals like cameras and scanners, Brookwood said.\nPrinter companies may not want to build drivers on old products for Windows 8 and RT as there is money and effort in development of new drivers and certification from Microsoft, Brookwood said.\n\"If you think about the HPs and Canons of the world, they don't want you to be able to use your old printer with the new OS,\" Brookwood said.\nThe printer companies want to sell more products, and would rather see people buy new printers that are fully compatible with new OSes.\nNonetheless, Microsoft at least is providing a higher level of printer compatibility in Windows RT than other tablet OSes, Brookwood said.\n\"Most people who have been buying tablets to date, including Android and iOS tablets, they hardly ever print because of limits\" on drivers, Brookwood said.\nHP's latest printers come with wireless printing capabilities. Wireless printing may be catching on in mobile devices, but drivers may also be needed for that, Brookwood said."}

A number of analysts polled by Yahoo Finance had expected earnings of 66 cents per share and revenue of $14.7 billion. For the fourth quarter, Intel matched the revenue expectation of $14.7 billion, a 6 percent increase, but exceeded the earnings expectation, hitting 74 cents per share. Intel also reported profits of $3.7 billion, up a whopping 39 percent from a year prior.\nFor the full year, Intel reported revenue of $55.9 billion and profits of $11.7 billion, with unit shipments of PCs, servers, tablets, phones and the Internet of Things reaching record highs for the company. Intel also said that its customers had shipped 46 million tablets using its chips, exceeding a goal it had set for itself.\nA 'reinvigorated' PC business apparently means one that's not dropping as fast as it was a few years ago. Shipments from the company\u2019s PC Client Group, though up by 3 percent from a year ago, were actually down by 3 percent sequentially, to $8.9 billion. Desktop sales fell by 1 percent compared to a year ago, Intel said, while notebook sales climbed by 11 percent. But the average price of Intel's desktop chips were flat, while notebook prices fell by 3 percent.\nBetween the highly anticipated release of Windows 10 and the steady rise of Chromebooks, worldwide PC shipments are expected to decline by a lower-than-expected rate of 3.3 percent this year, and fall by just 1.8 percent in 2016, IDC said on Monday. Gartner said that PC shipments actually rose by 1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the prior year. The release of Windows 10 in particular has analysts cautiously anticipating another rebound.\nIntel itself has admitted, however, that many high-end hardware makers could skip its delayed Broadwell chips, which are now shipping, for the Skylake chips which will debut this fall.\nIntel\u2019s profits are typically based upon its server business, however, where Intel has quietly pushed out older RISC microprocessor suppliers as well as its rival, AMD. Intel reported revenue of $4.1 billion, up a whopping 25 percent from a year ago.\nIntel saw less success in its Internet of Things business, which the company is trying to establish as its next major area of growth via standards. At CES, Intel launched \u201cCurie,\u201d an embedded chip that\u2019s small enough to fit inside a coat button. But the business only pulled in $591 million of revenue\u2014though that was up 10 percent from a year ago.\nIntel\u2019s other businesses fared worse. Intel\u2019s software business pulled in $557 million, down 6 percent, and its struggling Mobile and Communications Group actually reported negative revenue of $6 million.\nIntel will hold a conference call later this afternoon to answer questions from analysts. The company forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, down 7 percent from the fourth quarter.\nWhy this matters: Intel\u2019s forced to ride the wave of the PC market, up and down. But though the company\u2019s communications and IoT businesses are struggling to get off the ground, the dominance Intel has in servers can fund the emerging businesses\u2014and Intel can still report record revenues."}

{"idx": "15155", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Efforts to help subprime borrowers have been disjointed and inconsistent, and a new mortgage industry alliance formed this week is trying to remedy that. But some who counsel distressed homeowners say the alliance won't resolve key issues.\nThe alliance, called HopeNow, was announced by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and counts as members some of the largest lenders and servicers that collect payments, a handful of housing counselor networks, and a group representing investors who hold mortgage debt.\nIt is intended to coordinate efforts between servicers and counselors to provide \"workouts,\" which can include lowering the interest rate on a loan, spreading out past-due payments over the life of the loan or a short-term repayment plan.\nTo date, getting resolution on loan workouts has been difficult in part because of a lack of communication. The alliance members have agreed to provide dedicated teams to rectify that, a move borrower advocates commend.\nBut some of the advocates say the alliance shows signs of being more talk than action, especially given that their \"best-practices\" guidelines are still being debated.\n\"[It's] a smokescreen for not doing anything. It's a PR gimmick. Having a process without a realistic opportunity for results is setting the homeowner up for failure,\" said Bruce Marks, founder and CEO of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA).\nMarks and Michael Shea, housing director of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), said they are highly skeptical because of the reluctance they've seen among many of the alliance members to modify loans to levels affordable to borrowers. In addition, they say, lenders have relied on temporary concessions that potentially just postpone rather than prevent foreclosure.\nMarks and Shea support a suggestion made by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair last week. She called on servicers to permanently freeze interest rates on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for those homeowners who are current on their payments and whose rates have yet to reset. Part of her reasoning: evaluating loans on a case-by-case basis is taking too long, and time is of the essence.\nRoughly 1.3 million subprime ARMs are due for a rate reset between now and the end of 2008, according to data from First American Loan Performance. Monthly foreclosure filings are nearly double what they were one year ago.\nWhile one of the alliance's goals is to improve turnaround time on case evaluations by streamlining the process, both Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the American Securitization Forum (ASF), an alliance member which represents mortgage investors, have stated that the alliance doesn't support across-the-board modifications.\n\"Every situation is different. ... It's very difficult to say we'll have a one-size-fits-all solution,\" said Paul Leonard, vice president for government affairs for the Housing Policy Council, which is organizing the alliance. \"We're not going to dictate how cases should be solved.\"\n\"Our goal is to reach out to as many people as possible and have positive outcomes,\" said Leonard.\nThose positive outcomes include but aren't limited to loan modifications, Leonard said.

Republican Gov. Doug Burgum has supported the repeal and is expected to sign the bill. The repeal would take effect Aug. 1.\nNorth Dakota has had \"blue laws\" restricting business on Sunday since it became a state in 1889. They stemmed from fears that visiting a retail store on Sunday morning would compete with church and leave little time for rest.\nFargo Republican Rep. Shannon Roers Jones, the bill's primary sponsor, had made a push through social media to have constituents urge their senators, including her father, Fargo GOP Sen. Jim Roers, to vote for the bill. Jim Roers voted against the repeal in 2017 when it failed by just two votes. He said he personally didn't like the idea of repealing the law but that he voted in favor of the bill Tuesday \"because of my constituents, as well as my daughter.\"\nChurch groups, including the North Dakota Catholic Conference, had asked parishioners to lobby against the repeal. Director Christopher Dodson said the Sunday-closing law is \"not about imposing times of worship.\" The intent is to set aside time for \"rest and relaxation\" that is \"important to families and communities,\" he added.\nMost states at some time in their history have had laws regulating Sunday activities, but most have since been repealed by lawmakers or struck down by courts. About a dozen states have some form of Sunday sales laws, but only North Dakota prohibits shopping on Sunday morning, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe bill would leave in place the state's all-day ban on Sunday vehicle sales and half-day ban on Sunday alcohol sales. Shopping malls and building owners could not require that a business in the facility be open on Sunday.\nThe Greater North Dakota Association, the state's chamber of commerce, has long supported lifting the ban, while the North Dakota Retail Association has taken a neutral stance on it.\nThe state Supreme Court has twice upheld the Sunday shopping ban, once in the mid-1960s and again in the early 1990s, ruling that the law was not to aid religion, but rather to set aside a day for \"rest and relaxation.\"\nNorth Dakota once required most businesses to stay closed on Sundays, but that was changed in 1985 to allow grocery stores to open. In 1991, the Legislature agreed to allow most businesses to open on Sundays, but not before noon.\nIn 2015, the Legislature voted to allow restaurants and bars to begin serving alcohol at 11 a.m. on Sundays, instead of noon. Proponents said North Dakota's booze restrictions put cities bordering other states at a disadvantage because those states allow for earlier sales on Sundays.\nBackers of the entire Sunday repeal argued similarly.\nGOP Sen.

They are just not clinical enough.\nTime after time, Leinster put themselves into excellent scoring positions but failed to convert via some silly mistakes. Connacht on the other hand, as they had against Edinburgh, continued to believe that if they could just stay in the game and within one score of the champions, they could win.\nIt was another frustrating night for the Blues, who created more than enough chances to win pulling up, and while they have two losing bonus points on the road, they will still be bitterly disappointed in the execution of their game-plan.\nThis weekend, at home, it becomes another must-win game for them, and given the fact that the visitors Cardiff have only managed one win here in 10 years and are struggling to score tries at the moment, Leinster should not only be going after a win, but a five-point haul.\nLeinster need to be more patient in their build-up.

And with geothermal energy in abundance, this could be a model used across the US.\nThe tomatoes aren\u2019t cooperating. Instead of growing up the trellis, the plants are weaving all over the garden bed and arching, menacingly, toward a young grapevine. On a hot August afternoon, Pauline Benetti and Diane Kelsey are trying to coach the fruit upward by tying its stems to the wood-and-metal trellis.\nIt\u2019s high season for the juicy red spheres, but these two volunteers \u2013 both shorter than the vines they\u2019re trying to wrangle \u2013 aren\u2019t just struggling with these plants for the final farmers\u2019 markets of the summer. They want to train the tomatoes to grow in the right direction inside this greenhouse all year long.\nTheir work is part of a five-year effort by the Geothermal Greenhouse Partnership (GGP) in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The volunteer-run nonprofit, in coordination with the south-west Colorado town, is transforming the world's deepest geothermal hot spring into something much more than just a travel destination: it\u2019s using the renewable energy source to grow food year-round for the community.\nPagosa Springs is well-known in the western United States for its unique approach to geothermal energy, which is energy harnessed from the Earth\u2019s heat. Geothermal food growing, though, is a new enterprise.\n\u2022 Are forgotten crops the future of food?\nIn the centre of the small downtown, on the banks of the San Juan River, sit three conspicuous, geodesic greenhouses, each 42ft (13m) in diameter. They stand in stark contrast to the old-timey buildings on the road above. All will house gardens, but each has a different mission.\nThe first, the Education dome, was built in 2016. It is the only one of the trio that\u2019s currently operational. Volunteers stop by to prune and plant every day; more than 300 students have visited the site to learn about the plants and to practice their maths or science skills; and the public is welcome from 11:00 to 14:00 on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\u201cEverything we do is [focused on] teaching sustainable agriculture to the next generation and growing food year-round \u2013 which is pretty special\u201d at an altitude of 7,150 feet (2,180m), says Sally High, a former environmental educator and GGP board treasurer.\nThe geothermal water comes from town wells via a lease agreement with Pagosa Springs. A heat exchanger inside each greenhouse uses the geothermal liquid to heat domestic water, which is piped through the floor of the greenhouse in cold-weather months. The geothermal fluid then resumes its natural path.\nThe closed-loop system is as close to non-consumptive as possible \u2013 meaning almost no water is consumed during the process, with most of it returning to the ground \u2013 and allows the greenhouse to maintain a consistent temperature that ranges from 58F (around 14C) on the coldest winter nights to 90F (32C) on a sweltering summer day.

'Most of the Leicester greats came through the academy together and got better and better.\n'When you look at the current team, the likes of Ben Youngs, Tom Youngs, Manu Tuilagi, Tom Croft, Toby Flood, myself perhaps, we're all still young men who can expect to be better individually and collectively.\nStanding in Cole's way, though, are a Toulouse team with even more European history, a team with the same standards and expectations and a team who will also win the group and qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Leicester.\nIn October, when the teams met in France in the first game of the pool stages, Toulouse were deserved 23-9 winners.\nCole expects a different conclusion this time.\n'I'll look around the dressing room and I'll see the likes of Tom Youngs and Louis Deacon, Julian Salvi and Marcus Ayerza, and I'll know they'll give their all.

Still, John Allers thought it would be a good idea to host an outdoor concert in late January. As it turns out, he was right.\nIn 2011, Radio 104.5, Philly's alternative rock station, for which Allers is the program director, unveiled what was then called Winter Jam, an open-air concert at the Piazza at Schmidts. The free event featured performers Bayside and locals Terrible Things and Valencia. Piggybacking off of the success of their popular Summer Block Party events \u2014 free concerts also held at the Piazza \u2014 Radio 104.5's sales manager suggested a winter iteration playing into a snow sports theme.\n\"I'm sure a lot of listeners, bands and sponsors thought we were nuts when we first introduced the concept of an outdoor concert in Philly in the winter,\" Allers said.\nNow re-branded as Winter Jawn, the live music event won a 2017 Reader's Choice award. The new show is held at XFINITY Live! and has seen lineup alumni like Tegan and Sara, New Found Glory, Cold War Kids and just this year, Grouplove, Capital Cities and Phantogram. And it's still free.\nBelow, Allers shares his favorite memories and how the event has grown over the years.\nDo you think there was a need for an outdoor wintertime event?\nI think there was a need, though I can't say I fully realized it at the time. I really didn't know what to expect when we launched the event, but it sounded like a fun idea and based on the event's success, I would say there is absolutely a need. Winter Jawn has turned into a great answer to cabin fever.\nHow did the first-ever Winter Jawn event translate with fans?\nWe were blown away by the response from day one! Now, I think the participants feel a [bond] from being a part of the event. We've been able to make it bigger and better every year to the point where we now hold it at XFINITY Live! with two stages.\nHow has the event grown since then?\nWe are able to lure larger artists and bigger crowds, as we've normalized the concept of an outdoor festival in Philadelphia in January. We've also been fortunate to have booked some great performers around a time when their music was really beginning to connect with our audience, including bands like Twenty One Pilots, Walk The Moon, Judah and The Lion, New Found Glory and more. From a fan perspective, I believe the event has yielded a great deal of word of mouth and photo and video sharing through social media and enticed more interest each year.\nWhat's the biggest challenge in organizing an event like this?\nThe biggest challenge has been educating artists and booking agents about the event and sharing all of our success stories. You should have seen the looks we got when we first asked artists to perform on an outdoor stage in Philly in the middle of winter. Yet once bands play Winter Jawn, they seem to like it and several artists have returned to play a second year, including Twenty One Pilots, Walk The Moon and Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. Also, making our artists and listeners comfortable should we have cold weather.\nWhy is it important for Radio 104.5 to throw live concerts?\nOur audience loves live music and I believe it's a great way"}

That fee, which El Paso Electric pays to the city quarterly, is passed on to ratepayers who live inside El Paso city limits through electric rates and a separate surcharge.\nThe estimated $40 million would be in addition to millions of dollars of city tax rebates and other incentives put on the table by city officials to get Great Wolf to build its complex at Interstate 10 and Paseo del Norte Boulevard (Artcraft Road).\nThe city plans to swap 2,313 acres of city-owned land surrounding Painted Dunes golf course in Northeast El Paso for the 44-acre, West Side site, where Great Wolf would be located.

The government also said it believed the documents had been \u201cstolen\u201d from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British counterpart of the NSA.\nGreenwald, who has been helping Snowden disseminate the documents he took from U.S. government computers, had previously said that Snowden had downloaded 20,000 documents. As previously reported by NBC News, the U.S. government has not yet been able to determine the scope of what Snowden took.\nThe government was able to decrypt some of the files using a code found on a piece of paper carried by Miranda, but is struggling to decrypt the rest.\nIn a separate statement to the court, Oliver Robbins, Britain's deputy national security advisor for intelligence, chided Miranda for carrying a password on a piece of paper. \"The fact that ... claimant was carrying on his person a handwritten piece of paper containing the password for one of the encrypted files,\" said Robbins, \"is a sign of very poor information security practice.\"\nRobbins also said that the information seized from Miranda was \"highly likely to describe techniques which have been crucial in life-saving counter-terrorist operations, and other intelligence activities vital to UK national security.\"\nA former U.S. official familiar with the case said \"significant amounts\" of intelligence documents from U.S. allies -- particularly the UK and Australia -- were taken by Snowden from the NSA.\nMiranda had challenged the right of British authorities to retain the material seized from him, but at Friday\u2019s hearing the judge agreed to let the government continue examining the files.

But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that these homeowners were making payments on time and unfairly booted from their homes without cause.\nMany of the irregularities stem from the fact that lenders routinely sell the loans they write to other firms and investors, the report showed. They just don\u2019t always fill out the proper paperwork in assigning these loans to the new note holders.\nThat can lead to confusion over who had the legal right to process the foreclosure. But it doesn\u2019t mean the foreclosure itself was unwarranted.\nThat point is significant given that the median home value in Southern California slipped again last month, to $260,000 \u2013 down from $270,000 in December 2011. Values are now on par with what they were in 2002.\nReckless lenders who sold loans to people who didn\u2019t qualify for the terms are one reason that home values are back to where they were a decade ago. But reckless borrowers who took those loans, making a bad bet that home values would continue soaring, are certainly another.\nBy the way, the title \u201cForeclosure in California\u201d itself may be a bit of an exaggeration.

Grocery store supporters hope to raise another $1 million, enough to get the store built, stocked, and staffed.\nTherein lies the rub of our insane food system: We\u2019ve consolidated and centralized everything from the production plant to the grocery store. This has made our food cheap \u2014 to the point where Americans spend a smaller fraction of our income on groceries than any other country. But a lack of competition from the big players means low prices for farmers. Those who can squeak by end up driving past 30 miles of food to buy another farmer\u2019s thin margins.\nThere\u2019s also a downside in terms of flavor. Technically, there was nothing wrong with the Sysco steak on my plate; it tasted fine. I walked in knowing this was no locavore haven, and yet the glimpse into the freezer dulled my tastebuds. The town\u2019s famed steak got its flavor elsewhere. I poured on the Heinz and finished it anyway."}

We wanted to see how it stacked up against other facilities.\nGreenhouse gases trap heat and warm the planet, leading to heat waves, droughts, sea level rise, and other adverse effects. In the U.S., the largest source of greenhouse gases come from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.\nThe EPA requires facilities to report their emissions if they release more than 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year.\nWe took a look at the five facilities that met the EPA threshold in Davidson County, home to a diverse economy with intense energy needs. Most of their emissions were carbon dioxide, and some were methane.\nThe EPA data does not include indirect sources of greenhouse gases.\nAt Vanderbilt, for instance, the university's sustainability office also tracks the amount of emissions from purchased power, and from people commuting to campus. Those sources are not accounted for in this round-up.\nThe largest employer in Nashville, Vanderbilt has its own power plant that provides heat, cooling and electricity to the medical center and other parts of the Vanderbilt campus. It primarily emits carbon dioxide. The plant was burning coal until it switched to natural gas in November 2014, accounting for the largest reduction in pollution. Emissions dropped even further while the plant was partially offline for construction, but they climbed back up in the last two years as it became fully operational.\nStill, the university\u2019s emission levels are down 22 percent since 2010, during a time of campus expansion. It recently opened a new engineering and science building.\nFiberweb manufactures weather protection systems for buildings, including the wrapping that you see around homes under construction. It specializes in so-called nonwoven fabric. The company has been expanding at the former DuPont plant in Old Hickory in recent years. Around 2010 it built a $25 million natural-gas powered utility plant.\nAbout a year later it added a $12 million research and development center. Then, in 2013 it announced a new 300,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center. Consolidating all the operations in one location, the company said, would reduce its overall carbon footprint. At Old Hickory, though, it has increased its emissions by more than two-thirds since 2011, when it first began reporting to the EPA.\nCarlex produces windshields and other automotive glass at its factory in northwest Nashville. With three large brick smokestacks for furnaces, the plant looks like it\u2019s from a bygone era. It was built for Ford in the 1950s. But inside the Japanese-owned company uses high-tech processes to mold and finish the glass.

And so for the third time in 19 months, a proposal to regulate roving food vendors re-emerging, this time with a distinct difference: the proposal is in the form of an ordinance that singles out mobile vendors\u2014and bans them altogether from city limits except during special events.\nIt is the most far-reaching and strict proposal yet, exceeding what most Flagler Beach city commissioners had suggested to date, and likely to again stir up the sort of anger and opposition that previous but vaguer such proposals had drawn when discussed in April and February 2012. The city commission takes up the proposal at its Thursday meeting, which begins at 5:30 p.m. at Flagler Beach\u2019s city hall. But the meeting agenda is stacked with more than two dozen items, with the mobile vendor item scheduled toward the end\u2013when audience members have usually tired of the slog.\nFlagler Beach doesn\u2019t have a serious food vending \u201cproblem,\u201d nor is it prone to much roving food-vending traffic. The proposals have been largely seen as targeting one vendor in particular: Sandy Kinney, a Bunnell resident who sells ice cream out of her truck, and has been doing so for several years in Bunnell, Palm Coast, unincorporated parts of Flagler County, and of course Flagler Beach.\nBut Kinney\u2019s selling in Flagler Beach also angers existing ice cream businesses that have invested time and money on their brick-and-mortar locations, where they must abide by city regulations. To some of them, Kinney is afforded an unfair competitive advantage by being allowed to sell from her truck.\nBut by no means to all. Karen Barchowski, one of the three co-owners of Sally\u2019s Ice Cream on North A1A, has championed Kinney\u2019s operation all along. \u201cI have supported her from day one,\u201d Barchowski said, as have her two partners in the business.\nCity Commissioner Jane Mealy, who has led the charge against mobile vendors, has insisted that she\u2019s never sought to ban ice cream trucks in particular, only to regulate mobile vending in general, which city ordinances leave entirely silent. The proposed ordinance ends that silence.\n\u201cThis was what I was looking for to begin with,\u201d Mealy said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t see Flagler Beach as a town that has ice cream trucks or whatever kind of mobile vending just riding around, ringing bells, making all kinds of noise, and I think they\u2019re very unsafe. Kids run out in the street without looking. I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessary.\u201d Her strongest reason against mobile vending, Mealy added, is their unfairness to brick-and-mortar businesses, which pay rent, pay taxes and abide by regulations. \u201cI think it\u2019s more friendly to the brick and mortar businesses than to have those trucks around,\u201d Mealy said.\nWhen the issue was previously discussed, Commissioner Steve Settle echoed Mealy\u2019s concerns about safety, and favored limiting the range of vendors within the city to specific areas. But Commissioners Marshall Shupe and Joy McGrew were more supportive of mobile vendors\u2014at least they were so last year. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of vendors,\u201d McGrew said categorically, though she was willing to hear about some form of compromise that would regulate them\u2014not ban them. Shupe had no opposition to ice cream trucks, but he was opposed to what he considered to be shadier vendors who may be hawking watches"}

It was the unanimous decision of the party leadership, he said, that we will not go towards the Prime Minister's House.\nHashmi said party leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Jehangir Tareen, Asad Umar, Arif Alvi and Pervaiz Khattak were all agreed on this decision.

The \"Bangladesh Model\", a soft coup, is based on the idea that the political system must be cleansed of corrupt elements for the welfare of the public, which perhaps has been left incapacitated to elect honest leaders.\nThe model works on the premise that the military and judiciary must intervene to help differentiate the \"right\" from the \"wrong\" before it is too late.

In the warm-up to one match in the late Seventies, when he was in his 30s, his right knee gave way.\n\u2018I pushed the knee to get it back in again and tried to go on but it collapsed again,\u2019 he recalls.\nNot long after he underwent surgery to \u2018remove excess cartilage\u2019. \u2018I recovered well and continued to play some sports, like tennis, often with a crepe support bandage to stop my knee collapsing,\u2019 he says.\nBill has now learned the surgery he had all those years ago involved removing a meniscus disc.\nThere are two of these triangular wedges in each knee \u2014 they poke into the joint, acting as a cushion to protect the cartilage, which lies above the meniscus and coats the bones to help them glide smoothly across each other.\nBill had torn the meniscus on the inner side of his right knee, and up until the early Eighties, a damaged meniscus would be completely removed, explains Adil Ajuied, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospitals NHS Trust, in London.\nHowever, this then popular surgical technique had an unintended long-term effect, predisposing patients to arthritis. \u2018The unfortunate effect of removing the meniscus is to remove the shock absorber,\u2019 adds Mr Ajuied, who carried out Bill\u2019s recent knee replacement privately at the Fortius Clinic.\nIt seems Bill has done extraordinarily well not to need a new knee until now, as many patients who had their meniscus removed needed knee replacements within ten to 15 years. Such patients are still coming through for knee replacements, says Mr Ajuied.\nToday a torn meniscus is treated in a day procedure where the tears are simply trimmed \u2014 \u2018you walk out that day and you\u2019re on crutches for only one or two days\u2019, explains Mr Ajuied.\nAs well as a life-threatening attack of peritonitis \u2014 an abdominal infection \u2014 in the mid-Seventies, Bill\u2019s other major health concern has been bipolar disorder, diagnosed about 15 years ago, and for which he takes lithium.\nIt ran in the family. \u2018I\u2019d come home from school to find my mother attacking my father,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018She was eventually committed to a psychiatric hospital where she sat hunched up in a corner.

When I\u2019m commuting across the Dumbarton Bridge between the KGO building and the tollbooths, there is a putrid smell that is sometimes rotten eggs and sometimes poop. It can be so strong that I can easily throw up if I do not cover my nose and mouth. I smell it mostly in the afternoon since my windows are down. But westbound in the morning, even with the windows closed, I can still smell it. What is causing the smell?\nQ Why does the stretch of Interstate 880 between Dixon Landing Road and Highway 237 smell so bad? It\u2019s the pits, dude. There is a fireplace log and charcoal briquette factory off Dixon that gets peach pits from packing plants this time of year and stores them in piles while the flesh rots and stinks.

{"idx": "15226", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: With millions fewer state dollars flowing out from Austin in the coming two years, the challenge locally is how to minimize the impact.\nThat impact is not limited to initial cuts in payroll or services those organizations receiving state funding must enact to offset the revenue reductions, but extends to the greater community, which will feel the indirect result of millions of dollars removed from the local economy.\nThe obvious impact comes when Lubbock ISD eliminates 87 support staff positions to save $3.4 million or closes three small schools to save another $4 million. The district, which is preparing to lose as much as $10 million in state funding, did what it had to do.\nThe obvious impact comes as Texas Tech eliminates positions and tightens its belt to weather what cuts the as-of-yet undetermined state budget will deliver.\nVarious other groups dependent on state money will also see revenue reductions.\nShould the Texas House\u2019s budget become law, the state\u2019s school districts will see $7.8 billion less from Austin over the coming two years.\nAlthough it\u2019s more likely the actual budget will fall somewhere between the House\u2019s $164.5 billion plan and the Senate\u2019s $176.5 billion offering, the House budget is $23 billion smaller than the current state budget while the Senate offers $11 billion less.\nThe House\u2019s $7.8 billion cut to public schools gained a bit of definition Tuesday as the House Public Education Committee approved a plan for how the cuts will be spread across the state\u2019s 1,024 school districts.\nState Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, offered a school finance bill attempting to fix a 2006 school funding plan where districts ended up with disproportionate funding. Under the 2006 plan, Lubbock ISD\u2019s \u201ctarget revenue\u201d was $4,870 per student and other districts had as much as $12,000 per student. With Hochberg\u2019s plan, the target revenue variances would be reduced, with districts having high target revenue numbers bearing the brunt of state funding cuts. According to The Texas Tribune\u2019s database based on Hochberg\u2019s plan, some districts would be looking at 20 to 40 percent cuts, while districts would see funding drop by lesser percentages. LISD would get about $5.6 million or a little more than 3 percent less.\nShould Hochberg\u2019s plan make it into law, it bodes well for LISD \u2014 but not necessarily for all school districts in Lubbock County. Combined, the seven districts would get $292.5 million over the coming two years, down $15.4 million or 5 percent.\nThat\u2019s where the less obvious impacts come into play. Isolating the $3.4 million LISD will save by eliminating central office support staff, the local economy will feel an estimated $24 million impact. That estimate is based on the formula of each dollar turning over seven times. When applied to the projected $15.4 million in reduced state funding to county school districts, the local economy will lose $107.9 million.\nWith that level of loss in money coming into the local economy, the challenge bigger than balancing the budgets of local state-supported groups will be creating new businesses and industry to provide the jobs and economic contributions needed to keep the region going."}

Everyone agrees on this even though Labour\u2019s position in the polls is not significantly better now than it was before the summer.\nThe Labour leader, and again on this everyone seems to agree, has been setting the agenda. David Cameron has been forced to respond to whatever Miliband has been talking about. From Syria to the Daily Mail to the cost of living it\u2019s been the leader of the opposition who has seized the initiative. As a result, Miliband looks stronger; Cameron somewhat diminished.\nThat, at least, is the conventional wisdom and, as is so often the case, the conventional wisdom is not wholly nonsense. It has certainly become more difficult to make stick the charge that Miliband is a hopeless wet fish.\nNevertheless there is a difference between getting a good press and convincing the public. A considerable difference, in fact. The press loves bandwagons and is constantly distracted by the latest, new, exciting, shiny thing. The public takes longer to be persuaded, if indeed it can be persuaded at all.\nWhich of the following policies do you think will do more to help consumers with the cost of their energy bills?\nForcing companies to automatically put consumers on the cheapest deal they have available, and reduce the number of different deals they have on offer to simplify things for consumers.\nFreezing the cost of energy bills by law for two years, to prevent any further price increases, and reforming the way the energy market operates to increase transparency and competition.\n51.8% chose the first policy, only 37.9% the second. In other words, Labour\u2019s headline policy from conference season is less popular than the policy preferred by an unpopular coalition government.\nThe Tory (ok, Tory-led) policy is the preferred option amongst voters of every socio-economic class and in every part of Britain except the north of England.\nIt is, of course, only one data point. Nevertheless it is a telling one. Because it suggests the public takes a more sceptical view of populist and simplistic policy solutions to complex problems than might commonly be assumed.\nMoreover, this result \u2013 and no fewer than 38% of voters who intend to vote Labour say they prefer the government policy \u2013 suggests that Miliband has not yet made the leap from credible leader of the opposition to credible Prime Minister in waiting. And that is, as Neil Kinnock might remind him, a Beamonesque leap.\nI suspect the public can recognise a gimmick when it is dangled before them and they have concluded that Miliband\u2019s energy-price-freeze gimmick is indeed a gimmick. And they are unimpressed by it. They identify it, correctly, as a pose not a policy. Poses are good for winning headlines; they are less useful for winning votes.\nSo, again with the caveat that this is a single data point, I suspect this is a useful poll (and not just because it leads to conclusions I happen to find attractive). Useful because it reminds us that Ed Miliband is still a work-in-progress. The Labour leader may be able to identify problems; it is much less obvious that he has identified solutions.\nEnergy policy, of course, is only one small example of this. Much the same, I think, could be said of Labour\u2019s economic policy. And that\u2019s something that Labour partisans should probably find worrying.\nIs Ed Miliband a) hopeless, b) on course to become Prime Minister or c) both?"}

Today she lies infirm and barely coherent after a lifetime of eating what must rank as an extremely spartan diet. It was not economics that imposed the diet: It was a mixture of societal expectations and her own conscience.\nUp until three decades ago, Bengali widows were expected by society to cook on a separate stove, using their own cooking vessels\u2014mainly kaasha or bell metal\u2014and maintain a separate set of tableware. They would sit on the floor in the kitchen for their meals, which had a long list of don\u2019ts: no meat, fish or chicken, no onions or garlic. No garam masalas such as cinnamon and cloves. Not even masoor dal (type of lentil) was allowed, probably due to the pink colour. No parboiled rice for sure, though Gobind Bhog was accepted. Raka\u2019s grandmother stuck to sendha namak, the mountain salt that is the norm all over north India for Navratra fasts. In fact, one of Raka\u2019s earliest memories was of her grandmother pounding salt with the other spices on the grinding stone that nobody else in the family used.\nOther friends recall with trembling voices the dhokar dalna and ash gourd with grated coconut that only their widowed grannies could prepare with such precision\u2014these dishes would taste sublime with the least amount of spicing.\nSo what exactly is the secret of Bengali widows\u2019 cooking? Could something so simple actually be made to taste good? Yes, because of the labour intensive processes that were involved. Which leads to the question: Do the rest of us overspice our food as a short cut to making food tasty without necessarily taking time and effort over the process?\nAnother theory is that whatever you tasted in your childhood will stay with you as a pleasant memory. But whatever the truth, it couldn\u2019t have been pleasant for the widow herself. Raka\u2019s grandmother was married at the age of 16 and was widowed slightly over a year later, which means that she has been a widow for upwards of seven decades. And imagine having to end it all at the mercy of someone else\u2019s culinary skills when you are too ill to carry on a lifestyle that has been yours for all that time.\nIn the old days, no self-respecting widow would have cooked this chutney because of the presence of garlic; today, even fish is par for the course.\n\u00bdtsp panchphoran (Bengal\u2019s five spice mixture containing jeera (cumin seeds), saunf (fennel seeds), kalonji (nigella seeds), methi (fenugreek) seeds and radhuni; the last is available only in a Bengali store).\nHeat the oil in a heavy pan, add thepanchphoran, red chillies and ginger and garlic one after the other. Put in the tomatoes, salt and sugar. Bring to the boil and then leave to simmer till 30 minutes or until the tomatoes thicken. The more sugar added in the beginning, the quicker the process will be.

Indeed, there is great expectation that this year\u2019s SAARC Summit could be a turning point for the organization.\nSAARC\u2019s roots lay in the Declaration on South Asian Regional Cooperation and the Integrated Programme of Action (IPA), adopted by the foreign ministers of South Asia in 1983, calling for regional cooperation in the areas of agriculture, rural development, telecommunications, meteorology, and health and population activities. Subsequently, SAARC was formally established in 1985, during its first Summit in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The overarching objective of the alliance was to consolidate South Asia\u2019s economic and geopolitical potential, and promote the welfare of the population of the region and improve their quality of life.\nBut more than three decades since it was formed, SAARC stands on shaky ground, and according to some experts has largely been a \u201csomnolent and disappointing body,\u201d its achievements meager and unconvincing.\nEconomically, the region is one of the least integrated in the world, with very low levels of intra-regional trade and investment. Intra-regional trade is under 5 percent of total official trade \u2013 less than it was fifty years ago \u2013 while intra-regional foreign investments as a proportion of total investment figures are just as paltry. Juxtaposed to this, intra-regional trade accounts for nearly 35 percent of the total trade in East Asia, 25 percent in Southeast Asia, and almost 12 percent in Middle East and Africa. The SAFTA (South Asian Free Trade Agreement) group comprises a region that has tremendous economic potential, but despite having 23 percent of the world\u2019s population, the region accounts for only 6 percent of Purchasing Power Parity based global GDP, 2 percent of world goods trade, 3 percent of global foreign direct investment, but more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s poor.\nSAARC has also done little to improve bilateral disagreements and skirmishes, and the Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism has failed to combat terrorist activity. Inter-state conflict is also one of the most significant reasons for the stalling of the SAFTA. The group\u2019s commitment to the goals of the SAARC Charter for Democracy, have been disappointing with several member-nations struggling with military coups, unstable governments, rampant corruption and abuse of power.\nWhile SAARC\u2019s failure to realize its goals may be attributed to several factors \u2013 ranging from terrorism, strained bilateral relations, and the absence of military and strategic cooperation \u2013 India\u2019s own engagement with SAARC has been found wanting, even though it has evolved over the years.\nIndia\u2019s initial attitude towards SAARC was, according to one observer, \u201cakin to the attempt by the Lilliputs to tie down Gulliver.\u201d It, consequently, played a limited role in the alliance, choosing instead to engage with its neighbors bilaterally based on reciprocity.

The other workers survived.\nSteve Lemay's body will eventually be transported back to Washington as investigators try to determine what caused the collapse.\nOn his way to the funeral home Friday morning, Keith Lemay told the News-Leader in a phone interview that he will remember his dad as a generous man who donated money to an orphanage in India and made yearly trips there to visit the children.\nDuring holidays, Keith Lemay said his parents open their home to victims at a local women's shelter.\n\"He had very strong faith,\" Keith Lemay said. \"He was a picture-perfect dad.\"\nAs of Friday morning, Keith Lemay said the family had not received any information as to what might have led to Thursday's tower collapse.\n\"Right now, we don't have answers,\" Keith Lemay said. \"In time, we will find out.\"\nKeith Lemay said his dad began working on TV towers more than 20 years ago and had a reputation for being hard-working but also extremely cautious.\nWhen Keith Lemay got the news Thursday that his father died in the collapse, he said he could not stop crying.\n\"We're all going to miss him a lot,\" Keith Lemay said.\nWebster County Sheriff Roye Cole said workers heard cracks and pops on the tower before it went down.\nCole said the other workers on the tower started fleeing, but Lemay stayed on the tower.\n\"My logical conclusion is that he was somehow trying to fix the situation,\" Cole said, while cautioning that it is too early to say what happened with any certainty.\nThe TV tower that collapsed was owned by Missouri State University and used to broadcast KOZK Ozarks Public Television.\nMSU spokeswoman Suzanne Shaw said the workers were installing structural support to accommodate new equipment associated with a channel change.\nCole said the workers were replacing crossbeams on the tower.\nJohn Myers, a structural engineering professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology, said it's extremely rare for any type of structure like a TV tower to collapse without some type of major event, like a hurricane or tornado.\nMyers cautioned against speculation but said it appears to him that multiple factors could have contributed to the tower's collapse.\nA witness described the sound of the tower collapsing as \"a car crash magnified by 500.\""}

An inquiry to Darden\u2019s Net Impact club found its way to Gray, who \u201cgrabbed the bull by the horns and brought the project to life,\u201d according to Cuellar.\nGray, who came to Darden with a background in the financial technology and insurance space, had a long-standing interest in social entrepreneurship and was curious to participate in the venture creation process in a developing country. Similarly, Reiss, who came to Darden with a technology background and experience in venture capital, welcomed the opportunity both to share what he knew about starting a technology venture and to gain a better understanding of the challenges startups face on the other side of the globe.\nShortly after the first email exchange, Gray and Reiss began meeting regularly over Skype with Jana Jurukovska, a teacher who came to the Co-Lab with a plan for a crowdsourcing platform for helping local Macedonians pay for medical bills in the case of an unexpected emergency, similar to GoFundMe or YouCaring in the U.S. While she had a vision for her product and company, she had no experience in business, finance or management.\nDespite her lack of traditional business training, Jurukovska said the regular meetings convinced her that her idea was viable, and that she had the capabilities to develop the requisite toolkit to get it off the ground.\nGray and Reiss say the ideal mentor-mentee relationship took some time to solidify. As MBAs armed with a wealth of entrepreneurial theory and experience, the Darden students went into the program imagining they would be full of answers and solutions.\n\u201cYou get excited, and you want to do what you can to help, but you\u2019re not nearly as familiar with the business environment on the ground as they are,\u201d Reiss said.\nInstead, the pair suppressed their natural instincts and started advising less while listening more, enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of what Jurukovska hoped to accomplish. It also helped them identify what a successful outcome from their sessions could look like.\nAlong the way, they helped guide Jurukovska toward a viable business strategy, wrestling with fundamentals like pricing and customer acquisition strategy along the way. They also gained a greater understanding of the unique challenges involved in starting a business in a country like Macedonia, where roughly a quarter of the population is unemployed, according to Cuellar.\nGray said a key takeaway from the experience for him is witnessing the global applicability of the business skills he has learned before and during his time at Darden.\nGray and Reiss have also worked with Cuellar to help bring some additional structure to the mentorship program. To that end, a second round of pairings between Darden students and the Co-Lab are in the works for the remainder of the school year.\nGray and Reiss are careful not to overstate their impact, but each says they take satisfaction"}

Local Churches claim between 30,000 and 40,000 members in North America, along with at least 300,000 more worldwide.\nSigners included noted evangelical scholars Darrell Bock of Dallas Theological Seminary; Gordon Lewis, professor emeritus at Denver Seminary; Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary president Paige Patterson; and Earl Radmacher, president emeritus at Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon.\nThe letter asks LSM to disavow and cease publishing statements from Lee on the doctrine of God and doctrine of man. \"The letter also asks LSM and the 'local churches' to renounce statements made by Lee that denigrate evangelical Christian denominations and organizations,\" a release from the signers said. \"Finally, the letter appeals to the leadership of LSM and the 'local churches' to discontinue their use of lawsuits and threatened litigation against Christian individuals and organizations to answer criticisms or resolve disputes.\"\nIn response to a Harvest House Publishers suit against them, LSM/Local Churches sued the publishing house and authors John Ankerberg and John Weldon over the Encyclopedia of Cults and New Religions, a 1999 volume that included them.

Facetune ($2.99) as its name implies, is more specialized and concentrates on improving skin tones and masking imperfections. Over ($1.99) is a typographic app that lets you create handsome, whimsical titles as well as other spot artwork for your images.\nA selection of edits and filters gives you a well-rounded editing app.\nThe rationale behind Truefilm is that it gives you three apps for way below the price of one, without in-app purchases. Not surprisingly, while Truefilm has some elements of the three apps combined, it does not replace the two specialty apps.\nTruefilm excels in the category of general editing, where competitors such as Snapseed, Aviary, Perfectly Clear and, yes, AfterLight dwell. It has a respectable-looking set of filters and abundant controls for clarity, vibrance, saturation, contrast, grain, cropping and more. The picture frames, skin improvements and text features are extras and fairly basic.\nAn interactive 3D-style undo-redo function takes you to each individual edit.\nIf you really want fancy title lettering on your images, Over is a good choice because it offers many typefaces and stylistic overlays, whereas Truefilm gives you just one. It lets you adjust the size, color and opacity of its single font.\nWhereas Facetune offers a multiciplicity of features that let you smooth skin, whiten teeth, refine facial structure, and even apply makeup, Truefilm gives you just the skin smoother and patch, but that may be all some folks need.\nA variety of photo frames \u2014 mostly based on geometric shapes \u2014 are also available, and you can make them look decorative by coloring them, but that\u2019s the extent of photo frame creativity.\nA productive take on photo adjustments.\nA unique 3D history control functions as a multiple undo-redo feature that lets you slide back and forth through each edit by swiping down with your finger.

It was an open discussion,\" the central bank chief said.\nAnalysts say the strong euro, falling consumer prices and fears of a global economic slowdown as China's once booming expansion cools, provide ample argument for the ECB to ease monetary conditions still further in the 19 countries that share the euro. Markets have begun to speculate that the ECB could soon accelerate or increase its programme of so-called quantitative easing (QE), given that consumer prices declined by 0.1 percent in the euro area in September, raising fears of a dangerous downward spiral of deflation. \"Inflation rates will remain very low in the near term,\" Mr Draghi said.\nIn March, the ECB embarked on a scheme of sovereign bond purchases - more than 1.0 trillion euros in all at a rate of 60 billion euros per month - to bring inflation back up to levels that are more conducive to healthy economic growth. While falling prices might appear to be good for consumers, they can be poisonous to the economy. The fear is that deflation could become entrenched if consumers delay purchases in the hope of lower prices later, which in turn prompts companies to hold off investment, creating a vicious circle of falling demand and fewer jobs.\nSome analysts believe the ECB could extend the QE programme beyond its original timeframe of September 2016 or accelerate or increase in the total amount of bonds purchased.\nECB executive board member Benoit Coeure recently pointed out, however, that only a third of the QE programme had been executed so far. And with the beneficial effects of a range of other policy measures - unprecedented amounts of liquidity and historically low interest rates - still only gradually making themselves felt, it was \"premature to discuss\" a new QE programme, Coeure said. Nevertheless, \"it is certainly our duty to be prepared to cope with all kinds of contingencies,\" he added."}

Parents of preschoolers at the Wilkinson Early Childhood Center magnet school say the only possible instance of neglect was when a 3-year-old was accidentally sent to school in a pullup diaper and, instead of immediately taking it off, Hahn called the parent instead. Another staff member apparently called the Missouri Department of Social Services.\nWhat is amazing to me is that the administrators that decided to fire her - despite her exemplary care and ability - had probably never 'taught' the pre-K children themselves, and their idea of what the school's \"Mission Statement\" was towards what they termed neglect and endangerment left them no choices once the ball began rolling.

{"idx": "15258", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Could the Air Force implement a new policy requiring troops to be ready for a physical fitness assessment at all times, pop-quiz style? It's one of several ideas proposed by the Air Force scientist instrumental in creating the current PFA.\nDr. Neal Baumgartner, chief of the Air Force Exercise Science Unit at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, told Military.com he's interested in having in place the most reliable assessment of fitness -- and reducing pain and frustration wherever possible. He's gathering feedback on proposals aimed at making testing less of an ordeal, including randomized testing, longer time between tests for the super-fit, and measures to reduce anxiety around test-time.\nWhile Baumgartner said the current testing regime is generally working well, he's bothered by what he calls \"five-and-a-half month wonders:\" troops who don't worry about their health and fitness until their semi-annual PFA is right around the corner.\nOne proposal Baumgartner believes could reduce testing resources while discouraging airmen from \"cramming\" fitness ahead of a scheduled test is randomization -- administering a lower number of tests to the force at random, forcing troops to remain ready.\n\"Random testing has a big positive in that it enhances accountability,\" he said. \"You never know when the policeman may come around the corner.\"\nBaumgartner added that troops could be exempted from being called up for random testing after a deployment, or within a certain time frame after taking a previous test. The objective, he said, it not to catch more airmen out, but to discourage those who spend most of the year out of regulations and then take unhealthy steps to prepare at the last minute.\n\"[People say], 'I can't wait until the last two weeks of the year to start getting fit for the test,'\" he said. \"The goal is consistency.\"\nThat said, the Air Force does not appear to have a significant percentage of airmen at risk. As of the end of March 2019, 98.2% of the active-duty Air Force had a passing score on the fitness assessment, Capt. Carrie Volpe, an Air Force spokeswoman, told Military.com.\nThat means roughly 6,000 airmen, out of the active force of 332,800, did not pass, with more squeaking by on the margins.\nFor those at the other end of the spectrum, Baumgartner proposes letting top-scoring airmen go longer between PFAs. In feasibility testing is a proposal that would determine the time gap between fitness tests for airmen by their previous scores, with greater gaps associated with higher scores.\nThis initiative would further a 2010 Air Force policy change that allowed airmen who scored a 90 or above in all fitness components to take the PFA annually, rather than twice a year, as an incentive to maintain a high rate of fitness.\nThe thinking, he said, is that those who score in the highest percentages on the PFA are those who exhibit the healthy habits and behaviors the Air Force is looking for year-round; they don't need much evaluation or prodding. And even if a top-scorer did the unlikely, and started habitually gorging on Cheetos and beer immediately after finishing the PFA, Baumgartner reasons it would take some time before they found themselves at risk of failing the test.\n\"What if one of those 96 [scorers] decided to become a couch potato?\" he said. \"How long would it take before they went from a 96 to"}

Some of the changes coming in the weeks ahead are smaller, but worthwhile tweaks \u2013 like adding buttons or rearranging menus. But the more notable change is that Hulu is testing the elimination of the app\u2019s existing landing page \u2013 currently known as \u201cLineup\u201d \u2013 and replacing it with a new experience.\nThere\u2019s a possibility that the testing might reveal that viewers prefer \u201cLineup\u201d over \u201cHulu Picks\u201d so the company can\u2019t definitively say that it will drop Lineup permanently.\nThe change could have a significant impact, as the Hulu landing page is the place everyone first lands when they launch the app. The page today sees the most engagement and is the biggest driver of content discovery for the streaming service.\nHulu found that users have short attention spans when hitting this page, however; in 30 to 60 seconds, they lose interest. Plus, when users decide to play a piece of content from this landing page, they\u2019re doing so after five actions or fewer. That means Hulu has only a small window to connect viewers to content they\u2019ll like, before they click away to elsewhere in the app or close it altogether because they can\u2019t find something to watch.\nWhat Hulu now wants to learn is what sort of content makes the most sense for this landing page. \u201cLineup,\u201d after all, is a vague term. It sounds like it\u2019s something highly personalized to the viewer \u2013 and it\u2019s clearly not, as any Hulu user can tell you, the suggestions here are often hit-or-miss.\nIn its place, Hulu will trial two different variations: a \u201cHulu Picks\u201d collection, which is curated by staff, and an \u201cUnwatched in My Stuff\u201d option that will show you things you have on your list but haven\u2019t yet watched.\nThe former, \u201cHulu Picks,\u201d would allow the company to have more control over what sort of content suggestions you see first. While the latter option would showcase content you\u2019ve explicitly indicated interest in viewing.\nThe company says it will test both options with a portion of Hulu\u2019s user base in order to determine which one sees the best response. This will roll out in the weeks ahead.\nMeanwhile, other changes to the Hulu app will be focused on helping you view more content while searching for something to watch, as well as helping you to more easily navigate and start watching with less confusion and fewer steps.\nFor example, Hulu will soon have more content appear on the screen as you scroll down in the user interface, so you can scan the thumbnails and make a decision more quickly.\nIt\u2019s also adding a larger, more prominent \u201cDetails\u201d button on content within its various collections \u2013 like the Lineup (or whatever replaces it), as well as sections like \u201cKids,\u201d \u201cNews\u201d or \u201cSports,\u201d for example. This button will take you to the details page for that show or movie you\u2019re interested in.\nIt\u2019s adding more metadata next to the content, too, including things like the genre, rating, and the year which will help users make a choice more quickly.\nOn the content\u2019s Details page, there will be a stacked list of quick actions for things like playing the next episodes, adding items to \u201cMy Stuff\u201d or managing your relationship with the show.\nThis latter option is a small but useful tweak that takes you to an area where you can adjust your suggestions and watch history \u2013 meaning you can mark something as watched or unwatched. This will be particularly beneficial for those times when you\u2019ve begun to watch a program on another streaming"}

The platform went live at 9am; by 9.10, NHSBT said that most of the HR department were using it.\n\u201cFor a management function that didn\u2019t use tools like that, we were worried how staff would take to it.

The headline total announced on Tuesday is the number of measles cases recorded in the region since the outbreak began at the start of November 2012.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) held up the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg (ABM) health board as an example of how to respond to the epidemic. But it also warned that with 50,000 people across Wales without measles protection, vaccination efforts needed to be widened.\nThe ABM health board, which covers Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot, and Bridgend, has been carrying out a major vaccination programme for the past month. As a result, 4,000 10- to 18-year-olds have received the MMR jab, 40% of the 9,000 identified as being unprotected. The major vaccination programme continues in local schools and weekend drop-in clinics at a number of hospitals.\nPHW warned on Tuesday that similar efforts to those already seen around Swansea needed to be mirrored across the principality. The warning came as a death certificate was issued at a brief inquest in Swansea for Gareth Williams, 25, who had measles. The father of one died in his flat in Port Tennant, Swansea, on 18 April. It is still unknown whether he was the first victim of measles. The result of tests to establish the cause of his death are awaited after initial tests last week proved inconclusive.\nPhilip Rogers, the coroner for Swansea, also issued a cremation certificate for Williams's family, who did not attend the inquest.\nThe rise in the number of measles cases in the affected region adds a further 69 to the total since last Thursday. The total of 1,011 takes in cases in the Powys, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Hywel Dda health board areas. By comparison, the number of cases notified across the whole of Wales since November last year has been 1,142.\nDr Marion Lyons, PHW director of health protection, said: \"The efforts to vaccinate susceptible children in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board area have been tremendous and we are delighted to see that around half of children needing vaccination have now received the MMR.\n\"But with around 50,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still not vaccinated, and more than 1,000 cases now reported to us, we cannot be complacent.\n\"While not enough children are vaccinated, this outbreak can easily spread anywhere in Wales. Therefore we urge parents of children, and young people themselves, to take up opportunities to receive the MMR vaccine as a matter of urgency.\n\"Vaccination sessions are continuing in schools throughout Wales and I urge pupils and their parents to take advantage of these.\"\nShe added: \"Those not vaccinated are highly likely to catch measles, which is highly contagious.

Adelman granted a preliminary injunction while denying the principal's motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\"Even short deprivations of First Amendment rights constitute irreparable harm,\" Adelman wrote in a 15-page order.\nSchoenecker, a sophomore at Markesan High School, sued in April after he was told to change shirts, cover them or spend the day in an isolated cubicle. The suit contends that a ban on shirts simply because they show guns infringes on his free speech rights.\nIt also says principal John Koopman's personal, case-by-case determination of which shirts are \"inappropriate\" violated Schoenecker's rights to due process.\nThe school district has since amended the dress code to specifically ban clothing depicting weapons, and Koopman told Schoenecker he even had to cover a shirt with the word \"gun.\"\nMarkesan is in Green Lake County, about 30 miles west of Fond du Lac.\nThe shirts in question do not overtly promote violence. One spells LOVE out of a handgun, a grenade, two knives and an assault rifle. Another shows a variety of firearms above the phrase, \"Celebrate Diversity.\"\nA third was only text, which read, \"IF GUNS KILL PEOPLE, I GUESS PENS misspell words, CARS make people drive drunk, and SPOONS make people fat.\"\nSchoenecker says he wears the shirts to express his support for the Second Amendment.\nThe school argued that the exact message of the first two shirts is ambiguous, and therefore not protected expression under the law.\nBut Adelman said the fact the shirts are open to interpretation doesn't deprive them of First Amendment protection.\nAs to the \"If guns kill people ...\" shirt, Adelman wrote that phrase is a variation on a common argument advanced by gun-rights supporters.\n\"Thus, when he wears the shirt, the plaintiff expresses his personal belief on a matter of public concern. Expressing that belief is protected by the First Amendment.\"\nSchoenecker and Koopman argued that different lines of U.S. Supreme Court decisions about school speech controlled the issue, but Adelman said a more recent ruling from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals provided the best guidance.\nIn that case, a high school banned a student from wearing a shirt that read \"Be Happy, Not Gay,\" to express his disapproval of homosexuality. The court found the school could censor the shirt if school officials could show it was reasonable to expect substantial disruption at the school if the shirt were worn.\nKoopman tried to show that by noting Schoenecker wore the shirts after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school, that Markesan students walked out to protest gun violence and that instruction was delayed more than once as students discussed Schoenecker's shirts in class.\nPlus, Koopman argued, after the suit was reported, many other news outlets came"}

Kay Bailey Hutchison said Monday that universities, state governments and the private sector need to take action to preserve public colleges' strengths.\nLamenting the shrinking state support for higher education in Texas and across the country, University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves and former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said Monday that universities, state governments and the private sector must act to preserve public colleges' strengths.\nCooperation is needed, Hutchison said, to \"protect our universities' capabilities to do great things for our students and our nation.\"\nHutchison and Fenves spoke in Austin with a group of reporters before meeting with state and higher education leaders, including Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, about the issue. They planned to present a report that said state funding of public research universities has dipped 34 percent nationwide in the past decade. Flagship universities aren't immune to that trend. State funding now makes up about 12 percent of UT-Austin's budget, compared with a peak of 47 percent in 1984-85.\nThe report was compiled by a group organized by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hutchison, chairwoman of the Texas Exes board of directors, served as an adviser for the report. Fenves wasn't involved but hosted Monday's meeting and said he is \"very supportive\" of its goals.\nThe project's co-chairman, Robert Birgeneau, argued that the decline in funding has hurt state flagship universities the most. And he said it is the main reason that universities have had to sharply increase their tuition in recent decades.\nBut tuition increases can't continue indefinitely, Birgeneau said. So the report urges state leaders across the country to \"reverse cuts made over the last decade.\"\nCuts were made in Texas as the state struggled to balance its budget during the height of the economic recession last decade. Lawmakers have also said rising costs for other state needs, especially Medicaid, have taken dollars that might have otherwise gone to higher education.\nMonday's meeting was held during a time that university budgets have gained the attention of some Texas lawmakers. Most of Texas' major public universities are planning to increase tuition for the upcoming school year. That has caused some lawmakers to express support for the Texas Legislature retaking control of how tuition rates are set. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has asked the Legislature to study the idea, expressing frustration with the schools and noting that state appropriations ticked up for higher education in 2015.\nOn Monday, Birgeneau acknowledged, \"We are not going to go back to the era where the state provided 50 percent of the university's budget.\" So universities also need to look for new revenue streams, he said, to keep themselves robust.\nMeanwhile, Fenves expressed skepticism toward the idea of the Legislature regulating tuition in the future.\n\"The current system with the boards of regents [setting tuition costs] is the right approach,\" he said.\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin and Texas Exes are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.

Fox Foundation in its fight against Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nIt proved that the draw of the Back to the Future film trilogy is as strong as ever, and a good bet that Sunday\u2019s 3 p.m. Q&A session with Christopher Lloyd, the film\u2019s beloved Emmett \u201cDoc\u201d Brown, is likely to play to a packed house.\nAll the more reason to relish a quiet conversation, which revealed that Lloyd, despite a 27-year association with the character of the wild-eyed Brown, shares all of the good Doc\u2019s sweetness, but none of his manic side.\nThose words likely served Lloyd well when he played his 2002 Malvolio in Twelfth Night for the New York Shakespeare Festival, opposite Julia Stiles and Zach Braff, or in his 2010 turn as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman for a small summer theatre in Weston, Vt., but they also came in handy during the filming of Back to the Future.\nMichael J. Fox is so embedded in our consciousness now as Marty McFly that it\u2019s hard to imagine he almost didn\u2019t play the role; for the first five weeks of filming, Eric Stoltz had the part.\n\u201cYou have to remember I created the character of Doc during those initial weeks with Eric,\u201d Lloyd says. \u201cWe built up that classic relationship between an older man and a younger one, the mentor who would open up the pupil\u2019s imagination to all the possibilities in the world.\nBut director Robert Zemeckis, his co-screenwriter Bob Gale and producer Steven Spielberg felt differently.\n\u201cSuddenly, one night, we were all gathered together after a midnight dinner at 1 a.m. All the suits were there. Even Spielberg. We knew it was serious. They told us Eric was fine, but he lacked a certain comic flair they felt the part needed.\nSo they brought on Fox. In truth, he had been the team\u2019s first choice for the part, but he was too busy with his television series Family Ties. Now, he was finally available.\n\u201cQuite frankly, I was scared,\u201d says Lloyd. \u201cI had shot a lot of my big scenes during those five weeks. I had discovered most of my major moments. Could I repeat myself without making it mechanical? Could I do it again?\nAnother reason emerges in conversation, when Lloyd is asked for his most cherished memory from the series.\n\u201cIt was in No. 3. Michael and I were both standing on top of a railroad car. I think we were trying to go from car to car to get up to the engine to make the train stop. We were standing there, it was dangerous and we were swaying.\nJust as vividly, Lloyd recalls a not so happy moment in his career.\n\u201cIt was 1976 and I was acting off Broadway with a pair of Canadians, Victor Garber and Gale Garnett. The play was called Cracks and Martin Sherman, the man who wrote it, went on a few years later to have a giant hit with Bent.\n\u201cBut not this time around. Opening night was a disaster.

One set of indictments against two defendants, for example, had a combined 44 charges.\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost five percent of the total of all the indictments, just for two defendants,\u201d Brackett said.\nSo what is a grand jury, anyway?\nA grand jury is a panel of up to 18 people who hear basic facts about a criminal case, said David Hamilton, York County Clerk of Court. The clerk of court office administers the grand jury, but prosecutors bring the cases to the grand jury after police make an arrest.\nJurors are summoned from county voter registration and driver\u2019s license rolls.\nThe grand jury meets once a month at the Moss Justice Center in York. The jury can either issue a \u201ctrue bill\u2019 indictment that allows prosecutors to go forward with a trial, or a \u201cno bill\u201d that states grand jurors found not enough probable cause for the case to move forward.\nGrand jury proceedings are secret and not open to the public, Hamilton said.

So, is the logistics hub going to come along now and be a further burden on the rest of the economy?\" King queried.\nHowever, chairman of the logistics and investment task force, Dr Eric Deans, said special economic zones will be created to ensure different areas of the economy are incorporated in the hub.\n\"When we speak of the logistics hub, it's not just to benefit large corporations.

He asked me if I wanted to come over and I pretty much agreed straight away. They sent through the contract and I signed off and I just had to wait for my visa and I was straight over. It was all pretty fast and it was a matter of a couple of weeks and I was here and in the thick of it.\nRennie suggested that Frisby would get his chance during the Test windows but it seems likely that his first opportunity will knock a little earlier than expected, when Glasgow play Connacht tomorrow, if only because Ali Price and Kaleem Barreto are both injured leaving just two Warriors scrum-halves standing (plus Niko Matawalu if Rennie wants to roll the dice).\nIt is not fair to judge him on one rusty, outing against Harlequins when Frisby had an interesting 80 minutes. He scored an interception try, from England scrum-half Danny Care\u2019s pass, he conceded an interception try and, bizarrely, he passed the ball straight to one bemused Harlequins player in open play. Frisby was reportedly much improved against Northampton Saints even if the scoreline went against the Warriors.\nAs things stand right now the Aussie is probably third-choice scrum-half behind Price and George Horne, pictured, not that he has to accept the status quo.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always got to back yourself,\u201d insists the Aussie, \u201cbut obviously there are two quality half-backs here with George [Horne] coming off a really good season and he\u2019s had some international experience now, and Ali has been around for a couple of seasons and he\u2019s played a bit more international footy as well.\nStill only 25 years old, Frisby is not only keen to show what he can do but also offers versatility.\nBack in 2012 he appeared at full-back for the Wallaby U20 side that beat Scotland 67-12, playing against the likes of Finn Russell, Alex Allan and Jamie Bhatti.

Thankfully, everything else about \u2018The Conners\u2019 is warm, hilarious, and fun.\nWe\u2019re not allowed to tell you what happened to Roseanne.\nMaybe that renders this review useless. The question at the center of the very existence of The Conners, the hustled-into-production spinoff of last season\u2019s Roseanne revival, is what will happen to the character of Roseanne herself when the series premieres Tuesday.\nBut there was one condition: Barr herself could not be involved in any way with or profit from The Conners. That meant that Barr would have to forfeit her intellectual property rights to the show and its characters, which she did.\nSo while we can\u2019t tell you what happens to the character of Roseanne, we can tell you whether The Conners justifies asking that question in the first place. Roseanne has lived in pop culture for 30 years because of Roseanne\u2019s voice. It\u2019s remarkable that The Conners works at all without it. And, once the echoes of that voice stop drowning out anything else there is to say about the show\u2014which is the chief creative liability of the premiere episode\u2014The Conners may even be good.\nAs it stands, too much of the premiere is mired in Roseanne. The tone of it all is icky and upsetting, and while played with admirable honesty to the humanity of the event-we-cannot-talk-about, still comes off as mean-spirited given the tenor of opinion surrounding Barr. Because of this, launching the show respectfully was a creative impossibility. No matter what the creative team might say about the intent of the premiere\u2019s plot, the ugliness and outrage surrounding Roseanne herself would inevitably blanket the show. And it does.\nThere are reports online about what happens to the character, which we cannot confirm or deny. But it is frustrating to not be able to talk about it because how it\u2019s handled directly relates to how the show will be received. There\u2019s a peculiar dissonance between the public\u2019s opinion of Roseanne Barr and how we\u2019re meant to feel about her absence in The Conners. More, while the episode is almost entirely stripped of the baiting political references that garnered so much attention for last year\u2019s revival, there is something inherently political about the situation that is intriguing to see as it\u2019s dealt with in a broad, multicam sitcom. It is also utterly bizarre, as this is an arena that historically lacks nuance.\nAll of that said, it takes about six minutes before Lecy Goranson, who plays Becky, to deliver a one-liner so good we cackled right through the next three lines of dialogue.

Interior designers, no matter the country in which they work, work closely with architects, contractors, and clients in planning a space for overall functionality and aesthetics. They need to be familiar with architectural drawings, building codes, and interior construction, as well as furnishings, wall coverings, and decorating principles.\nSuccessful interior designers combine artistic flair with technical know-how. They understand how colors, textures, and lighting work together to create the right atmosphere for their clients. They also have excellent interpersonal skills. They can communicate and negotiate effectively with clients, suppliers, and tradespeople. They also need strong project management skills and the ability to work on deadline.\nInterior designers typically follow a three- or four-year bachelor's degree program at a technical institute, college, or university. The Council for Interior Design Accreditation sets the educational standards in North America that determine what students will study and how the curriculum is structured. In Canada, students graduating after January 1, 2017 must attend an accredited school. Those who graduate prior to that date must become members of their provincial associations prior to July 15, 2021.\nFollowing graduation, prospective interior designers must become members of their provincial association and then complete a prescribed supervised work experience period, usually two to three years. Supervision must occur under a licensed interior designer or architect who provides interior design work. This internship not only prepares individuals to write the necessary exams, but also provides them with further education and experience to enhance their future careers.\nInterns who have completed their required supervised work experience may then apply to take the National Council for Interior Design Qualification examinations. There are three parts to these exams, and candidates must pass all three portions. There are two half-day multiple choice exams and one full-day practicum.\nKate Hillsing has been a freelance writer and editor since 2005.

In an interview earlier this year, Yael Maguire, who heads up Facebook\u2019s Connectivity Lab, discussed the vision of the project, saying that the hope is to have a fleet of around 1,000 drones where possible for the purpose of connecting people to the Internet.\nThat of course is assuming regulators around the world agree to the presence of the drones. But regulators are not the only ones posing a threat to Facebook\u2019s mission to connect the globe. Critics have remained skeptical, claiming the motives of Zuckerberg and Internet.org are less than altruistic. Some have even accused Facebook of using this venture solely as a means to increase the company\u2019s global penetration and therefore its bottom line. There are also some preservationists who fear a completely connected world would lead to cultural losses, especially within the few societies that have remained untouched by the modern age.\nAs technology companies look to grow revenues and add new users, many are looking to developing nations for new opportunities.\nOnly about 16% of Africa\u2019s population has access the Internet, according to the Pew Research Center. And mobile phones are much more popular than land lines in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Bangladesh and Uganda. Many people who become newly connected to the Internet do so through mobile devices.\nInternet.org could provide benefits to the areas it serves. For example, an expansion of Internet connectivity could eventually lead to greater access to information and education. In Bangladesh, the Internet is primarily used for job hunting, according to Pew. Whether one agrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s venture or not, the Facebook founder has helped bring the world one step closer to a fully connected society."}

What is it all about? And how can it help an anti-doping organization?\nAleksandr Derevoedov: ADAMS wasn\u2019t developed specifically for the Olympic Games. It\u2019s been in existence for a rather long time. It\u2019s an administrative system whereby you regulate doping-related procedures. It is rather well-protected, and, most importantly, it contains all information about the athletes\u2019 whereabouts and information about drugs they take, if they do take drugs. For example, if a drug is banned but an athlete has been authorized to take it. These are the two principal parts of the system. There is also a laboratory ADAMS. It contains the entire amount of data from laboratory tests.\nRT: Who can use the system? What are the restrictions?\nA.D.: It can be used by an athlete, but only on his or her own personal page. We, as an anti-doping organization, see the general picture with regard to the Russian athletes: how many tests were taken, where an athlete is, etc. We see all of that. But only an athlete can amend his or her page.\nRT: Given the modern level of medicinal drugs and nutrient additives, can we speak about objectiveness of doping control? After all, a banned drug may be a component of ordinary food products.\nA.D.: If we speak about food products, the answer is likely to be \u201cno.\u201d If we speak about nutrient additives as food products, then, regrettably, a nutrient additive turned out by unscrupulous producers may indeed contain some banned chemicals. We simply don\u2019t recommend to athletes to use nutrient additives.\nRT: What sports are in the focus? Where do doping attempts happen most often?\nA.D.: It is held that there is a group of sports events where certain types of doping might, theoretically and practically, be most effective. There are so-called cyclic sports events, track-and-field, bicycles, skis, skates, rowing and a number of others where doping is very effective. The same goes for weight-lifting and a number of other sports events that draw the most attention.\nRT: Is it true that marijuana is often used as doping?\nA.D.: Marijuana use, in principle, is not regarded as doping. It\u2019s a so-called light narcotic drug and its use is contrary to the spirit of sport. From this point of view, marijuana doesn\u2019t enhance strength or endurance. It might possibly improve the mood to some extent, but it cannot have much effect on an athlete\u2019s performance. But the use of these drugs is contrary to the spirit of sport, and therefore it is punished if used during competitions, but not outside of competitions.\nRT: Can an athlete be expelled from the team for smoking marijuana?\nA.D.: Not only can he or she be expelled, but also suspended from competing in any sports events \u2013 sometimes for longer, sometimes for shorter periods \u2013 and, of course, it also means an expulsion and withdrawal of funds, etc."}

Think of it like your Netflix Instant Queue for games, where instead of buying physical media or even spending time downloading large files you can just log in and begin playing any video game across the internet.\nThat's the experience OnLive hopes to deliver, and today marks the opening of the beta program for those who signed up after the company initially went public to the press back at the Game Developer's Conference in March of this year.\nMuch like what Netflix or Hulu are now doing with online video, OnLive hopes to do with gaming. You'll be able to access the service on PCs and Macs with compatible hardware requirements via a browser plug-in and hop right into multiplayer matches against other players on various platforms (you'll need a broadband internet connection to use the service). Being able to provide true cross-platform multiplayer gaming itself would be rather novel, and the underlying goal of disintermediating the game console is indeed a revolutionary one.\nThey also plan to offer their own, as they call it, \"micro-console\" that is essentially a small device big enough to include a couple of USB ports, ethernet, HDMI, and optical audio out. The unit would accept up to 4 wireless controllers and bluetooth headsets, offering an alternative method of accessing the service if you don't have a spare computer to play on and/or hook up to your television set for a living room gaming experience.\nStill, it will depend greatly on the underlying technology and if it will be able to handle the significant technical challenges of synchronizing fast-response gaming experiences to multiple players simultaneously on different platforms. In many of the games players will want to enjoy, even a split second of lag time is unacceptable.\nIf OnLive is able to scale and meet the demand, however, it could pose a significant challenge to a game console industry that's weathered the storm of multiple hardware cycles, but might face an uphill battle against a truly great on demand service. They haven't released an official decision on their business model yet, but OnLive has indicated it will most likely be either subscription-based or possibly subsidized through the purchase of the OnLive micro-console.\nWhat do you think: is the gaming industry ripe for a great cloud on demand service?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations for VF Corporation. Thank you, you may begin.\nJoseph Alkire -- Vice President, Investor Relations.\nGood morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.\nUnless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted, which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with US GAAP.\nReconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Nautica brand business. During first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the Company has included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations to their respective dates of sale. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.\nJoining me on today's call will be VF's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle, and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions.\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone.\nVF's second quarter results were strong, fueled by the continued acceleration in our core brands and platforms. Our focus and investment in support of our 2021 strategy is driving accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio.\nOver the past few months, geopolitical and macroeconomic events have caused increased volatility in the marketplace. I like to take a moment and address how a few of these events are shaping how we think about our business and our consumers. First as it relates to the current trade climate between the US and China, we are closely monitoring the situation and are actively involved in scenario planning.\nFor context, about 11% of VF's total cost of goods sold come directly to the US from China. By leveraging our global supply chain, we have positioned ourselves to address any additional changes in the overall trade environment with China. And we have the ability to reposition our global sourcing footprint in the near-to-mid term to mitigate the potential negative impact of additional tariffs should they materialize.\nSecond, with regards to the recent trade agreement between the US,"}

This series of strategic initiatives will allow Ericsson to operate even closer to its customers, meeting the growing demand for 5G globally and in the region.\nThe investments will fall into two categories: 1) increase research and development work done close to customers in the US and 2) increase flexibility to shorten the timeline for new product introduction and product delivery to customers. This will enable Ericsson to recruit new expertise from the US, complementing the company's existing highly-skilled employees in the region.\nB\u00f6rje Ekholm, President and CEO of Ericsson, says: \"The United States is our largest market, accounting for a quarter of Ericsson's business over the last seven years. To serve the demand of these fast-moving service providers, we are strengthening our investment in the US to be even closer to our customers and meet their accelerated 5G deployment plans.\"\nIn late 2017, Ericsson opened the Austin ASIC Design Center in Austin, Texas, to focus on core microelectronics of 5G radio base stations to accelerate the path to 5G commercialization. The 1,400-square-meter facility (15,000-square-feet) will have 80 employees once fully staffed.\nEricsson will also open a new software development center with baseband focus in 2018, employing more than 200 software engineers once fully operational. This facility and its employees will further strengthen Ericsson's 5G software development. Baseband provides intelligence to the radio access network. It is also the interface between the core network and radio units, processing and forwarding voice calls and internet data to end users.\nBeginning in 2019, both of these facilities will introduce 5G products and software features into the Ericsson portfolio, and will be available for customers globally, including in the US.\nAdditionally, Ericsson will increase its investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation, employing around 100 specialists in North America by the end of 2018. This team will work on utilizing AI technologies to accelerate automation, examine product road maps and explore new business opportunities. They will focus on boosting the company's current portfolio, strengthening customer engagements and promote innovation of new disruptive business opportunities.\nTo increase flexibility in bringing new products into the market, Ericsson will recruit a dedicated team to work specifically on introducing products for the US market, conducting production engineering, testing/integration and supply preparations on early prototypes. This will be done in close collaboration with US-based R&D resources.\nTo make 5G products available to customers as fast as possible, Ericsson will also begin manufacturing in the US in the fourth quarter of 2018. This will enable Ericsson to operate closer to customers -- providing volume production of next-generation radios and the fast introduction of new products into the US market. Initially, Ericsson will work with a production partner and the first radios for the US will be produced before the end of 2018."}

Vail\u2019s hometown darling, 18-year-old Mikaela Shiffrin, rolled into a solid second place finish, the first giant slalom podium of her career. Shiffrin had the second to last run in the final round, and the crowd went wild as she expertly carved her way down the course. Lindell-Vikarby, the last racer to go, responded with a fluid run that bumped Shiffrin\u2019s final run time by about a 10th of a second.\nSwitzerland\u2019s Tina Weirather was the surprise third place winner. She\u2019s a top downhill and super-G racer, but this is the first giant slalom podium for her. The podium finish was an impressive turnaround for her after crashing out in Saturday\u2019s super-G, not to mention a landmark in her career.\nLindell-Vikarby has likely seen more World Cup starts than Weirather and Shiffrin combined. She was the surprise leader, a World Cup veteran who came back from a knee injury in 2009. Since then she\u2019s shown herself to be a sold top 15 finisher, but hasn\u2019t had a World Cup podium in the last few years, and certainly not in giant slalom. She also put down the fastest run of the first round. On her final run, she had two mistakes early on in the course, but made up the time on the bottom half of the run to hold onto first place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been on the podium, and I\u2019m pleased to be here again. I\u2019ve been working really hard the last three years on my GS,\u201d she said.\nShiffrin was visibly giddy over the silver, a nice addition to the five slalom World Cup wins she already owns.

{"idx": "15339", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Changes in the spin rate of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan suggest an ocean of liquid water lies beneath its icy surface, a new study reports. The finding bolsters the possibility that the moon might foster life.\nTitan\u2019s low density suggests it is composed of a combination of water and rock. During the moon\u2019s early days, heat from its formation and the decay of radioactive material should have melted much of this water to create an ocean.\nMuch of the ocean would have since frozen. But scientists suspect a liquid layer up to 300 kilometres thick persists beneath an ice crust, probably aided by ammonia, which acts as an antifreeze.\nHard evidence for such an ocean has been difficult to come by, however. Apparent radio echoes observed by the Huygens probe as it landed on the moon\u2019s surface in 2005 might be due to radio waves reflecting off the top of an ocean. But it\u2019s possible they\u2019re simply an instrument error caused by motion of the lander\u2019s parachute.\nNow, slight variations in Titan\u2019s rotation rate detected by the Cassini spacecraft have provided new evidence for an ocean, say Ralph Lorenz of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, US and colleagues. Watch an animation showing Titan\u2019s ocean.\nTitan is close enough to Saturn that Saturn\u2019s gravity should distort the moon\u2019s shape, causing internal friction that slows down its rotation. This slowing continues until the moon rotates exactly once per orbit, keeping one face forever locked on the planet.\nBut when Cassini\u2019s radar tracked surface features on the moon, scientists found evidence that Titan rocks slightly due to tiny shifts in its rotation rate. Currently, Titan spins an extra 0.36\u00b0 over the course of a year beyond what it would if it were in perfect sync with the moon. The moon\u2019s rotation rate also appears to be slowly increasing.\nThe rocking effect was actually predicted in 2005 as a result of changes in the direction of winds in Titan\u2019s massive atmosphere over the course of its 29.5-year orbit around the Sun. A similar effect is known to vary Earth\u2019s rotation rate.\nImportantly, the rocking is easier to produce if Titan\u2019s surface is simply a shell that floats on top of an ocean. The rotation of the relatively lightweight shell would be easily disturbed by changing winds. Alternatively, it would be much more difficult for winds to change Titan\u2019s rotation if the moon were solid from surface to core.\nThe observations weigh \u201cin favour of a liquid layer, but it is not a definitive proof\u201d, Gabriel Tobie of the Universit\u00e9 de Nantes in France, told New Scientist.\nTobie and Christophe Sotin of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, US, say changes in the orientation of the moon\u2019s rotation axis over thousands of years could also explain the observed shift.\nBut Bryan Stiles of JPL, who is a member of Lorenz\u2019s team, disagrees. He says the existing data \u201cis sufficient to distinguish between movement of the pole and changes in spin rate\u201d and that the team has indeed detected changes in spin rate.\nTobie says further observations could help settle the matter. If the spin rate changes on a timescale of a few years, that would bolster the case that the variations are produced by seasonal wind changes, rather than very long-term changes in the direction of Titan\u2019s rotation axis.\nIf Titan has an ocean beneath its surface, could life be present"}

Sometimes people think that photographs show just what your eye sees. But this picture doesn't. The spectators seem to be falling over, and the car's wheel is completely out of shape, like a squashed fruit.\nThese effects were caused by the camera Lartigue used. It had a shutter that operated from bottom to top. This, and the fact that he moved his camera from left to right, following the car, produced the ``squashed'' wheel.

There are too many people, too few jobs, and not enough food.\nBeatrice remembers being hungry as a child. \"There wasn't much food in our fields.

No matter what gets developed in AI, these are the two elements that can keep the agency services business alive, and keep marketers busy for years to come.\nAI is a complement to what you do. It is intended to augment your abilities. AI can create a layer of efficiency that companies are otherwise lacking and free them up to be doing the kind of work with incremental impact.\nAgencies have succeeded in the past because they are creative. They come up with solutions to problems that teams knee-deep in the challenges every day may not see.\nAI enables marketers not to get sucked down into the weeds for reporting and analysis, but instead optimize testing in campaigns while they\u2019re in-market, freeing up time to tackle new problems in creative ways.\nAll that being said, empathy is the single most important characteristic of a marketer or agency. Empathy can never be automated. It comes from putting yourself in the shoes of your customers and understanding the emotional impact of the challenges they face. Empathy is not an algorithm.\nYou can execute focus groups and you can do research to develop insights into your target audience, but empathy enables you to look deeper than the binary output of data. It\u2019s that special insight stemming from the aggregation of data, the understanding of context and the application of emotion to come up with a truly new and unique idea. It can never be automated.\nAgencies get paid for more monotonous work than ever before, and now that work can be automated. Margins have been squeezed for all the other more creative work and that\u2019s resulted in lower-cost people being put in positions of creativity, which tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy (less experienced employees tend to do lower quality work). Many CMOs have not been sure how to utilize technology to create efficiency, and instead focused on creativity.

Or maybe you didn't spend quite as much on gifts as you budgeted for, and now have some extra cash sitting around. Whatever the reason, if you happen to have $1,000 or so in the bank and want to put it to work, here are three ways you could use it and possibly boost your tax refund in the process.\nPerhaps the best tax breaks of all come from retirement savings. Not only do you get a nice tax deduction (either now or down the road), but you'll also set yourself up for financial freedom later in life. If you have some extra cash to invest, putting it into a traditional or Roth IRA is a great choice.\nWith a traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct your contributions on your tax return this year. This depends on how much you earn, and whether or not you have access to an employer's retirement plan. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, doesn't allow for a current-year deduction, but your qualified withdrawals will be 100% tax free in retirement. Other benefits of a Roth IRA include their lack of a required minimum distribution, and the ability to withdraw your contributions whenever you'd like.\nThe ability to contribute directly to a Roth IRA is subject to income limitations. You can find a discussion of the restrictions for both types of IRAs here.\nFor 2016, the maximum annual contribution to both types of IRA is $5,500, with an additional $1,000 allowed if you're 50 or older. This is a cumulative limit, so if you have more than one IRA, your total contributions cannot exceed that sum. Both account types allow your money to grow on a tax-deferred basis, meaning that you won't have to worry about capital gains or dividend taxes each year.\nIt's also worth noting that you can make IRA contributions for 2016 until the tax deadline on April 18, 2017, so you have plenty of time to take advantage of this one.\nIt's a well-known fact that charitable donations are tax deductible. Unlike the deductions for retirement savings I discussed earlier, charitable contributions must be made by midnight on New Year's Eve to qualify for your 2016 tax return. So, your $1,000 could be put to great use for a worthy cause, and reduce your tax bill at the same time.\nOne thing about charitable deductions that isn't well understood is the documentation requirement, which varies depending on whether you donate cash or property, and how much you give. For cash donations of less than $250, a cancelled check or simple receipt from the organization is sufficient, but if you donate, say, $1,000 to a charitable organization, be sure you get written confirmation from it.\nFor a more complete discussion of the rules of charitable giving, check out this other article.\nFinally, one of the best uses for extra money (especially if you have kids) is to start saving for their education. It's never too early to do this, and in fact, earlier is better. My daughter is 1 year old, and I've been saving aggressively in a 529 Savings Plan since she was born.\nWhat's the rush?

Scientists studying the effects of radiation in rodents say that astronauts exposed to galactic cosmic rays could face a host of cognitive problems, including chronic dementia.\nThe UC Irvine-led study, published in Scientific Reports, adds to a growing body of research on the harmful effects humans may reckon with as they venture out longer and deeper into space, whether on trips to Mars or potentially beyond.\n\"Recovery of the brain [from] these exposures certainly takes a very long time \u2014 so these are very chronic consequences,\" said study leader Charles Limoli, a neuroscientist and radiation biologist at UC Irvine. \"This of course raises a concern for NASA.\"\nIt's well-known that radiation can damage neural tissue and hurt cognitive function; cancer patients with brain tumors who need radiotherapy end up with what the study authors called \"severe and progressive cognitive deficits.\" But it's not clear exactly what effect space radiation has on the brain because there are different types of radiation and they're delivered in different doses.\nSpace is filled with high-energy particles of all kinds that quickly would damage the cells of living things. Luckily, the Earth's magnetic field shields us from the onslaught; but farther out in space, with only a spacecraft as protection, humans are exposed to much more radiation.\nThe White House has set a goal of getting humans to Mars by the mid-2030s, and President Obama penned a CNN op-ed this week discussing his support for a mission to the Red Planet. So scientists are increasingly trying to quantify those impacts, with hopes of understanding the risks to long-term spaceflight, and perhaps mitigating or even preventing them.\nLimoli and his colleagues already had found significant changes in the brains of rodents six weeks after exposure to space-like levels of radiation, but for this new paper, they wanted to do a longer study to see whether the effects persisted. In a series of experiments involving mice and Wistar rats, rodents were exposed to fully ionized oxygen and titanium particles at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York; the animals then were sent to Limoli's lab at UC Irvine.\nWhen UC Irvine researchers exposed mice to radiation much like what exists in outer space, the animals suffered brain impairment.\nThe scientists found that even six months after radiation exposure, the rodents still were suffering from brain inflammation and neural damage. Neurons sported fewer dendrites and spines, which meant their neural networks were less interconnected than in a healthy brain.\nOf course, rats and mice are not humans, Limoli conceded. But the fact that similar effects were seen in both rodent species indicates that there could be similar effects seen in the brains of other mammal species, including ours.\n\"Astronauts that are exposed to these radiation fields may be at heightened risks for certain impairments,\" Limoli said. \"They could develop impairments that could impact mission critical performance. Decision-making could be impacted; their ability to multitask and respond to unanticipated events would be impacted. We have data to suggest that animals exposed to these particles show elevated anxiety and stress, so this could be a confounding factor out in space when you consider they have to operate on almost complete autonomy.\"\nOn behavioral tasks, the rodents exposed to radiation performed poorly on tests of learning and memory. Their ability to suppress unpleasant and stressful associations also declined \u2014 an effect that could make someone pr"}

Early in the first round, the blockbuster trades usually revolve around teams' pursuit of a franchise quarterback. We witnessed this last year with the Bears, Chiefs and Texans trading up for a QB, and the year prior with Los Angeles and Philadelphia.\nThere's usually movement later in the first round, too, as teams with an eye on becoming an annual playoff contender -- or remaining one -- target impact players at other positions.\nTeams often set up trade scenarios with other teams before the draft in order to settle on compensation instead of trying to seal the deal within the 10-minute window between picks. With four weeks to go until the draft is officially underway, these are some of the deals that would make sense for teams to discuss in advance of this year's proceedings.\nIf quarterbacks are selected with the first three picks, as I project in my latest mock draft, my dark horse to move up to select the fourth quarterback is New Orleans. Remember that Kansas City traded from the 27th spot to the 10th slot last year to acquire Patrick Mahomes. The Saints' decision to re-sign Drew Brees was wise, but finding his eventual replacement is paramount for the future of a franchise that struggled for a long time before he arrived.\nSean Payton's squad is not likely to pick early in the first round over the next couple of years, so if they want a top prospect to groom under Brees, they'll have to go get one. Mayfield would be such a perfect fit for the Saints, and Brees would be an excellent mentor on and off the field for the feisty young passer. If Josh Rosen or Josh Allen were available instead of Mayfield, the trade would still make sense. The Bears, on the other hand, would pick up one or two selections from the Saints this year in addition to a high pick or two in the 2019 draft -- regaining some of the draft capital they lost in the trade to move up for Mitchell Trubisky last year.\nBills GM Brandon Beane is playing it coy when answering questions about the team's willingness to trade up again to get a quarterback. He's already made a deal to move up nine spots (from 21 to 12 in a trade with the Bengals), and I won't be surprised if he and head coach Sean McDermott trade up again to land a true playmaker at the position.\nLast year, the Bears signed Mike Glennon to a three-year deal before drafting Trubisky. The Bills could follow suit -- their signing of AJ McCarron to a two-year deal earlier this month should not prevent them from striking for a QB in this draft. As for Jackson, he's a special talent at quarterback. McDermott's defenses practiced every day against Michael Vick in Philadelphia and Cam Newton in Carolina. I think he'd welcome that type of dual-threat QB on his team again this summer. The Niners would move back a few spots and add a third-round pick (No. 65 overall) to their draft haul as part of the trade, and might very well be able"}

Project xCloud runs on devices paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller via Bluetooth and it\u2019s playable using touch input. It\u2019s complementary to Microsoft\u2019s ongoing work with console hardware, which means developers can use it to deploy and dramatically scale access to their games on xCloud with no additional work.

There are also on-going class sessions for restaurant operators and their staffs. And now it is ready for a rollout.\nA variation of this program has been working for several years in many other jurisdictions including Sacramento, San Diego, Alameda and Los Angeles counties but our county has carefully tweaked it to fit locally. And it appears to have the support of the dining industry, according to DEH Consumer Protection Director Mike Balliett.\nThe three principal grades that will apply is the green card, which can be earned with a perfect inspection or nothing worse that one serious violation which was corrected immediately. The yellow placard denotes that two such violations have taken place. A red card, with a trio of serious flaws, will shut the restaurant down until corrections take place.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that nationally 76 million cases of food-borne illnesses occur annually causing 5,000 deaths and 325,000 hospitalizations.\nThe website at sccgov.org/SCCDineOut will provide the food facility inspection results and also list the restaurants that have been shut down for food safety violations over the past six months.\nThe county\u201ds 38 inspectors will begin using the placard and website system as they complete their regular inspections here in San Jose and all the other cities. So the visual impact will be gradual although it will be sending important signals to all the other food service operations. In addition to restaurants, the new regulatory system covers markets, bakeries, liquor stores, bars, farmers\u201d markets, food services at fairs and festivals, ice cream and hot dog carts, food trucks, produce trucks and food vending machines.\nThe educational effort will provide classes in various languages, reviews of new facilities and remodelings, and will issue permits. Classes are also held to qualify food operators and managers for state food safety certification.\nWe think both the public and the food industry will be well served by the new system and in particular here where we have such a broad diversity of food serving practices and cuisines."}

The district needs an Assembly member who can cut through the city-suburban divide to represent everyone. We pick Democrat Pamela Hunter for the job.\nThis is a special election to fill the vacancy left when Assemblyman Sam Roberts was appointed state welfare commissioner. The winner's term will only run until next year.\nHunter's resume includes service in the U.S. Army, working at a nonprofit, re-establishing the police Citizens Review Board and serving on the Syracuse Common Council since 2011.\nCity and suburban residents have common needs, she says. \"All people want better education, people want jobs, and roads, and bridges and water mains,\" she said.\nHunter, 45, said she will work in Albany to revamp the Common Core and change state funding for schools so that no student is at a disadvantage because of where he or she lives.

Now, every person over the age of 18 who has lived in Wales for over a year will be eligible to be an organ donor unless they explicitly opt out. The organs will be used to save lives all over the United Kingdom and I, for one, think this is an incredible change in law. Let me tell you why.\nThis legislation is going to save lives. There is no difficult equation or tricky clauses that need to be discussed to understand this. By donating the organs of those who have not explicitly said yes or no, there will be in fact more organs available. More hearts, more livers, more pancreas, etc. will go to the ever-growing number of people in need. This logic is straightforward and simple.\nThis bishop is commercializing the definition of gift. From a moral perspective, the idea of giving should be linked to positively affecting affecting someone\u2019s life, and this will occur regardless of whether or not the heart someone receives is wrapped in a bow. He, however, is not the only one with qualms about this new law. A few religious groups believe that the act of organ donation should be voluntary.\nTechnically, it is still voluntary. People can say no. They can opt out. If someone is that vehemently against organ donation, they should make the effort to say no. It is natural for someone to try to assume the best of people. In fact, it is refreshing to try and assume the best in people. Besides, the Church of Wales actually supports this new legislation.\nOther European countries, such as Spain and Croatia, already follow this opt-out system. It is no surprise that this new legislation has been greeted with a bit of criticism, even though it is not an entirely new concept, because that is how any novelty is regarded in our society. What actually matters is the strength of the criticism, which in this case is actually not that great. Overall, however, people are responding to this with positivity and gratitude.\nIn a world where we are currently plagued with constant bad news, I am going to choose to focus on the bright aspects of this news.

Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.\nDespite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.\nThe party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step toward trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.\nThousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.\n\u201cBe free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another,\u201d the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.\nStepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.\nThe Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyi\u2019s party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.\nRohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.\nRegarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.\nThe militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.\nA one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.\nThe government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.\nMyanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA \u201cterrorists\u201d.\nEven before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.\nThe insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.\nReports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to"}

Sweeney, is gone, but his last message to his wife can be heard by picking up a handset in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, which opens next week after years of debate over how to remember an event that spawned heartbreak, heroism, wars, political upheaval and finally the revival of ground zero.\nOn Thursday, President Obama will speak at a dedication ceremony for the museum, which opens to the public May 21. On Wednesday, museum officials opened the doors to the media and to some of the officials, architects, planners and others, including 9/11 family members, who helped oversee completion of the 110,000-square-foot exhibition space at the site of the fallen World Trade Center towers.\n\"It was never easy, but it was essential,\" said former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, chairman of the nonprofit foundation that manages the museum. Bloomberg and Joe Daniels, the foundation's president and chief executive, said that despite the tragic overtones of items on display \u2014 the battered firetrucks, the shoes of office workers who died, the audio recordings of victims' last voice mails \u2014 the goal was to honor the nearly 3,000 people who got up that morning, left their homes and never returned.\n\"In a very real sense, they were who we are,\" Daniels said of the dead.\nThe museum also provides a history lesson about Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and about the hijackers who seized the jets on Sept. 11, 2001, and the attackers who bombed the World Trade Center in February 1993. Some Muslim groups objected to a short film, \"The Rise of Al Qaeda,\" which is part of the exhibit, saying it could lead viewers to blame Islam for the attacks. Some family members objected to the museum's $24 admission fee, saying it would turn a site of tragedy and reflection into a moneymaking tourist stop.\nBut the film remains, and officials say that in the absence of federal funds to cover the museum's $60-million annual budget, officials have to charge admission. Victims' families, and police, firefighters and others who responded to the attack, will not be charged.\nMost of the museum is 70 feet below ground, beneath what used to be the two World Trade Center towers and what is now the 9/11 Memorial, an outdoor plaza that opened in 2011.\nThe first thing visitors notice as they enter the bright, glassed-in lobby are two, five-story high steel columns resembling three-pronged forks, which were part of the North Tower's exterior support structure. The word \"Save\" appears in large letters on one column, painted by recovery workers who guessed that the pieces should be preserved.\nFrom the lobby, the museum begins a gradual descent into the dim, cavernous exhibit space, where a progression of displays eases visitors into the heart of the tragedy.\nIt starts with a montage of audio recordings of people recalling where they first heard that America was under attack.\n\"I was in Times Square,\" one says. \"I was in Honolulu,\" says another.\nThe voices echo through the chamber, gently overlapping, as photographs of stunned onlookers flash on mesh-covered panels.\nEverywhere, there are rem"}

{"idx": "15405", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It is often thought that one of the reasons for the lack or the fragility of democracy in the Arab world is the weakness of Arab political parties and their apparent inability to compete with the ruling regimes.\nOften political or legal reasons are cited to substantiate this idea, including laws restricting party life, repressive measures, electoral fraud, internal factionalism and fragmentation within political parties and trends, the personalisation of leadership, the absence of internal democratic practices, the exclusion of youth and other segments of the population, an inability to recruit new members or rally grassroots support, and an intensely polarised socio-political climate.\nHowever, the idea that political parties in the Arab region are weak and fragmented is flawed in some respects. While many parties and trends, especially secularist and leftist and liberal ones, tend to be structurally weak and vulnerable to schism, the sectarian, ethnic and religious oriented parties and groups present what we might consider to be the opposite problem: they are too strong.\nThey often operate as separate societies and almost as states within the state in some countries.\nThe phenomenon is at its most pronounced in the failed or quasi-failed states in the Arab world where such parties or entities have evolved into militia organisations with secessionist aims or plans to monopolise power.\nIn short, in the Arab world we have excessively weak secularist parties and excessively strong religious parties.\nThis antithetical condition has distorted political life in most Arab states and worked to strengthen authoritarianism, deepen social divides, and hamper democratisation.\nThe secularist parties, whether liberal, such as the Wafd and the Free Egyptians Party in Egypt and the Nidaa Tounes Party in Tunisia, Marxist-socialist, such as the Tagammu in Egypt and the Popular Front in Tunisia, or nationalist/Nasserist, such as the Baath Parties in Syria and Iraq, and the Karama (Dignity) Party in Egypt, share a number of characteristics.\nAmong them are the personalisation of leadership, the lack of internal democratic mechanisms, and the exclusion of women, youth and representatives of regional groupings and religious and ethnic minorities in their internal organisations.\nThese flaws lend an elitist and authoritarian character to these parties, and they are also prone to internal rifts and schisms and the proliferation of smaller splinter parties.\nThese things exacerbate another common feature of these parties, being their inability to rally grassroots support and to recruit new members due to poor financial resources, a lack of representation outside major urban centres, and a tendency among some secularist parties to enter into alliances with the ruling regimes.\nThe religious and/or ethnic identity parties in the Arab world, whether associated with Political Islam, such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist Movement, or affiliated with a sectarian/ethnic community, such as Hezbollah and the Amal Movement in Lebanon, also have common characteristics.\nAbove all, they represent communities that are separate from society as a whole, whether for linguistic or ethnic reasons, as is the case with the Amazigh (Berbers) in North Africa or the Kurds in the Middle East, or due to religious/denominational frames-of-reference, as with the Shia and Christian communities in various states, or socio-psychological ones, as with the case of the Islamist trends that seek to impose their religious/moral outlooks on the whole of society.\nOften these parties evolve into parallel state entities with their own cultural, religious, educational, social"}

With spring just around the corner, St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations and rivers of green \u2013 everyone feels the need for green. Now, there\u2019s one more green cause to celebrate \u2013 the all-new Need for Green hue available on the 2019 Mustang.\nLooking every bit svelte, the Ford Mustang comes to market in 2019 with minor changes following its major refresh for the 2018 model year. That update brought new front and rear styling, revised suspension calibration and more power from both engine offerings.\nFor 2019, a 480-horsepower version of the venerable pony car\u2019s 5.0-liter V8 powers the latest Bullitt edition of the coupe. A new iteration of the California Special debuts, rev matching is fitted to manual transmission variants and the turbocharged four-cylinder engine gets an optional quad tipped exhaust system.\nOn the electronics front, the new optional Bang & Olufsen audio system boasts 1,000 watts. Apple CarPlay compatibility for Ford+Alexa and Waze via SYNC 3 is being offered as well. Rounding out the tech updates, FordPass Connect WiFi replaces SYNC Connect.\nDwelling on those latter features for a moment points out how the sleek muscle car has matured over the years. When attributes like those are combined with upmarket versions of the Ford\u2019s leather upholstery and generous array of comfort and convenience features, the Mustang provides an aura of quality its chief competitors lack.\nSaid succinctly, the Mustang feels better sorted than both the recently updated Camaro and Challenger. More comfortable, more luxurious, better handling and unquestionably more handsome, the choice between the three is obvious for me.\nPower comes from a choice of two sources. The aforementioned 5.0-L V8 makes 460 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. As impressive as those numbers are on the screen, you really have to sit behind this engine to fully appreciate what it\u2019s all about. With its stratospheric 7,400 rpm redline you can wind the 5.0-L Mustang to your heart\u2019s content. Even better, the more tightly you do so, the more melodious its aural signature becomes. Few V-8 engines give you a rev range this broad and you won\u2019t find it anywhere else in the Mustang\u2019s price range.\nMeanwhile, the 2.3-L turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder, which replaced the V6 in the Mustang\u2019s engine bay, also delivers a wholly satisfying driving experience. While it lacks the thunderous resonance of the 5.0-L V8, it pulls strongly everywhere from anywhere on the tachometer, delivering a total of 310 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque.\nWhen you consider this powerplant is tasked with motivating a mass of 3,556 pounds, it becomes obvious you can expect (and get) a fulfilling driving experience. In fact, the EcoBoost version of the Mustang also delivers quicker turn-in and a more agile feel overall because it has less weight in its nose. You can get a six-speed manual transmission with either engine, or a 10-speed automatic.\nOf course, cars in this category must also excite visually and the Mustang\u2019s long, low and lean profile accomplishes"}

The Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index asks a random sample of 500 people each day whether they have health insurance.\nThe survey found that the uninsured rate among adults was 12.3% during the period from 1 July to 30 September, an increase of 1.4 percentage points since the end of last year. The increase in the number of uninsured is more striking because it comes at a time of economic growth and low unemployment.\nThe annual sign-up season for subsidized private insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act starts 1 November, but it may not make much of a difference.\nDonald Trump has stopped federal payments that reimburse insurers for lower co-pays and deductibles that the Obama-era law requires them to provide to people with modest incomes. His administration slashed the advertising budget for 2018 sign-ups, cut the length of open enrollment in half, and sharply reduced federal grants to groups that help consumers navigate the process.\n\u201cThe number of uninsured Americans likely will continue to rise,\u201d the Gallup-Sharecare analysis noted, unless Trump and Congress take steps to stabilize insurance markets.\nA bipartisan bill to restart the canceled insurer payments faces opposition from conservatives and Trump has sent mixed signals about whether or not he backs it.\nWhile \u201cObamacare\u201d remains politically divisive, its coverage expansion helped about 20 million people get health insurance, bringing the uninsured rate to a historic low.\nContinued progress seems unlikely now.\nNext year\u2019s premiums for plans sold on the health law\u2019s marketplaces are expected to increase significantly in many communities, and insurer participation is down sharply, with about half of US counties having only one carrier."}

I\u2019m always happy to have moments like that in game \u2013 moments that take the game from well, this is decent to holy crap, this is amazing.\nIn Saints Row 4(Volition, PS3, 360, PC), that moment happened for me when I was running across a city at supersonic speeds, leaping hundreds of feet, and tossing fire and ice balls, effortlessly knocked people and cars out of my way. I had a gun that shot dubstep and another that shot alien abductions. I was dressed like \u201cRowdy\u201d Roddy Piper. Stan Bush\u2019s \u201cThe Touch\u201d was blaring. \u201cThis is f***ing magical,\u201d I thought.\nThe Dubstep Gun \u2013 let evil fear your mighty wubs.\nThe superpowers in Saints Row are a refreshing update to a formula which has often felt like just another GTA clone. Somewhere between the superpowers and the crazy weapons and vehicles and the Transformers references and Keith David, though, it manages to feel like its own beast.\nAnd how does a street gang (a world-famous street gang with an omnipresent marketing presence, granted) get superpowers? Easily, when the majority of the game takes place in a Matrix-like simulation. Trapped there by an invading alien race (led by the Killface-like Zinyak) the leader of the Saints \u2013 now the President of the United States \u2013 must find a way to disrupt the simulation, free your comrades and kick the living snot out of Zinyak. Along the way, the game also serves as a trip down memory lane, reliving events from the previous games and poking fun at itself.\nBetween the superpowers, entertaining cut scenes, and a boatload of gags and funny lines, the game provides a very enjoyable experience. But it\u2019s also pretty buggy. There were also a lot of weird errors, like unlocking weapons and costumes long before missions which would have logically been the ones to unlock them \u2013 I unlocked the Dubstep gun very early in the game and was then presented with it in a cut scene much later. The game also froze up on me on a number of occasions.\nAnother issue is that many of the side missions (superspeed races, using telekinesis to throw bombs at targets, etc) end up being a bit tedious. They\u2019re not deal breakers \u2013 none of them are truly terrible \u2013 they\u2019re just not all that exciting.\nSaints Row 4 provides a great mix of humour and action. It has its problems, but Volition\u2019s strategy to further distinguish the game from Grand Theft Auto is a smart one. Unfortunately, the end product just isn\u2019t that ground breaking. With the game\u2019s release just a scant few weeks before Grand Theft Auto V (a game which very much appears to be a game-changer), SR4\u2019s long term prospects are not good. I know that I\u2019m planning on trading in my copy of SR4 towards GTAV and I\u2019m sure a lot of other gamers are too. But if you\u2019re a fan of the open-world genre, Saints Row 4 will be a very welcome diversion \u2013 even if it\u2019s only until the next big thing hits."}

And then, silence.\nThe holidays can be cruel to those who broadcast live.\nThey create an additional pressure that not everyone can stand.\nAlready, one TV morning show anchor ended up in the hospital after trying to ride an electric scooter. Three Canadian anchors were forced to eat an artichoke tip that pushed their innards to the point of regurgitation.\nAnd now for the vomiting.\nBBC shipping forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker was delivering weather information vital for boating craft in British waters -- live on the radio at 5:20 a.m. local time.\nSuddenly, his voice began to falter.

I find that a lot of recent first-person shooter games aim for the lowest common denominator when it comes to casual appeal, and for the most part such games are almost \u201crail-shooters\u201d with a slight requirement to \u201czoom in\u201d to shoot accurately. Would I, however, say that Call of Duty ruined the FPS genre? It\u2019s a debatable gesture because Call of Duty alone isn\u2019t quite to blame\u2026or is it?\nAn editorial over at Sabotage Times recounts, in detail, the process in which games like Call of Duty have taken over the FPS genre and simple, mindless, fast-as-you-can-blink multiplayer has become the major focus of the FPS genre.\nThe author of the article, Jacob Ellison, details how Call of Duty\u2019s single player experience is basically an on-rails cinematic experience with single-player gameplay that practically mimics the multiplayer, save the enemy AI are basically talking cardboard cutouts. There are those now ubiquitous \u201cMichael Bay\u201d moments where players \u201cooh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d but have no control over what happens, a problem that Gaming Blend\u2019s own Pete Haas pointed out as a possible missed opportunity in his Call of Duty: Black Ops review. What kind of opportunity you might ask? Well, a chance to really engage the player with a little thumb action as opposed to just watching it all unfold in front of you.\nThe multiplayer, however, has basically become the point-and-center for all the attention focused on the Call of Duty games, and most people (with the exception of PC and PS3 gamers when it comes to Call of Duty: Black Ops) would agree that the multiplayer is a heck of a lot of mindless fun.\nSo why would a game consistently labeled as \u201cfun\u201d also find its way in synonymous conjunction with a verb like \u201cruin\u201d and adjectives like \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201crepetitive\u201d?\nEllison points out, in so many words, that catering the genre to casual gamers since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has engaged the community to become complacent with titles that focus on that lowest common denominator: simple fun. Just about any 10 year old can pick up a controller and play, and win, in a Call of Duty game. It\u2019s that simple, and yet that fun.\nNow, some gamers in the community feel like Call of Duty is receiving a lot of unnecessary hate simply because \u201cit\u2019s popular\u201d and pours on the \u201csimple fun\u201d in droves each year. However, it\u2019s a lot more to it than that. While the \u201carcade fun\u201d paradigm could be used as an excuse of why the Call of Duty games are about as simplified in their gameplay structure as Quake II from 1997, it doesn\u2019t really help that the industry is trying to mimic that \u201carcade fun\u201d with equally simplified gameplay titles aimed at the casual gamers.\nGames like Homefront, Bulletstorm, Bodycount, Crysis 2, Alliance of Valiant Arms, Call of Juarez, Blacklight, Transformers, Operation Flashpoint, Metro 2033, Left 4 Dead, the upcoming XCOM and Brink all fit within the same category of gameplay mechanics: fun, fast, arcade-like experiences catered toward the Call of Duty fan.

Sanger program coordinator Edward Fernandez said Sanger already offered tutoring in Organic Chemistry and Matrices and Matrix Calculations, two of the courses in Villarreal\u2019s proposal. Fernandez said more tutors were hired for those courses because of the information Villarreal gathered.\nThe four classes added to Sanger\u2019s tutoring services were Foundations of Finance, Cell Biology, Introduction to Medical Microbiology and Microeconomic Theory.\n\u201cI think this is the first time we\u2019ve changed regular course offerings, but it works into an existing system that was always designed to react to student needs,\u201d said Michelle Jewell, director of the Sanger Learning Center.\nOf the 1,963 students who enrolled in Microeconomic Theory from spring 2010 to fall 2012, 15 percent of students received a letter grade of \u201cD,\u201d \u201cF\u201d or dropped the course, according to Villarreal\u2019s data. Fernandez said students came in for 62 Microeconomic Theory tutoring sessions during the fall 20l3 semester, making it the most popular of the new offerings. Only eight came in for tutoring in Cell Biology.\nAccording to Fernandez, 141 of the new sessions were completed during the fall semester. This amounts to 10.2 percent of the Sanger center\u2019s 1,389 upper-division tutoring offerings, which in turn made up 14.3 percent of all tutoring \u2014 upper- and lower-division \u2014 sessions.\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re helping a lot of students, and they\u2019re continuing to use the service definitely shows that it was a successful initiative,\u201d Villarreal said.\nFernandez said Sanger plans to continue to provide tutoring for the piloted courses. There are currently 180 tutors at Sanger, most of whom are undergraduate students who pass competence exams in their preferred subject.\n\u201cWe anticipate that the number of completed sessions will increase as more students find out about this service,\u201d Fernandez said.\nSanger\u2019s appointment tutoring has a 90 percent satisfaction rate from student evaluation responses, according to Jewell.

This casual-dining venue comes courtesy of Matthew Jansen, best known as the driving force behind Boulder's popular and long-running Mateo.\nSituated on the ground floor of a mixed-use development, Raglin Market boasts a bright and airy vibe. The setup here is akin to most fast-casual places, namely that it's an order-at-the-counter spot, although staff does bring meals to the table. There's also an intriguing selection of $3 Tractor Beverage Company self-serve carbonated and non-carbonated fountain drinks, including a peppy ginger beer and a smooth coconut soda.\nThere are lots of hard surfaces here, including expansive glass picture windows, so it did get a little noisy during the lunch hour. It's also worth noting that Raglin has already become a popular lunch destination, and we needed to scramble for seating.\nBuilt on a foundation of soup, salads and sandwiches, the menu is straightforward, and also spotlights a selection of sides ranging from house-cured olives to roasted beets. If you're seeking strong beverage to accompany your meal, you'll find a small selection of local craft beers, cider, wine and cocktails. For small fries, there's a $6 kids menu, offering a choice of grilled cheese or chicken tenders.\nMy lunch companion, who adheres to a gluten-free diet, and I started off with a $6 bowl of tomato soup. In this instance, the key ingredients are cream and San Marzano tomatoes, blended in such a way to make for a bright, but balanced soup. The flavor profile expertly split the difference between the tomato's acidity and suave cream. As an added bonus, there was a surprising hint of peppery spice that built up over time, which contributed interesting depth to this comforting standby.\nA $12 garlic shrimp sandwich showcased two optional slices of top-notch toasted gluten-free bread that was tough to distinguish from a regular loaf. Stuffed with large and meaty shrimp that certainly lived up to its garlicky billing, the filling was equally laudatory. Arugula, cucumber, radish and a lemon aioli added both spring-like freshness and lightness, making for an unquestionably satisfying sandwich that didn't seem overly heavy.\nSurprising heartiness also characterized my choice of a protein plate. This $13 option enables the diner to choose either tuna, steak, pulled pork, jerk chicken, shrimp, or a cauliflower \"steak\" along with two sides. Perhaps motivated by some vaguely delusional New Year's resolution to eat better, I opted for the cauliflower. Although this cruciferous veggie was cooked to a greater degree of doneness than I prefer, I'd order it again. It also would have benefited from more of the green romesco sauce drizzled on top as its mix of acidic and herbal tones helped to enliven this otherwise mild vegetable.\n"}

This will be part of our contribution to the Productivity Commission review of local body financing and cost pressures.\nBesides the horrendous rates many farmers pay, a theme in the feedback has been concern that, in many districts, farming operations are paying numerous uniform annual charges because the farm is in more than one title.\nMultiple titles are common in farming. This can be part of a farm succession plan, the use of leased blocks and run-offs.\nThe basic rule is that rates apply to each land title and its value. Uniform annual charges, as a per property amount, are intended to reflect a contribution all ratepayers should make regardless of property value.\nTo avoid one landowner paying multiple times, the law allows for charges on additional titles to be remitted \u2014 but the rules are strict. The titles must be contiguous, used for the same purpose (such as farming), and owned by the same person.\nAround New Zealand the impact of these rules varies. Some councils hold tight to the legal minimum, getting maximum uniform charges from farmland, others are more relaxed.\nFar North District Council has quite an extensive 'common use' policy, so titles that are physically separated but part of a farm such as a run-off can get the extra uniform charges taken off their rates.\nThe catch is that the titles still must be owned or leased by the same entity but, on application to the council, separate owners can confirm their titles are part of the same farm.\nWhang\u0101rei's rules are a little different, with a charging policy refined to the separately used or inhabited part of a rating unit, presumably to capture multiple residences on the one title. For farms, it seems a bare land title ends up with uniform charges anyway.\nKaipara council's policy is perhaps best for the farming community. It allows remission of uniform charges where titles are part of the same farm, regardless of ownership.\nA uniform general charge can be hundreds of dollars. It is a good idea to check your rate demands to see what charges are applied; if you have more than one title money might be saved by checking with your council."}

Here\u2019s how VINE decided on an upgrade strategy for its critical monitoring infrastructure.\nThe Victim Information Notification Everyday (VINE) system grew from tragedy. In 1993, Mary Byron was killed by an ex-boyfriend after he was released from jail. She hadn't been notified that he had been released.\n\"Somebody promised her that they'd make a phone call, and that person let it slip,\" says Travis Ackert, manager of infrastructure services for Appriss, makers of VINE. \"From that event, we identified that the ability to notify people when criminals were being released from jail could be handled by computers and automated to eliminate human mistakes from the situation.\"\nVINE now automates the notification process when inmates are released. The system is used in 47 states and tracks more than two million inmates. It also lets petitioners track their restraining or protective orders and register to be notified of status changes.\nWhen Ackert joined Appriss almost two years ago, he took over VINE's infrastructure. He had a few choices in dealing with the monitoring system he inherited: upgrade, patch or replace the current system.\nAckert wanted the capability to grow Appriss and expand monitoring with it. Appriss has since acquired a company that lets people in traffic accidents look at accident reports online instead of going to a police station \u2014 a system that Ackert says is now used in a quarter of the country.\nAckert says he decided on LogicMonitor because it met this and the other five criteria.\nAppriss has also moved into healthcare with a tracking system that combats prescription drug abuse. \"I can add hundreds of servers, and [LogicMonitory] handles all the back end,\" he says.\nWhen Ackert began his search for a new monitor, he found he wasn\u2019t satisfied with what many vendors offered. \"They had a number of services and they used their own agents, which was software that you have to install on every machine,\" he says. \"[That] was a lot more complex than what I wanted or had the resources to deal with.\"\nLogicMonitor\u2019s system was lightweight, and they didn\u2019t pressure him into long-term licensing agreements. \"With us, if we're not performing and providing value as a software service provider, they can just cancel [the contract],\u201d says LogicMonitor CEO Kevin McGibben.\nThe technologies that LogicMonitor uses aren't propriety, which means Appriss could cancel its contract without worrying about the information they'd have to extract from their machines. \"They're using standard space technology that is out there for everybody to use. They're just doing it better,\" says Ackert.\n\"I have a fairly small team. There's seven of us who run an extremely complex network and close to 1,500 total virtual machines,\" Ackert says. One of the first tasks Ackert gave an intern was to work on LogicMonitor and backup the configuration, which the intern did with very little instruction.\n\"This was a kid who hadn't really done anything in the IT industry before,\" he says. \"It's nice to be able to hand something over to someone new and have it be intuitive for them.\"\nWhen Ackert first started talking to LogicMonitor, he says he saw that they were using a technology two generations older than what Appriss wanted.

Describing himself as a pragmatist, Anthony Santucci of the Centre for Alcohol Abuse and Drug Prevention said he hoped to see \u201ca 10 per cent tax on the sale of alcohol, which would be used to fund both the roadside sobriety testing and the support agencies such as PRIDE and Focus\u201d.\nBermuda Industrial Union president Chris Furbert said that Government could claw back some cash by abolishing tax concessions in the construction, retail and hotel sector.\nBut business heads have sounded the alarm over rolling back some concessions. According to the Chamber of Commerce, jobs will be the casualty if payroll tax breaks are taken away for retailers and restaurateurs.\nThe Bermuda Hotel Association took a similar line on preserving concessions for an industry that was once a pillar of the Island\u2019s economy.\nFor the civil service, the Bermuda Trade Union Congress has proposed a raft of initiatives, including voluntary early retirement incentive plan, restrictions on overtime, hiring freezes and removal of funds for vacant posts.\nUnions agree that cutbacks in the civil service should be left to natural attrition.\nAsked for his hopes for today\u2019s Budget, David Burt, Shadow Minister for Finance, said his priorities remained much the same as those put forward by the Opposition a year ago.\nThe Progressive Labour Party has repeatedly called for economic diversification, and roundly opposes outsourcing and aggressive cuts.\nMr Burt said that pension funds invested overseas could be used to fund the start-up of new businesses, as well as \u201cinvesting in companies that can bring jobs to our shores in new industries \u2014 tech and healthcare, to name a few\u201d.\nWhatever cuts are declared today, the Bermuda Tourism Authority has vowed that 2015 is the make-or-break year, pointing out that tourism\u2019s budget is comparatively low.\nMany who spoke with The Royal Gazette agreed that the Finance Minister\u2019s position was an unenviable one.\nSeniors advocates hold out little hope for a pensions raise, while Becky Ausenda, executive director of the Bermuda Education Network has implored Government to make literacy a priority.\nThe possibly merging of some schools is much anticipated, with the Bermuda Union of Teachers signalling its support for the move, given the drop in the Island\u2019s population.

{"idx": "15438", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Do You Have Financial ADD?\nRecently, a client remarked that he thought he was suffering from financial ADD. Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) is a medical condition that is normally associated with children and adults who exhibit inappropriate levels of impulsivity, inattention, lack of focus and sometimes hyperactivity.\nHis rationale for making this diagnosis was his track record of starting small enterprises upon a whim, with minimal success. He also reported that he usually became distracted by what appeared to be 'hot' new opportunities, at the expense of the business venture in which he was already involved.\nWhile I initially laughed at his declaration, I reflected on the concept of financial ADD and realised that when it came to their money affairs, many people could really be suffering from symptoms similar to the real disorder. Let's look at some ways in which financial ADD could be affecting your life.\nOne of the main areas in which you may exhibit impulsive money behaviours is in your spending habits. If you often make purchases without knowing if you can really afford them, are clueless about what it costs to live your lifestyle, and never prepare a realistic budget, then you have financial ADD.\nAnother way in which impulsive decisions may wreak havoc with your finances is in borrowing money. Symptoms include buying items on your credit card that are beyond your means, using payroll loans to try to plug budget shortfalls and taking out loans without the ability to manage the monthly payments.\nThe investing choices you make can also point to financial ADD. If you follow friends into dubious investment schemes, expect to make improbable gains from minimal investing efforts, and fail to educate yourself about smart investing techniques, then your impulsivity can put your money at risk.\nWhile impulsive behaviours may have immediate repercussions on your finances, financial inattention or negligence can take many years before the full impact is revealed. For example, if you fail to start saving early for your retirement, you may be forced to live in deprivation in your senior years.\nAnother way in which financial negligence can put you at risk is if you ignore the need to acquire life, critical illness and health insurance. Hoping that everything will just work out fine is irresponsible, especially if you have dependents who would suffer if you were very sick or died too soon.\nWe will all pass from this earth at some point in time, and it's important to put plans in place to deal with your earthly possessions when you're no longer around. Your financial ADD in neglecting to write a will or arrange for the seamless transfer of assets can be costly for those you leave behind.\nFinancial success requires you to be very focused on what you want to achieve with your money. If you fail to set specific and time-based goals, then it's highly likely that you will never accomplish your dreams. In this case, your financial ADD will prevent you from living the life you really desire.\nWhen you put your money aside in savings and investments, it very important for you to be focused on how well your money is growing. If you fail to monitor your money after you have opened an account or made an investment, then your financial ADD may cause you to forfeit potential gains.\nYou could also lose from being financially unfocused in the area of creating extra income. To attain your money goals, you may need to increase your earning capacity. If you do not seek ways to make more money and are not resolute in going after them, you could miss out on profitable opportunities.\nCuring a clinical case of ADD usually requires someone to undergo treatments such as behavioural modification and corrective medication, but sometimes the condition may remain with the person forever."}

Able to track multiple people with ease. Free.\nSome minor tracking issues. Can't import pre-made images and video. Can't layer effects.\nMotion FX gives users a wealth of the funky special effects to add to photos and video, but some limitations keep it from greatness.\nPhoto Booth devotees who've longed for more dynamic video effects will find a lot to like in Autodesk's Motion FX. The free Mac app leverages an Apple computer's iSight camera to add fire, smoke, and numerous other visual effects to photos and video taken within the app. You can't import previous taken photos and video, and there are some minor issues with the Motion FXs ability to track and read items in its environment, but it\u2019s a worthy download for those who like to tinker with goofy imagery.\nYou'll see an image of yourself in the large viewing area when you launch Motion FX, but not a normal image. Instead, the app applies all manner of wacky effects as it cycles through green auras, blue flames, and the like. To start, you have to wave a hand so that the motion trackers pick up your movement (which it does rather quickly). Bringing the mouse to the bottom of the viewing area causes a toolbar to appear which contains over a dozen visual effects ranging from smoke to rainbow effects. You can switch between them on the fly simply by selecting a new effect. Above the viewing area is a strip that lets you tinker with several options that enhance the Motion FX experience: Face Detect, Mode, Effect Paint, Video Warp, and Reveal.\n\"Face Detect\" lets you apply one of several effects to your eyes. The camera picks up on your orbs and applies an effect such as blue flame. I liked that Motion FX picked them up quickly, but it sometimes has problems maintaining the effect when I turned my head to a three-quarters angle.\n\"Mode\" lets you select a color and have an effect apply only to the area in which the color appears. For example, when I clicked a red box in the background, flame effects appeared over every instance red in the camera's view. Motion FX was pretty accurate in nailing all the reds in its vision, but it also set ablaze light pink items, such as blouses or human tongues. It could use some refining.\n\"Effect Paints\" lets you drawn lines or shapes that eventually dissipate into the effect you've selected; it creates a misty, almost ethereal look. \"Video Warp\" lets you warp the image by stretching and bending it to comical levels.\nIf you'd like to preserve your creations, you can snap still snapshots or record video by clicking the appropriate menu bar icon. There are five speeds for cycling through images, and the Reveal button opens the folder that contains either photos or video.\nShould You Download Motion FX?\nIf you're in the mood for a few laughs, grab a friend, fire up Motion FX, and deep dive into the insanity. Creating goofy photos and video is incredibly fun when you can pretend that you're crying rainbows. Motion FX may not allow you to layer effects, or apply them to previously taken imagery, but it's a fun app that won't weigh on the wallet.\nBottom Line: M"}

In fact, it was really big year, one that set the table for the next 2-3 years of innovation from Apple.\nIt's very likely we're going to look back at this year as the first one in which Apple fully entered the post-Steve Jobs era.\nThere's one event that really stands out: The introduction of iOS 7. Apple expert John Gruber writing about iOS 7, said, \"it shows that the company is not afraid to boldly move forward from the Steve Jobs era.\"\nJobs loved the bubbly, glitzy, faux-realistic icons and design in iOS 6. His partner Jony Ive killed all of that in iOS 7, which had simpler icons and design with a brighter color palate.\nApple hired Angela Ahrendts, formerly CEO of Burberry to run its retail operations. (Some people are so high on Ahrendts they think she'll be CEO one day. I'd like to see her work a day at Apple before making proclamations.) It bought 15 (!) companies this year.

Apple scooped up a lot of the people that developed Nike's FuelBand. Cough *iWatch* Cough. It released iOS 7, a total remake of Apple's mobile software. (We just talked about this.) The iPad Air is an incredible product, and the iPad Mini with Retina ain't too bad. Two new iPads that keep it ahead of the competition.

View Slideshow For most people, open source is a synonym for free software. But for programmers, open source is about sharing code, building on the work of others and not having to reinvent the wheel \u2013 at least, that's the ideal. In practice, code reuse remains very low, because it's often too hard for programmers to find relevant bits of code for their applications.\nA new search engine for programmers promises to alleviate that problem by making it easier to find and share code. That in turn could increase programmers' productivity and give a fresh boost to the open-source movement.\n\"This winds up being a window on all the open-source code in the world,\" said Krugler, who estimates the Krugle index will contain between 3 and 5 terabytes of code by the time the engine launches in March.\nThe new service joins other source-code search engines like Koders and Codefetch, but Krugle intends to differentiate itself by allowing developers to annotate code and documentation, create bookmarks and save collections of search results in a tabbed workspace. Saved workspaces have unique URLs, so developers can send an entire collection of annotated code to a co-worker just by e-mailing a link.\nKrugle also contains intelligence to help it parse code and to differentiate programming languages, so a PHP developer could search for a website-registration system written in PHP simply by typing \"PHP registration system.\"\n\"It's so cumbersome now to use tools like Google to search for code that the majority of programmers just write their own code,\" said Olson \u2013 even if they know that an open-source component is probably available that would meet their needs. \"If you can't find the pieces, it's too frustrating to try to reuse components. But if you can reuse components, you can get a factor-of-10 improvement in productivity.\"\nSimon Phipps, the chief open-source officer for Sun Microsystems, said Krugle could be useful as a learning tool, but the many different licenses that apply to open-source code are a potential stumbling block. In addition to the widely used Gnu Public License, Mozilla Foundation projects have their own licensing terms \u2013 and copyright holders may retain some rights even in otherwise publicly available open-source code, said Phipps.\n\"Let's say you turn up a bit of code that's licensed under the GPL \u2026 if you use it, that means your whole project needs to be licensed under the GPL. I hope that people are aware of these issues, because the licensing situation could get pretty hairy.\"\nKrugle will make money from advertising on its free, public search engine. The company is also planning to create an enterprise edition, due in 2007, to facilitate code-sharing within companies.\nCan Open Source Outdo the IPod?"}

According to several witnesses, men who had just left the church\u2019s hypothermia shelter for the day were set upon and questioned.\nSome were asked if they\u2019d seen any number of illegal immigrant criminals for which the officers were searching. Others, Latinos in the group, were singled out, fingerprinted, and some even restrained, forced into vans and driven away, witnesses said.\nAn ICE official would only confirm that two arrests were made at that location on that day.\nBut on Feb. 17, Kincannon and other religious leaders decided to pay a return visit to ICE, specifically at the field office on Prosperity Avenue in Fairfax. He said they have been trying to find out the names of the men who were allegedly picked up in the vans but haven\u2019t been successful yet.\nAfter reports of ICE officers conducting large surges of searches, \u201ctargeted enforcement actions,\u201d for undocumented immigrant criminals that followed executive order from President Donald Trump, this action in Mount Vernon has sparked fear in the community and calls for answers from leaders, according to the religious leaders.\nGov. Terry McAuliffe released a letter Feb. 16 directed to John Kelly, secretary of Homeland Security, requesting an immediate briefing regarding the events outside Rising Hope, as chronicled by NBC Washington.\nKincannon said that Jesus Christ taught \u201chow we treat the least of these\" is how we treat him.\nOscar Ramirez, one of the green card-carrying men who said he was detained and questioned by ICE on Feb. 8 before eventually being released, said fear in the immigrant and Latino community has caused people to stay inside, away from public and government buildings.\nSupervisor Jeff McKay (D-Lee) said this is a major blow to the public\u2019s relationship with law enforcement \u2014 one that Fairfax County Police have been working to repair and bolster.\nMcKay said many people don\u2019t differentiate among law enforcement \u2014 all are \u201cpolice.\u201d And if residents, undocumented or not, refuse to open the door or run the other way when FCPD comes around looking for help solving crimes, that\u2019s a concern.\nMcKay cited the recent murder case of 15-year-old Damaris Reyes Rivas, for which FCPD has arrested 10 suspects and issued murder charges against five of them.\n\u201cWithout that cooperation, we wouldn\u2019t have people under arrest,\u201d McKay said.\nFCPD Chief of Police Edwin Roessler said community involvement was definitely part of the case that helped them solve it.\nTwo memos from the Department of Homeland Security were recently published giving more detail to the executive orders on immigration and deportation enforcement.\nSpokespeople from both ICE or DHS both declined to answer whether or when Fairfax County Police might be contacted about participating as the memo describes.\nHowever, when asked about the memo, Roessler said first that any change in FCPD operation would need to go through the Board of Supervisors.

Trying to build an actual stairway to the moon would have been a bold solution to the problem of how to land a man there.

Spartacus here will have a change of heart about it the moment he becomes nominee and has to think about the general election.\nWhat\u2019s so remarkable about this rapid leftward shift is that it\u2019s working against the party\u2019s best interests\u2014both for the individual candidates and their chances of defeating Trump next year. So many candidates are trying to fill the most-progressive lane of the party that they\u2019re splitting that share of the vote evenly.

House Republicans shouldn\u2019t let her. Try to make her put the bill on the floor and force House Democrats to choose between their base and, well, basic math. Does Nancy Pelosi take the environment seriously or is she a climate-change-denying lover of farting cows?

But he would soon get another wakeup call on his third pro race. That race was the 2014 St. George Ironman where he finished in 18th place, nearly ten minutes behind the winner.\nIt was that St. George race that helped him refocus, to train even harder and to push himself to his absolute limit. In 2017, he won the ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships and placed second at the Ironman World Championship.\nSo that might be another reason St. George holds a special place in his heart \u2014 even with the challenging course.\nSanders is usually the one doing the inspiring. After going from addict to Ironman champion, he\u2019s a living, breathing example that someone can change.\n\u201cThe biggest thing I would say to anyone in a dark place like that is if you truly want to make a change in your life, you can,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing. It feels all dark and you can\u2019t see any positives. But if you really decide to make that change, it\u2019s amazing how the stars align and you meet the right people at the right time and have great experiences.

The bill would require no-confidence motions to be submitted by at least 61 MKs who agree on an alternative candidate for prime minister.\nIf that candidate were to be unable to form a government, the Knesset would not be dissolved.\nIf the bill passes in its preliminary reading, Likud Beytenu\u2019s coalition partners intend to veto and remove key clauses in the bill before it is passed into law.

He also criticized the proposal for canceling the role of the president in dispersing the Knesset, writing that such a change would enable prime ministers to advance elections to a time that would be convenient for them politically.\nBar said MKs should see Yinon\u2019s letter to him as a warning not to vote for the bill on Wednesday. He called upon the coalition to immediately backtrack from the bill and instead begin a serious process of considering change in the electoral system that would not cause significant harm to Israeli democracy.\nRotem wrote Yinon expressing outrage over the letter.

Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, said he would begin proceedings to hold the industry in contempt of Congress if the documents were not immediately made available to lawmakers working on a national settlement with the tobacco industry.\nThe state and the insurance company are suing to recover $1.77 billion they say they spent to treat smoking-related illnesses. They are also seeking punitive damages. They have long contended that cigarette makers concealed the dangers of smoking for decades and manipulated nicotine to hook smokers.\nOpponents of a proposed national tobacco settlement, in which the industry would get protection from lawsuits in return for a cash payment, looked forward to the release of the documents.\n''Once we in Congress start reading these documents, whatever little support the industry has on Capitol Hill will vaporize in a puff,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey.\nLast summer, state attorneys general and the tobacco industry negotiated a national settlement of state tobacco lawsuits that would have required the industry to pay $358.5 billion over 25 years. The proposal was recently revised in Congress, and the price tag raised to $516 billion.\nIn the Minnesota case, cigarette makers had argued that the documents should be protected by attorney-client privilege. But three lower courts and the Supreme Court refused to block their release.\nThe documents will not immediately become public. The industry has moved to keep them protected until they are introduced in the trial, while the plaintiffs want all the documents to be made public. Mr. Bliley's committee could also release them.\nAttorney General Hubert H. Humphrey 3d proclaimed a ''landmark day'' as he stood in front of some of the 110 file boxes just delivered to the Minneapolis law offices of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi.\nLawyers for the tobacco industry said the high court's decision set a bad precedent.\n''It sends a very chilling message to any trial lawyer that attorney-client privilege is not as sacred as it once was,'' said Greg Little, a lawyer for Philip Morris."}

More importantly, he said, the Department of Veterans Affairs should be screening veterans who took mefloquine and providing treatment.\nThe study will have particular emphasis on mefloquine and the new drug, tafenoquine, and will look closely at possible long-term neurologic and psychiatric effects, as well as the potential development of post traumatic stress disorder.\nThe work is sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The National Academy formed a committee of 10 experts in fields such as epidemiology, pharmacology, neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry, who held their first meeting Jan. 28.\nThey\u2019re examining long-term health effects on adults, including effects on service members, Peace Corps volunteers and others.

In these uneasy times, when stressed out business owners are pinching every penny, knowing how to reward employees without spending a lot is crucial. Here are 10 ways to pump up the troops.\nStart with the easy one. \"Some smaller companies get completely paralyzed with indecision when it comes to thanking employees, so they do nothing,\u201d said David Cain, director of marketing for Success Factors, a software company that sells online human resources management software. Stop fretting about not being able to shell out cash; a well-deserved pat on the back can go a long way.\nThanks feel great; attention and sense of ownership feel even better. Take time this week to sit down with key staffers, especially ones you are grooming for advancement, and discuss broadly what\u2019s going on at the company--from new clients to long-term goals--and how each person can contribute to making it happen.\nCompany picnics aren't nearly as restorative as time spent with family--in fact, say human resources experts, scheduled work events can seem a burden rather than a perk. What employees crave is a flexible work schedule and the ability to take personal time to handle family obligations. Four-day work weeks are becoming popular (though they come with their own complications). If possible, consider letting people work from home one day a week; with gas at $4 a gallon, that savings will feel a like a holiday bonus.\nTraining and development opportunities are energizing perks. Check out the local community colleges and university-extension departments for affordable classes, and foot part or all of the tuition for eager employees.\nIn a very small company, rewarding just one employee can make a huge difference. Take it from Sari Gabay-Rafiy and Anne Marie Bowler, two lawyers who left a large firm to start their own Manhattan practice two years ago. When Myrna Greenfield, their 60-something, part-time legal assistant, was feeling a bit blue, the partners decided a makeover was in order. So they booked an appointment at the Sparkle Beauty Studio, a trendy salon on Charles Street in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. Myrna left with a chic razor haircut and a smile on her face. After the salon visit, they continued their \u201cgirls\u2019 day out\u201d with cocktails and dinner. \"We can\u2019t give our staff thousands of dollars in bonus checks, but we can do little things for them,\" said Gabay-Rafiy.\nArbill, a Philadelphia-based workplace-safety consultancy, boosts employee morale by giving the troops more responsibility. \"We created employee committees to do things like set up a health fair, a food co-op and other [projects],\" says chief executive Julie Copeland. But the extra work doesn't just make people feel good, she says. \"Watching how employees manage these committees helps us create a great bench of leaders for the company.\"\nCash rewards work best if they are given immediately after a major achievement, according to Bob Nelson, author of 1001 Ways to Reward Employees. \"Reserve one or two percent of your base pay budget for cash payouts to recognize top performers,\" he says. \"These rewards have terrific motivational power, particularly when given as quickly as possible.\" Small perks--like gasoline credit cards or gift cards to Target or Bed Bath and Beyond--are also nice perks when money is tight.\nRelentless micro-management can douse enthusiasm in a hurry. \""}

Not so in India\u2019s telecom sector. In the past six trading sessions, shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have fallen 6.2% and 12.5%, respectively, in value. Year till date, these stocks have declined 32% and 62%, respectively. In contrast, shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which houses the mammoth Reliance Jio project, have fallen merely 1.9% in the past six trading sessions. Year to date, RIL shares have gained 34%.\nRIL isn\u2019t exactly a telco stock; although it is true that a large part of the gains in the stock have accrued because of Reliance Jio\u2019s steady upward march in the industry\u2019s market share tables.\nIn fact, subscriber numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show that the pace of Reliance Jio\u2019s market share growth has accelerated in recent months. The company had relaunched its feature phone called JioPhone in July, which helped its subscriber count grow by 11.8 million in the month. This was much higher than the average monthly addition of 9.5 million subscribers in the previous four months.\nFor incumbents, growth slowed dramatically. In July, Bharti Airtel\u2019s wireless subscriber base rose by just 300,000, while the Vodafone-Idea combine\u2019s subscriber count rose by 600,000. It was the lowest rate of subscriber addition in the past 10 months.\nAs pointed out in this column earlier, with none of the small telcos left to grab share from, Jio\u2019s incremental market share gains are expected to come at the expense of large incumbents. In July, Jio\u2019s subscriber market share rose to 19.6%, taking it ahead of both Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which were operating as separate companies at the time. In March this year, Jio\u2019s market share of 15.8% was considerably below Vodafone\u2019s 18.8% share.\nOf course, a larger share of Jio\u2019s incremental subscribers are coming from rural areas in recent months, suggesting higher sales of its feature phone. The Arpu (average revenue per user) in this segment is far lower compared to the smartphone segment. As such, revenue growth may be slightly lower than subscriber growth.\nMore importantly, Jio\u2019s growth is coming on the back of an increased thrust on capital spend. Cash burn can be expected to remain at high levels this year as well.\n\u201cDespite strong network metrics, Reliance spent US$2.5 billion in 1QFY19 alone, taking its telecom outlay to US$42.5bn\u2026 Telecom debt is already over \u20b9 0.8 trillion, in our estimate, with total telecom liabilities likely to reach \u20b9 1.9 trillion by March 2019 ( \u20b9 1.4 trillion in March 2018) after adjusting for vendor dues, spectrum liabilities and the RCom deal that has begun to close,\" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt.

This was especially true for \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d products that could be sold overseas. The belief was that American workers should be given every opportunity to compete with foreign businesses on a level playing field.\nThe Export-Import Bank, commonly referred to as the Ex-Im Bank, was created more than 80 years ago to help American companies sell their goods and services to international buyers. It provides loans and guarantees to buyers of U.S. products by partnering with private-sector lenders \u2013 not competing against them.\nIn 2014 alone, Ex-Im helped American companies export $27.4 billion in goods. Since Ex-Im\u2019s foreign customers pay interest and fees, Ex-Im was able to do this at no cost to U.S. taxpayers and in fact, has actually lowered our national debt by more than $2.7 billion in recent years by sending money back to the U.S. Treasury.\nBut this idea of a level playing field for U.S. exporters has come under attack from special interest groups that have convinced some members of Congress that they should oppose a program that makes it easier for U.S. workers to compete against foreign manufacturers.\nThe Ex-Im Bank requires that every few years Congress reauthorize its charter, but Congress let that charter expire last June when they left for vacation without even voting on the issue.\nSpirit AeroSystems does not directly use the Ex-Im Bank, but Washington\u2019s inaction affects our company and our employees. We supply parts to a larger company, Boeing Co., which uses Ex-Im to sell American-made planes to companies and countries around the world. Every airplane that Boeing sells means more work for our nearly 2,000 Oklahoma employees as well as hundreds in our supply base.\nBy failing to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, Congress is picking winners and losers. Regrettably, Congress has decided to choose foreign producers as the winners and U.S. workers as the losers.\nFortunately, members of both parties have joined together to secure a fair up-or-down vote on the future of the bank. This is a crucial vote for the economic future of our nation and our state.\nI urge the entire Oklahoma congressional delegation to unite behind American workers by voting to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\nDebbie Gann is vice president of Spirit AeroSystems."}

Still, with a glut of injuries to the starting rotation, the Mets have given him every opportunity to prove himself.\nAs the Mets use the next few months to evaluate their future, Montero has to make a case for yet another chance next season.\nMonday, they got a little glimpse of what they have been looking for. Montero had his best start of the season, holding the Yankees to two runs on five hits and two walks. He struck out six over six innings.\nThe Mets lost 4-2 when Hansel Robles and Erik Goeddel gave up solo home runs to Aaron Hicks and Gary Sanchez in relief.\n\"I hope it's a big step forward,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said of Montero. \"He has the stuff to pitch here. If he locates it and trusts his stuff and throws the ball in the strike zones, he has a chance to get outs and he showed that tonight.\"\nIt was one good argument for Montero, now 26 years old, heading down the stretch in a season that has been full of cases against him.\nWith this solid start, Montero lowered his ERA to 5.80. It was the first time in his last four starts he allowed fewer than four runs in an outing. With a home run to Aaron Judge to lead off the sixth inning, Montero has now allowed at least one homer in each of his five starts.\nBut there were signs that the Mets liked from Montero as he battled himself out of a jam in the fourth inning. He loaded the bases with back-to-back, one-out walks to Judge and Didi Gregorius. He gave up a sacrifice fly to Sanchez, but then coaxed a fly out to right from Chase Headley.\n\"I thought he did a great job,\" Collins said. \"The fourth inning could have been a disaster for us. I thought it was a big turnaround for us.\"\nAnd just maybe, this time it's the start of a turnaround for Montero.\nThe key for him Monday night was attacking hitters inside.\n\"I threw the sinker a lot tonight and I felt like I had good results with that,\" Montero said. \"I think all my pitches were really working tonight.

All of the major domestic stories, however, played out against the continuing images of the Vietnam Conflict.\n1969 in Vietnam saw US troops engaged in a 10-day attempt to cut off North Vietnamese infiltration from Laos in a high carnage battle at Ap Bia Mountain, later nicknamed Hamburger Hill by journalists. Ho Chi Minh died of a heart attack in September and, instead of lessening North Vietnamese resolve, fighting intensified. The U.S. responded with two strong and seemingly counteractions: the institution of a draft lottery and \u2018Vietnamization\u2019 program designed to gradually reduce the number of U. S. forces in South Vietnam. The draft seemed to gather up those young men not enrolled in college and to create a new group known as \u201cdraft dodgers\u201d who fled to Canada to avoid combat. Vietnamization worked as troop numbers dropped from more that 549,000 in 1969 to less than 69,000 in 1972 and an anxious nation watched as reports began to focus on the Paris peace talks.\nAmidst all the political and social upheaval of 1969, soldiers, sailor, airmen and Marines from the Tennessee Valley continued the fight.

The three brothers then tested them on surfers to be sure they would not bleed on clothes. They set up production and formed a business ( www.javajewels.com ).\nThe idea looks like a hit.

All the congestion on Chicago-area roads sucked up more than $6 billion in wasted time and fuel in 2011, according to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. That\u2019s third among the 101 metro areas they assessed.\nOf course, a lot of that wasted time is in what commuters like Esther might consider \u201ctypical\u201d traffic jams. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to help her: by laying out what the \u201cexpected\u201d traffic patterns actually are.

The worst morning hour, which is not as heavy as the afternoon peak, is from 7 to 8 a.m.\nWhy is the morning rush hour generally lighter than the afternoon-evening rush hours? Citing data from the Federal Highway Administration, Nebiyou Tilahun, an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of Illinois Chicago, says it\u2019s because people are doing more than just commuting in the afternoon.\n\u201cIn percentage terms, commuting dominates over other types of trips in the morning. In the afternoon, it is one of several trip types that congest the roadway. Family and personal trips as well as social/recreation trips are made with more or almost equal frequency,\u201d he says.\nThe discrepancy between morning and evening rush hours is even most pronounced on Friday, which IDOT says is generally the heaviest traffic day of the week in the Chicago area.\nThey think that\u2019s due to people taking long weekends, working from home, or otherwise shifting toward a four-day work week in the summer months.

{"idx": "15513", "prompt": "Continue the following text: I wanted to publish one more guest post on the topic of \"how we know what students know\" (look back at the introduction to this post for the full text of my guest post request). My favorite idea in Loryn's piece is that formative assessment is a necessary piece of a good lesson. I encourage you to check out the resources she references and think about ways to uncover students ideas during your work with them. If you have other resources or ideas about formative assessment please share them in the comments.\nI was taken aback initially by the fact that others might not trust that I was certainly capable of ensuring my students understood and mastered material. It was difficult for me to think of tangible ways I could provide evidence of said learning to outsiders. After some time in professional development and discussion with my colleagues, it became clearer and clearer that while teachers might think that they \"just know\" when their students get it, it is actually impossible to assess their learning without deliberate effort on our part to look for it. Furthermore, it isn't the outsiders for which we should do this; it's our students.\nSo, then, how do we look for understanding? Of course, there are traditional summative quizzes and tests that provide an opportunity for students to show their learning through essays, multiple choice responses, or fill-in-the-blanks. But while summative assessments are largely important, this is merely one way to assess our students. A problem with summative assessments is, by the time students take this assessment, and by the time it is graded with feedback, it might be too late to intervene. In addition to assessing our students summatively, we must also implement deliberate formative assessment.\nWhether it be hand signals and eyes closed in which students show you how well they understand a concept on a rating of 1-5, sentence stems to help them complete a summary of what they learned that day, or five things that they learned illustrated in their instructional notebook, a product from the student needs to be created to give the teacher an idea of what they learned or didn't learn in each lesson. Page Keeley, an author for the National Science Teacher's Association, has a plethora of examples that can be used for formative assessment with little to no prep for the teacher, as does a simple Google or Pinterest search. However, searching can be daunting, so in order to streamline this part of my instruction and showcase the evidence of my students' learning, I made a simple bulletin board in which students display their evidence.\nSome days it is a post-it note of a follow-up question they have over the material discussed, other days it is a concept map filled in by them and their partner. When, and only when, they show mastery, I tell them, \"Staple it to the board.\" They proudly display this work, not showing a creative ability to neatly display their work, but a true understanding of that particular concept. I've been amazed at how much more eager students are to use their notes or discuss with their partner to formulate a correct response to be able to showcase even one word on the board. This not only incorporates the essential piece of instilling ownership in students' learning, but also holds students accountable for mastering material. Additionally, it provides an easy way for instructional coaches, colleagues, or administrators to see what students are learning when visiting classrooms.\nI have found that it is not the ideas of formative assessment that teachers are lacking, rather it is the intentional effort to draw attention to the understanding that we forget to do in our very busy lives. I firmly believe that leaving this piece of teaching out bears the greatest consequences for"}

Some rejoiced, with choruses of \u201cWe made it\u201d flanked by newly black praise-hand emoji filling Instagram and Twitter. Some even professed to cry tears of joy over this sign of racial inclusion. But already, Apple\u2019s well-intentioned gesture to human diversity has taken a turn for the worse. The emoji are being used to make racist comments on social media and insert questions of race in texts and tweets where it may never have arisen before. Instead of correcting its mistake \u2014 excluding people of color from emoji \u2014 Apple has, in some ways, made the situation worse.\nIn trying to advocate for racial inclusivity in its iOS 8.3 update, Apple has allowed for further racial segregation with these new emoji. Because I\u2019m black, should I now feel compelled to use the \u201cappropriate\u201d brown-skinned nail-painting emoji? Why would I use the white one? Now in simple text messages and tweets, I have to identify myself racially. I\u2019ll now question other people\u2019s emoji use when they\u2019re speaking to me: Why is he sending me the black angel emoji specifically? Why is she sending me the black-girl emoji instead of the white one? What Apple has done is introduce race into everyday conversations where it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be. Clorox already has felt the weight of that reality, when in response to the new emoji, the brand tweeted \u201cwhere\u2019s the bleach?\u201d The barrage of criticism that followed the face-palm moment pressured the company to tweet an apology, noting that it never meant the comment as a reference to race.\nApple\u2019s intent was good. But the execution was completely flawed. Apple took the easy way out. Instead of creating actual emojs of color, Apple simply allows its users to make white emoji a different color. With this update, the company skirts around having to attribute certain physical characteristics to certain races of people. For example, there\u2019s nothing specifically \u201cblack\u201d about an emoji with browner skin. Deepening the skin color of a previously white emoji doesn\u2019t make the emoji not white. It\u2019s just a bastardized emoji blackface. The blond-haired emoji man and the blue-eyed emoji princess are clearly white, but you can slip them into a darker-colored skin. These new figures aren\u2019t emoji of color; they\u2019re just white emoji wearing masks.\nUnderstandably, Apple didn\u2019t want to create caricatures, giving those emoji an afro or thicker lips. But the company had already done something similar. With the first batch of emoji, they clearly identified one character as Asian, giving it narrow eyes and a skull cap. Another was clearly identified as Middle Eastern, with browner skin and a turban. And many were identified as white, with blond hair and blue eyes. Apple should have simply removed the racialized emoji altogether. What they did instead was homogenize and whitewash them. And now, in an absurd twist, you can change the skin tone of emoji that were specified as Asian or Middle Eastern. It\u2019s political correctness gone wild.\nApple\u2019s mistake was in ever introducing the concept of race to emoji in the first place. Now"}

There were many reasons given: too complicated, too adult, and no one reads books with young female leads. Now, 55 years later, Ava DuVernay\u2019s live-action adaptation of the book is making a similar point about young, black girls deserving a chance to be a part of the scifi cultural canon.\nA Wrinkle in Time was almost never published. You can\u2019t name a major publisher who didn\u2019t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I\u2019d read to them at night what I\u2019d written during the day, and they\u2019d say, \u201cOoh, mother, go back to the typewriter!\u201d A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn\u2019t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don\u2019t find, or didn\u2019t at that time, in children\u2019s books. When we\u2019d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up.\nAll those publishers were clearly wrong-headed. A Wrinkle in Time has since gone on to become one of the most widely read and beloved children\u2019s books in the world. Even with that proof, people still trot out reasons like the ones L\u2019Engle was given to reject things. How often do we hear \u201cit\u2019s just for kids?\u201d Or that \u201cgirls don\u2019t buy toys?\u201d That\u2019s all part of the same small-mindedness that almost kept us from reading A Wrinkle in Time.\nThe first image [I had in my head] was to place a brown girl in that role of Meg, a girl traveling to different planets and encountering beings and situations that I\u2019d never seen a girl of color in. All of those scenes struck my fancy, and then it was also something that [Disney VP of production] Tendo Nagenda said to me, which I\u2019ll never forget.\nOne of the things that really made me want to read it was when he said, \u201cAva, imagine what you would do with the worlds.\u2019 Worlds! \u2018Planets no one\u2019s ever seen or heard of,\u201d he said. There aren\u2019t any other black women who have been invited to imagine what other planets in the universe might look and feel like. I was interested in that and in a heroine that looked like the girls I grew up with.\nWhile A Wrinkle in Time\u2019s casting may not drastically change its story, the pivot is a testament to just how simple it can be to course correct for multiple decades-worth of marginalized groups being shut out out of cultural mainstays like science fiction. Just say yes to good stories."}

He'll try for his 20th world title in November in Scotland.\nWith no competitors in his weight and age class, Robert Herbst had one goal at the recent American Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation Powerlifting Nationals.\nHe needed to lift enough weight to defend his World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation World Full Power Championships title.\nThe 60-year-old Larchmont resident, who has battled multiple injuries the past several years, including an improved but lingering pinched nerve that has resulted in his right chest and arm muscles atrophying, benched 209 pounds, squatted 286 and deadlifted 341 to win his 23rd consecutive U.S. title and, moreover, qualify for November's Worlds.\n\"One adapts to the conditions,\" Herbst said. \"While I could have won lifting an empty bar, I had more pride than that and pushed myself. For example, I opened at 242 in the squat, instead of 132, because I am not going to make a charade out of being unopposed and win a hollow title. They say 90 percent is just showing up, but I wanted to do more than that.\"\nThe AAU Strength Sports Hall of Fame and Westchester Sports Hall of Fame member will go to Scotland in November having won 34 national titles and 19 world titles.\nWhile without competition at the American Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation Powerlifting Nationals, held in Kentucky, notching his 23rd straight national title was important to him.\n\u201cIt means a lot to me because it\u2019s so crazy long,\u201d Herbst explained.\nHerbst easily exceeded the Worlds-required minimum in the deadlift and squat. His 341 dead-lift seemed easy, he said.\nThe bench was different. Herbst's muscle loss contributed to him competing at 158 pounds in a division capped at 167. Last year, weighing 164, he benched 253.\nHerbst, who wants to break his age/weight class's 26-year-old bench world record of 264, didn't clear the world-required minimum of 209 until his third and final attempt due to right-arm weakness.\nWith the pinched nerve only occasionally causing tingling at this point, he's working to rebuild muscle to lift much more at Worlds.\nThe attorney has no plans to retire from his sport. He derives inspiration from other athletes, including a 155-pound, 81-year-old man he once saw dead-lift more than 400 pounds."}
{"idx": "15520", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: But sewage spills have also been problematic in neighborhoods to the west of Riverside Drive, because the entire area is part of two interconnected drainage basins, said Ray Shell, the assistant authority director. Authority records indicate that more than 440,000 gallons of sewage has spilled in the basins since the beginning of 2006.\nThe biggest spills have been on an easement at the dead end of Lennox Drive. The area is just 150 yards or so from the Ocmuglee River. Paths run along authority easements, where some people walk and jog.\nSince identifying Lennox as a \u201chot spot\u201d in 2007, the authority estimates that almost 350,000 gallons of sewage spilled into Sabbath Creek there.\nTwo of those spills resulted in fines to the authority of $4,400 from the state last year, Rojas said. More fines are expected for the four spills of more than 30,000 gallons that happened there this year, he said.\nRojas said spills were probably happening in the Lennox area for years, undetected by the authority.\nCheryl Rozier, who has lived at the end of Willowdale Drive for 12 years, said her family had long noticed a foul odor after heavy rains. It turned out to be coming from spills in the woods behind her home.\nFor the last 18 months she has been complaining to the water authority and the state Environmental Protection Division.\nShell said there are two main problems causing the spills. One is inadequate capacity and poor flow in the main sewer line in the area. The other is storm water infiltrating sewer lines, which can fill them up and cause overflows.\nThe first problem is with the sewer line that runs between a lift station at Lennox Drive and the next station, called Corbin. Lift stations pump sewage uphill toward a sewage treatment plant.\nShell said the sewer lines in the area were either poorly designed or planned very piecemeal when they were installed 30 years ago. The trunk line between Lennox and Corbin isn\u2019t properly elevated for the sewage to flow downhill, and the line is too narrow for the volume of sewage coming from north Bibb.\nTo fix this problem, the authority is taking bids on a $4 million project to run a parallel sewer line between the two lift stations. It will take the overflow during times when the original line fills up, Shell said.\nIn two weeks, the Corbin lift station is scheduled to get new pumps and motors to increase efficiency, Macy said.\n\u201cThis will fix the Lennox issues but will not cure the (storm-water inflow and infiltration) problems west of the interstate,\u201d Shell said.\nTo deal with infiltration, authority employees walked along the lines after this spring\u2019s rains and found missing manhole covers and other problems, Macy said.\nAlthough the authority has been using flow monitors to pinpoint leaks in the sewer lines for more than a year, the utility owns only 12 monitors, and they must be moved after each rain in a slow process of elimination, Macy said.\nRojas said the authority usually budgets $1.35 million a year for reducing sewer infiltration, but the authority board voted to cut back to $850,000 this year and next year so the rest could be spend on water system"}

{"idx": "15523", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In 1955, the number of mentally ill Americans in public psychiatric hospitals peaked at 560,000. Since then, that number has been in sharp decline: as a result of deinstitutionalization and the broad transfer of mental health funding from the federal government to states, people \u2013 especially children \u2013 living with psychiatric disorders and emotional disturbances have fallen through the cracks.\nLiz Garbus\u2019s new HBO documentary, A Dangerous Son, puts this crisis and the country\u2019s inadequate response in sharp focus.\nThrough the lens of three mothers whose sons suffer from mental illness, the documentary chronicles in intimate, often painful detail the roadblocks families face in securing treatment, as well as the effects of a dismantled and under-resourced apparatus for psychiatric care in the US.\nGarbus, the prolific documentary film-maker behind Ghosts of Abu Ghraib and What Happened, Miss Simone?, took interest in the subject after the 2012 Newtown shooting, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 27 people. Though she\u2019d previously examined institutional hurdles and the criminal justice system in documentaries like The Farm and The Execution of Wanda Jean, her hope, this time, was to empathize with the mothers who apply what she calls \u201cherculean efforts\u201d in order to care for their children.\nThe mothers featured in A Dangerous Son, Stacy, Edie and Cora, feel similarly. For the film, they granted Garbus unfettered access to their home lives as they perform the grinding task of caring for their children while jumping through a number of bureaucratic hoops to get them proper treatment. At one point Edie must call the cops on her son, William, 15, after they meet with his social worker; in another scene, Stacy\u2019s 10-year-old son, Ethan, is shown punching his younger sister in the backseat of the car. Later, filming is halted so the camera crew can intervene when Ethan is physically violent toward his mother.\nThe specter of mass shootings like the ones in Newtown and Aurora loom large over the film, with one mother expressing fear that she\u2019ll one day see her own son\u2019s face on the news as an example of a child who didn\u2019t get enough help. But Garbus emphasizes the fact that adolescents with mental illness are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. \u201cThis is not a film about these mass shooters,\u201d she says, underscoring the fact that, while focus on mental health is often used as a crutch in media coverage of gun violence, stigmas about mental illness frequently come at the expense of families like the ones featured in the film.\nAs noted in the film, 17 million children in the US have or have had a psychiatric disorder, but there are currently fewer than 60,000 beds to accommodate them. In Virginia and elsewhere, such insufficiencies have had fatal consequences: Austin \u201cGus\u201d Deeds, the son of the Virginia state senator Creigh Deeds, stabbed his father and killed himself just 13 hours after efforts to secure him a hospital bed fell through. Deeds, who spoke to Garbus for the film, later sued the state of Virginia for medical malpractice and criminal negligence, claiming that his son\u2019s mental health evaluator failed to contact local hospitals that were later revealed to have available beds.\nIn remarks made in the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed,"}

Fairly level terrain in the form of flats bordering lakes Superior and Michigan as well as the floodplains of big rivers like the Mississippi and the Wisconsin is widespread, but some of the Badger State\u2019s defining terrain features are hills and ravines \u2013 ice-molded or otherwise.\nGlacial hills, ridges and depressions give Wisconsin much of its landscape character, given that Pleistocene ice sheets covered most of the state repeatedly. You\u2019ll find moldings of glacial rubble from the Bayfield Peninsula to the Illinois border, but there are few better places to appreciate the workings of ice upon terrain as the north (dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kmn) and south (dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms) units of the Kettle Moraine State Forest in southeastern Wisconsin. Here you can wander piles of ice debris in varying incarnations \u2013 esker ridges, moraine divides, kame knolls \u2013 and gaze down into the pothole depressions called kettles, left by residual blocks of melting ice. The more ambitious might extend their glacial tour by hiking larger portions of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail (nps.gov/iatr).\nSouthwestern Wisconsin is part of the Driftless Area, a distinct territory along the borders of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and a small portion of Illinois that escaped glaciation in the most recent Pleistocene ice invasions. The topography is thus sharper and rougher than surrounding, glacially modified terrain. Coulees dissect the countryside, and noble, richly forested bluffs shoulder the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers here. Wyalusing State Park (dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/wyalusing), at the confluence of those mighty streams, is a wonderful place to bask in some of the Upper Midwest\u2019s most impressive scenery.\nThe Baraboo Hills constitute one of Wisconsin's most unique and arresting highlands. Their north and south ranges describe a ragged oval of tough quartzite, deposited as seafloor sediment some 1.6 billion years ago, buried, then exhumed by erosion. The heart of the Baraboo Hills is Devil\u2019s Lake State Park, protecting the namesake lake dammed by glacial moraines when ice swept along the margins of the range. Here you can marvel at glimmering waters set beneath 500-foot cliffs footed with extensive boulder fields. The Baraboo Hills are also notable as one of the most extensive swaths of forest in southern Wisconsin, hugely important for migrating birds and other wildlife.\nThe flatlands of Wisconsin\u2019s Central Forest are studded with ragged pillars of sandstone and dolomite \u2013 called castellated buttes \u2013 among the state\u2019s most unique landforms.

One needs to look only at the considerable increase in commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers spanning several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks\u2014these have become de rigeur. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, for the last two years the Russian data-center market is ahead of India, China and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data from the same period, Russia places second only to Brazil from BRICS nations in terms of total area. It should be noted that recent trends reveal that more high reliability data center sites are being developed in Russia, and there is good reason to believe that this will continue for the next three to five years.\nDespite these facts, it is too early to speak about a mature market for data centers in Russia. It would be more accurate to say that, at the present moment, the Russian data-center market is in a stage of active growth and formation: New services are being commissioned, new technologies introduced, new business models developed. Practically all of the market players announced plans to design and build new facilities, mostly Tier III level.\nThe composition of commercial data-centers users has remained relatively constant in Russia as well. The majority are big service-providers, system integrators, suppliers of various network content and also corporate clients, including banks and other financial institutions, who need reserve sites for information storage. Moreover, it is clear that many corporate clients still do not trust commercial data centers for direct data transfer, so their interest is mainly in reserve capacities. And while Russian government organizations are becoming more information-driven every day, and the proportion of commercial data-center business from governmental sources is increasing, the growth is much slower than expected.\nAt present the most dynamic growth area in the data center market is in the sphere of IT outsourcing based on cloud servers. This set up employs consolidated server solutions with cloud software that provides multiple clients access to different information architecture systems in one server cabinet. This is a trend in the corporate and public service sector in IT that will only grow with time.\nFrom the point of view of commercial real estate, data-centers market development is similar to the office real estate market several years ago. At first there was active growth, then flattening out, during which occupation rates increased. Later, when most of the areas and resources for data-centers are used, the development is more about intensive usage of existing areas than the development of new ones. Thus, the primary aspect is the possibility of modernizations, which should be envisaged in the design from the very beginning. The engagement of consulting company that has experience in this sphere is essential for the success of data-center \"densification,\" as all the works will be performed in close proximity to critical equipment. Russian operators of data centers that plan development of new capacities shall choose solutions that allow for future modification without stopping the operations of data-centers, besides savings at the construction stage due to phasing.\nIt seems likely that the further development of the data-center market will be driven by global patterns of available capital, construction costs, and the operational expenses of data centers. Presently, owners of almost all data centers try to squeeze the maximum output from their facilities. This process of \"squeezing\" forces data center developers to search for the most effective solutions, not only for engineering but for IT infrastructure as well. To be able to achieve the best possible results, one has to work with the best possible consultants."}

The same thing will happen with more bandwidth.\"\nToday, most businesses are using Ethernet-based connections that run at either 10 or 100 megabits per second (mbps) or 1 gigabit per second (gbps). That is the speed that bits of information travel across a network. Networking companies and an industry standards group are in the midst of a two-year effort to boost Ethernet's speed tenfold: to 10 gbps.\nWith a new high-speed version of Ethernet in the works, networking companies hope to tap into a hot new service provider market, where start-ups, such as Yipes and Telseon, recently captured about $200 million each in venture capital funding. They are attempting to undercut more established companies by selling lines to businesses using Ethernet technology and optics, rather than more costly T1 lines.\nThe start-ups, which also include Cogent Communications and Intellispace, have been using Ethernet-based equipment that run at gigabit speeds. But with the higher-speed Ethernet, they can soon offer Net connections that are ten times faster. The extra bandwidth will allow them to offer new services, such as video-on-demand and storage of company data.\nEven though the 10 gigabit Ethernet standard won't be finalized until March of 2002, analysts said most networking companies will ship products supporting 10 gigabit Ethernet in the second half of this year.\nThe networking companies will fight for a piece of the 10 gigabit Ethernet market that will grow from $71.4 million in revenue this year to $3.6 billion in 2004, according to analyst firm Dataquest.\nFoundry and Extreme executives said their 10 gigabit Ethernet products will ship in the second half of the year. Cisco is currently showing prototypes of its 10 gigabit Ethernet technology to its customers.\nCisco executives declined to state when Cisco will ship products but did say the company plans to ship before the standard is finalized this spring. Networking executives said their customers can quickly and easily upgrade the early 10 gigabit Ethernet technology when the final version of the standard is released. That is a plan similar to what transpired when gigabit-speed Ethernet was introduced to the market in the late 1990's.\nThe higher-speed Ethernet products will be used to unclog congestion on corporate networks, providing the extra capacity needed for employees to perform bandwidth-"}

Attendees at lectures sponsored by the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs discussed how to move on beyond the current impasse in negotiations with the other Nile countries.\nFirst, they said, there needs to be a single national agency responsible for Nile Basin affairs to manage the current crisis after several Nile source countries signed a framework agreement (the Cooperative Framework Agreement) which Egypt and Sudan refused to join claiming it neglected key concerns.\nThis first step is seen as a more viable option than letting the matter be distributed among several government bodies, they agreed. Members of the new agency would be drawn from the National Security Authority, the ministries of foreign affairs, agriculture, water resources, irrigation and international cooperation.\nMustafa El-Fiqi, the chairman of the National Security and Foreign Relations Committee in the Shura Council, said the problems of managing the Nile water crisis are primarily political.\n\"Someone is whispering in the ear of Nile Basin countries that the 21st century is the century of water,\" El-Fiqi said. \"While the 20th century was the era of oil and the Arabs benefited greatly from that, it is now their turn to reap the rewards and put a price on water and sell it like the Arabs did oil.\"\nIbrahim Nassereddin, director of the Institute of African Studies and Research, said that Egyptian-African relations are fractured, with animosity directed at Egypt. He used the example of Ethiopia, whose role on the continent has historically been in direct conflict with Egypt's because it views Cairo as a coloniser. Accordingly, Ethiopia resents Egypt's presence among the Nile Basin states.\nAmbassador Reda Bebars, who is in charge of the issue at the foreign ministry, asserted that the agreement will not proceed as planned. Bebars said that Egypt will continue talks with concerned parties and has drafted a development plan and closely monitors any new moves by donors for new projects, such as Ethiopia\u2019s planned construction of dams along the river.\nTo add the sense of urgency, Egypt is predicted to suffer climatic and environmental calamities in the future, forcing it to seek new solutions. Most pressing of these is the expansion of desalination projects and digging a small canal around the Aswan dam to allow the passage of soil towards the Nile Delta whose steady erosion will see areas flooded by the Mediterranean, according to Khaled Ouda, a geology and palaeontology expert.\nManaging the crisis from a legal standpoint is comparatively straight forward, according to Egypt's legal team in charge of the issue, because the statutes of international law are in Egypt\u2019s favour. Mohamed Sameh Amr, head of the legal team, said that Cairo is standing on firm grounds regarding its share of Nile water.\nThe major problems of Egyptians emanate from this kind of thinking \"Someone is whispering in the ear of Nile Basin countries that the 21st century is the century of water,\" El-Fiqi said. \"While the 20th century was the era of oil and the Arabs benefited greatly from that, it is now their turn to reap the rewards and put a price on water and sell it like the Arabs did oil.\" You Egyptians policy makers, we black African can\u2019t we think for ourselves?

Picking out three characters from around the world, Nokia gave the impression that these devices were for those in emerging markets, rather expecting to shift a large number in Europe.\nWhatever the case, Pocket-lint was on hand to give the new devices a quick going over. The first impression is that they very much toe the line for \"old\" Nokia and Nokia watchers will probably recognise various details and be able to accurately name the predecessor devices.\nWe've bundled these all in together. The first up is the Nokia Asha 200 (pictured in white) and 201 (pictured in blue). Essentailly these devices are the same, but one features a dual SIM setup and the other is single SIM.\nThe target market for this type of device is Africa, it seems, where Nokia tell us they've sold a lot of dual SIM devices. This is enhanced by their Easy Swap SIM technology, meaning you don't have to mess around when you want to swap from one card to the other.\nOne of the SIMs resides under the battery, as normal, the other can be accessed through a slot on the side of the phone, meaning you can cross a border, roll up to your nearest SIM seller and get yourself on a cheap local network, rather than face roaming bills.\nThe other big claim of the Asha 200/1 devices is that you get microSD support up to 32GB with a battery that Nokia claim will get you through 52 hours of music.\nThe next device offers a traditional 12-key keyboard as well as touch in the form of the Nokia Asha 300. It offers a 5-megaxpiel camera on the back so you can snap all those exciting shots and share with your friends. It looks every bit the Nokia phone of yesteryear, but with the freshly polished S40 OS.\nThe final device is another QWERTY phone with touch. This comes in the form of the Nokia Asha 303. It has a large capacitive display and an attractive metallic curved back. The Asha 303 comes with a 1GHz processor and Wi-Fi and 3G.\nIt only packs in a 3.2-megapixel camera, however, so you what Nokia giveth with one hand, it takes away with the other. The keyboard feels great though, feeling very much like the E series devices.\nThe four new Nokia Asha phones come with a Nokia browser, which offers compression on the server side, offering faster connections using less data, designed to save users money.\nNo word on whether we'll be seeing them in the UK, but Nokia is planning to sell millions of these handsets globally.

Avrahamy, in opposition to the city\u2019s dismissal motion did not state where they were signed in violation of the state\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure.\nFormer LAPD Chief Bernard Parks, now a city councilman seeking election to the county Board of Supervisors, was among those who provided a declaration, or written statement to the court given under penalty of perjury.\nAvrahamy said he will file a motion to try and persuade Munoz to change his mind.\nAvrahamy said he thought, based on the judge\u2019s comments during arguments on the dismissal motion last Wednesday, that Munoz was going to deny the city\u2019s dismissal motion. The judge took the case under submission and issued his decision Friday.\nClint Robison, an attorney for the city, said he was pleased with Munoz\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying all along, that there was not enough evidentiary information to go before a jury,\u201d Robison said, adding that he believes the decision will withstand any legal challenges by Avrahamy.\nThe trial was scheduled to begin April 1.\nSmith alleges that, for nearly 20 years, she was the subject of a false rumor that she tried to kill herself, and the department did nothing to stop it. She reached a tentative $1.2 million settlement in January that was rejected by the City Council, Avrahamy said.\nSmith, who lives in San Pedro, filed her complaint in October 2006, alleging intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation, negligence and civil rights violations. The suit named the city of Los Angeles, police Chief William Bratton, then-Assistant Chief George Gascon and Cmdr. Stuart Maislin as defendants.\nAccording to Smith\u2019s court papers, she has battled a false rumor about the end of her relationship with a fellow LAPD officer who lived with her at a Glendora apartment complex.\nAccording to the rumor, she stood naked on a diving board at the complex and pointed a gun to her head in despair over the breakup, threatening to kill herself unless the man returned to her, her lawsuit states."}

{"idx": "15561", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Despite a slow opening weekend, J.J. Abrams' sci-fi sequel Star Trek Into Darkness ultimately proved to be a decent hit for Paramount Pictures, making over $225m domestically and currently retaining a place just inside the top 10 highest grossing films of 2013 so far. This is good news for fans of Abrams' rebooted vision of the universe, as it means that Star Trek 3 is still solidly on track to head into production within the next couple of years.\nThe talent that will return to the franchise, however, is another matter entirely. With no writers or directors currently announced for Star Trek 3, the series could potentially go in a number of different directions: either bringing back all of the old team or, as the latest rumors suggest, bringing in some fresh voices.\nBadass Digest says that \"excellent sources\" have revealed the new writers currently attached to Star Trek 3 are Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, a long-standing team who are perhaps best known for co-writing Thor alongside Don Payne (who sadly passed away earlier this year). Miller and Stentz also worked on the script for X-Men: First Class, and have also done some work on the script for 20th Century Fox's reboot of Fantastic Four.\nAlex Kurtzman and Bob Orci are reportedly remaining onboard as writers and were instrumental in the decision to bring in the new blood. Miller and Stentz have previously written episodes of Abrams, Kurtzman and Orci's TV show Fringe, so the decision to involve them in writing the script for Star Trek 3 makes sense. Having said that, Badass Digest states that this isn't a \"done deal,\" only that at this point the Star Trek 3 writing collaboration is \"Stentz and Miller's job to lose.\"\nIf the story is true, this won't be Miller and Stentz's first brush with Gene Roddenberry material. The writing partners previously collaborated on many episodes of sci-fi show Andromeda, which was based on Roddenberry's notes for his 1973 TV pilot Genesis II and as such was sometimes referred to as Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda.\nStar Trek 3 doesn't currently have a director attached, and reports as to who might be likely to take the helm have been conflicting. The rumor mill mentioned Joe Cornish (Attack the Block) as one of the names on a list of possibilities, but Zachary Quinto has said that Abrams is still interested in directing the third installment himself, and the Badass Digest article reports heavy rumors that the director is on the verge of dropping out of Star Wars: Episode VII. The reasons behind his possible discontentment are unclear, with Abrams having expressed irritation at being forced to shoot the film in England and uproot his family for several months. Could this have been enough to drive him back into the arms of Star Trek, or is the buzz just misguided?\nThere's plenty of food for thought here, but with about three years left to go before Star Trek 3's release, anything might change between now and the start of production. Would you like the old writing and directing team back to complete their trilogy, or do you like the idea of some new blood?\nStar Trek 3 is expected to be released some time in 2016."}
{"idx": "15562", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: In May earlier this year, Snapchat raised around $1.8 billion in a financing round that valued it at around $18 billion \u2014 and now it looks like that valuation could double in its upcoming IPO.\nBloomberg is reporting that Snapchat is looking to raise as much as $4 billion in its initial public offering that could value it as high as $35 billion. Previously, the company was reportedly planning to IPO as early as March, though, as usual, all these things are subject to change.\nThere are a couple of important footnotes in these kinds of situations. First, these discussions seem pretty early in the process, and we probably won\u2019t know where things finally land until the IPO is priced closer to its listing. So setting these kinds of early expectations is often a tactic used to entice potential investors to the IPO. The company has chosen bankers, according to that report, but it\u2019ll still take a couple of months to pan out before we see some final details.\nSecond, as a result of them seemingly being pretty early in the process, everything could change wildly. According to leaked documents attained by TechCrunch, the company is looking to generate around $1 billion in revenue next year. It\u2019s already hit 150 million daily active users, making it one of the fastest growing and most appealing new platforms for advertisers. But we still have to see if the plans fully pan out. Snapchat\u2019s 2015 revenue was $59 million, according to those documents.\nIn addition, those documents suggested that Snapchat estimated it would generate between $250 million and $350 million in revenue this year. A $25 billion to $35 billion valuation is quite a large range, but given that the discussions seem quite early, it looks like bankers are still working to nail down the overall appetite for Snapchat\u2019s IPO.\nRaising that much money wouldn\u2019t be outlandish for a company like Snapchat, however. Facebook, in its IPO, raised around $16 billion, while Twitter raised around $1.8 billion. Obviously the former has proved to be more successful than the latter, but if Snapchat can capture early interest and raise a large amount of capital, it can get ahead of future potential waning interest.\nRaising that much money is also important to work on its hardware plans, like its Spectacles sunglasses, and making large acquisitions like its reportedly $100 million acquisition of Bitstrips."}

The Fed's policy move today might not have happened \u2014 probably would not have happened \u2014 if not for the heroic blogging efforts of Scott Sumner.

But Sumner's vigorous and relentless blogging throughout the crisis on the potential of expectations-focused monetary policy really broke through. It all began with some links from Tyler Cowen and perhaps a tiff with Paul Krugman. I became a regular reader and his ideas have done a lot to influence me, and you can clearly see the influence on Ryan Avent at the Economist, Matt O'Brien at the Atlantic, Ramesh Ponnuru at National Review, Josh Barro at Bloomberg, and a few of the Wonkblog contributors. Outside the exciting world of online economics punditry, NGDP targeting hasn't (yet!) caught fire as rapidly but it gained explicit allegiance from Christina Romer, Krugman, the economics team at Goldman Sachs, and eventually Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans who started out with a different but similar-in-spirit program.\nThat really is the key here: Not only has he been incredibly influential, but he really has done it almost entirely through his blog. Also, the bi-partisan swath of his adherents is remarkably rare for an economic pundit.\nIt's also rare for ideas to simultaneously gain currency among academics and Wall Street economists like Goldman's Jan Hatzius, who endorsed the idea about a year ago in a much buzzed-about note.\nThe jury, obviously, is still out on the Fed's actions, but the folks we like to listen to, like Bill McBride at Calculated Risk, are very hopeful that this can accelerate the economy.\nAnd if it does, then Sumner's blogging and promotion of the idea that the Fed should signal its unwillingness to let off the gas pedal, until the economy has more than recovered, will deserve major credit. Bloggers have accomplished some remarkable things, and this one will be one of the biggest.\n1. OK, if you're so smart what should we do?\nIt is not about being smart, it's about setting specific goals and promising to do whatever one can to meet those goals.\nI'd like to see the Fed set an explicit target path for nominal GDP.

{"idx": "15574", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke recently said the recession is probably over, as third-quarter growth in gross domestic product will likely be positive. But as jobs are a \u201clagging indicator\u201d of economic cycles \u2014 employers don\u2019t hire until they get signals that times are good \u2014 unemployment may still go above 10 percent. For those out of work, statistics pointing to recovery are often cold comfort.\nUnfortunately, some of the \u201ccures\u201d offered by politicians also offer little comfort in reducing unemployment. In fact, they will likely make things worse.\n\u201cGreen jobs\u201d is the solution most bandied about by politicians as a way to create new jobs in \u201cenvironmentally correct\u201d industries, such as wind and solar power. But it\u2019s just the latest elixir that builds on the shaky platform of job creation through taxation, spending and regulation. The only way the government can foster sustained job growth is to remove tax and regulatory obstacles to job creation in the private sector.\nWhile there certainly are some jobs created by new government spending compliance with government regulation, the key focus should be the number of net new jobs. And most often the result of big government schemes is net job loss.\nThis is because the costs of regulation prevent businesses from hiring new workers they would have otherwise employed, and government spending \u201ccrowds out\u201d \u2014 in economic terminology \u2014 business spending through tax hikes or massive borrowing that raises interest rates for the private sector. And since often the jobs created by these schemes cater to politicians\u2019 wants rather than market needs, they often are not sustainable without continuing infusions of federal money.\n\u201cGreen jobs\u201d seems to fit this classic pattern of government schemes that result in net job losses. Last year, Peter Orszag, then director of the Congressional Budget Office and now director of President Obama\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, testified that limits on carbon dioxide emissions in cap-and-trade regulation before Congress \u201cwould reduce demand for energy and energy intensive goods and services and thus create losses \u2026 for workers in the sectors of the economy that supply such products.\u201d To make whole the jobs that were lost in these sectors, government would have to start a vicious cycle in which it would spend more money, which would likely result in tax hikes that would kill jobs elsewhere in the private sector.\nIf this evidence of harmful effects weren\u2019t enough, there is also the issue that there is no standard definition of what a \u201cgreen job\u201d is. Some researchers for instance, do not count jobs created in the nuclear industry as \u201cgreen,\u201d despite the fact that nuclear power does not emit carbon dioxide or pollutants. The government probably couldn\u2019t even measure what the effect of its \u201cgreen jobs\u201d spending and mandates would be.\nFortunately, there is a lot the government can do to remove its own barriers to job creation in the energy industry and the economy at large. It can cut taxes to encourage investment, or at the very least not raise them.\nLawmakers also should consider deregulatory measures like the \u201cNo Cost Stimulus\u201d bill introduced by Sen. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican. This legislation would create an estimated 3 million new jobs by opening closed areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas exploration, and streamlining the licensing of nuclear power plants. This also would create royalty revenues for the government that the bill directs to a new trust fund that can promote renewable energy.\nCongress also should pare back job-killing mandates like those embedded in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was rushed through Congress in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals.

This exercise is a single-joint exercise, although the muscle it strengthens is a two-joint muscle.\nThe biceps curl begins with your arms straight at your sides. Your palms face forward with a dumbbell in each hand. Exhale, bend your elbows and raise your hands toward your shoulders. The weight is lifted as high as you comfortably can and as long as you are able to keep your elbows close to your sides. Inhale as you straighten your arms and lower the dumbbells to the beginning position. Keep a slight bend in your elbows at the bottom of the exercise. The curl repeats for your desired number of repetitions. The supinated curl is performed from a standing, seated or lying on a bench position.\nThe biceps are the muscles that bend your elbows and lift the dumbbells. The biceps begin on the scapula and end on the lower arm bone. Since the biceps cross the elbows, the elbow joint is used during the supinated dumbbell curl. The biceps shorten as the muscle contracts and when the muscle shortens the elbow flexes.\nThe wrist does not flex or extend during the supinated arm curl, but it is involved in the exercise. To protect your wrist and to focus the muscle concentration on the biceps, the wrists must remain in a neutral position. Neutral is described by the American Council on Exercise as being in a straight line with your forearms. The wrists and the forearm muscles controlling the wrists, remain in a static position as you attempt not to move the wrist joint during the curl.\nThe biceps attach to the shoulders, but the shoulders should not move during the curl.

Homeowners also need to take into account location, neighborhood, safety and any emotional connections to the home.\nFritschen says homeowners need to recognize their goals: do you love the neighborhood, the easy commute to work or your shaded yard, but need an additional room or would you rather move to a new area to get that bigger house?\nOwners\u2019 temperaments should also be considered during the decision-making process. Owners who can\u2019t live in a mess and don\u2019t like loud noises and hectic environments with people coming in and out may want to consider moving into a new home the fits their needs. For those that don\u2019t mind a little mess and chaos and like to give their personal stamp on upgrades and be part of the construction and design process, remodeling could be a good route.\nBefore making any decisions, owners should talk to a local real estate agent to find out about local inventory and get an estimated cost of the homes and the renovations.\nHomeowners should make sure any upgrades and additions are in line with the other homes in the neighborhood. If raising the roof on a home to add more to the upstairs will make a home the biggest on the block, then remodeling the return will be low, says Fritschen. On the flip side, homeowners with the smallest house in the neighborhood and you add a bathroom, kitchen or bedroom the value of your home is apt to appreciate, he says.\nIn the case of buying a new home, Nick Chaconas, listing specialist at Redfin advises buyers do research to make sure their budget lines up with their list of desires and potential markets to make sure the move is worthwhile.\nIn addition to the available inventory, Chaconas says owners should weigh whether they want to spend more on a new home or want to lower the equity in their home by moving. \u201cThe question needs to be answered: how risk averse or risk conscious are you?\u201d says Chaconas. Remodeling requires having the cash upfront to complete the job, a new home allows for financing over the life of a mortgage.\nAccording to Fritschen, the best time to buy a home is in the fall or around the holidays when the only ones on the market tend to be serious. The fall and winter season also tends to be the best time to remodel since contractors usually have a lull during the holidays, which means potential deals and savings."}

Spraying with toxic chemicals is always an option, but more Americans than ever are searching for more natural mosquito repellents for their backyards.\nThankfully, there are safer options out there. Of course, almost everyone knows that standing water is like a mosquito fertility clinic in the backyard. So, get rid of that. If you can\u2019t eliminate standing water, Mosquito Bits and Mosquito Dunks can make sure none of their young make it out of their breeding ground alive. Mosquito Dunks and Mosquito Bits are made from bacteria that should be naturally occurring in the soil called Bacillus thuringiensis strain israelensi, or Bti. Bti, found in the Bits and Dunks by Summit only affects mosquitoes and black flies. Bti gets the buggers when they are babies and is very specific. It won\u2019t kill caterpillars or any other bugs that you actually may want around your yard. The Dunks work longer, but the Bits work faster, according to a review on BugOfff. Neither will harm pets, people or wildlife other than black flies and mosquitoes. Unfortunately, that means it also won\u2019t help with ticks in the grasses near wetlands, but check out what amazing animal can decimate upwards of 5,500 ticks each week.\nNext, mosquitoes can\u2019t stand when a yard has been treated with Mosquito Barrier. A gallon lasts a long time and will drive the pests out of your yard. You wouldn\u2019t deliberately set up camp in an area that smells repulsive to you and neither will mosquitoes. Mosquito Barrier is made from garlic oil. You won\u2019t be able to smell it, except when you first spray it, but mosquitoes (and fleas and ticks) will be able to smell it for quite some time and will move on down the road.\nMosquitoes love the smell of mushrooms and rotten fruit. Be sure to get rid of mushrooms in your yard and move any berry plants far away from your play area. Consider growing Citronella, because the living plant is reportedly more effective than the commercial products. A live Citronella plant has a stronger smell that is more offensive to mosquitoes. If your ground frosts or freezes in the winter, the tall, grassy plant will need to be planted in a large pot, so that it can be brought inside for the cold season. If you live in a Midwest or Eastern growing zone, planting Horsemint, also known as Beebalm, is another way to repel mosquitoes. It\u2019s great for around beach areas, because it thrives in sandy areas. Mosquitoes also despise lavender, catnip, peppermint, lemon balm, and marigolds.\nIf you\u2019re buying mulch for your landscaping, consider cedar mulch. Cedar oil is a main component in many bug sprays. It can keep your landscaped area moist, without inviting mosquitoes to set up a nursery.\nIf you have a bit more cash to invest in eliminating mosquitoes from your yard, you could also consider purchasing a product like the Mosquito Magnet.

We've known about Android O for a while now, of course -- ever since the first developer preview of the software plopped out back in March -- but at I/O, Android O officially entered its beta phase and became readily available to anyone with a recent Nexus or Pixel phone.\nAndroid O isn't quite ready for public consumption, mind you -- it's still a bit rough around the edges, and if you use it enough, you're bound to encounter areas that don't yet work as intended -- but the software is now close enough to its final form that you don't have to be a total daredevil to try it out on a phone you're actually carrying.\nYou knew this one was coming, right? I've been talking about my burning desire for native Android notification snoozing ever since I fell in love with the snoozing function in Google's Inbox app many months back. With Android O, my wish is a reality.\nWhen you see a notification in O that's important but not something you want to deal with immediately, you can simply swipe it slightly to either side to reveal a new clock icon. Tap that icon, and ta-da: You'll find the option to send the notification away and have it reappear a little while later.\nBy default (for now, at least), Android O snoozes all notifications for 15 minutes. Tap the little arrow next to that time, though, and you can opt to change the window to 30 minutes or an hour.\nIdeally, I'd love to see even more robust snoozing options, like what we have in Inbox -- things like the ability to snooze a notification until a specific time and date or to set a notification to reappear when you're in a particular location -- but remember that this is still only the first beta version of this feature. What we're seeing now is a powerful first step toward making alerts more useful.\nThink about it in real-world terms: Let's say you get an important Slack message while you're in a meeting -- maybe something from your boss asking you to call her when you're free. You read it, but you know you won't have a chance to deal with it for another half an hour. And you don't want to forget.\nNow, instead of having to awkwardly leave the notification in place and hope it catches your eye again -- or, if your brain is as perpetually frazzled as mine, set a separate reminder for yourself as a fail-safe -- you can simply swipe that notification to the side and tell Android to bring it back to your attention in 30 minutes.\nEasy peasy, right? From a productivity perspective, this really may be Android O's most impressive feature.\nAndroid's had a native split-screen function since last year's Nougat release (and third-party manufacturers have been baking that sort of feature into their own software for even longer), but Android O's picture-in-picture mode is a much more practical way to multitask on a smaller-screen device when it comes to a"}

While the rest, that\u2019s 88 per cent rely on unhygienic methods like using an unsanitised cloth, ashes, sand or even husk. While that is one end of the problem the other aspect is that the minuscule percentages of women who use sanitary pads generate a substantial amount of waste every month. To be precise, over 1 billion sanitary pads make its way into the landfills every month and continue to overburden the landfill and pose a threat to the environment as conventional sanitary napkins take 100 of years to decompose completely.\nOn this International Women\u2019s Day, we take a look at five women who apart from propagating about menstrual hygiene also promote eco-friendly sanitary napkins.\n26-year-old, Deepanjali Dalmia, quit her high-paying job in New York in 2015, to work on an innovation that will help thousands of women around her. Last year, Deepanjali launched her innovative product, an organic sanitary pad brand called Heyday. The sanitary pad is 100% biodegradable and is made using bamboo fibre, which has high absorbance levels, and corn, for its soft texture. Heyday is manufacturing the pads in China and Finland and is packaging these in India. The reason for setting up manufacturing firms abroad is non-availability of chemical-free soil in India. Despite that, the products are being sold at a reasonable price. Currently, there are two types of sanitary napkins available \u2013 one ultra-thin sanitary pads are available at a cost price of Rs. 85 (7 pads), Rs. 165 (14 pads) and second, maxi fluff sanitary pads that are available at a cost price of Rs. 79 (7 pads) and Rs.155 (14 pads).\nThese pads are available to women in Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida and Mumbai in 24\u00d77 stores. Whereas, the rest of India can purchase these online.\nFrom the sanitary pads to its cover and packaging, everything biodegrades itself naturally within six months.\nFor this innovation, Deepanjali also made it to Forbes India\u2019s 30 Under 30 list in 2017 that features exceptional Indians under 30 who are creating a new India.\nKristin Kagetsu, 27, left the comfort of her home in New York and moved to India, because she wanted to tackle environmental challenges that country is currently facing \u2013 menstrual hygiene and waste management. In 2015, Kristin, who is a graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology started her journey to find solutions to these problems. Together with other graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2013 Amrita Saigal and Grace Kane, an idea to make 100 per cent biodegradable sanitary napkins was conceived. At the end of the year, eco-friendly sanitary napkins that can decompose naturally within six months in the brand name of Saathi Pads were launched in Gujarat. These pads are made using locally sourced banana fibre from the state, and are being sold at a price of Rs. 20 per pad for urban women. While for rural woman it is being sold for Rs. 5 per pad.\nThe products are also available online on their official site.\nFor this innovation, Kristin Kag"}

Fulghum and Bill Sweetman: \"Are there alternatives to the F-35 program?\" But in post-super committee America, where the Air Force daydreams about growing its fleet with a service-life extension program for the Wright Flyer , things aren't as clear cut as they used to be.\nBack in the old days we used to say, c'mon, there's just too much riding on this to seriously contemplate it going away. It's the largest defense program in history. It's the future of fast-jet flying for three U.S. military services and a host of international clients. It's got an economic footprint across the country. All the right people in Washington have a stake in pressing forward, even as its schedule slides and its costs creep up.\nProblem is, Washington does strange things. Difficult as it was to believe the capital would trap itself in a \"Guns of August\" crisis of process, that is what has happened: Congressional deadlock lit a slow fuse set to burn until early 2013, when a budgetary detonation could obliterate nearly $1 trillion in planned DoD spending growth over the next 10 years. The Pentagon, having shut its eyes and plugged its ears in hopes that would banish this monster, made no plans for what to do in exactly the scenario that has materialized.\nThe White House doesn't want this bomb to go off, but under the bizarre logic of the moment, it has vowed to stop Congress from blowing out the fuse, in hopes that its continued burn will motivate lawmakers to get the kind of deal they couldn't to begin with -- which set the whole thing in motion in the first place. Plus there's a nice little sideshow this week in which the Democratic president is in a showdown with the Democratically controlled Senate over detainee provisions in the defense bill.\nSo in other words, things that may have once made sense now don't. All the reasons the F-35 was guaranteed to survive may no longer apply. Secretary Panetta himself dangled the program over the hotel balcony in his warning to Senate lawmakers about what might go away under sequestration. There are no brakes on this thing. At one point, we were supposed to get a thoughtful, soup-to-nuts strategic review that would show the way toward a new defense posture for Austerity America, but nope, nothin' yet. Maybe this lack of any clear way forward is why people keep using the word \"decline.\"\nStrictly speaking, the answer to Fulghum and Sweetman's question probably still is \"no,\" in the sense that DoD can't just whip up another advanced fifth-generation fighter for U.S. and international militaries. There is a school of thought that it doesn't need to -- that upgraded versions of today's F-16s and F/A-18s can do just fine for the medium term. The international clients would be screwed, especially the British and Italian navies, but the way Europe's economy is headed these days, buying new fighter jets might be least of their worries.\nIf the F-35 went away, Lockheed Martin would be devastated, but it would probably survive -- it makes a lot of other stuff -- though tens of thousands of people would be out of work in Texas, California and many other places around the country.

But will our parents really kill us? Koraly Dimitriadis investigates.\nBeing brought up in a migrant family can sometimes feel like being stuck to family members like superglue, for better or for worse. This strong sense of family is \u2013 I believe \u2013 due to the migrants putting so much emphasis on family and community when they migrated to Australia. It was a scary foreign place to them, with people of different customs. In many cases, it was safer to stick with their circle, which was to be protected at all costs.\nWhile this superglue can have its up sides (like providing safety and security), a consequence of this is that it can sometimes be overbearing and claustrophobic. This can be the case especially for children born into migrant families, or children migrating at a very young age. As you grow into adulthood, your values, politics and ethics may differ from those your parents brought you up with. This conflict can be complex if there is a huge difference in ideologies.\n\u201cThis can lead to real dilemmas for people - the desire to be themselves and the desire to belong and be accepted by their family.\"\nPsychologist, Sian Khuman, who has over 15 years of experience working with family relationships comments on the matter.\nRigid family systems or family units with strongly held beliefs and expectations may \u201cset up a situation where [a child] has less flexibility to express and explore being and doing things that are different from the family discourse\u201d.\nI lived my life according to what was expected: I studied business, married and had a child. But when I realised, many years later, that my beliefs and my lifestyle were not what I had chosen for myself but what was expected, I began to question my life and search for my own identity.\nMy misery forced me to begin a personal journey of my own to find out who I was and what I wanted from my life. This meant separation from my husband. If you originate from a migrant family where family is everything, you\u2019d know that this is a decision that does not go down well with your immediate and extended family.\nThe push-and-pull between what my family wanted and what I wanted was traumatising for both sides. I had never lived on my own so, once separated, I would tremble in the night. I didn\u2019t have anyone I could turn to that understood what I was going through. My identity was always my family, and when that was out of the picture it felt as if I was a cat with my whiskers cut off. But I could not go back to the way it was.

Gates may be the world's greatest philanthropist, but when it comes to China, he's simply wrong.\n\"You've got to decide: Do you want to obey the laws of the countries you're in, or not? If not, you may not end up doing business there.\"\n\"The Chinese efforts to censor the Internet have been very limited. It's easy to go around it, and so I think keeping the Internet thriving there is very important.\"\nHe's wrong. The Great Firewall of China is not \"very limited;\" if it were limited the Chinese government would not bother to spend the amount of time and money it does enforcing Internet censorship. It's true that there are ways to attempt to circumvent it, such as anonymous proxy servers. But the vast majority of people in China have no idea how to do that. Chinese Internet censorship is not limited at all.\nAs for obeying the laws of the countries you're in, that's clearly a swipe at Google. And Google knows full well that it may not end up operating in China. Kudos to Google for taking such a principled stand against censorship.\nIt's also somewhat ironic that Gates is telling Google that you need to obey the laws of the country you operate in, given Microsoft's history of prosecution in the U.S. and record fines by the European Union for violating anti-trust and monopoly laws."}

For two months, Lancaster has gotten the chance to come out to the farm and work with six horses. It\u2019s a nice change of pace for Lancaster, who has been incarcerated for more than a decade on burglary charges.\nLancaster is one of four men involved in a program at the Second Chances Horse Farm.\nWhile caring for horses at Second Chances Horse Farm in Sykesville, prisoners from the Central Maryland Correctional Facility who are nearing release learn skills that will help them when they return to society.\nSarah Stein, the program director, said this program is about bringing horses who no longer have a racing career together with inmates who need to learn how to develop a skill. It\u2019s been going on since around 2009 or 2010, she said, and is one of nine programs in the country that partners with the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation.\nThe inmates involved are in pre-release facility, she said.\n\u201cThe guys who get to come here are ... on good behavior in the prison and are looking for an outside detail,\u201d she said.\nThey\u2019re at the farm every day, for almost eight hours each day, starting around 7:30 a.m.\nThe men feed the horses, do field work, groom the horses and more. There\u2019s also some classroom time, she said, to learn about how to take care of the animals.\n\u201cThey are interacting with horses who are animals who \u2014 due to their nature of being prey animals \u2014 their main goal is to stay safe. And so the way they interact with other beings is to have a relationship that is always about feeling safe and feeling comfortable,\u201d Stein said.\nThis helps the inmates learn about themselves because the horses act as a sort of mirror, she said \u2014 the animals can reflect the energy the men bring.\n\u201cSo you really actually have to do some internal work to learn about yourself,\u201d she said.\nFor Lancaster, who hopes to finish his bid in about eight months, the program has helped in more ways than one. He came to pick up some skills, he said. He\u2019s learned about horsemanship. He\u2019s learned how to use farm equipment and drive tractors and do fence work.\nBut it has also helped him emotionally. \u201cI have more confidence. Especially working around a 1,200-pound animal and putting trust in them as they\u2019ve put in me,\u201d Lancaster said.\nThe program has helped him get his social skills back, he added.\nAt the beginning of his term, Lancaster said his mindset was like he was still on the streets. He was noncompliant, and it wasn\u2019t until about nine years ago that he started to change his ways.\nHe\u2019s been creating and facilitating groups, he said \u2014 anything he can do to help.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing everything that I can to give back what I\u2019ve learned \u2026 to the young generation that\u2019s coming in,\u201d Lancaster added.\nAnd he hopes to continue to work with horses once released.

In 1998, Rossetto and Metcalfe lost control of the magazine to a group of investors who sold it to Conde Nast.\nIn 1994, Wired launched HotWired, the first commercial web magazine, which eventually was renamed Wired News. Wired News was sold to the search engine Lycos in 1998, shortly after the magazine was purchased by Conde Nast. For eight years, Wired News was owned by a different company from Wired, despite being the magazine\u2019s online presence. In 2006, Conde Nast bought Wired News, though the magazine and its website remain separate entities.\nWhile Wired.com had languished over its last few years under Lycos, its traffic rose quickly under Conde Nast. The magazine\u2019s circulation has steadily increased over the past decade, though its ad pages declined sharply in early 2009. They had flattened by 2012, while digital advertising revenue equaled print for the first time. In 2013, it launched Amplifi, a unit devoted to native advertising.\nWired Digital also runs the social news website Reddit \u2014 bought by Conde Nast in 2006 \u2014 and the popular tech blog Ars Technica, a 2008 Conde Nast purchase. Wired\u2019s U.K. division also runs a consulting division.\nWhile Wired was critically acclaimed in both the 1990s and 2000s, it reinvented itself for mainstream audiences under editor Chris Anderson after the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, going from a strictly tech-oriented magazine to more of a culture-of-tech magazine.\nWired has been praised for its innovative design and trendy tone, though it has also been criticized for the split between its print and online divisions.\nWired released its much-anticipated iPad app in May 2010. The app was initially free, with single issues costing $3.99. The April 2011 issue was made free as part of a sponsorship deal with Adobe. In May 2011, Conde Nast announced a deal with Apple that would allow in-app subscriptions for its magazines, including Wired. In-app subscriptions were available for Wired starting with the June 2011 issue. The app had 84,000 subscribers in the second half of 2012, putting it in the top 25 of magazines overall.\nIn March 2007, Wired launched Assignment Zero, a citizen-journalism project focused on crowdsourcing in various areas of modern life. The project, run in conjunction with NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen, was one of the first large-scale crowdsourced journalism efforts ever attempted.\nAfter encountering serious logistical and organizational difficulties with its more than 800 volunteers, the experiment folded that July after producing about 80 essays, interviews, and stories.\nPrimary author: Mark Coddington.

In the epic film Clash of the Titans, Perseus, the mortal son of Zeus, must kill the monstrous Kraken before it can annihilate his beloved Princess Andromedra and the citizenry of Joppa. Perseus heroically decapitates the dreaded Gorgon Medusa to obtain the most powerful weapon of his time: her snake-covered head. A single glance from Medusa\u2019s countenance turns the Kraken to stone, the local residents are saved from a horrible fate, and Perseus and Andromeda live happily ever after.\nPerseus vanquishing the Kraken was but a small skirmish compared to an even larger battle that is shaping up in the biotech version of this myth. The titans of biopharma are currently taking sides, and the clash of these powerful combatants is likely to be an expensive one. Healthcare consumers will find their wellbeing threatened by a powerful opponent. One of the strongest and most dreaded weapons of modern society has already been brought to bear: armies of lawyers fortified with thick legal briefs. The eventual outcome of this m\u00eal\u00e9e is unclear, but at stake are billions of dollars in revenue and profits. How was this conflict started, and who are the warriors in this brewing confrontation?\nThe fracas began when Abbott launched a broadside attack on the burgeoning field of biosimilars by filing a citizens petition with the FDA to protect their rheumatoid arthritis treatment adalimumab (Humira) from competition by biosimilars. This drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by binding to and neutralizing a protein known as TNF. Annual sales of Humira were nearly $8 billion in 2011, and it is poised to become the largest selling drug in the world following the expiration of Pfizer\u2019s patent on atorvastatin (Lipitor) in 2012. Humira\u2019s success in the marketplace has attracted the attention of numerous competitors, who have been planning on making their own versions of this blockbuster medicine when its patent expires. Abbott has asked the FDA not to \u201caccept for filing, file, approve or discuss with any company, or otherwise taking any action indicating that the agency will consider any application or any investigational new drug application for a biosimilar that cites, as its reference product, BLA 125057 for Humira\u00ae (adalimumab) or any other product [emphasis mine] for which the biologics license application (BLA) was submitted to FDA prior to March 23, 2010, the date on which the BPCIA was signed into law\u201d.\nFor those of you who are not familiar with the term, biosimilars are the generic drugs of the biotech world, copies of patented proteins that comprise many of the world\u2019s best selling drugs. Biosimilars are currently not available in the U.S. (with one minor exception) primarily because there is no defined regulatory pathway for their approval. The FDA spent months soliciting input from industry and consumer groups that is being used to plan out a regulatory pathway; their draft guidance was issued recently. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPICA) is legislation that establishes the ground rules for resolution of patent disputes that affect the development of biosimilars.

Not something we've ever seen before on 'Live at the Bike,' or here at the Bicycle Casino.\"\nThe game represented the culmination of a marathon of texting and cajoling from Feldman, the 33-year-old co-owner and producer of \"Live at the Bike.\" His task was sizable yet delicate: Persuade players to buy in for a minimum of $100,000 and play poker at stakes 20 times higher than the biggest game typically offered at the casino.\nThe lineup needed to be juicy enough to entice risk-adverse professional players and collegial enough to bring in deep-pocketed amateurs. Feldman assembled the seven players at the table, some considered the best in the city, others flown in from Las Vegas: Adelstein, a man described on another show as \"the kingpin\" of high-stakes poker in Los Angeles; Berkey, the volatile pro from Las Vegas; Prahlad Friedman, a fixture of ESPN's poker coverage in the 2000s; Art Papazyan, the reigning World Poker Tour player of the year; Nick Vertucci, an Orange County real estate investor who played often on the stream; Andy Tsai, another regular; and Ralph Wong, a former basketball analyst turned cryptocurrency investor.\nThe game had nearly collapsed earlier in the week, after three players dropped out and replacements were hard to find. Almost all the advertising for the show arose from word of mouth, and Feldman spent nearly two years trying to hustle advertising. The credibility of the brand depended on his ability to deliver. \"I'd be screwed,\" he said, \"if I didn't have a show.\"\nHe felt satisfied in salvaging this lineup. Adelstein acknowledged the \"thankless job\" Feldman undertook. \"All day, every day, someone's mad at you about something,\" Adelstein said. \"He's not getting rich off of building these games. He does it because he loves poker.\"\nAfter Adelstein and Berkey raised the stakes to $1 million, Feldman wanted to advertise the moment. He muted his microphone and rose from his chair.

Zappos plans to ask employees to choose their hourly work schedule based on higher pay and perks offered. The retailer recently stepped into this space by testing a new compensation model for their call center employees.\nThe model is called Open Market and is similar to Uber's surge pay that charges more during times of greater demand. Basically, Zappos plans to pay more on shifts with a higher number of callers.\n\"We wanted to start testing how we could give our call center employees more flexibility and be able to incentivize people to come to work when we needed them, even if the timing wasn't always ideal,\" said Adam Goldstein in an interview.\nGoldstein is the senior products manager at Zappos Labs, the shoe seller's R&D group that focuses on experiments concentrated on social, content and commerce.\nAlong with his team, Goldstein developed the Open Market project in 10 weeks using a variety of algorithms and metrics, including historical data, call volume forecasts blended with seasonality assumptions, and rolled out a pilot test of the program during the retail industry's busiest time of year: between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.\nBased in Las Vegas, Zappos' primary selling base is shoes, which accounts for about 80 percent of its business. It has since expanded its inventory to include clothing, accessories and kids' merchandise, which account for 20 percent of the company's annual revenues.\nBy 2015, Zappos forecasts that clothing and accessories will bring in an incremental $1 billion worth of revenue and might eventually outpace shoes.\nGoldstein says the heart and soul of Zappos is the customer loyalty team who answers on average 5,000 calls a month and 1,200 emails a week. Those numbers can easily spike, especially during holiday seasons.\n\"Employees love it. Every week when they log in, we ask them how happy they are with their schedule,\" said Goldstein. \"We've actually seen self-reported happiness go up 20 percent during the time we've been testing\" the Open Market method, he said.\nOpen Market is flexible and allows employees to set their work schedules above 40 hours, with the ability to work even when shifts are overstaffed. However, in reverse to the concept of surge pay, overstaffed shifts pay less.\nA perk of the compensation system is \"20 percent time,\" an employee benefits program in which a fraction of overall hours worked can result in expendable time to work on other projects, or even take some leisure time.\nWhile the online retailer admits to not having worked out all of the kinks, Goldstein argues that keeping employees happy is essential to the company. Open Market may be tested in other areas of the company, yet there is no date for launch in other departments, he said.\n\"Other teams have reached out to us because they want to be empowered to make decisions,\" Goldstein said, \"which is why they chose to work at Zappos and why we hired them to build teams that work.\""}

It had completed processing on 31 percent of the documents, or roughly 123 million documents, as of Dec. 31, 2011, according to the operations report.\nThe processing includes initial assessments, followed by reviews and certifications. About 70 percent of the backlogged documents have received the initial assessments, but only 44 percent of the assessed documents have completed all processing.\nThe reviews and certifications are required under national defense authorization laws passed in 1999 and 2000 as well as by a supplement issued to the laws. The reviews must be performed for documents that contain restricted data, or formerly restricted data, related to nuclear weapons.\nNARA officials said in the operations report that the lack of such reviews by the agencies that originated the backlogged documents may delay completion of the declassification project.\n\u201cThe primary reason for records not successfully passing the assessment is the lack of documented review for nuclear weapons information as required by a law commonly referred to as \u2018Kyl-Lott,\u2019 or a certification that the collection is \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 to contain nuclear weapons information,\u201d the operations report said.\nDespite interagency efforts to coordinate and speed up those reviews and certifications, the result is likely to be delays that impact the deadline for the project, the report added.\n\"Although we will certainly successfully assess all 400 million backlog pages within the next two years (and probably sooner), our ongoing assessment of the backlog suggests we must divert extensive interagency and NARA resources toward addressing prior failures by agencies to address the Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data-related requirements, and this unexpected extra review step will certainly impact our ability to complete all declassification processing by the deadline,\u201d the operations report said.\nThe declassification center also released a list of documents that had completed processing since October and are now available to researchers by request. They include just-declassified records from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Secretary of Defense.\nAll the documents in the backlog are 25 years old or older."}

Nearly 50 percent trail in reading. A third do not graduate on time. And hundreds of children, from kindergartners to seniors, withdraw within months after they enroll.\nBy Wall Street standards, though, Agora is a remarkable success that has helped enrich K12 Inc., the publicly traded company that manages the school. And the entire enterprise is paid for by taxpayers.\nAgora is one of the largest in a portfolio of similar public schools across the country run by K12. Eight other for-profit companies also run online public elementary and high schools, enrolling a large chunk of the more than 200,000 full-time cyberpupils in the United States.\nThe pupils work from their homes, in some cases hundreds of miles from their teachers. There is no cafeteria, no gym and no playground. Teachers communicate with students by phone or in simulated classrooms on the Web. But while the notion of an online school evokes cutting-edge methods, much of the work is completed the old-fashioned way, with a pencil and paper while seated at a desk.\nKids mean money. Agora is expecting income of $72 million this school year, accounting for more than 10 percent of the total anticipated revenues of K12, the biggest player in the online-school business. The second-largest, Connections Education, with revenues estimated at $190 million, was bought this year by the education and publishing giant Pearson for $400 million.\nThe business taps into a formidable coalition of private groups and officials promoting nontraditional forms of public education. The growth of for-profit online schools, one of the more overtly commercial segments of the school choice movement, is rooted in the theory that corporate efficiencies combined with the Internet can revolutionize public education, offering high quality at reduced cost.\nThe New York Times has spent several months examining this idea, focusing on K12 Inc. A look at the company\u2019s operations, based on interviews and a review of school finances and performance records, raises serious questions about whether K12 schools \u2014 and full-time online schools in general \u2014 benefit children or taxpayers, particularly as state education budgets are being slashed.\nInstead, a portrait emerges of a company that tries to squeeze profits from public school dollars by raising enrollment, increasing teacher workload and lowering standards.\nCurrent and former staff members of K12 Inc. schools say problems begin with intense recruitment efforts that fail to filter out students who are not suited for the program, which requires strong parental commitment and self-motivated students. Online schools typically are characterized by high rates of withdrawal.\nTeachers have had to take on more and more students, relaxing rigor and achievement along the way, according to interviews. While teachers do not have the burden of a full day of classes, they field questions from families, monitor students\u2019 progress and review and grade schoolwork. Complaints about low pay and high class loads \u2014 with some high school teachers managing more than 250 students \u2014 have prompted a unionization battle at Agora, which has offices in Wayne, Pa.\nA look at a forthcoming study by researchers at Western Michigan University and the National Education Policy Center shows that only a third of K12\u2019s schools achieved adequate yearly progress, the measurement mandated by federal No Child Left Behind legislation.\nSome teachers at K12 schools said they felt pressured to pass students who did little work."}

This 17% was on a population base of 350 million or so. At present, over 30% of our population, on a base of 1.2 billion, lives in urban centres.\nBy 2030, when we complete work of the 2030 Development Agenda, nearly 600 million Indians, or 40% of our population, will reside in urban spaces. To lay further emphasis on India\u2019s urban prospects \u2013 from now till 2030, India has to build 700 to 900 million square meters of urban space every year.\nIn other words, India will have to build a new Chicago every year from now till 2030 to meet its urban demand. More importantly, the new urban infrastructure India builds for 2030, 70% of which still needs to be constructed, will have to be green and resilient.\nIndia has been in the vanguard of the sustainable development agenda even prior to 2015. By promoting cooperative federalism, ensuring integrated planning through convergence, and focusing on an outcome-based approach compared to a project-based approach, we have embarked upon the most ambitious and comprehensive programme of planned urbanisation ever undertaken in the world.\nWith these principles as the backbone, India is implementing some of the world\u2019s largest and most ambitious national schemes for social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability, through silo-breaking approaches.\nIn the words of Prime Minister Modi at the UN summit for post-2015 development agenda, \u201cJust as our vision behind Agenda 2030 is lofty, our goals are comprehensive. It gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades. And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives\u201d.\nIndia has consistently achieved a growth rate of over 7% year on year through bold economic reforms, and has strong prospects for an even higher growth rate in the near future. Given our size and scale, India is fast becoming a pillar of global growth and stability.\nAs President of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat, it gives me great pleasure to note international efforts towards inclusive, resilient, and sustainable human settlements and SDG 11 have been greatly strengthened in the last few years by the New Urban Agenda signed at Habitat III, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements.\nToday, more than 90% of the global urban growth is occurring in the developing world. India, China, and Nigeria together will account for 35 % of the growth in the world\u2019s urban population between 2018 and 2050. It would not be an overstatement to say that India\u2019s urban agenda will constitute one of the defining projects of the 21st century.\nUrban areas in India face multi-pronged challenges. We remain confronted by a complex ecosystem of urban challenges through and in ensuring housing for all, technology based solutions"}

Down to ten men for the last quarter of an hour, the Phoenix succumbed to a late equaliser from Diego Castro. Morrison believes it was an errant decision, and that inexperienced refs are exacerbating the problem.\n\u201cThis is not a one-off - we are told it is going to be fixed, but it has not been. When we are denied a penalty in the first half, then have a player red-carded, we draw a match we are probably going to win. It puts the club under pressure, because we don\u2019t get flow-on effect due to a win against an unbeaten team that is top of the table. We don\u2019t get the crowds and the cash flow we need. It impacts our clubs as businesses.\u201d says Morrison.\n\u201cWe are seeing continual mistakes with VAR. FFA have to sort it out, and if they can\u2019t, then they have to get someone else in to fix it. We have constant conversations with them, but we get fobbed off. It is a complete waste of time sending stuff through, because we don\u2019t get action.\u201d adds Morrison.\nMorrison saves most of his wrath however, for the refereeing appointments themselves.\n\u201cThey are not spending enough on referee development. Pro refs are a good move, but they look to develop them by appointing them to games involving smaller clubs like the Phoenix. Adam Kersey has had twenty-odd games, and eight of those have involved the Phoenix. Over a third of his development training has involved us - we are effectively paying for it. In five of our six games this season, we have had the most inexperienced ref in the round. That\u2019s not an anomaly, that is bias.\u201d says Morrison.\nBut the Head of the A-League, Greg O\u2019Rourke, refutes those claims.\n\u201cThere are only thirteen refs on the panel, and only five games. Those refs are the best five available for the round. They are allocated by the strength of the fixture. But they are still getting one of the top five. I think they have had six separate refs - so it\u2019s not as if they are getting the apprentice.\u201d says O\u2019Rourke, who adds that FFA has devoted more resources to officiating in recent seasons.\n\u201cLast year, we appointed three additional coaches. We only used to have one in Eugene Brazzale - last year we had an elite refs coach in Michael Fabian, and a W-League coach in Jacqui Hurford, plus an AR coach in Michael Cheeseman. That has continued into this season. We went from one to four.\u201d says O\u2019Rourke.\nVAR remains the biggest bone of contention, for fans and clubs alike. Yet O\u2019Rourke says the system - by and large - is working well, and that there are potentially more improvements to come.

As a university student living in the area, of course, I couldn\u2019t resist. Sounds perfect, right?

Harmless? Chic? Unfortunately, the more I thought about it, the more I felt that it was deeply disrespectful to glorify Winston Churchill, without mentioning those who truly suffered at the hands of colonial rule.\nBeing of mixed Pakistani and English descent, colonial history has always been very close to home, and uncovering the horrors of British imperialism was a deeply upsetting experience. Churchill cannot be disentangled from this bloody colonial history. His instrumental involvement in the Bengal famine, his blas\u00e9 attitude towards South African concentration camps and declarations such as \u201cthe Aryan stock is bound to triumph\u201d have understandably lead me to question his heroism. With all this in mind, when my flatmate invited me to attend a surprise performance protesting against the caf\u00e9\u2019s decor, I felt my presence would be justified.\n\u201cCHURCHILL WAS A RACIST!\u201d Fifteen of us visited the packed-out Blighty Caf\u00e9 on a windy Saturday morning. A silence fell amongst the customers as we recited Churchill\u2019s racist outbursts; people were listening quite intently. Our performance lasted no more than five minutes. There was surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) little friction; except for one member of the cafe\u2019s staff shouting at us as we left: \u201cChurchill fought for all of our freedom!\u201d I felt such a response rather confusing after we had just quoted Churchill as saying: \u201cI hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\u201d I pondered on the man\u2019s retort on the way home; yes, Churchill did fight for all of our freedom, but he also hated South Asians and said that they followed a beastly religion. Should I then be content with businesses in my local area celebrating his legacy?\nThe coverage of the protest by The Sun and The Daily Mail in the days following our performance have triggered a racist backlash, with one member of the group singled out for character assassination. We might have intended to make people feel a bit uncomfortable, but at the end of the day it was a peaceful protest. Rather than personal attacks, the newspapers could engage in a debate about our historical narratives. The coverage also noted that, like many young people, some of our group supported Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Yet we did not choose to involve Corbyn in our performance, and of course he is entitled to his own opinion on these matters.\nOn the caf\u00e9\u2019s website, it is stated: \u201cBlighty\u2019s mission is to make the world a closer place by celebrating and improving the relationships between the people and nations of the 52 members of the commonwealth.\u201d That sounds wonderful.

This professor's bug of choice is the mosquito.\nMost people are turned off by creepy-crawly, or flying insects, but not necessarily when it's their field of expertise.\nDr. Wallace said \"I've been collecting insects since I was 8 years old, and it started with butterflies. It just kind of got out of control, into mosquitoes.\"\nEnvironmental biology student Kayli Thomas said, \"You tell people you work with mosquitoes and they're kind of put off by that a little bit. That's fair, but when you work with them every day, you get kind of attached.\"\nDr. Wallace's current project is figuring out how to entice the mosquito to prevent harmful diseases from spreading.\n\"That behavior can be exploited to trap and actually ensnare them, and pull them out of the disease pathogen transmission picture,\" Dr. Wallace said.\nSome may wonder why trap, and just not kill off the mosquito which has been known to transmit the zika virus.\n\"We are never going to get rid of this mosquito, this mosquito wiped out a third of Philadelphia back in the 1700s. It's still a major vector of yellow fever, hence the common name of Aedes Aegypti is the Yellow Fever mosquito,\" Dr. Wallace said.\nThe female mosquito is the only one to carry transmit diseases, but it takes more than a male to lure her away. That's what Dr. Wallace's research will figure out.\n\"In these countries where Zika is very prevalent, houses don't have window screens. Access to the internal part of the house is fairly easy. So, the idea would be to lure these mosquitoes away from inside of the house,\" Dr. Wallace said.\n\"Any mosquito that we can catch and control would be a mosquito that isn't going to send a pathogen to someone else, although we may not control all of them, what we can do is important,\" Thomas said.\nWhile this research is being done in central Pennsylvania, these researchers hope once they figure out ways to entice and trap the mosquito which carries Zika and other diseases, that people around the world will benefit."}

If geography in part accounts for why Mr. Graves is still in the shadows after more than six decades, another reason might be that his painting is nothing if not spiritual. Historically, spiritual concerns have been on the periphery of American art, but lately audiences have become more receptive to them.\nCynthia Roznoy, the manager of the branch museum, has organized a moving exhibition, one that proves satisfyingly once again that things can be counted on to stay the same, the more that they change.\nFor Mr. Graves the changes are on the surface as well as in the depth and range of his meaning and message. At the beginning of his career, his palette was dark and brooding, and his paint thick or scumbled. Nowadays his surfaces are thin and his subject matter is the transitory. But there has always been an undergirding of emotion. A 1933 self-portrait shows the lean and bearded artist looking outward warily, as if he's more comfortable turning inward. Animals -- birds in particular -- were an early focus for Mr. Graves. He painted them in exotic or affectionate circumstances, as in the lush ''Brazilian Screamers'' (1931) or the charming domesticated gosling, ''Minnie'' (1933). But often there is a negative component. Many of his earliest paintings are composed of arabesques, and an extreme example of an elastic line is ''Wounded Brant.'' Its subject is a wild goose with a head turned so that it agonizingly almost touches its tail.\nThe exhibition reveals a kinship between Mr. Graves and artists like Marsden Hartley and Charles Burchfield, painters who made symbols out of the most ordinary objects. In two paintings Mr. Graves made of sidewalk drinking fountains in the mid-1930's the fountains become fragile flowers; the bowl on top of the base resembles an open flower with the spigots as stamens. These paintings are prophetic, for flowers later become the main elements in his work. But the tendency toward transformation, one object becoming another, is a hallmark of Surrealism and its pervasive influence in the middle years of this century must be taken into account. Just as Hartley painted bleak rural Maine, and Burchfield a desolate upstate New York, Mr. Graves found gold of a sort in the impoverished local landscape. The titles alone of ''Abandoned World War I Fortification, Whidbey Island Washington'' (1933-34) and ''Memorial Day Wild Flower Bouquet in the Cemetery of an Abandoned Mining Town'' (1936) indicate the darker pole to which he gravitated. The essay in the exhibition brochure by Barry Schwabsky recounts that Mr. Graves was imprisoned in an army stockade during World War II for being a conscientious objector to military service, and that during the 1930's he lived for five years in Father Divine's Peace Mission in Harlem. Such facts indicate dedication to ideals, but in these experiences lie the roots of Mr. Graves' profound immersion in Zen Buddhism, something he shared with the composer John Cage, his lifelong friend whom"}

It's going to cost you.\nOr, putting it another way, you can save money if you promise not to make any human contact with a teller.\nWelcome to the biggest trend among financial institutions: rewarding you for staying away from their employees. It's part of the industry's growing emphasis on caring for the more profitable, affluent customer, and penalizing folks who take up a teller's time with pesky little transactions and irritating questions.\nIf banks had their way, you'd conduct all your business via automatic teller machines, PC modems or phone--on which the fees also have been rising.\n- At NationsBank in Washington, D.C., you pay an $8 monthly maintenance fee on non-interest checking if, during the month, you make one or more deposits or withdrawals at a teller window, by mail or by night deposit box. But the bank will knock $3 off the fee if you handle all those transactions electronically.\n- Savings of America, San Diego, doesn't require that you keep any minimum balance in an \"ATM Value\" checking account, although there's a $5 monthly fee that covers 30 free transactions per month. If you interact with a live teller for any transaction under $500, you're charged a $1 \"teller assistance fee.\"\n- Great Western Bank in Tampa has a no-interest \"Automated Checking\" account that charges a $5 monthly fee if you need any human teller assistance during the monthly billing cycle. The fee drops to only $1 per month if you don't bother with their help. You can bring that figure down to zero if you agree not to have your checks returned with your monthly statement.\nThe Bank Rate Monitor study shows that checking accounts, probably more than on any other type of account, are where the consumer can avoid being dollared to death by a myriad of fees and charges. All you need to do is switch from people to robots. But what makes it difficult for the average Joe and Jane is the slew of different checking accounts to choose from--some banks offer six or seven.\nToday, more than ever, it's important to match the right checking account with your personal banking behavior. Is it better for you to have an account that pays interest but charges higher fees, or one with no interest but lower fees? The answer is a no-brainer because, on average, an interest-bearing account pays a measly 1 percent.\nThe minimum amount you'll need to open a checking account depends on where you live, and the kind of account it is, Bank Rate Monitor found. On no-interest checking it ranges from a high average of $738 among New York banks to a low average of only $21 in Boston. But--and here's the rub--to avoid paying a fee, the typical New York institution requires you keep at least a $1,893 balance. In Boston, the average no-fee threshold is $2,100, highest in the country. Minneapolis has the lowest minimum balance to skirt fees: $263.\nThe ugliest fee of all? When you write a rubber check. On a no-interest account, it will cost you $28.29 in Philadelphia or $27.59 in Miami.\nIf you haven't looked into your checking costs lately, this is a good time to start.

In circumstances that Russia enjoyed for much of the previous decade, the harsh masters in the form of the international capital markets could be largely ignored. Unfortunately, this long period of good fortune is rapidly coming to an end. Starting in 2011, Russia\u2019s margins, on current trends, will be exhausted, and the country will be exposed to similar pressures that are felt by most countries further to the West.\nRussia has been a net saver for more than a decade as evidenced by annual current account surpluses in its balance of payments. This excess of savings over investment is estimated to cumulate to $676 billion between 2000 and 2010. These savings were by definition lent to the rest of the world, and the assets for the most part were held in the foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank.\nWhether it made sense for a country like Russia, with its enormous needs for more productive investment, to be a financier for the rest of the world is questionable in the abstract. But in view of Russian realities, where good intentions are too often sidetracked, it is not clear that higher investment \u2014 and hence lower net savings \u2014 would have been well-spent. As it was, becoming a major international creditor country, although not in the same league as China, provided Russia with an ample margin for maneuver in policy terms, a luxury that many countries could only envy.\nOne of the ironies of the fallout from the global financial crisis in fall 2008 was that there was a sudden credit crunch in Russia despite its status as a major creditor country. The problem is that Russian capital markets are relatively unattractive to investors with the result that the country\u2019s savings are generally held offshore, and it is foreign banks that profit from intermediating this money back to large Russian borrowers who also find the local markets inadequate for their needs. So in the end, Russians were borrowing their own money and paying for the privilege. No wonder that financial market development has belatedly become an important policy priority.\nIn the past decade, the government helped Russia become a net saver. Having been burned by the 1998 default \u2014 when an unsustainable budget was confronted by unforgiving capital markets, which is also seen in the current sequel to this scenario in the euro-zone periphery \u2014 the Russian government got religious. That is, the budget was in surplus from 2000 through 2008, and public debt was substantially reduced. These funds were available to soften the blow when the global crisis did hit.\nFor two years now, the government has run a budget deficit. It seemed until last summer that this dip into deficit was just a temporary response to the impact of the global crisis. The Russian government had a plan to get back to a balanced budget and wean it away from dependence on oil as a key source of financing. But sustained high oil prices and irresolute leadership in the face of conflicting demands led to a weakening in fiscal discipline. Whereas the budget could have balanced in 2005 with an oil price of $35 per barrel \u2014 in fact the oil price was $50 per barrel and the surplus equaled almost 8 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 now it would take an oil price of $100 per barrel. This is clearly a high-risk approach since the major macroeconomic risk ahead is the excessive dependence of the budget on the oil price.\nFor the past two years, the government was able to live"}

Obama has done precisely this in unveiling his bank bailout plan.\nIn a desperate attempt to distance himself from Bush, the Obama administration has added some complicated economic terms packaged into a system he simply calls the \u201cbad bank.\u201d The essence of the plan, however, is exactly what Bush originally proposed.\nAlthough the details are fuzzy, simply put, U.S. taxpayers could have to pay up to $2.5 trillion more to buy the garbage loans that the banks accumulated, saving them from bankruptcy, while maintaining the same greedy shareholders and inept managers that drove the banks to ruin in the first place.\nTo distinguish this plan from Bush\u2019s, Obama will force taxpayers to pay trillions to private firms so that they can purchase the junk debt. Of course this changes nothing.\nBush originally shelved this plan and instead opted towards investing (owning) directly in the banks, while purposely choosing to have no decision making power.\nThe result is well known: bank executives did whatever they wanted to with taxpayer money, such as holding lavish banquets and paying millions to management \u2014 all the while making no new loans and now pleading for more money.\nMore importantly, by nationalizing the banks, the government could actually decide what to do with the money, such as \u201cunfreezing\u201d the credit market \u2014 the alleged goal of the past and present bailouts. The shareholders and management could be quickly done away with, and the money could be put to work on socially useful projects, such as helping finance social works projects, giving people low or no interest loans to buy houses, finance their education, or to payoff predatory credit card bills, etc.\nWhy is this? Why did Obama ignore the common sense advice of nationalization, which would have saved him the embarrassment of giving trillions of taxpayer money to the already-hated bank owners?\nThe answer is simple: Obama completely shares Bush\u2019s perspective on the free market (capitalism), meaning that private individuals should run our economy and be accountable to no one but themselves. Never mind that these individuals need trillions of dollars of taxpayer money \u2014 they should be left alone to do what they like.\nFor such hardened believers in the market economy, nationalization is considered a cardinal sin, for it destroys the myth that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market solves all our problems, and instead shows another way: that a government\u2019s economy can be put to work towards socially useful activities, and not simply to profit a small group of billionaires.\nAbove all, the free-market believer fears that, if the banks are nationalized, people might also demand that other sectors of the economy be put under public control, completely removing the need for shareholders in the first place, the same people who benefit tremendously from bank bailouts.\nSome analysts are predicting that once the Obama administration reviews the balance sheets of the banks that are to receive bailout money \u2014 which is one aspect of Obama\u2019s plan \u2014 the government will realize these banks are beyond insolvent (bankrupt) and will need to be nationalized anyway.\nIn this case, the banks would likely be nationalized just long enough for them to be cleaned up and sold to private investors, with the public receiving little if any benefit.

His office didn't immediately return calls for comment Wednesday.\nNIFA chairman Jon Kaiman, who was appointed by Cuomo, said after the Senate vote that \"the county is coming forward with revenue and savings that give me greater confidence that they can cover the costs.\"\nNIFA is scheduled to meet Friday to consider approving Memorandums of Agreements with four of the five county unions -- the Civil Service Employees Association, the Police Benevolent Association, the Detectives Association, and the Superior Officers Association. A deal with the county's correction officers has yet to be finalized.\nThe agreements would end the wage freeze NIFA imposed in March 2011 and give union workers raises retroactive to April 1.\nThe school-zone speed camera bill authorizes 69 cameras in Suffolk County and 56 in Nassau, one per public school district. It also would expand the number of speed cameras in New York City from the current 20 to 140. Net proceeds from tickets generated on village streets would go to villages.\nSen. Martin Golden (R-Brooklyn) had held up negotiations on the bill, pushing for a share of the money to go to public safety programs in some jurisdictions. He indicated Wednesday that the sides had reached an agreement to that effect. Details weren't immediately available.\nBackers said speed cameras would improve safety in school zones.\n\"The evidence is clear -- when drivers know they might be caught, they slow down,\" said Senate co-leader Jeff Klein (D-Bronx), sponsor of the bill in the Senate. \"We need to make people think twice before they hit that accelerator in a school zone and these cameras will do exactly that.\"\nOpponents called it a \"money grab\" and recalled the hidden cameras that watch citizens in the novel \"1984.\"\n\"I believe that the effort for more speed cameras kept being disguised as a public safety measure when it was all about generating more revenue,\" Sen. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley), who voted no, said after the vote. \"We're seeing more and more cameras in our neighborhoods, and enough is enough. I've heard from many of my constituents who agree with me.\"\nSen. John Flanagan (R-East Northport) and Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson) also voted no.\nSenate co-leader Dean Skelos (R-Rockville Centre) supported the measure, along with S"}

That's Jason Witten the player, and the person, and that play is his whole career.\"\nWitten has not formally announced his retirement, but sources have indicated his decision is final. The Cowboys are not expecting him back, and he will join ESPN's Monday Night Football booth for the 2018 NFL season.\nOn Saturday, the team drafted his potential replacement in the fourth round \u2014 Stanford's Dalton Schultz.\n\"Maybe he just figured it was time,\" his former teammate, Patrick Crayton, said. \"We all have to. I am sure his body is beat up. He was a true professional who came to work every day and always, always showed up on Sundays. A total team leader all the way through.\"\nOf the many stories and tales told of the 15-year pro, here is one from former Cowboys linebacker/defensive end Greg Ellis you have never heard. And as much as the helmet-less catch-and-run defines Witten, this anecdote sums him up, too.\n\"He quickly gained my respect as a player because he never backed down in practice. He stepped up to every defensive end no matter how big or how fast. And he hung in there. He was so persistent and he sacrificed himself and his body for the love of the game as much as anyone I ever played with.\n\"I know that play where his helmet came off sums of his career, but there were some others. There was the time he had a broken rib and he kept playing, but the one I really remember was he broke his jaw.\n\"I don't know what year it was , but he broke his jaw and they did surgery on him and he couldn't eat. Everything had to be through a straw.\"\nWitten suffered a fractured jaw and had three plates inserted in his jaw on Oct. 6 of '03.\n\"He was losing weight, and they didn't want him to play because of that \u2014 he kept losing weight,\" Ellis said. \"So when we went to weight check in, he would sneak weights into his pockets so when he stepped on the scale it wouldn't look like his weight was down, so he would make weight.\n\"And Bill told him, 'Those guys are not going to go easy on you.' They really didn't want him practicing. So practice started and we were going at Jason, and hitting him hard. Nobody told Jason what was going on. I consider Jason a friend and after one time I hit him pretty good and he said, 'What is going on?' I just whispered to him, 'Bill told all of us to go full speed on you.' He just kinda smiled; he never said anything but he understood.\"\nWitten was inactive for the following game, and that is the only game he missed in his entire 15-year career. He returned the next week.\nThe following season, he was named to his first Pro Bowl to become the first Cowboys tight end to receive that honor since Jay Novacek in 1995.\nThere are so many other records and Bunyan-esque tales about Jason Witten.\n\"However you define a tight end, by whatever metric, he was one of the very best to ever play his position,\" Bledsoe said. \"And, as a person, honestly, he is second to none. He is truly one of the great people I ever played with.\"\nAlthough Witten has decided he has reached the age to retire, the stories about him never age.\nMight Cowboys TE Jason Witten retire now and follow Tony"}

In the United States alone, the overall cannabis market is projected to triple to $25 billion by 2025. Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the quickest growing subsets of the industry as companies offer a wide variety of CBD-based products. In the U.S., marijuana enthusiasts in this past April were even more at ease than usual after a U.S. senator from Colorado said President Donald Trump had committed that his administration's stated harder policies against cannabis would not affect the state's legal marijuana business. The industry will be interesting to watch over the summer as Canada approaches recreational legalization. Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include: Marijuana Company of America, Inc. (OTC: MCOA), PotNetwork Holding Inc. (OTC: POTN), Hemp Inc. (OTC: HEMP), Medical Marijuana Inc. (OTC: MJNA), Aurora Cannabis Inc. (OTC: ACBFF) (TSX: ACB).\nMarijuana Company of America, Inc. (OTC: MCOA), an innovative hemp and cannabis corporation, is pleased to provide an update on its New Brunswick Hemp Project with joint venture partner, Global Hemp Group Inc. (CSE: GHG/ OTC: GBHPF/ FRANKFURT: GHG) (the \"Partners\").\nThe Partners have hired Joan Parker-Duivenvoorden as fulltime project agrologist and field manager for the project. Ms. Parker-Duivenvoorden graduated from Guelph University in 1981 with a BSc (Agr) majoring in plant protection. She has over 15 years-experience with the Nova Scotia Dept of Agriculture and with the New Brunswick Soil and Crop Improvement Association (\"NBSCIA\"). While working at the NBSCA, she has developed strong ties in the farming community that will prove to be advantageous as the project expands from the initial group of four farmers to more than fifty farmers as envisioned in coming years. In addition to being responsible for the project locally, she will provide advisory services to participating farmers, will conduct on-farm research projects to properly monitor the behaviour of various hemp varieties in different environments of the region. She will also develop training materials to assist farmers who will join the project in subsequent years. One of the long-term research projects headed by Ms. Parker-Duivenvoorden will be to develop a profitable crop rotation for organic hemp, opening the way for organic CBD.\nContracts have now been signed with the initial group of four farmers, who began seeding this season's 125-acre industrial hemp crop last week. The farmers participating in the project in 2018 are located throughout the northeastern region of New Brunswick, Canada, making for a good cross section of results for research conducted on the behavior of the crop across that region. The distribution of farms will maximize the demonstration effect and will facilitate the recruitment of additional farmers in the following years. This carefully selected group of farmers will actively participate in addressing the introduction of this new crop across different regions.\nPotNetwork Holding Inc.

We are continuity, not a rupture,\u201d he declared during a speech in which he also condemned the U.S. trade \u201cblockade\u201d against Cuba and reaffirmed the island\u2019s support for Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and other longstanding Cuban foreign policies.\nHe also said he did not expect big changes in the new Cuban constitution that is to be approved next year in a referendum, and was convinced that the \u201cirrevocable character of socialism will be ratified\u201d by the vote.\nThe Cuban leader also criticized the United States for withdrawing from the nuclear agreement with Iran and warned that might have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for stability in the Middle East. His first bilateral meeting Monday was with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\nD\u00edaz-Canel also said Cuba supports the peaceful uses of atomic energy and in January became the fifth country to ratify an international agreement on the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.\nHe also heaped praise on Ra\u00fal Castro, who retains the powerful job of first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party. D\u00edaz-Canel described Castro as \u201ca father\u201d shortly after he was named to succeed Castro.\nD\u00edaz Canel also met with the president of El Salvador Wednesday morning and was scheduled to meet later with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. On Wednesday night, he was scheduled to attend what was described as a \u201csolidarity with Cuba\u201d event organized by IFCO/Pastors for Peace and the Riverside Church in Manhattan.\nThe Cuban leader held a string of bilateral meetings Tuesday with the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs director, Federica Mogherini, and the leaders of Bolivia, Panama, Angola, South Africa, Barbados, Spain and Argentina.\nThat last meeting raised eyebrows because Cuba\u2019s official news media has been attacking the Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his close ties to the Trump administration. The Cuban foreign ministry and Argentina\u2019s presidential palace gave no details on the meeting.\nThe president of Spain, meanwhile, was invited to travel to Havana for what would be the first visit from a Spanish head of state in three decades. And Panama President Juan Carlos Varela briefly mentioned Cuba during his speech to the General Assembly, urging the United States to return to warmer policies toward the island.\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez met Tuesday with his Russian counterpart, Serg\u00e9i Lavrov.

We will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance.\"\nAccording to Good Morning America, contestants will now partake in a \"live interactive session with the judges\" in lieu of the swimsuit portion. The news organization stated that participants will now be asked to \"demonstrate their passion, intelligence and overall understanding\" of the Miss America role.\nIn addition, Carlson said the organization will be \"revamping\" the evening gown portion of the competition by asking women to wear an outfit of their choice.\n\"We're no longer judging women when they come out in their chosen attire\u2014their evening wear, whatever they choose to do,\" the former Fox News anchor said. \"It's going to be what comes out of their mouth that we're interested in when they talk about their social impact initiatives.\"\nThe news comes about six months after the Miss America Organization Board of Directors called upon former contestants to help recruit new leadership. Back in December, The Huffington Post published emails allegedly exchanged between leaders of the organization that featured derogatory comments about former contestants, including comments about their weight and looks. Executive chairman and CEO Sam Haskell, chairman Lynn Weidner and president and COO Josh Randle all resigned following the scandal. Carlson was elected chairman of the organization shortly after.\n\"This is a new beginning and change can sometimes be difficult,\" Carlson said during the interview, \"but I know a lot about change. My life has worked in mysterious ways. I never thought I would be the chairwoman of the Miss America organization, but here I am and we are moving it forward and we are evolving in this cultural revolution.\"\nThe decision also comes in the middle of the #MeToo movement. In 2016, Carlson settled a reported $20 million lawsuit against former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes after she accused him of sexual harassment. Ailes, who is now deceased, had denied the allegations in a statement to The New York Times earlier that year.\n\"So, I could have never expected what would happen when I sued my former employer at Fox News for sexual harassment 22 months ago, but look what has happened,\" she said. \"Thousands of women have been inspired to know that they can stand up and speak up and their voices will be heard. And if I've been a beacon of hope to any woman in that process, it has been worth it.\"\nShe then added, \"The same is true about the wonderful Miss America Organization. We are now open, inclusive and transparent.

However, 2019 is a new year and we have a new Supreme Court that includes Justice Evan Jenkins and myself, who were elected in last November\u2019s special election, and Justice John Hutchison who was appointed by Governor Jim Justice late last year. In recent months, our State\u2019s newly constituted Supreme Court, under the direction of Chief Justice Beth Walker, has taken significant steps to \u201crecover the character\u201d of our court system.\nFirst, fulfilling our commitment to establish clear guidelines to prevent future abuses of our citizens\u2019 hard-earned tax dollars, we have adopted detailed written policies to establish needed safeguards. These policies include the placement of all court vehicles under the state\u2019s motor fleet guidelines, and adoption of an Asset Management Policy, a Purchasing Card Policy and a General Accounting policy to ensure fiscal oversight of state property, funds and purchasing by the Court. The Court has also adopted new Computer and Removable Media Policies governing state computers and related equipment.\nThese policies will help to ensure needed oversight of the purchase and use of state furnishings, vehicles, computers and property to guard against waste and avoid the type of abuses that shook our citizens\u2019 confidence in their Court system. These policies are available for public review on the Court\u2019s website.\nSecondly, we developed a frugal and fiscally responsible budget for the Court system which was adopted by the Legislature. The Court spent considerable time and effort undertaking a line by line review of its budget for the upcoming Fiscal Year beginning July 1, 2019, and reduced its budget request to the Legislature by more than $15 million or nearly 11 percent. This includes a reduction in anticipated spending of more than $5 million and an additional reduction of $10 million in requested funding made possible by the anticipated use of funds left over from previous budget years.\nThe Court worked with the Legislature in a cooperative manner this year to reduce the Court\u2019s budget from $139,759,670 for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, to $124,322,344 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1. Despite the smaller budget, the important work of our Court System will continue unabated. Through increased efficiencies and use of previously appropriated funds, the crucial work of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Magistrate Courts, Family Courts, Circuit Courts, Drug Courts and Probation Officers in all fifty-five counties throughout our state will be efficiently and adequately funded.\nThird, the Court is continuing its work to increase transparency and openness throughout our Court System. The Court is moving forward with a phased-in implementation of the Court\u2019s e-filing system to make filing and review of court records more efficient, open and accessible. In addition, the Justices have been visiting schools and other groups across our state to discuss the work of the Court, and the Supreme Court is holding oral arguments at locations outside of Charleston so that citizens can view their Supreme Court in action.\nFinally, we and our dedicated staff members have redoubled our efforts to do the job we are Constitutionally charged to do \u2014 administer justice in a fair, impartial, efficient and timely manner.

The writer of such literary masterpieces as \"Great Expectations,\" \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"A Christmas Carol\" was married with 10 children when he met the teenager, who toiled on stage with her mother and two older sisters. Dickens separated from his wife to be with Nelly, but as a \"proper\" Victorian gentleman he could never divorce and marry her. So Nelly became the \"Invisible Woman.\"\nFiennes, 51, earned Oscar nominations for the Oscar-winning best films \"Schindler's List\" (1993) and \"The English Patient\" (1996) as well as appearing in such films as \"Quiz Show,\" \"The Constant Gardener,\" \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Skyfall.\" And he scared the daylights out of audiences as Voldemort in the \"Harry Potter\" blockbusters.\nDuring a recent visit to Los Angeles, Fiennes was in high spirits when he chatted about \"The Invisible Woman\" over French press coffee in the lobby of the Chateau Marmont.\nCharles Dickens seems very much like the characters that inhabit his books \u2014 funny, warm, larger than life, romantic, tragic and flawed.\nHe's a man of contradictions. There is a sort of boyishness to him, a boyish energy. I think he could be domineering and then he had a sort of madcap quality to him as well, combined with this manic, furious work ethic. His energy for work was terrifying. He was unstoppable.\nHe also could be cruel, especially in the one scene where he sends his wife to give Nelly a gift of jewelry he brought for her.\nOf course, it's cruel, but people are cruel. We can't expect our great artists to be saints. I think he had a cruel streak. He was a dominating father. I think he was the kind of father who very rarely praised his children. He was disappointed in his sons and only one of them, Henry, went on to be professionally really successful. Even with his daughters, he was very domineering about who she should marry. There is a quote of Katie Dickens saying, \"My father was not a good man, but he was a great man.\"\nI realized watching this film I knew very little about Dickens, let alone his relationship with Nelly.\nI was ignorant about Dickens.\nYou're kidding!

Photo: Twitter.\nIn 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM.) Aside from defusing the anger and shame of many gays and lesbians \u2014 which helped to improve their mental health \u2014 the APA shift facilitated great strides in the social, cultural, political, and legal arenas in subsequent decades. As unceremoniously absurd as the overnight change of status was, it remains a stunning model of social engineering, cultural amelioration, and of what grassroots political activism can achieve. As a Jew fighting antisemitism, I find this very instructive.\nIf the APA has the power to de-stigmatize human behavior by eliminating supposed disorders, might it have the power to stigmatize and shun other behavior by adding previously unlisted ones?\nI would like to propose that if renewed research on antisemitism can more forcefully demonstrate its association with psychopathology, its institutional recognition through the APA manual may help to curb it.\nThere is indeed a body of literature that makes a good case for antisemitism as a sign or symptom of serious mental illness. To be accurate, antisemitism itself would not be the disorder, but the content of some other structural disorder, such as delusional or narcissistic personality disorder.\nFurthermore, it has been broadly proposed by several prominent researchers that racist and antisemitic feelings, thoughts, and behaviors can be a principal co-occurring symptom of psychopathology.\nNeuroscientist Mortimer Ostow has done great work in this field. Ostow conducted a major study and concluded plainly that \u201cto the question of whether there is a mental health component to antisemitism, the answer at least statistically, is yes.\u201d Through his interviews with patients, Ostow found that the more one held antisemitic beliefs, the more likely they were to harbor psychotic thinking.\nPsychologists Carl C. Bell and Edward Dunbar used a prejudice rating scale to assess and describe levels of prejudice. They too found clear associations between highly prejudiced people and other indicators of psychopathology.\nIt is time for the American Psychiatric Association to designate extreme racism as a mental health problem by recognizing it as a delusional psychotic symptom.\nTo be clear, my goal here is not to shame and stigmatize the truly mentally ill. Psychopathological antisemitism should be regarded as a cry for help, whether from a crazed gunman in Kansas City, a delusional British politician or rock star, or an abused and despairing Arab teen.\nHowever, let me be equally clear that for the social/cultural antisemite, I do believe that shaming and stigmatizing is in order, because their bigotry, willful ignorance, and misinformation are shameful and dangerous.\nWe must devise smarter, reinvigorated strategies for curbing the misplaced and deadly enmity that is antisemitism. I call on researchers, scholars, academics, and activists to consider new research with workable data, so that we may lobby the APA to help us combat the scourge of antisemitism.\nDahn Hiuni is a New York-based Israeli artist, playwright, and freelance academic.

Dan Huberty, R-Houston, would put $6.3 billion into public schools and $2.7 billion into property tax reform. The bill will likely head to the full House soon, where more than 100 have already signed on as co-sponsors.\n\"Everybody's opinion is welcome,\" said Rep. Ken King, R-Canadian, before voting to approve the bill. \"I would just hate to see the destruction of a valiant effort because somebody didn't like one little piece on it.\"\nThe initial version of HB 3 included money for districts that wanted to rate their teachers and provide the top-rated ones with more money, modeled on a Dallas ISD program that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has touted.\n\"The language we ended up with to some degree could have been construed as tied to [the state's standardized test] and created a little bit too much authority as we went forward,\" Huberty said, explaining the change in the bill.\nAt last week's first hearing on HB 3, teachers unions and educators told lawmakers they opposed that portion of the bill. They argued that although the bill didn't require districts to rate teachers based on standardized test scores, it would be difficult for them to use any other metric. And teachers unions would rather have directed pay raises for all school employees than a program directing more money only to certain teachers.\nHuberty removed that portion of the bill and instead included a section incentivizing school districts to pay teachers more to work at high-needs campuses, in rural districts or schools, or in subjects with a shortage of teachers \u2014 a more widely palatable policy. School districts that opt into this incentive program would then be subject to state evaluations.\nThe decision to remove the merit pay provision led to cheers from Texas American Federation of Teachers, the teachers union loudly opposing the merit pay portion of HB 3.\n\u201cThe rejection of merit pay sends an important signal that educator salaries should not be tied to standardized tests never intended for that purpose,\u201d Louis Malfaro, the union\u2019s president, said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut it angered at least one group that had been advocating for merit pay programs.\nHB 3 does not include an across-the-board teacher pay raise, with Huberty and Republican House Speaker Dennis Bonnen arguing school districts should instead have local control to decide how to use additional funding. The Senate already unanimously passed Senate Bill 3, which would put $4 billion toward $5,000 raises for full-time classroom teachers and librarians.\nEducators and advocates have appeared divided in their support for the two bills, which will need to be reconciled in some form later this session.\nThe new version of HB 3 also includes several other technical changes based on input from advocates and experts. It would require a school district wanting to ask voters to approve a tax hike to first submit to an \"efficiency audit\" of their financial management.\n\"This is important for transparency purposes. If you're going to go to your voters for some reason, you should prove that you've been operating as efficiently as possible,\" Huberty said Tuesday."}

He beat the ticket by saying he was inside a store getting change - an excuse tried many times thereafter.\nParking firsts have been few and far between since then. But now, parking is entering the computer age. In early June, Ann Arbor, Mich., became the first American city to order 1,700 electronic parking meters. Other cities are using computers to monitor the number of cars entering garages and to figure out how much they owe as they leave. Computers even are helping the police catch scofflaws.\nThe old-style meters still bring in a fair piece of change. Duncan Industries of Rolling Meadows, Ill., and the POM Meter Company of Russellville, Ark., the only two manufacturers of parking meters in North America (there are four overseas), have installed over 5.5 million regular meters in 47 countries. And in the United States particularly, municipalities are turning to those meters to offset declining tax bases and Federal aid cutbacks.\n''Ensuring public safety and access are still the primary motivations for using parking meters,'' said Fred Caponiti, chief of the Bureau of Parking Services in Washington, D.C. ''But you can't deny that they make a lot of money.'' Since the bureau stepped up its enforcement programs and raised its rates in 1978, annual revenues from the district's 13,000 meters have increased to $8.8 million from $3 million, and revenues from fines have gone to $27.5 million from $12 million.\nMunicipal garages are filling city coffers, too. ''About 10 years ago, cities realized that parking is a ready source of income,'' said David Ivey, executive director of the Institutional and Municipal Parking Congress, an association of suppliers and administrators of parking sites. Mr. Ivey estimates that public-sector parking - for example, at colleges, hospitals and airports - brought in nationwide revenues of $10.5 billion in 1985. (No one has collected figures for private parking.) New York City's 65,000 parking meters -the world's highest number - yielded $32 million in revenues in 1984, and an additional $100 million in fines. But there was little joy over revenues this year, as scandals rocked the city's Parking Violations Bureau.\nNew York remains the most expensive place to park. Some garages in the best section of Manhattan will charge as high as $500 a month. The city's average hourly rate is $6.08; a survey published in the New York Motorist in November 1985 showed that the average rate in eight other cities was $2.58. Not surprisingly, New York is one of the first cities to embrace the idea of condominium parking spots - a few square feet of land in a lot that can sell for $30,000."}

Matt Reeves's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, by contrast, marks a far more singular achievement, rendering its titular apes with such nuance and sophistication that it is easy to forget they are constructed out of pixels.\nThe evidence that we are entering an age of post-human filmmaking has been gathering for some time: last year's Pacific Rim, say, or this spring's Godzilla. Replace a Charlie Hunnam here or an Aaron Taylor-Johnson there with any comparably Cybexed alternative and who would notice? Even a star as effortlessly magnetic as Angelina Jolie was to some degree swallowed up by the effects deployed around her in Maleficent.\nIt is true that\u2014as was the case with this movie's precursor, Rise of the Planet of the Apes\u2014the human cast of the sequel is not particularly indelible. Aussie Jason Clarke is, at least at this juncture in his career, a better actor than he is a movie star. (He should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as \"Dan\" in Zero Dark Thirty.) Keri Russell is perfectly adequate, too (though not one-fifth as memorable as she is on The Americans), as are Kodi Smit-McPhee and a mostly-here-for-the-paycheck Gary Oldman.\nPrecisely how one should divvy up credit for the performance between Serkis and his special-effects team at Weta Digital is hard to discern. (Likewise, for Serkis's fellow ape actors.) But ultimately it's beside the point: The performers and digital artists are so utterly, intimately in sync that there's more than enough credit to go around.\nWe witness the apes conversing with a combination of sign language, grunts, and occasional English words. We're treated to a hunt with primitive spears, to the birth of a chimplet, and to a near-death by bear mauling. Mostly we just watch in awe as the apes lope majestically among the trees of Marin County. It's actually a bit of a letdown when the human beings eventually show up.\nBut show up they do. A community of survivors has settled in the ruins of San Francisco and they send a small party, led by Malcolm (Clarke) and Ellie (Russell), to restart a hydroelectric dam in the apes' territory in hopes of supplying power for the city. The plot that unfolds from this point will be familiar to anyone who's seen Dances with Wolves, or Kingdom of Heaven, or Avatar, or any of a few dozen other movies about the need for peace and understanding between races/religions/species.\nThere are decent, tolerant souls among human and ape alike, and there are also suspicious, warmongering bigots.

There was also a so-called \"invincible,\" a young woman who was happy to learn she was entitled to free health insurance.\nAll three were helped by EmblemHealth individual insurance sales representative Assata Washington.\nA lot has changed for Draggon since she signed up for Obamacare last year.\nDraggon, a real estate broker in Harlem, was able to purchase a 2014 plan that cost her nothing in premiums, after subsidies.\nBut she expects to earn more in 2015, and therefore her subsidies likely will be less robust.\nDraggon has also decided that her current plan's network does not suit her needs.\n\"Most of my providers don't want it,\" she said.\nDraggon decided to switch to an EmblemHealth silver plan that will cost her $235 a month, after the subsidy. All of her doctors accept the plan.\nDraggon said she doesn't mind the added cost. Before the launch of Obamacare, she was paying $700 a month for health insurance.\n\"I am very happy,\" she said.\nTim Heath was in for a shock.\nIn the fall, the Hudson Heights resident got a letter from New York State of Health: The plan that covers him and his wife, at a cost of $340 a month after his subsidy, will cost him $708 in 2015, the notice said.\nThe reason for the big jump: the marketplace said he is no longer eligible for financial assistance.\nIn estimating a customer's income and subsidies eligibility for the coming year, the exchange uses your most recent tax return \u2014 the return you filed for 2013.\nThis can create confusion for enrollees whose expected income in 2015 will be far different.\n\"I knew I needed professional help to navigate these complex plans,\" Heath said.\nWith Washington's guidance, Heath arrived at a more realistic picture of his projected income and expenses for 2015.\nAfter considering his options, he reenrolled in a bronze EmblemHealth plan. The cost, after the subsidy, will be $410 a month \u2014 much less than the estimate he received from the exchange.\nHis advice to others: \"I encourage people to reach out to a broker to get assistance in navigating,\" Heath said. \"There is so much information out there that provides clarity.\"\nA random walk down 125th St. has made a big difference for Rebecca Cabrera.\nCabrera happened to be in the neighborhood recently and stepped into the EmblemHealth center.\n"}

In addition to his role as a leader in the Rochester Section, Harrison Howe was the founding editor of Chemical and Engineering News and a fervent champion of industrial research and development. It was his belief that chemistry and the pursuit of chemical knowledge contribute to the betterment of society. The Harrison Howe Award is given to acknowledge and support this idea through recognition of an outstanding chemist.\nA distinguishing feature of the Harrison Howe Award is that many of the recipients have been recognized in the early stages of their careers. Linus Pauling, then just 44 years old, was the first Harrison Howe Lecturer in 1946. A complete transcript of Pauling's Inaugural Harrison Howe Lecture is available. As of 2011, 39% of Harrison Howe Award winners have eventually gone on to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. A complete listing of all of the past awardees is also available.\nThe award consists of a plaque and an honorarium. The recipient will deliver a lecture at the annual Harrison Howe Award Symposium at the University of Rochester.\nThe award will be granted to an individual without regard to nationality for outstanding contributions to research in chemistry defined in its broadest sense. The award typically recognizes a relatively young recipient with potential for further outstanding achievement.\nA complete nominating document, including: 1) a synopsis of the accomplishments of the nominee, 2) a curriculum vitae, and 3) a maximum of five reprints, should be submitted electronically to the Awards Chairman at devadmin@chem.rochester.edu. A follow-up email should be sent to Professor Bradley Nilsson to confirm receipt of the electronic nomination package.\nIn addition to the primary nominator\u2019s recommendation, a maximum of two (2) supporting letters, containing information about the candidate not provided in the nominating document, may be attached to the nomination.\nWinner must be able to attend the scheduled symposium and accept the award in Rochester, New York.\nNominations are accepted each year and are kept active for three (3) years.

In most cases, those expenses are quite modest, involving only road trips to events within Western Canada. In a few cases, the expenses are almost literally out of this world.\nThe members of the SDC don\u2019t handle the responsibilities of the committee single-handedly.

The CSG provides our national command authority with options, access and forward presence that allows for a rapid response to a wide spectrum of threats or natural disasters. Even when faced with contested waters and airspace, the composition and maneuverability of a CSG ensures survivability of the carrier while its embarked carrier air wing uses its integrated capabilities to project power, thus enabling the U.S. to continue its role as a key guarantor of peace and stability around the world.\nCSGs, typically comprised of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier (CVN) and its embarked air wing, one guided-missile cruiser , a couple of guided-missile destroyers , and a supply ship, train and deploy as a team with well-established integrated tactics, techniques, and procedures that allow for freedom of maneuver in the global commons. Operationally, the combined strength of the CSG remains vastly greater than the sum of its parts. As a complex, joint force multiplier, with command and control and organic logistical capabilities, there exists no comparable way to quickly generate the effects crucial to American diplomatic and economic interests that carrier aviation offers.\nCarrier Strike Groups provide access \u2013 access often denied or diplomatically slow to attain through other military and civilian channels. CSGs afford options to deny an adversary\u2019s objectives, preserve freedom of action, and assure access for other joint and coalition forces. While political dynamics and host nation sensitivities can restrict the use of land-based aircraft in the initial stages of conflict, CVNs and their embarked air wings can reach nearly any spot on the globe without having to ask permission. We continue to live in a turbulent and unsettled world, and the strategic options and flexibility our CSGs provide remain in high demand by our Combatant Commanders around the world.\nWhen the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant suddenly and viciously expanded across the Middle East in the summer of 2014, and the President needed immediate options to curb ISIL's advance, the George H.W. Bush Strike Group was on station in the Arabian Gulf and ready within 30 hours of being tasked. The Bush CSG was the only strike option on station for the first 10 days of the conflict and remained there for a total of 54 days as the only viable U.S. option until the order was given to conduct air and cruise missile strikes. Since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve, in fact since well before 9/11, CSGs continue to be present in that region of the world, with seamless transitions among those strike groups as they rotate in and out.\nThe continuous forward presence carriers provide around the world comes with a cost. After nearly 14 years of sustained combat operations, Naval Aviation forces must reset and recapitalize in an effort to ensure readiness in the future. The frequency and extended durations of carrier strike group deployments has accelerated the wear on the force and has led to increased maintenance and repair requirements, resulting in lengthened maintenance availability periods.

{"idx": "15714", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: SARASOTA - The state gas tax may become as antiquated as Ford's model T when it comes to dealing with modern transportation needs.\nThat was the message Florida Department of Transportation officials delivered Friday at a conference for Floridians for Better Transportation, a transportation advocacy group backed by businesses, road builders and the Florida Chamber of Commerce.\n\"The motor fuel tax has been a wonderful source of revenue since the '50s,\" said Lowell Clary, the DOT's assistant secretary for finance and administration.\nBut slow growth in the fuel tax - not just in Florida but also nationally - means there will likely be less road-building money available in a fast-growing state where the population is expected to approach 45 million residents by the mid-century. In the U.S., gas tax revenues grew by less than one-tenth of a percent through April, compared to an annual growth rate of about 4 percent just four years ago.\n\"Today, the revenues that are generated do not meet the demands,\" Clary said.\nClary said state officials noticed the recent slide about a year ago when fuel tax collections broke a 15-year trend and dipped. Last November and then in March, the DOT had to readjust its five-year road-building program to reflect a $550 million decline in anticipated revenue.\nThe financial freefall has continued. Clary said May estimates showed the fuel tax had dropped another $32 million below its March estimate.\nHe said if the decline continues, DOT officials may have to delay more road projects when they meet in the fall to review the five-year building plan. Based on the rate of the current drop, the next adjustment may be even steeper than this year's $550 million drop, Clary said.\nThe looming crisis may not be readily apparent to many motorists since the state has put an additional $17 billion into transportation projects since 2000, including a decision in 2005 to add $7.5 billion for growth-management related road needs.\nBut the downward trend will be reflected in the new state budget that begins Sunday. The DOT will spend $8.5 billion in 2007-08, down from $9.1 billion this year.\nStephanie Kopelousos, the recently appointed secretary of the DOT, said her agency has estimated that there are more than $45 billion in unfunded needs on the state's major highway system through 2030.\n\"We truly are not keeping up,\" she said. But Kopelousos and other state officials are taking steps to deal with the reality of the declining value of the fuel taxes as a means of building new roads.\nThey cited the passage of new legislation that Gov. Charlie Crist signed into law earlier this month. HB 985 bill will let the state more readily increase tolls on existing highways, including the Florida Turnpike. It also expands the turnpike's ability to issue bonds, which officials project could result in an additional $900 million in road projects.\nThe legislation also smooths the way for allowing more private companies to build and operate toll roads in Florida - a controversial but growing national trend.\nClary noted toll roads, now largely operated by the state or local public toll authorities, have already become a reality in Florida, with toll roads accounting for 91 percent of the new expressways built over the last 17 years.\nThis year, for the first time, annual toll revenues statewide topped $1 billion, meaning tolls account for more road-building revenue than the main state fuel tax,"}

But Carlene Carter was never daunted by the huge shadow her family cast, even though her mother was June Carter, wife of Johnny Cash, and her grandmother was country pioneer Maybelle Carter. Their central message: Be yourself.\nSo Carlene left home at age 15 and took that lesson to heart. In the late '70s and early '80s, she explored new wave music and roots rock with her husband at the time, Nick Lowe. She re-emerged in the '90s as part of the progressive country movement alongside artists such as Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle.\n\"I was watching this movie 10, 12 years ago about this little girl who is being abused by her stepdaddy, and all she wants to do is go to Nashville and sing 'Gospel Ship' with the Carter Family,\" Carter says. \"That old recording of that song from the Grand Ole Opry and this little girl singing it, it brought up all these emotions in me and I was sobbing. I believe in hearing that song at that moment, God spoke to me and I realized this is what moves me more than anything.\"\nIn 2003, her famous mother and stepdad both died. \"I wasn't sure if I could stand to re-enter myself into the music industry again,\" she says. \"After mom died, and I'd been through so many hard things that one year, my life was in a shambles, I had to dig deep. What do I want to do? Every time I tried to sing, it hurt, it hurt my heart. My grief was so heavy. This (Carter Family) music brought me back. The album I did before (in 2008), 'Stronger,' I wrote in a couple months. It came flooding out of me. Lots of personal stuff. And I did the 'Wildwood Flowers' musical (in Nashville), in which I was asked to play the role of my mother. I was apprehensive about channeling my mom, to act and sing like her, because her death was still fresh in my mind. But it reintroduced me to singing all that music, the harmonies of the Carter Sisters, and from then on I was on my way.\"\n\"I always intended to do a record like this, but I wanted to wait for a respectful time after mom died \u2014 I wanted it to be a celebration of our family's music, not grieving and sad,\" she says. \"It turned out to be cathartic. I wanted to try to play the style of guitar my mother played and have that be the core. I didn't want to re-create the original sound of the Carter Family. It was me myself, and Don (producer Don Was) brought the right guys (musicians) into the room with me. It was a very spiritual recording session for me. This is the first album I've done where I didn't write 80 percent of the songs. I had to wrap my head around the songs, and I didn't choose the Carter Family's greatest hits. These were songs that meant something to me personally. That's when I realized, these are mine, they're part of my heritage too. I can do whatever I want.\"\nThat freedom was fostered by her free agency. She had no record deal and financed the sessions herself from money she had inherited from her mother"}
{"idx": "15716", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Kdol Leu (AsiaNews) \u2013 Modernity has brought rapid and profound changes to Cambodian society such as urbanisation, new forms of communication and new family relations. Fascinated, and yet frightened, young people want to play a leading role in society.\nThrough her work in the field of education, the Church accompanies them and tries to protect them from the dangers of this \"new world\", where meeting and exchange are increasingly difficult.\nIn his address at the 2018 AsiaNews Symposium, Fr Luca Bolelli, a PIME missionary who has been in the Asian country for 11 years, talked about the young Catholics who are preparing to face the future, strong because of the presence of Jesus and inspired by a deep spirit of collaboration.\nI am Fr Luca, a missionary with the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME). I have been in Cambodia for 11 years. For the past nine, I have been the parish priest in the village of Kdol Leu. Right now, I am at the entrance of the church with some young people from the parish who have come to pray with me this morning.\nCambodia is a very young country. According to some statistics, the average age is just 22 years. This is due to the fact that the nation went through a long period of war, which decimated the population (seniors will certainly remember the name of Pol Pot).\nIn the 1990s there was a baby boom, which led to a large number of young people. People who come from Italy are struck by the number of children in the villages but also in the church, which is unusual nowadays among Italians. Some might compare Cambodia to the Italy of the 1960s that went through a period of reconstruction after the war and therefore saw a strong rise in the number of births.\nCambodia is at a critical juncture. In the past few years, it has been moving into the modern world from a predominantly rural society that existed for thousands of years. This has had a great impact on the people, especially the young. A few days ago, a woman told me she had lived like her mother, who had lived like her grandmother, and so on for generations. Her daughter's way of life, on the other hand, is completely different. A truly epochal change is underway, creating fears but also raising expectations. Speaking on behalf of the young people you see next to me, whom I asked to talk to me, I will try to give them a voice.\nFor them, especially those who grew up in the countryside, entering modernity means entering a new world. On the one hand, the novelty fascinates them because it leads them to new relationships and knowledge; on the other, it frightens them. The possibility of using the new means of communication like mobile phones and social media, which have taken everyone\u2019s life like a storm, puts the world in their hands. This was not possible before. Imagine that when I arrived in this village, just nine years ago, I was the only one with a mobile phone. Now, I am the one with the cheapest model. All the kids, even those from poor families, have a smartphone that, at a low cost, puts them in touch with the world.\nAs you can imagine, all this attracts them and involves them a lot. At the same time, however, it frightens them because they already see the consequences. For example, at school they see friends completely caught up in these media, wasting time and at risk of getting into dangerous situations. Like in many other parts of the world, this is happening in Cambodia as well. The"}
{"idx": "15717", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Melissa McBride plays Carol on \"The Walking Dead\" -- and had to make some terrible choices in the last episode.\nForget the scares -- this series packs a well-earned emotional wallop almost every week and none more dramatically and audaciously than in its latest shocker.\nSunday night's \"The Grove,\" penned by executive producer/writer Scott M. Gimple, is one of the best episodes The Walking Dead has ever done. And it got to the heart of why the drama works on so many levels other than just being a show about zombies -- and why it should be taken more seriously as a top-tier drama.\nArguably, no series on television uses children as effectively -- and as shockingly -- as The Walking Dead does when it tells its stories. And it has done this from the very start of the series when, out of nowhere, the zombie apocalypse spreads from a contagion and everybody is swept up in it -- everybody, meaning children and the elderly as well as the fleet-of-foot and fit-for-fighting adults. The decision to feature children prominently was not only bold but important, keeping the series rooted in realism, which is one of its greatest strengths beyond the most important one -- that this show is about the living rather than the dead.\nDuring Sunday's episode, \"The Grove,\" Gimple wrote in not one but two shocking twists. Viewers were already familiar with two young sisters: Mika (Kyla Kenedy) and the slightly older Lizzie (Brighton Sharbino). The sisters had lost their parents and were taken under the wing of series regular Carol (Melissa McBride), whose own daughter, Sophia, was turned in the earlier days of the show and, memorably, put down as a zombie in front of Carol's eyes (one in a lengthy list of emotionally wrenching scenes that The Walking Dead has pulled off with aplomb).\nInterconnected stories that run through characters as they grow are essential to making a great series. Believability and, ultimately, emotional payoff come from not only getting to know characters well, but also having them act as we might expect them to as they face adversity, change or something unexpected. That's why Carol felt it necessary to toughen up Lizzie and Mika -- she knows all too well that the meek do not survive in this new world. Truly taking care of Lizzie and Mika wasn't just about protecting them, but teaching them how to protect themselves against the \"walkers.\" And both girls have done just that in previous episodes. But Lizzie couldn't get it right in her head that the walkers were not still somehow real people.\nMika, meanwhile, was relying too much on Lizzie's older-sister protection and Carol knew that Mika had to toughen up. \"The Grove\" featured a strong scene where Mika tells kill-or-be-killed Carol that she won't kill another human, but will kill walkers. Finding traces of humanity is a theme in the series, but sometimes with all the bleakness that hope has to come from within children. The Walking Dead's worldview is often unflinching -- always has been -- so it made clear from the start that other humans can be as dangerous as the walkers. When the world goes to hell and people are lost and roaming, the kindness in our hearts wants to believe that others will help, that coming together with strangers in a similar situation will make the larger group stronger. The Walking Dead has rightly chosen to sub"}

Ford has not yet released photos of the updated car, but has given us a few enticing details. What we are most looking forward to seeing is the updated version of MyFord Touch, which gets a new graphical layout and performance tweaks.\nCadillac will have onhand its new luxury roller, the XTS. And while we've been eagerly waiting for a new sedan from Cadillac that is not a CTS variant, what is more exciting in the XTS is Cadillac's new CUE infotainment system. CNET got an early look at the system, sans car, at CTIA, but now we get to see it in situ.\nThe Subaru BRZ concept is high on our list of new, desirable cars. Jointly developed between Subaru and Toyota, it represents a departure for both companies. For Subaru, it's a new, sporty, rear-wheel-drive car. Toyota will sell it under the Scion brand, and it will probably be the first Scion model to exhibit true performance.\nWhen we reviewed the Audi A7 earlier this year, we found a near-perfect tech car. That can only get better as Audi releases the S7, the performance variant. The cabin tech in this car is already fantastic, with such innovations as Google Earth navigation. The A7 also featured Quattro all-wheel drive and an efficient engine. The S7 should have even more power and better handling.\nWe got a look at the new Porsche 911 at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt earlier this year, but this car is worth a second look. With slightly different proportions from the current model, the new 911 represents a significant update.

Amazon has previously used the lockers as advertising vehicles.\nThe Seattle tech giant also operates Amazon pickup locations, a glorified version of the lockers that are staffed by workers, and pickup locations for groceries.\nThe centralized pickup points help Amazon further speed up delivery times and offer an alternative to receiving packages at home or work, particularly for those concerned about package theft.\nE-commerce competitors including rival Walmart also offer their own package pickup locations.

A new report from iSuppli, however, suggests that Apple may actually renew its contract and remain exclusively with AT&T-though Apple may pursue other opportunities with Verizon.\n\"Speculation is rife that Apple will end its exclusive U.S. iPhone service deal with AT&T when the current contract expires in June 2010 and begin to offer phones that work with the Verizon network,\" said iSuppli analyst Francis Sideco in a statement.\n\"However, iSuppli doesn't believe this will be the case,\" Sideco added. \"The main reason Apple is likely to stick with AT&T beyond 2010 is the relatively wide usage and growth expected for the HSPA air standard used by the carrier for 3G data.\"\niSuppli expects HSPA wireless services, which include high-speed downlink packet access, or HSDPA, and high-speed uplink packet access, HSUPA, to rise from 269.1 million in 2009 to 1.4 billion in 2012. The EVDO standard used by Verizon, by comparison, is expected to grow from 2009's 145.2 million subscribers to 304.6 million in 2013.\n\"The FCC investigation not withstanding,\" said Sideco, referring to alleged pressure from AT&T for Apple to reject the Google Voice app from its App Store, \"Apple has no reason to move away from its highly successful deal with AT&T, which has already generated strong growth in iPhone sales and is expected to fuel a continued expansion in the coming years.\"\nWhile Apple may have every reason to be thrilled with AT&T, the feeling may be less than mutual these days. An Aug. 17 study by Copenhagen-based Strand Consult found that carriers that offer the enormously popular iPhone not only have not increased their revenue, earnings or market share, but in some instances are worse off for offering it. \"Some carriers have sent out profit warnings because of the iPhone,\" reported Strand Consult.\nAT&T, likewise, has spent billions of dollars updating its network and nonetheless faced criticism for its overly taxed network, as iPhone users delight in the device's data-gobbling features. This situation will be exacerbated further when, on Sept. 25, AT&T finally makes MMS messaging capabilities available on the iPhone.\niSuppli analyst Jagdish Rebello agrees that iPhone users are bogging down AT&T's network with data traffic created by the use and download of apps, but ultimately he puts the blame on AT&T.\n\"The real problem is that A&T has not found a way to monetize data traffic generated by the iPhone. With its voice service revenue on the wane, and the company unable to cash in on the increase in data traffic outside of the base data access fee, AT&T is finding it difficult to make the required investments in"}

The US has reportedly abandoned any participation in peace proceedings and is finalizing plans for air strikes. But even to those who see some sort of armed intervention as necessary, I would ask you to critically question the United States record in the region as a credible force for democracy, as a responsible and moral military and as a suitable partner for peacemaking. With the drumbeats for war building and as US warships are arriving off the Syrian coast, I urge us all to speak out, work together and collectively seek another solution before even more of Syria is destroyed.

But in the world of terrorism, no one\u2019s loyalty is ever certain. In this week\u2019s Newsweek, Joby Warrick reports on the man who left seven CIA operatives dead.\nOn Dec. 30, 2009, seven CIA operatives were killed at a U.S. base in Khost, Afghanistan, when a Jordanian double agent who claimed to have cracked al Qaeda\u2019s inner circle proved instead to be a suicide bomber\u2014in other words, a triple agent.\nThe warning signs, painfully obvious in hindsight, were obscured by two singular forces that collided at Khost on that late-December day. One was the mind of the bomber, Humam al-Balawi, a man who flitted precariously between opposing camps. The other was the eagerness of war-weary intelligence operatives who saw a mirage and desperately wanted it to be real.\nBalawi\u2019s coup as a spy came in November 2009, when, just months after the pediatrician had been recruited by Jordanian intelligence, he announced he\u2019d become the physician to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the man believed to be al Qaeda\u2019s operational commander.\nFrom Kabul to Amman to Langley, marble buildings seemed to shift on their foundations. CIA Director Leon Panetta rushed to the White House, where he recounted the startling turn of events to the administration\u2019s national-security team. Later he would repeat the briefing in a private audience with the president.\n\u201cIf we can meet with him and give him the right technology, we have a chance to go after Zawahiri,\u201d Panetta said of Balawi.\nBut as Panetta soon discovered, arranging a meeting with the CIA\u2019s new star informant was more complicated than it had first seemed. As Panetta pressed for details, an uncomfortable truth emerged: No one from the CIA had ever laid eyes on the man.\nIndeed, the CIA\u2019s files on Balawi were distressingly thin. He had been recruited by Jordan\u2019s intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, yet he lacked formal training as a spy. No one had even heard of him until January 2009, when he had been picked up by the Jordanians for posting violently anti-Western screeds on the Internet. He had turned informant after only a few weeks in the Mukhabarat\u2019s clutches, but nothing in his background suggested an aptitude for espionage. A year earlier he had been a clean-living pediatrician. Yet in a few short months he had managed to penetrate al Qaeda\u2019s inner sanctum. Yes, Balawi\u2019s stories seemed almost too good to be true. But they were also far too tantalizing to ignore.\nThey decided to bring Balawi to a U.S. base in Afghanistan, just across the border with Pakistan. Balawi\u2019s contact in the Mukhabarat, Ali bin Zeid, emailed him about meeting in Khost. It was time to pick things up a notch, he wrote.\nBalawi balked.

And \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d currently enjoying its American premiere at Yale Repertory Theatre through Nov. 17, thrives on its simplicity in physical production design, words and performance.

Rather, it\u2019s due to the way that Brook and Estienne (both credited with text and direction) use but a handful of actors and a virtually bare stage to spark our imagination.\nOne actor directly addresses the audience as our ancestors did, sitting around the proverbial fire. The five actors place David Violi\u2019s apparently random fallen branches and sticks in various positions to define specific settings on The Rep stage. This unfettered approach clears the open mind and pricks one\u2019s imagination so that, despite the play\u2019s exotic unities of time, place and action (or because of it), \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d universally speaks to theatergoers of all stripes about punishment, forgiveness and redemption.\nVioli\u2019s set greets the incoming audience with its open, bare walls stage dressed with stray components of a shattered tree. A narrator (Hayley Carmichael, one of three actors playing multiple roles) sets the scene: a small village where a young man, Mavuso (a riveting Hiran Abeysekera), has committed the \u201cunspeakable crime\u201d of patricide. Mavuso, we learn in short order from his uncle Ezekiel (an equally compelling Herv\u00e9 Goffings) is an otherwise good and honorable person, but he bashed his father\u2019s head with a rock after discovering him in bed with his own daughter \u2014 Mavuso\u2019s sister (a heart-breaking Kalieaswari Srinivasan).\nEzekiel metes out Mavuso\u2019s initial punishment as per the customs of the village before surrendering him to the local authorities. Mavuso is sentenced to 20 years in prison, which Ezekiel convinces the judge to commute. Instead of staring at four prison walls from a cell, Mavuso must look at the prison from just outside of its walls, eating whatever flies or scurries by for sustenance. He will remain outside looking in until he believes to his own satisfaction that he has served his penance.\nThough Mavuso interacts with a few characters, he\u2019s left alone most of the time with his conscience. With nothing but time to reflect, Mavuso, \u201cbeggar in infinity,\u201d mourns the loss of his father and Nadia, as well as his soul.

But this is Imaginate's 25th anniversary season and memories \u2014 his own, and other people's \u2014 keep coming to the fore. \"We've got volunteer staff with us this year who want to be involved because they saw some of our shows when they were kids themselves,\" he says, \"and for me that's a kind of validation. Because the festival is all about giving young audiences the best-made, clever and inspiring theatre we can find. And when you discover that, one morning in May, an eight-year-old watched a performance that has stuck with them ever since... Maybe changed their understanding of the world, or the people around them, maybe even changed their ideas on what they wanted to do with their life \u2014 well, yes, it's like 'join the club' because that's more or less what everyone in Imaginate has felt and wants to share.\"\nAny eight-year-olds who venture into A True Tall Tale \u2014 a Danish production that's coming to Imaginate \u2014 will certainly find their world view altered. Instead of formal theatre seating, the audience is invited to lie back in a hammock as the story of a forest adventure unfolds in projections overhead. \"It's a kind of story-telling that encourages your brain absorb what's going on in lots of different ways,\" says Reekie. \"You're listening to the words \u2014 but there are all of these wonderful visual images as well, and the feeling of being wrapped up in a hammock just seems to free up your thoughts.

{"idx": "15747", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Can President Clinton Pardon Himself?\nPresident Clinton promised this month not to pardon himself. It\u2019s surprising to see Clinton voluntarily relinquish a legal weapon, but even more surprising that he had his hands on it in the first place. Can the president really pardon himself?\nNo one knows the answer. The Constitution says that the president \u201cshall have the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\u201d This sentence, like many in the Constitution, can reasonably be interpreted in several ways. And since no court has ruled on this issue\u2013because no president has ever tried to pardon himself\u2013it remains an open question.\nThe simplest interpretation is that the president can pardon any federal criminal offense, including his own, but cannot pardon an impeachment. In other words, Clinton is free to immunize himself from criminal prosecution, but has no power over Congress.\nA competing interpretation is that the power to pardon \u201cexcept in cases of impeachment\u201d means the president cannot pardon someone who\u2019s been impeached, or at least cannot pardon the offenses which led to an impeachment. This interpretation not only prohibits Clinton from self-pardoning, it also prohibits a future president (e.g. Al Gore) from pardoning Clinton. (It was kosher for Ford to immunize Nixon, under this interpretation, because Nixon was never impeached.) The problem with this argument is that the Constitution elsewhere (Article I, Section 3) makes a distinction between \u201ccases of impeachment\u201d and subsequent criminal prosecution for the same offenses. So it\u2019s unlikely that the founding fathers were referring to the subsequent criminal prosecution when they restricted the power to pardon.\nThe last interpretation\u2013a linguistic argument\u2013is that \u201cgranting\u201d can only be done unto others, not unto oneself. So Clinton can\u2019t pardon himself, though Gore is welcome to pardon Clinton if and when Clinton is no longer president. Moreover, the Constitution clearly recognizes that conflicts-of-interest should be avoided. For instance, the Constitution prohibits Congress from voting itself a pay raise (one Congress may vote the next a pay raise, however), and it specifies that during an impeachment trial the Chief Justice, not the vice-president, should be president of the Senate. Clearly it\u2019s a serious conflict of interest if the president can pardon himself. Since the Constitution makes it clear that avoiding conflicts-of-interest is important, it makes sense to assume that the Constitution never meant to allow the president to pardon himself.\nWho will decide this issue if it ever arises? If Clinton pardons himself, and Starr prosecutes him anyway in a federal court, that judge will have to decide whether the president\u2019s self-pardon is valid. Amazingly, the judge might rule that she isn\u2019t permitted to interpret the meaning of the Constitution in this matter. This is because the Supreme Court has ruled that certain constitutional interpretations are the province of \u201cpolitical\u201d branches, not the judicial branch. (For instance, the Supreme Court refused to comment upon whether the 1993 Senate trial of Judge Walter Nixon was constitutional or not, saying that only the Senate could make that decision.) By this reasoning, only the president can interpret the scope of the presidential pardon. In other words, in such a case, the judge might actually defer to a constitutional interpretation made by the criminal defendant (who happens to be the ex-president).\nExplainer thanks Professor Harold Bruff of the University of Colorado Law School, Professors Evan Caminker and Daniel Hays Lowenstein of U"}

When we find out that another actor has gotten the job that we had pinned our hopes on, however, we often feel a sense of rejection.\nOn a personal note, I know what that feels like because as an actor I have put my heart and soul into preparing for a part only to find out the role went to someone else. Unless I start telling myself a story about what happened, it is no more than a temporary sting. The problem arises when you start believing the story about the story and start telling yourself that you are not good enough. It doesn\u2019t help when so-called \u2018experts\u2019 are continually telling us that our careers are built on this very feeling called rejection.\nIn full disclosure, I reject that an actor\u2019s career is built on a series of rejections and I advise you not to buy into this approach. Instead, I recommend you hang out with a tribe of individuals who have your best interest at heart and encourage you to create art, not fear mongering.\nAnswering the call to have your voice be heard stems from a profound need to express yourself and when you need something that strongly, it\u2019s important to realize that not everyone is going to want what you have to offer.\nI agree with Winch because anyone who has invested time and energy into preparing for an event whether it is in sport, art, business, politics or anything you are passionate about can relate to feeling rejected at times. Then again, the upside is that it is only a \u201cfeeling.\u201d Fortunately, feelings (and the pain therein) come and go, especially when we learn how to label them and hold space for them to flow through us. Once that is over, we can get on with living our lives.\nI recommend shifting this limiting belief system of feeling like you are not wanted to literally re-frame what just occurred. Upon learning you did not book the job, it\u2019s important to first feel what you are feeling. Afterward, take a moment and acknowledge what worked in the audition or the call back and savor that for a moment. Then, with specificity in hand, focus on what didn\u2019t work and then flag what can be addressed on your next audition.\nThen, be sure to celebrate the fact that you had another opportunity to express yourself, realizing that you are in a select group of actors even being considered for a role that many others would love to have had the opportunity to audition for!\nGuy Camilleri is a Venice-based actor, acting coach and poet.

That&apos;s a mark of how well and quickly the technology has been adopted by Chinese companies, who have traditionally only been able to compete on price in bidding for railway and other basic infrastructure projects in the developing world.\nThe Three Gorges Dam has been more controversial, though the government has relentlessly touted the $23 billion project as the best way to end centuries of floods along the mighty Yangtze and provide energy to fuel the country&apos;s economic boom.\nThe water level in the vast reservoir behind it hit its peak height of 574 feet (175 meters) at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, according to project operator, the China Three Gorges Project Corp.

As officials attempted to raise water levels in the reservoir last fall, at least one town had to evacuate dozens of residents after a hairline crack appeared on the slopes above homes.\nIn addition, millions have been displaced and great swaths of productive farmland sacrificed for dam and projects like it.\nCompany chairman Cao Guangjing called Tuesday&apos;s feat a \"historical milestone.\""}

But living in the collective memory of those passionate about racing would be the record-breaking feat of Thunder Snow.\nOn March 30, the Godolphin bay colt became the first horse to win the Dubai World Cup twice in the 23-year history of US$12 million (Dh44m) race.\nHis victory was a remarkable achievement for trainer Saeed bin Suroor and jockey Christophe Soumillon. While Bin Suroor stretched his record in the race for most winners by a trainer to nine, Soumillon became the first jockey to win the race back-to-back on the same horse.\nDubai World Cup Night was the high point of the season, as has been the case for many seasons in the past \u2013 not just for the racing fraternity around the world but also for Godolphin, the Dubai-based racing operation owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai.\nMeanwhile, O\u2019Shea \u2013 who had earlier become the most successful jockey in UAE history when he went past the 504-winner mark of Richard Hills \u2013 reached another milestone on Friday. He equalled Ted Durcan\u2019s record of winning seven UAE champion jockey titles.\n\u201cIt's great and I had a tremendous year,\u201d O\u2019Shea said after receiving his award in the final meeting at Meydan Racecourse. \u201cObviously it was a great tussle [with stablemate and fellow jockey Richard Mullen] last month, and to come out on top was very satisfying.\nO\u2019Shea topped the jockey\u2019s leaderboard with 48 winners and extended his all-time record to 511.

{"idx": "15760", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Ever wondered how dogs tell the time?\nIt's five o'clock, and your dog is excitedly wagging her tail and nuzzling against you. Your furry friend is hungry and seems to know that this is the hour you usually feed her. But was this performance a simple reaction to a rumbling in Ginger's tummy or are canines actually able to somehow read the clock?\nAnecdotally, many dog owners will tell you that their dogs seem to anticipate dinnertime or the hour when they regularly go on a walk. Some owners claim their dogs know these important times to within minutes, notifying them at precisely at 5 p.m. that a meal should be served, or maybe 4:49 or 5:01, occasionally 5:03, but virtually never more than 5 minutes earlier or later. It's like the dog is reading a signal, maybe from the amount of daylight or perhaps some other sense, that tells him the time. But time is a human invention, at least in the way we normally think about it in terms of seconds, minutes, and hours. Can dogs, or other animals, actually understand time in the same way that we do? \"This is actually a very hotly debated question in animal research,\" said cognitive scientist Locky Stewart, director of research at Dognition, a company that analyses canine intelligence.\nCognitive scientists are interested in the ways animals form memory, mostly because it helps us understand the way our own brains work. Researchers often break down our long-term memory into two categories. There's implicit memory, an unconscious muscle memory that we use to perform tasks we have learned and repeated many times in the past, like tying a shoelace or riding a bike. And there's declarative memory, where we store the personal experiences and factual information that make up the story of our lives.\nPavlov taught us that dogs and other animals have implicit memories, which are used for trial-and-error learning or conditioned responses. But there's still some uncertainty regarding whether or not non-human animals have declarative memory.\nResearchers are particularly interested to figure out if animals have what's known as episodic memory, or the ability to recall contextual information about past events, such as what was happening, or where and when it occurred. Stewart described this ability to think about and re-experience the past as a type of mental time travel.\nScientists have studied episodic memories in apes, monkeys, rats, bees, and some birds, including crows. Many experiments have tried to determine if these species have a \"www\" memory or the ability to recall the basic facts about an event: what, where, and when. The outline of the test for each animal is fairly simple.\nLet's say you give a chimpanzee two sealed opaque jars, each containing a treat. One jar has a non-perishing snack, something like a grape. But the other contains a treat that needs to be enjoyed within a certain time limit, like a frozen cube of juice that's going to melt. After five minutes, the chimp is given the chance to open one jar. After an hour, it can open the other.\nOnce the test has been given several times, most creatures will crack open the jar containing the disappearing treat first. They have learned by experience if they wait too long, this one won't be around anymore. They have demonstrated the three w's. What: a tasty treat. Where: inside this jar. When: within five minutes or it won't be around anymore.\nBonobos, chimps, and orangutans pass this"}

It's a tie that myself and the players are really looking forward to.\n\"The FA Cup is the best domestic cup competition in world football.

{"idx": "15763", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There are two kinds of people in the world: people who answer the question \"How are you?\" with \"I'm good\" and people who send me e-mails to say how annoyed they are with all those other people.\nIt should be \"well,\" these folks say, not \"good.\"\nThis discussion is so common in my world that I can give an answer from memory and even cite my source from memory. My response goes like this: If you look up the word \"good\" in \"Webster's New World College Dictionary,\" you'll see that, among its many definitions is \"healthy.\" That's basically the same meaning as the adjective \"well,\" which is commonly used to mean \"in good health.\"\nSo if you're healthy and want to say so, you can choose \"I am good.\" Of course, because the adjective \"well\" is more commonly used to talk about health and because so many people prefer it, it's a probably better choice. Still, \"I am good\" is a legitimate response to any health inquiry.\nBut recently, I got an e-mail that turned this whole question on its head. A reader in Pennsylvania had written to ask about \"the growing use of the word 'good' when 'well' is traditional.\" In my mind, I had already begun to pen my pat response when I got to the next sentence: \"I keep hearing more people saying, as a response to 'How are you?' the ear-jangling reply 'I'm doing good.' Or to 'How is Johnny doing in school?' the reply 'He's doing good.'\"\nThat's very different indeed. In fact, the issue this reader asked about deals with an altogether different part of speech. In this reader's example, \"well\" and \"good\" are being used as adverbs. But in the prior example, they're adjectives. Note: we're setting aside the noun form of \"good\" that means \"good works\" or \"good things\" and is grammatical in sentences like \"Do-gooders like to do good.\"\n\"Well\" is best known for its job as an adverb, so it's easy to forget it can also be an adjective. In \"I am well\" it's describing a thing \u2014 the pronoun I \u2014 so this is the adjective form that means \"in good health.\" But in \"I am doing well,\" it's not modifying a thing, it's modifying an action, and that makes it a different word: an adverb.\nWe all know that the adverb \"well\" is the best choice for modifying actions: Seth dances well (instead of good). Al is paid well (instead of good). But does that mean you can never use \"good\" to modify a verb, even in such a common idiom as \"I'm doing good\"?\nAnd what about \"I'm doing fine\"? Isn't \"fine\" also an adjective? Yet doesn't it make a much better choice than \"I'm doing finely\"?\nThere are several ways to look at this. The most important can be summed up in the question: What's the context? If you're applying for a job as an English teacher, you'd be nuts to follow \"I'm doing\" with \"good.\" But in less formal situations, it's usually fine to use idiomatic expressions \u2014 structures that, though technically ungrammatical, are common and widely considered to be acceptable.\nSo there's nothing wrong with speaking informally in certain situations.\nThat brings us to another question: Is \"I'm doing good\" really ungrammat"}

Hardly three weeks ago, the SACP contested elections on its own, working against the ANC in the Metsimaholo local government,\u201d Zuma added.\nBoth the SACP and Cosatu have called on Zuma to step down.\nThe SACP publicly criticized Zuma after he sacked former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, accusing him of crippling the country\u2019s criminal justice system.\nCosatu said it had lost confidence in Zuma to lead and unite the ANC and the country, and therefore would not allow him to speak at its events. On May Day this year, Zuma was booed by hundreds of workers in the Free State.\nHe told the ANC delegates that the conference was obliged to publicly respond to these positions by its allies, as the ANC is the leader of the alliance and the decisions to ban Zuma and call for him to step down were taken at public conferences.\n\u201cThis conference must discuss these new developments and provide direction having given due regard to proposals of SACP around the reconfiguration of the alliance in line with new conditions of struggle,\u201d Zuma said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that when we take decisions about it, we carefully think about what we are doing to our history and our objectives, that are still there.

Some members say it could cost the party in November 2008.\nAmid the swimming pools and shuffleboards, a new sense of outrage is buzzing through condo land. Democratic activist Adele Berger began to hear about it at her regular, eight-deck rummy game in Century Village, an expansive, historically Jewish community of New York retirees. \"People have been coming over and asking me, 'What's going on, Adele? What's the purpose of voting if it won't be counted?' And that's sad, that's sad.\"\nThe head of the community's Democratic club, Sophie Bock, is hearing the same thing, forcing her to reassure residents in the monthly newsletter that their presidential primary vote will count -- at least symbolically. \"I am trying to make nicey-nicey, because I can't stand it when the people say, 'I don't want to vote. My vote won't be counted.'\" Privately, however, she is as angry as her club members, so angry that she has even begun deleting fundraising e-mails from Howard Dean and the Democratic National Committee before reading them.\n\"We have been screwed so many times,\" says Berger, sitting at her kitchen table late last week, before a spread of moist marble cake and sugar cookies.\n\"Oh yes, they are screwing us again,\" says Bock, who wears a purple beret decorated with fabric flowers.\n\"That's what I just said -- right,\" Berger says.\nSuch is the mood these days in Florida, where the specter of election meddling is again rearing its head. National Democrats plan to deny the state's 4.25 million registered Democrats any delegates to the 2008 National Convention as punishment for the state Legislature's decision to move the primary date to Jan. 29, one week earlier than the party rules allow, in an effort to make the Florida vote more influential. At the same time, the political leaders in four early primary states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- have bullied the major Democratic candidates to forgo campaigning in Florida until February, effectively prohibiting voters like Bock and Berger from meeting their candidates, receiving campaign mail or even seeing a candidate advertisement on TV. \"We can listen to their debates,\" says Bock. \"But, you know, sometimes if it interferes with a card came, someone is going to play cards.\"\nIn any other state, this sort of intra-party fight might seem like little more than an inconvenience. But messing with the vote in southeast Florida is a bit like lighting a fire under a burn victim's home. The retirement communities of Broward County form the core of the state party's strength, with some of the highest Democratic margins in the nation. There are nearly 460,000 Democratic voters in the county, or about three-quarters of the total number in the entire state of Iowa. Broward County was ground zero for the Bush v. Gore presidential recount, the sight of courtroom shout-fests, dimpled chads and, finally, anguished disillusionment. In 2006, electronic voting machines in a Florida district across state failed to record a vote for Congress from 18,000 voters, a glitch that may have been due to voting machine malfunction or poor ballot design. But there was no way to investigate since the machines left no paper trail. \"We're always"}

Even when Clinton staffers clicked the malicious links Katenberg crafted, two-factor authentication \u2014 a second, failsafe password test \u2014 still kept him out of their accounts.\nAfter a day of testing on March 18, he took a different tack, striking the Clinton's campaign staff at their personal \u2014 and generally less secure \u2014 Gmail addresses. At 10:30 the next morning he carried out one last experiment, targeting himself at his own Gmail address to make sure his messages weren't being blocked.\nAn hour later he sent out a barrage of new malicious messages to more than 70 people, including one to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. By the end of the day, he'd won access to one of the most important inboxes in American politics.\nOn Friday, the U.S. special counsel said Katenberg was an alias used by Lt. Aleksey Lukashev, an email phishing specialist with Unit 26165 of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, often abbreviated GRU.\nKatenberg, who did not return multiple messages seeking comment, has been in The Associated Press' sights ever since his email was identified among a massive hacker hit list handed to the news agency by Secureworks last year.\nIt was that 19,000-line database that allowed the AP to reconstruct Katenberg's digital movements, logging every malicious link he and his colleagues created between March 2015 and May 2016.\nThe data show that the malicious emails came in waves, some 20 or 30 of them at a time, aimed at diplomats, journalists, defense contractors and other Russian intelligence targets across the world. Between the waves, sometimes only an hour or a few minutes before a major campaign, the hackers sent test emails to their own accounts to make sure they could still dodge Google's spam filters.\nKatenberg's GRU hacking group, widely nicknamed \"Fancy Bear,\" was locked in an arms race with the email giant. Every few months, Google would cotton on to the group's tactics and begin blocking its messages. The Secureworks list, along with more than 100 other phishing emails recovered from spying victims, showed how the GRU would respond by firing up a new batch of malicious websites, moving on to a new link shortening service, or trying a new brand of phishing message meant to lure its recipients into giving up their credentials.\n\"Someone has your password,\" was one particularly dire-sounding message sent by the GRU to a DNC staffer on March 25, 2016.

That prediction never came to be, but even if rates rise later this month or next year, Ralph McLaughlin, a housing economist at Trulia, doesn't think it will scare away many buyers.\nIf rates do increase, it could be as little as a quarter percent. McLaughlin doesn't expect that to have a big impact on the market, but it could temper home price growth, \"which is good news for prospective homebuyers,\" he says. \"Interest rates won't have much of an effect on the 'rent versus buy' math,\" he explains. \"Buying would still be cheaper than renting in most metros around the country.\"\nThe threat of last year's rumored rate increase propelled some prospective buyers into action, but Nela Richardson, chief economist for national real estate brokerage Redfin, doesn't see that same pattern repeating itself. \"Buyers now don't seem to be all that spurred or driven by a rate increase,\" she says. \"That lack of urgency will translate into next year's housing market. There's interest, but there's not a lot of inventory to buy.\"\nHere's a look at other real estate trends to expect heading into the new year.\n1. Cooling coastal markets. Metropolitan areas on the West Coast and in the Northeast have been hot real estate markets during the past several years, but McLaughlin says some of the country's priciest housing markets are showing signs of slowing. \"Particularly in places like San Francisco, San Jose, Southern California and also some places in the Northeast, we're finding that homes in those markets \u2026 [are] starting to slow down slightly from the previous year,\" he says, adding that home prices in those areas may also cool.\n2. Booming bargain belt. As the Northeast and West Coast cools, McLaughlin expects the \"bargain belt\" (metro areas in the South) to boom in the coming year. \"In metros like Winston-Salem, [North Carolina], we've seen the biggest year-over-year increase in how quickly homes move off the market,\" he adds.\nMichele Silverman Bedell, owner and CEO of Silversons, a residential real estate agency based in Westchester, New York, also sees buyers migrating south. \"A lot of people are thinking about selling in the Northeast,\" she says. \"A lot of baby boomers, and even young people, are thinking of moving south to be out of the cold.\" It doesn't hurt that housing is more affordable, too. Zillow reports that the median sale price for Winston-Salem was $130,150 as of Oct. 31. On the other hand, the median sale price for New York City was more than four times as much ($599,900) for that same time period.\n3. Demand for amenity-rich suburbs. As some buyers get priced out of city centers, they're looking at suburban housing \u2013 but in a different light than in the past. \"People's preferences have started to change,\" says Svenja G"}

We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. [UPDATE] Campaigns that are live and running should not be affected and are still being delivered, although reporting is currently delayed. However, advertisers may experience issues creating new campaigns and making changes to existing campaigns.\"\nGiven Facebook's importance in the digital advertising market, the outage is already causing havoc as retailers try and prepare for what is traditionally one of the biggest shopping events of the year.\n\"Considering we are 3 days out for the biggest shopping day of the year this could not have happened at a worse time. I was in the middle of setting up Cyber Monday campaigns for a client when the outage hit,\" Audet said. \"Today and tomorrow are key times for media buyers as most middle market brands typically this is when they start their campaigns for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\"\nThe outage will also likely mean there will be a huge backlog of advertisements that will require human approval - and further delays - once the system is back up and running, the source said. Facebook tends to manually review items with sensitive content or red-flag terms, such as \"feminine products, art, copyrighted stuff, similar names to a big brand, underwear with models wearing it, etc.,\" the source said.\nFacebook and Instagram (which Facebook owns) were also down for some users earlier on Tuesday."}

While he may not win the 2016 nomination, he is winning the hearts and minds of Democratic voters and Independents. And with his growing popularity, particularly among millennial voters, it has not been surprising to see some liberals dusting off red-scare tactics from the ash heap of history.\nWith this red scare in the air, it was only a matter of time until a leading liberal decided to remind everyone that \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cMarxism\u201d have produced some of the most brutal and repressive dictatorships in the world. And last week, as President Obama was making the rounds in Cuba, New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait did just that in his article, \u201cReminder: Liberalism Is Working, and Marxism Has Always Failed,\u201d in which he opines that liberalism \u201chas never been stronger than now.\u201d Considering that economic inequality is at 80-year highs, Washington is controlled by monied interests, union membership is at historic lows, and American healthcare, though the most expensive in the world, is ranked at the bottom of the developed world, it\u2019s an interesting time to be so optimistic about New Democrat liberalism.\nBut alas, surely it\u2019s better than Marxism, which Chait defines as a \u201ctheory of class justice\u201d that only respects the political rights \u201cexercised by members of the oppressed class\u201d (in other words, a brand of left-wing authoritarianism). This narrow and erroneous definition explains why half of his unfocused screed is dedicated to the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d movement in academia, which does indeed have authoritarian tendencies, but has nothing to do with Marxism, which is essentially a method of socioeconomic analysis.\nReading his piece, one could easily get the impression that all Marxists and socialists were on board with the Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union; that is to say, all Marxists (and socialists) are inherently authoritarian and anti-democratic. This is about as absurd as calling President Obama a communist.\nIn his New York essay, Chait concludes that Marxism, or socialism, \u201chas failed everywhere it has been tried,\u201d by which he means authoritarian communism has failed \u2014 essentially omitting all anti-authoritarian socialists and socialist parties from history.\nHowever, as another article from last week, \"Is Socialism Undemocratic?,\" written by Joseph M. Schwartz and published in Jacobin \u2014 a publication that Chait directed much of his invective at \u2014 points out, socialists were \u201cconsistent opponents of authoritarianism of both left and right varieties\u201d throughout the 20th century.\nSocial reforms enacted throughout the 20th century in \u201cliberal\u201d states would have never come about without strong popular movements, made up largely of socialists and Marxists.

Manhattan was released posthumously in 1973, Sedgwick has become an emblematic figure of the '60s, one who married high and low, glitter with gutter.\nThe androgynous waif was the daughter of one of America's first families, \"the Plymouth Rock Princess,\" a free-spending and emotionally troubled heiress who made tabloid headlines as the socialite who befriended Warhol, son of Polish immigrants.\nBut she was also an artist in her own right, one who for reasons unexplored in the screenplay by the improbably named Captain Mauzner gravitated to the role of muse.\nIf you believe Factory Girl (which takes its name from Warhol's \"factory,\" the studio and clubhouse where he made his art and his movies), Sedgwick's importance is as a plaything caught in a tug of war between the asexual Warhol (Guy Pearce) and the heterosexual Dylan (Hayden Christiansen). The musician is called The Musician here because Dylan's representatives threatened to sue the production.\nSedgwick's relationship with the real-life artist was emotional; unknown is whether she had any relationship with Dylan, though she was involved with his close friend Bobby Neuwirth.\nLost in the movie's trumped-up love triangle with Sedgwick as the hypotenuse between the supposedly superficial Warhol and the supposedly profound Dylan is a more compelling story. Why would a troubled beauty self-medicate with celebrity and amphetamines?\nFor Hickenlooper and Mauzner, Sedgwick is more interesting for whom she slept with than who she was. Their movie may ind"}

The resort would be the only lakeside destination of its kind in the gambling capital.

In a draft report released on Thursday, the committee said WHO performed well in many ways, but made crucial errors.\nThe group described WHO's definition of a pandemic and its phases as \"needlessly complex,\" criticized the agency's decision to keep the members of its advisory committee secret, and said potential conflicts of interest among those experts, some of whom had ties to drug companies, were not well managed.\nThe expert committee also \"found no evidence of malfeasance\" and said WHO was not influenced by commercial interests in its response to the pandemic.\nBut it warned that under WHO's health oversight, the world is not ready to handle a major health disaster in the future.\n\"The world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public health emergency,\" experts wrote.\nDespite recent progress, \"the unavoidable reality is that tens of millions of people would be at risk of dying in a severe global pandemic,\" the report said.\nThe report will be presented during a meeting at WHO later this month in Geneva before being finalized. The expert group is chaired by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine in Washington DC. WHO said it would only comment on the report when it is finalized.\nSwine flu was a mild virus and most people infected didn't need medical treatment to recover. That led some critics to suggest WHO's declaration of a pandemic was the result of collusion with pharmaceutical companies, who made millions selling vaccines worldwide.\nThose suspicions were spearheaded by groups including the Council of Europe and the medical journal BMJ, who accused WHO of relying on doctors with ties to drug companies. WHO denied pharmaceutical interests swayed their decisions but acknowledged they could have handled the outbreak better. The agency said any potential conflicts of interests were properly disclosed.\nDuring the swine flu outbreak, WHO said declaring a pandemic was based exclusively on the virus' spread, not on its severity.\nIn the expert report, scientists said WHO should also have considered how serious swine flu was in its definition. The report also noted the agency altered some of its online pandemic documents without notice or explanation, inviting suspicion. Experts also said that despite WHO sending 78 million doses of swine flu shots to dozens of countries, shipments got bogged down in bureaucracy and arrived late.\n\"It would be terribly unfair to blame WHO because it takes the whole world to respond to (a pandemic),\" said Michael Osterholm, a flu expert at the University of Minnesota, who was not on the committee. \"This report is as much a commentary on the global governance of infectious diseases as it is on WHO.\"\nThe report commended WHO for rapidly sending experts to countries needing help, identifying and monitoring the swine flu virus, and making viruses available to make vaccines within weeks of the epidemic's start.\nDavid Heymann, a former senior WHO official, said the agency should focus on ensuring people worldwide have access to pandemic vaccines in the future.\nThe expert group issued a series of recommendations, including creating a public health emergency fund of at least US$100 million."}

When there are healthy, appropriate boundaries, each person in a relationship takes responsibility for their own feelings and actions.\nHowever, when it\u2019s not clear who is responsible for what, people get blamed for things they didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t control.\nHealthy boundaries make it clear that we\u2019re each responsible for our own feelings, thoughts, and actions.\nCodependents and people-pleasers tend to absorb other people\u2019s feelings (making them their own) and take too much responsibility for making other people feel better or fixing their problems.

The professor of law in exile demands that Iran's religious leader allow democratic change -- and suggests that South Africa could offer valuable lessons.\nA year before the Iranian Revolution, a member of my family had the great privilege of praying beside you. Later, during the revolution, this anecdote became a source of great pride within our family. This relative of mine had prayed with you and yet he, like myself, was forced to go into hiding soon after the revolution.\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei casting his ballot last Friday.\nExcellency, we had not committed any crime. We merely disagreed with the repressive measures instituted by Imam Khomeini -- and that had become a punishable offence.\nI was not even 18 years old when I was forced to flee my own country. Against all the hopes of those of us who participated in the Islamic revolution, the revolution enacted a system of political violence which created an unprecedented flood of political refugees and led to the murder of thousands by a regime which claimed to liberate them from tyranny. In the 1980s, thousands of Iranians, who fought with you against the Shah, were executed, convicted by revolutionary tribunals, without legal representation, with no official charge. Among those killed were two members of my own family. One is buried in a mass grave. In 1988, in the space of a few weeks, thousands of political prisoners were given a summary hearing, slain and thrown into anonymous graves on the orders of Imam Khomeini.\nThe prisoners were asked three questions: Are you a Muslim? Did you pray this morning? And have you told us everything about your friends, so that we can assume that you will now adhere to our Shariah laws? Thousands gave the wrong answer to one or more of these questions. As a result, they now lie buried together in a huge mass grave at Khavaran in the desert outside Teheran.\nRecently, your president ordered this mass grave to be destroyed. Why did he do that? I suspect it was out of fear. Because every day weeping mothers lay flowers on that inglorious pile of earth. Imam Khomeini promised the people Islamic justice -- those mass graves testify to what that means. They are the hallmark of the theocratic regime which you have led for the past 20 years.\nThirty years ago, millions of Iranians, young people mainly, took to the streets to demonstrate for three fundamental rights. First and foremost the three basic freedoms of Azadi-e Baian, Azadi-e Qalam, Azadi-e Andish-e: the freedom of speech, the freedom to write and the freedom of thought. Secondly, the right of independence. And thirdly, they demanded the (Islamic) republic.\nAgainst our hopes we helped put a monstrous constitution in place. In the end, Imam Khomeini's doctrine of vilayat-i faqih, rule by a single ayatollah, created an unparalleled crisis for Iran and Islam itself.\nExcellency, every response you have given in the face of non-violent protest has been one of more oppression and more violence. Even in constitutional questions: the appointment of the supreme religious political leader under the vilayat-i faqih system, has led to insoluble conflict.

BUT HE CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT.\nWhen Ryan Hawblitzel pitched for John I. Leonard High this season, pro scouts were usually lining up their radar guns.\nTwenty-five scouts showed up to see Hawblitzel pitch against Forest Hill early in the season. He threw a three-hitter en route to a 5-3 win. After that, an average of 10 a game appeared when Hawblitzel was pitching.\n\"I've seen more scouts this year than any other year,\" said Eric Keller, who has sent three pitchers to the minor leagues in his eight years as Leonard's coach. \"I usually don't tell scouts that a player is good unless he is. I guess they believe me by now.\"\nHawblitzel, 6 feet 2 and 170 pounds, didn't disappoint the scouts. Using an 85-89 mph fastball, a 75 mph changeup and a wicked curve, Hawblitzel ran up a 9-2 record, had 133 strikeouts in 75 innings and posted a 1.38 earned-run average. Being picked in the June pro draft is almost a certainty.\nFor his performance, Hawblitzel has been named the Sun-Sentinel Class 3A-4A Player of the Year.\n\"I ignored the radar guns,\" Hawblitzel said. \"I concentrated on what was happening on the field, not off it.\"\nWhen Hawblitzel wasn't pitching, scouts still came snooping around. A shortstop, Hawblitzel led the district and regional champion Lancers (20-10) with a .386 batting average (32 for 83) and had 14 RBI, 27 runs scored, 10 doubles, one triple and two home runs. Particularly heroic were Hawblitzel's two doubles in the Region 6-4A final that keyed a 5-4 Leonard win after the Lancers had fallen behind 4-0.\n\"Some scouts like Ryan better as a shortstop,\" Keller said.\nHawblitzel has already signed a letter-of-intent to play at Indian River Community College. But whether he goes there or goes pro depends on how high he is drafted.\n\"If the money is right, I'll definitely go pro,\" said Hawblitzel, who has a 2.5 grade-point average (out of 4.0) and admits he's not enthusiastic about school. \"The scouts have told me I most definitely will be drafted. But how high is the question. If I get drafted in the teens, the money might not be that good. Then I'll go to Indian River.\"\nHawblitzel said he would jump at a signing bonus approaching $50,000. Then his monthly earnings might be $800-$900 a month. Included in today's standard signing bonus is a provision for the club to pay for the player's college education either in the offseason of after he leaves baseball.\nHawblitzel said he's ready for the rigors of minor league ball. \"I think I'm mature enough to handle it,\" he said. \"If it's a rough life, it's a rough life.

Alphonse Ouimet and Tony Manera.\nOuimet led the CBC from 1958 to 1967. As an electrical engineer he had helped develop an early prototype of the television machine, and had been part of the CBC, and its predecessor organization, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, from its founding in 1934.\nManera was also an engineer. He was a CBC vice-president when he took over the top job in 1993. He quit in 1995 to protest the Chr\u00e9tien government\u2019s deep cuts to the public broadcaster.\nMost other past presidents were senior civil servants, politicians or both. Pierre Juneau had significant broadcasting experience as head of the CRTC and in a senior role at the National Film Board, but he worked at an over-arching managerial, not hands-on, level.\nJuneau had to deal with the Brian Mulroney Progressive Conservative government, which was, in significant measure, ideologically hostile to the very notion of public broadcasting. To ardent free-enterprisers, including many Conservatives, the CBC is a perfect example of government spending money on something the private sector can do perfectly well.\nBut Liberals have had their own reasons to distrust the CBC. The current prime minister\u2019s father thought the CBC\u2019s French network (Radio-Canada) was a separatist hotbed.\nDuring the Chr\u00e9tien era, the business-oriented wing of the Liberal party, which held great sway at the time, argued that it was a waste of money for government to fund such frivolous activities as comedy, drama and music \u2013- or even local news, which, they said, the private sector does better. Begrudgingly they saw some use for the all-news television networks.\nIf the CBC has survived, despite the long-term ill will of much of the political class, it is probably because too many voters do not know better, and they cherish it. In proportion, that group is bigger among francophones than English speakers. There are some French network shows that attract an enormous piece of the Canadian French-speaking audience, an audience share beyond the wildest dreams of their English language counterparts. The fact is that French networks do not have to compete with the American cultural behemoth and its tsunami of English language product that floods daily across the border.\nThe current government is the first in this writer\u2019s long memory that actually seems to sincerely consider the CBC to be a priority. But that can change, easily and quickly. One of Tait\u2019s big challenges, perhaps the biggest, will be to find institutional ways to maintain this and future governments\u2019 support for the public broadcaster. She will want to lead an effort to rebuild the CBC in such a way that is sustainable and enduring.\nThe new president might start by focusing on the too often ignored area of local and regional programming.\nAt their joint news conference, both Canadian Heritage Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly and Tait loudly declaimed that local news and other local programming has now become the highest priority for the corporation.\nThose are strong words, the strongest statement this writer has heard any CBC president ever make in support of local programming.

Each season, Terrain introduces products and fresh discoveries for decorating your garden and home and winter holidays are a major time for new designs. He's got great ideas for the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations. Let's chat.\nHey everyone, thanks for joining us. We're just taking a short break from setting our Christmas Shop up in Glen Mills, so we are feeling the season.\nHow can I convince clients that they will enjoy the holidays more if they edit and simplify their decorations, the food, the parties, the gifts... the whole shebang? Some organizing clients are already on board. Instead of decorating, they go on a vacation, maybe a cruise. Others refuse to let go of even one tradition. They argue against every suggestion, as in: \"But my mother always ______.\" Or, \"My husband would be so disappointed if we didn't do ________, but he'll never help me.\" Or, \"No, I can't bear to get rid of any of these decorations, we'll just have to find room for them someplace. Maybe we'll park the car in the driveway for awhile.\" How can I encourage and convince them to keep the best and shed the rest, when the holidays are such an emotional time?\nIt sounds like you're experiencing the same problem we all do. The season is about sharing and finding a happy medium. In my family, the way we navigated through those situations was to compromise. One year my dad would get to display his over-the-top collection of family heirloom German glass ornaments (there were at least 1,000) and the next year my mom would get to display her Scandinavian birch bark ornaments for a simpler tree. Let me tell you, as kids responsible for putting up and taking down all of the ornaments we always liked the simpler tree.\nCan they do custom arrangements?\nDeer eat everything in my front yard. What can I put up my steps that would look festive for the holiday season yet not be eaten by deer?\nThis question is a dear to me. There's always boxwood, but if you want to go with something in the pine family deer typically stay away from all of the firs. A favorite of mine is abies 'koreana' commonly known as Korean fir and known for having many cones on a juvenile tree.\nI order many amaryllis bulbs every November to start for the holiday season. Any other way that I may showcase them or other plants to add?\nOne of our favorites things to show with blooming am"}

Ripley allowed engineers based at the ride-hailing company's San Francisco headquarters to quickly deny remote access to driver and customer data.\nSome Uber employees felt the system hindered legitimate investigations, while others believed its use was justified when police didn\u2019t come with warrants or specific-enough data requests, according to Bloomberg, which first reported on Ripley Thursday.\nThe program's name was a nod to the character played by Sigourney Weaver, who is prepared to annihilate herself and her environment if it means ensuring that her space alien foes die in the process.\nThe use of this tool raises questions for Uber simply because there is now a growing list of eyebrow-raising technological tactics the company has employed during its meteoric rise from Bay Area phenomenon to global powerhouse over the past nine years.\nFor example, Uber's \u201cGreyball\u201d software identified regulators who were trying to hail a ride in an attempt to collect evidence of local law-breaking. Those rides would be canceled or never arrive. Uber quickly discontinued the practice after its existence was reported by The New York Times.\nThe Justice Department also is investigating whether Uber illegally used software to track drivers of its rival Lyft. And Waymo, Google's self-driving car company, has sued Uber claiming that its self-driving car technology is based on trade secrets effectively stolen during Uber's purchase of Otto, a self-driving truck company started by former Google employee Anthony Levandowski.\nMost recently, Uber was blasted by lawmakers after a disclosure related to the Waymo lawsuit revealed that Uber paid off hackers to keep quiet about a data breech that stole the personal information of 57 million passengers and 600,000 drivers.\nThe company\u2019s hard-charging co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, resigned in June after former engineer Susan Fowler's early-2017 blog post revealed a corporate culture that was toxic to women. Kalanick was replaced in August by the former CEO of Expedia, Dara Khosrowshahi.\nBloomberg's Ripley report noted that when authorities in Montreal were seeking evidence in May 2015 that Uber had violated tax laws, the company was able to thwart that request by shutting down access to such data from San Francisco. Uber then cooperated with a second search warrant and agreed to collect provincial taxes for each ride, Bloomberg said.\nEnsign said Ripley, which was initiated before the Uber hired a team of security experts, was retired because it did not work properly. The company now uses a tool called ULocker that can remotely lock and encrypt devices. She said Uber\u2019s guidance to employees bars use of the tool where it isn\u2019t legal.\nEnsign said security tools"}

Kids and adults fly kites high in the air and try to maneuver them so their lines cut those of other kites as part of a traditional and usually harmless competition.\nTo better their chances of surviving longer and cutting competitors, many people use extra strong string and nylon lines and even lines encrusted with ground glass. When those sharp lines fall across roads they are a hazard to two-wheeler riders who can\u2019t see them. Hitting one of the lines at high speed can knock bikers off their vehicles and slit their throats.\nWhile there are injuries and deaths caused by kite strings every year, this year was particularly tragic as two of the victims were under the age of five.\nA three-year-old girl died, while traveling in a car Monday with her head sticking out of the sun roof. She sustained a neck injury and was taken to a hospital where she died, said Vijay Singh, deputy police commissioner for northwest Delhi.\nIn another incident the same day in west Delhi, a four-year-old boy died also while looking out of a sun roof and becoming entangled with a string hanging from a tree. He was taken to a hospital and died, Pushpendra Kumar, deputy police commissioner for west Delhi said.\nAlso Monday, a man traveling in west Delhi on a motorbike became entangled with a kite string and crashed his motorbike, sustaining head injuries. He was also declared dead at hospital, Mr. Kumar said.\nChandraker Bharti, Delhi's secretary of environment and forests, on Tuesday banned the sale, production, storage and supply of kite flying thread \"that is sharp or made sharp such as being laced with glass, metal or other sharp objects.\""}

{"idx": "15826", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Challenging the assertion that the Occupy movement is trying to impose a shutdown of West Coast docks without support from port workers.\n(OAKLAND) - THE OCCUPY movement is trying to strong-arm longshore workers and truck drivers into shutting down West Coast ports December 12--or so say critics of the action.\nThose organizing for action on the docks are neither the outside agitators described by employers nor the ultra-left adventurists snubbed by union leaders and their apologists. Rather, they are a grassroots network that includes rank-and-file longshore union members; nonunion port drivers; longstanding labor militants from a variety of unions; and new activists, union and nonunion, who have joined the Occupy movement to try to challenge the country's economic priorities.\nAmong those new activists is Scott Olsen, who was critically injured in a police attack on Occupy Oakland. In a statement to ILWU members, Olsen wrote: \"You do the work--THEY, the global maritime bosses, profit at your expense. Your safety and your jobs are always at stake.\"\nAnd there's no sharp divide between Occupy activists and ILWU members and other workers who are also organizing to build awareness of the community picket.\n\"I think people [on the docks] do have sympathy and feel connected with Occupy as a whole,\" said Anthony Leviege, an ILWU member for 11 years who is active with Occupy Oakland. Working alongside other Occupy activists to leaflet the docks in recent weeks, he estimated that about 50 percent of the workers he's talked to expressed some sympathy for the December 12 action.\nLeviege is active in the Occupy movement for the same reason he is active in the ILWU--to improve the lives of working people, he said. \"It's because of my background--coming from the ghettos, coming from poverty, seeing young men die early or go to jail,\" he said.\nDavid Villegas, a member of ILWU Local 13 in Los Angeles and a former truck driver in the port, also reported a sympathetic reception to the flyers for December 12. \"Everyone is wondering if they will stand for something, or fall for nothing,\" he said.\nAlso see below for more info.\nTHE DECEMBER 12 call to action is a grassroots effort to deepen the links between Occupy and longshore labor. Activists are focusing on multiple targets: EGT, the transnational corporation that's trying to eliminate ILWU jobs at a new grain export facility in Longview, Wash.; SSA Marine, the port terminal operator owned by Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs; Toll Group, a trucking employer that fired 26 Los Angeles-Long Beach drivers in October for wearing Teamster t-shirts to work; and port employers generally for their hard-line opposition to truck drivers' union organizing.\nEssentially, the call for the December 12 action reflects an effort by the Occupy movement to tap labor's social power at a key node in the capitalist system.\n\"For the first time in decades in this country, the labor movement is being confronted with a genuine movement from below, a populist movement that is challenging the very fundamentals of our capitalist system,\" said Jack Heyman, a retired member of ILWU Local 10 who is building support for the December 12 action. \"Occupy is resonating very deeply within the ranks"}

Barrie's classic fairy tale. I volunteer the whole of Brooklyn as both a cast and location (including myself).\nAccording to Deadline, the half-hour, single camera show will be more of a romantic comedy and less of a drama about a young person who kidnaps a family of children in the middle of the night. And it's set in a workplace, because if there's anything the classic story of Peter Pan needs more of, it's computer screens.\nThe series will be written by Marisa Coughlan, Rashida Jones and is allegedly inspired by Coughlan's dating experiences. The series centers around a woman in search of a \"real man\" (not a robot one) but finds herself drawn to some man-child representation of Peter Pan. And we're supposed to cheer on the decision to date an adult male who isn't ready to grow up. Not sure about that just yet, but we'll have to wait and see.\nThis will be the second Peter Pan addition to NBC, the network is currently dusting off the classic Pan musical into a brand new live show starring Christopher Walken and Allison Williams.

I haven't really missed it that much.\"\nThe cigar was assembled in an colonial-era fort overlooking the harbor in Cuba's capital, Havana.\n\"He hasn't smoked for years, but the gift we are offering him is the hard work that we have done to commemorate his birthday,\" said Castelar, whose team rolled the cigar, which had the same width as an ordinary one, on long tables in an old colonial fort that overlooks Havana's harbor.\nThe legacy of the longtime Cuban leader, accused by many of brutally suppressing dissent, is mixed.\n\"Fidel is everything. He is sport, he is culture. He is rebellion. If Cubans are rebels, it is thanks to Fidel,\" Manuel Bravo, a 48-year-old glazier, told AFP.\n\"I will remember him as a dictator,\" Martha Beatriz Roque, 71, an anti-Castro dissident who was one of 75 opponents jailed in the \"black spring\" of 2003, said to AFP. \"He is the man of 'E's: egomaniacal, egotistical, egocentric.

The revolutionary leader also survived more than 600 attempts on his life, according to Cuban officials, though that number can't be confirmed.\nThose assassination attempts include efforts by the US mafia, which was forced out of the island's lucrative hotel and gambling trades by Castro's revolution, as well as US government attempts to enlist people close to the Cuban leader in plots to kill him.\nIn a letter titled \"The Birthday\" published on Cuban state-run media on Saturday, Castro again demonstrated his defiance of the threats that accumulated against him, saying, \"I almost laughed at the Machiavellian plans of the United States' presidents.\"\nAnd while Raul"}

The forever drought could be the new normal. It's already affecting what you eat.\nThousands of years ago, when the corpses of the last mastodons and sabre-tooth cats were still sinking slowly into the tar pits, what is now California would occasionally go through droughts that often lasted centuries. Now, a Canadian researcher who calls California home says it could easily happen again. In fact, it may already be happening.\nGlen MacDonald walks down a sandy path in a park near his house about 60 kilometres northwest of Los Angeles. The grasses on the hillside are straw-dry, a \"biological tinderbox\" according to MacDonald. He stops under the trunk of a withered oak tree.\n\"It's lost almost all of its leaves already,\" he says, grabbing a branch. \"It looks in very, very poor shape, it may very well be on its way out.\"\nThe UCLA professor has spent more than two decades studying drought in California. For his latest research project, his team headed to the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California and took core samples from the bottom of Kirman Lake. This allowed them to paint a detailed climatic picture of California over the last 10,000 years.\nHe says it was exciting to see how the sections of sediment reflected climatic events that may have had repercussions as far away as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. But most troubling was evidence that in California's prehistoric past, rising temperatures locked the region into drought that lasted hundreds, even thousands of years.\n\"Could that happen again now?\" he wondered.\nAccording to his new study in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, the answer may be yes. High levels of greenhouse gases may replicate the conditions seen during periods of increased warming, causing California's climate history to repeat itself.\n\"Drought becomes, in a sense, the new climatology. It becomes the new normal,\" MacDonald says.\nAnd that \"new normal\" could persist even if California goes back to receiving average levels of rainfall.\n\"In a sense, the state is becoming drier because we are evaporating and losing that precipitation, that moisture from the soil and the plants at a higher rate. So based on temperature, we are entering a new, drier climate state.\"\nThis long-term drought is already affecting the crops California farmers are choosing to grow and export to Canadian tables.\n\"An almond is actually very similar to a peach or an apricot\u201a\" says Daniel Bays, pulling an almond off one of the hundreds of trees in his orchard in Westley, Calif.\nBays is a fifth-generation farmer who grows apricots, melons and wheat, as well as the crop that has been most often vilified since the drought began: almonds. Bays acknowledges that it takes four litres of water to grow just one almond. So one might expect that in the increasingly dry Central Valley, almonds would be the last thing a farmer like Bays would want to plant.\nBut here's the paradox: many California farmers are deciding to let their lower-value field crops die, and use what little water they have left on their expensive but water-intensive almond trees.\n\"Last year and the year before we left about 10 per cent of our total ground just unplanted just because we didn't have enough water to grow those crops,\" Bays says. \" We've put more almond"}

A new study shows that it can reduce aortic inflammation, a key risk factor for future cardiovascular events.\nCould a psoriasis drug help to reduce cardiovascular risk?\nPsoriasis, a chronic inflammatory condition, is one of the most common skin disorders in the United States. It affects more than 100 million people worldwide.\nThe skin cells of people with psoriasis multiply faster than normal, which produces raised red bumps on the skin, often on the knees, scalp, and elbows.\nThough psoriasis affects such a large proportion of adults, its causes are unclear, and it cannot currently be cured.\nOver the years, a link has been found between psoriasis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This relationship is particularly pronounced in individuals who have severe psoriasis.\nUstekinumab, sold as Stelara, is an antibody that interferes with the body's inflammatory response. It is prescribed for people whose psoriasis has not responded well to other treatments, or who cannot tolerate other available medicines.\nThe drug has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Crohn's disease.\nA new study uncovers a compound that could help to prevent and treat psoriasis: a synthetic form of vanilla extract.\nRecently, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia joined forces with a team from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\nThey wanted to measure the effects of ustekinumab on something other than skin. Their findings were recently presented at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, held in San Diego, CA.\nBecause ustekinumab reduces the inflammation associated with psoriasis, the researchers wanted to explore whether or not it could benefit heart health by reducing inflammation there, too.\nFirst study author Dr. Joel M. Gelfand, a professor of dermatology and epidemiology, explains their thought process, saying, \"The type of inflammation we see in psoriasis is similar to what we see in atherosclerosis,\" which he describes as \"a type of heart disease that involves the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and inflammatory cells in the artery walls.\"\nDr. Gelfand adds, \"Since ustekinumab blocks the specific pathways involved in both skin and cardiovascular inflammation, we wanted to test whether it can improve aortic vascular inflammation.\"\nTheir study involved 43 participants with psoriasis, of whom 21 were assigned to the control group and 22 received ustekinumab.\nThe researchers were particularly interested in one measurement: aortic inflammation, which was measured using positron emission topography and computed tomography scans. The scans took place at the start of the study and after 12 weeks.\nThe results were relatively clear-cut. As expected, more than three quarters of the participants who took ustekinumab saw significant improvement in psoriasis symptoms.\nThe most interesting changes were measured in the heart: the participants in the control group saw a 12 percent increase in aortic inflammation, whereas members of the experimental group showed a decrease of 6.6 percent.\nThat means that, relative to individuals not taking the drug, ustekinumab was responsible for"}

Linden says that Lookout identified \u201cbetween 5 and 10\u201d mobile ad companies whose technology made apps act like adware and advised them in advance that Lookout was to begin encouraging people to uninstall apps with their technology included.\nSome changed their practices, says Linden, but five did not.

The quantum of the stake will depend on the conversion price of the debentures; the price will be decided when Ather raises its next round of funding.\nVCCircle had reported last month that Ather was now looking to raise fresh capital and had hired an investment banker to arrange the fundraising.\nHero MotoCorp currently owns a 32.31% stake in Ather. The two-wheeler maker had first invested Rs 205 crore ($30.5 million then) in Ather Energy in 2016.\nThe fresh commitment from Hero takes the overall investment the startup has raised so far to around $62 million. Before Hero MotoCorp, it had secured about Rs 75 crore ($12 million) in funding from US-based hedge fund and venture capital investor Tiger Global in early 2015. Ather Energy also counts Flipkart co-founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal among its investors.\nAther Energy was founded in 2013 by IIT graduates Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain. It had initially aimed to launch the electric scooters in 2016 but faced delays because product testing took longer than anticipated.\nThe company had rolled out the first two electric scooters that it designed from scratch last month, nearly three years after its first institutional round of funding.\nThe much-delayed commercial launch of the Ather 450 and the previously unveiled variant Ather 340 marked a milestone in India\u2019s nascent market for electric two-wheelers that research firm Frost & Sullivan estimates will grow 38% by 2020 and account for nearly 60% of the total electric vehicles market.\nThe Ather 450 is priced at Rs 1,24,750 and the Ather 340 costs Rs 1,09,750, after including all taxes, insurance and registration. That\u2019s more than twice the price of most scooters in India.\nTo be sure, Ather isn\u2019t the only one looking to tap into the growing market for electric vehicles. A number of other startups have also forayed into the segment and raised funding from angel investors as well as two-wheeler companies.\nElectric bike maker Ampere Vehicles Pvt.

His father was a faculty member at the Royal College of Music and his mother was a piano teacher. Andrew showed musical aptitude at a very young age, and, while still a youth, composed short musical entertainments for his family.\nHis first musical was \u201cJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\u201d (1967). With lyricist Tim Rice, Lloyd Webber created an eclectic score to accompany the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers. Musical numbers ranged in style from Elvis-style rock to calypso and soft rock ballads. Joseph\u2019s two big songs, \u201cAny Dream Will Do\u201d and \u201cClose Every Door,\u201d became hit singles.\n\u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d (1971), another collaboration with Rice, began life as a double album. Concert tours of the \u201crock opera\u201d followed, and ultimately, a stage version emerged. \u201cSuperstar,\u201d the story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of Pontius Pilate, garnered seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Score. Mary Magdalene\u2019s song \u201cI Don\u2019t Know How to Love Him\u201d became a pop standard. The 1973 film version starred Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson.\nMichael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in Webber's \"The Phantom of the Opera.\"\n\u201cEvita\u201d (1974), based on the life of Eva Peron, also began as a concept album. Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin starred in the Broadway version. The show received numerous Tony Awards, including Best Actress (LuPone). For the 1996 film which starred Madonna and Antonio Banderas, Lloyd Webber wrote a new song, \u201cYou Must Love Me.\u201d The song earned an Academy Award for the composer.\n\u201cCats\u201d (1981), based on T. S. Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical \u201cCats,\u201d is Lloyd Webber\u2019s longest-running show in both London\u2019s West End and on Broadway. \u2026 Like \u201cJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,\u201d \u201cCats\u201d contains songs written in a variety of musical styles. \u201cMemory,\u201d the show\u2019s climactic number, is a sentimental ballad, which has been championed by singers Elaine Paige and Barbra Streisand, among others.\n\u201cSong and Dance\u201d (1982) consisted of two parts: \u201cTell Me on a Sunday,\u201d a one-woman show, and \u201cVariations,\u201d a set of variations on Paganini\u2019s famous caprice for cello and rock band.

It would have forced the State Department to alter its long-standing policy of not listing Israel as the birthplace for Jerusalem-born Americans.\nThe policy is part of the government's refusal to recognize any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem, until Israelis and Palestinians resolve its status through negotiations.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy said in his majority opinion that the president has the exclusive power to recognize foreign nations, and that the power to determine what a passport says is part of this power.\n\"Recognition is a matter on which the nation must speak with one voice. That voice is the president's,\" Kennedy wrote.\nThe ruling ends a 12-year-old lawsuit by a Jerusalem-born American, Menachem Zivotofsky, and his U.S. citizen parents.\nJustice Antonin Scalia read a summary of his dissent from the bench, saying the Constitution \"divides responsibility for foreign affairs between Congress and the president.\" Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined the dissent.\nJustice Clarence Thomas agreed with the outcome of the case, but on narrower grounds.\nThe court's consideration of the case has coincided with acute Palestinian-Israeli tension over Jerusalem and strain in Israeli-American relations highlighted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of the U.S. role in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. For his part, President Barack Obama has said he remains unconvinced by Netanyahu's efforts to clarify pre-election statements rejecting creation of a Palestinian state.\nThe status of Jerusalem has for decades been among the most vexing issues in Israeli-Palestinian relations. Israel has controlled all of Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967 and has proclaimed a united Jerusalem as its eternal capital. The Palestinians have declared that east Jerusalem will be the capital of their independent state.\nU.S. policy has long refrained from recognizing any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem and has held that the city's status should be resolved through negotiations between the parties. Congress has for years tried to push administrations of both parties to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The U.S. has never enforced the passport law, on the books since 2002.\nThe justices had Zivotofsky's case before them once before. In 2012, the court rejected lower court decisions that called the matter a political issue that should be resolved by Congress and the president without the help of the courts.\nThe federal appeals court in Washington then struck down the law as an unconstitutional intrusion by Congress on the president's authority over foreign affairs.\nCongress and the White House have argued for decades over support for Israel's position on Jerusalem.\nIn 1995, Congress essentially adopted the Israeli position, saying the U.S. should recognize a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Most aren\u2019t even driving it. In many cases where the CIO is driving a shift to the cloud, seasoned IT professionals feel they have less control than ever but, ironically, customers have higher expectations for application delivery and experience.\nSoftware vendors are switching from building desktop-based applications to software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud-based technology because it delivers significant advantages. There\u2019s no installation to build, no version control, and the customer doesn\u2019t need to download anything or wait for it be mailed to them on a CD.\nThey have a single environment on which to build and they have all the control. This is forcing different parts of a corporation to buy into cloud-based web apps such as employee management tools, social media management tools, expense and finance tools, and mileage tracking.\nBut beyond SaaS, many older developers are moving apps into platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) installations like content management systems and bespoke applications, which they manage for their clients. Increasingly, CIO\u2019s didn\u2019t pick a multi-cloud strategy, they simply woke up in the middle of one.\nSince the IT teams didn\u2019t deploy these applications, which sometimes went from a proof of concept (PoC) to a fully live deployment, this presents new challenges. The \u2018IT\u2019 environment consists of a vast array of components from a multitude of vendors, often a mix of open source software and virtualised network infrastructure from many different vendors, depending on different capabilities or deployment models in the different clouds.\nHaving an application eco-system on premises or data centre means that organisations can centralise and standardise their application delivery infrastructure. Components such as load balancer, firewall, switching and routing infrastructure are being turned on their heads as applications are being deployed with their own virtualised application delivery infrastructure.\nA per-application ADC or per-application load balancer is a deployment model that provides the ability to deliver 1:1 matching of applications with a dedicated load balancer. Irrespective of where an application is hosted it can be delivered to users and clients via a load balancer that has been configured and tuned to be optimal for the application it is delivering.\nThis model of deployment means that each application gets the optimal load balancer settings, it reduces the chance of an issue affecting other applications, i.e. it reduces the blast radius. An advanced application experience fabric provides full per-application support across virtual, cloud and hardware-based deployments. Usage-based metered licensing means the number of load balancers that can be deployed is unlimited. Payment is required only for the combined throughput used.\nUsers benefit from better analytics. All data going between their firewall, load balancer, WAF and network services depends on a single application, making troubleshooting and maintenance far easier. It also means the organisation can scale up and down faster, because it is not porting all application settings to large (or smaller) appliances.\nAdvanced vendors understand the new multi-cloud challenges and opportunities that a per-app ADC model delivers.\nMetered licensing radically reduces the cost of the traditional load balancer licensing model. Metered licensing removes the per-appliance license fee and replaces it with an aggregated consumption model based on usage across all the load balancers.\nThis means that an organisation using 2GB a month on two load balancers can"}

But the nation\u2019s air traffic system is gradually shifting to text messages for a majority of flying instructions.\nThat\u2019s a big advantage, say government and industry officials, because up until now longer and more complicated instructions like a route change for pilots of planes waiting to take off are communicated verbally, with each word laboriously spelled out in the radio alphabet.\nFor example, HARD becomes \u201cHotel Alfa Romeo Delta.\u201d And it is hard to get it right. Pilots have to write down the directions as the controller reads them \u2014 then they read them back, also spelling out each word. If there is a mistake, the controller reads the directions back to the pilot again the same way, and so on. Even when there are no mistakes, the process can eat up valuable minutes.\nIf controllers want to reroute planes around a thunderstorm, they have to contact each plane by radio to relay instructions individually. With dozens of planes waiting for their turn to get instructions, the process can take 30 minutes or longer.\nWith the new system, called Data Comm, a controller can type a few instructions into a computer, tap a key and send the message directly to the flight management computers in each plane that needs the information. Pilots read the information on cockpit display screens and decide with the push of a button whether to accept it. The controller\u2019s message is also sent directly to airline flight dispatch computers, eliminating more time-consuming steps.\nTyping errors are always a risk with text messaging, but officials said the system has built-in safeguards that cause it to reject messages with certain errors.\nSo far, Dulles controllers have been able to substitute Data Comm for voice communications for about 10% to 20% of their departures. That share will increase as airlines equip more of their planes to use the technology.\nEight U.S. passenger and cargo airlines \u2014 American, Delta, Hawaiian, Southwest, United, Virgin America, United Parcel Service and FedEx \u2014 and 17 international carriers have told the FAA they plan to add Data Comm to their planes.\nDelta estimates that Data Comm can shave one minute off the time it takes a plane to taxi for takeoff. Spread over Delta\u2019s fleet of planes, the airline says that adds up to a savings of about $20 million a year.\nThe FAA estimates Data Comm will save airlines more than $10 billion over the next 30 years and the government another $1 billion.\nThe FAA began testing Data Comm in 2013 at airports in Memphis, Tennessee, and Newark, New Jersey. At the start of this year, it was in use at five airports. The FAA says it expects the system to be in use at 50 airports by the end of the year.\nPlanes waiting to take off at airports are one phase of the Data Comm rollout. The system is already in use in for high-altitude air traffic on busy trans-Atlantic routes, but not during the high-altitude phase of domestic flights. The FAA expects to have the system ready at its air traffic centers that handle high-altitude"}

But it represents a significant uptick since the end of last year.\n\"Although the increase in the uninsured rate from the end of 2016 to Gallup's most recent update is small on a percentage basis (0.8 points), it is statistically significant given the very large sample sizes involved, and translates into nearly 2 million Americans who, apparently, have already dropped out of the insured ranks,\" a post from Gallup-Sharecare said.\nThe result comes from a survey of more than 45,000 people over the second quarter.\nGallup-Sharecare cited a few possible reasons the uninsured rate could be increasing, such as higher premiums and insurer exits from the Obamacare markets. The post also cited uncertainty in Washington as a possible factor.\n\"Uncertainty surrounding the healthcare law also may be driving the increase. President Donald Trump's executive order permitting agencies to waive or delay provisions that 'impose a fiscal burden' on individuals, as well as the prospect of a new healthcare law may be causing consumers to question whether the penalty for not having insurance will be enforced,\" Gallup-Sharecare said.\nRepublicans in the Senate are currently debating a law that would repeal major parts of Obamacare."}

His slowness to fill the multiple open positions in his strategically crucial department was pound-foolish. His put-offish approach to the news media may have been OK for running ExxonMobil, when his responsibility was to stockholders. But a Secretary of State has an implied responsibility to be transparent with the American people, and many of Tillerson's media-savvy predecessors used that responsibility to further the interests of the United States.\nBut Tillerson proved much better at the job than Trump critics predicted, mainly because of the skills that made him a corporate success \u2014 the ability to choose the best course and stick to it under conflicting pressures.\nTillerson had the fortitude to defend and protect the Iran nuclear deal, despite it being one of Trump's favorite campaign targets, because he could see through all the noise that it was in our country's best interest.

The \"moron\" incident showed Tillerson to be human, an independent thinker and too big a person to blow a small matter out of proportion.\nTrump, like every president, needs someone like Tillerson who will put the needs of a nation and the world ahead of the wants of a president.

Rather, it requires long-term planning and a healthy level of savings to boot. And while a large chunk of Americans are taking steps to build their nest eggs, there's one important piece of the puzzle most workers are missing: planning for healthcare costs during their golden years.\nOnly 12% of working adults have taken steps to address or plan for medical expenses in retirement, according to data from the Empower Institute and Brightwork Partners. Furthermore, more than half of Americans admit they know little to nothing about what Medicare costs. If your goal is to retire with a degree of financial security, you'll need to start educating yourself on the reality of senior healthcare. And the sooner you do, the better a position you'll be in to save for it.\nHow much will you spend on healthcare as a senior?\nThe amount you spend on healthcare in retirement will depend on a number of factors, the most obvious of which is your actual health. But you should still get a ballpark of what that number might look like so you can boost your savings to cover it if need be.\nThe latest projections tell us that the average 65-year-old male today will spend roughly $189,687 on medical care throughout retirement, while the average 65-year-old woman will spend $214,565. The discrepancy stems from the fact that women tend to live longer, and therefore typically require more care in their lifetime.\nIf you're wondering why that number is so high, it probably has to do with the fact that Medicare will only cover a portion of your total healthcare costs. There are a number of services, like dental, vision, and hearing, that the program won't pay for.\nFurthermore, Medicare itself isn't actually free. Rather, you'll pay a premium for Part B, which covers preventive care and diagnostics, and Part D, which covers prescriptions. Furthermore, the services that Medicare does cover typically come with a copayment, not to mention a deductible. And unless you opt for a Medicare Advantage plan, there's technically no limit as to what you might spend on healthcare in a single year.\nThere's also long-term care to worry about, especially since it's not included in the aforementioned figures. It's estimated that 70% of seniors will need long-term care in their lifetime, and the associated costs could be catastrophic. Case in point: The average nursing home stay in the country costs $85,775 per year for a shared room, and $97,455 per year for a private one. Even assisted living facilities are no bargain, costing $45,000, on average, per year.\nHowever, there is some good news among all of these very scary numbers. If you make an effort to plan and save for the costs you might eventually come to face, you can avoid having them destroy the retirement you worked so hard for.\nNow that you know what healthcare might cost you down the line, you can take steps to ramp up your savings efforts to help cover them. Currently, workers under 50 can contribute up to $18,500 a year to a 401(k), or $5,500 a year to an IRA. If you're 50 or older, these limits increase to $24,500 and $6,500, respectively. This means if you're 57 and want to retire 10 years later,"}

But this was just the first of what could be three rounds as the two will meet again at South Tahoe and could meet again for the NIAA Northern 4A championship.\nThe game also had a controversial ending as Drew Good was knocked down in the goal box after beating a defender with the ball, but no call was made. Instead of Carson received a possible game-winning penalty kick, play went on.\nBut not for long. While the scoreboard clock showed 78 total regulation minutes had been played, the official called the game, saying 40 minutes and one minute of injury time had actually been played in the second half.\nIn the end, Viking coach Christian De Leon said one could see \u201cthe amount of respect we have for each other\u201d after the contest.\nKoop, though, knew his team had plenty of other chances to win. \u201cI felt we played well the whole match from top to bottom offensively and defensively,\u201d he said.\nThanks to the play of goalie Josh Doherty, South Tahoe stayed in the game as Doherty denied several excellent Carson chances. Ironically, it was Doherty\u2019s mistake that allowed Carson to take the lead in the second half, but otherwise his play was outstanding.\nDe Leon said the score could have easily been (\u201c3-0, if not more\u201d) at one time if not for the play of Doherty.\nIn the first two minutes of the second half, Doherty tried to clear the ball, but Blake Moreland was right there to make the steal and put the ball into the net. Moreland was so excited, he took off his jersey, which drew a yellow card.\nBut the Vikings responded less than two minutes later. Andres Munos sent a long ball to the right side of the net where Gavin Chandler was there to scored on a header, tying the game 1-1.\nGood then had an excellent chance from the left side, but Doherty was there to make the save. A little later, Moises Fernandez centered the ball from the right side to Nik Marsh, but Doherty was there to disrupt the play just enough to deny the chance. Marsh had another shot that was heading into the net before Doherty made the save.\nLate in the game, Brandon Briggs, who made five saves, made a diving save on another Chandler header to keep the game tied.\nCarson had two point blank range shots in the first half. Adam Updegrove was stopped in the first two minutes by Doherty. After Chandler had a shot that hit the crossbar, Brady Roser then made an excellent kind of half scissors pass to himself with his back to the goal to beat the defender.\nBut Roser couldn\u2019t finish the shot and Doherty made the save. Doherty also denied Updegrove on another shot late in the first half. Others who took shots for Carson included John Nuthall, and Matt Tillit.\nDouglas (7-2), which was missing several key players, came back twice to pull out the win at Hug.

Florida's 60 and older population makes up more than 30 percent of registered voters, and more than 40 percent voters who cast ballots in 2006.\nWork longer, get by on less.\nThat\u2019s the Marco Rubio retirement plan.\nRubio wants to raise the Social Security retirement age.

The campaign issued a press release criticizing the ad at 10:32 a.m. on Oct. 5, 13 minutes before the Crist campaign sent out its press release announcing the ad (Apparently, the ad was posted earlier in the morning on the website YouTube).\n\"In his latest desperate attempt to say and do anything to win an election, Charlie Crist has launched a desperate false attack ad designed solely to mislead Florida voters and scare seniors about Marco Rubio's Social Security position,\" the press release starts. \"The ad falsely claims that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits to 'balance the budget on the backs of seniors.' This claim is demonstrably false.\"\nWithin 30 minutes of Crist's announcement about the new ad, conservative commentator Stephen F. Hayes had penned almost 700 words about the Crist ad in a blog post titled, \"A Desperate Charlie Crist Dishonestly Attacks Rubio,\" that regurgitates Rubio's talking points.\nAnd within three hours the world heard from former Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\"Charlie Crist should be ashamed of his false attack against Marco Rubio on Social Security. Charlie Crist is purposely trying to scare seniors in order to win votes,\" Bush said. \"The fact is, Marco Rubio will protect Social Security.

{"idx": "15884", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: There's a cheaper way to pay for major renovations when purchasing or refinancing a home.\nA little-known federal loan program will finance the purchase and more than $5,000 in renovations, with less money down and lower interest costs.\nThe program offering loans insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is known as the Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program.\nAlthough available since the 1970s, lenders only recently began offering 203(k) loans, after rules were changed to reduce their risks.\nLoans are available to individuals or investors for residential property with as many as four living units. The maximum loan is $124,875.\nMortgage bankers say it's the most affordable way to purchase and renovate the home of your dreams.\n\"You get a better house,\" said M. P. \"Pat\" Potamkin, president of Boulevard Mortgage Co., Northeast Philadelphia. \"It gives you the opportunity to repair and modernize, while spending less money up front. Your monthly payment would be a bit higher because you're getting a bigger loan.\"\nThe program allows buyers to get a run-down home at a low price and still qualify for a mortgage that includes all renovation costs. To obtain financing, the property would have to be located in a viable area, where the market value after renovation would exceed repair costs.\nBuyers save money because they avoid having to get a separate construction loan at rates about 2 percent higher than mortgages. They put down less money because 203(k) allows financing up to 100 percent of closing costs. Regular federally insured loans limit financing to 57 percent of closing costs under rules adopted July 1.\nBuyers can include up to six months' mortgage payments in the loan, so they don't have to make payments until work is completed and they move into the home.\n\"This is a good way to rehab property. You get the mortgage and construction loan in one shot,\" said Gerry Glavey, a HUD official overseeing housing development programs.\nMr. Glavey said HUD insures the loan before repairs are made. With a regular FHA loan, any repairs necessary to meet HUD requirements must be completed before HUD will insure the loan. In many cases, buyers must pay for replacing the roof or other repairs before obtaining a HUD-insured loan.\nThe 203(k) program will finance just about any type of renovation, provided the cost exceeds $5,000 and the work isn't merely cosmetic, Mr. Glavey said. Eligible projects include a new kitchen and bathrooms; adding rooms or a detached garage; new siding; and replacing plumbing, wiring and heating and air conditioning systems.\nThe program won't finance such luxuries as swimming pools and saunas. Mr. Potamkin said he has rejected several applications that included only repainting and wallpaper. But such cosmetic work can be included if plans include major repairs, he said.\nHere's how much a 203(k) loan would cost, compared with a regular HUD-insured loan, assuming a 9.5 percent, 30-year loan.\nSuppose you buy a home for $50,000 and plan $25,000 worth of renovations. The 203(k) mortgage would be $77,550, including purchase price and repairs. You would pay about $3,500 to $4,000 down,"}

Asked why Europeans in recent opinion polls held the United States in low regard as a force for peace, Bush in effect discounted the poll results as a perceptual problem for Europeans. He had made decisions he though best for the United States and the world, and it was simply unfortunate that Europeans happened not to agree with him.\nBesides, that was the past.\nSo it is.

They had it since 1948 and our family had many, many years of enjoying the waterfront to ourselves and they wanted others to one day enjoy what we had enjoyed all those years, so it was a perfect choice,\u201d she said.\nPurchased for $1.96 million in state funds earmarked for mitigating flood waters or waters that could flood key areas, the St. Johns River Water Management District served as the sale transfer agent. Meeks said Sen. Rob Bradley(R-Fleming Island) and Rep. Travis Cummings(R-Orange Park) recommended that a portion of the state funds come to Clay County so that the county could purchase and mitigate some of the land that is more prone to flooding.\nCurrently, Clay County has possession of the waterfront park, but is projected to turn it over to the Town of Orange Park in May after Mayor Gary Meeks, Pat Meeks\u2019 husband, is term-limited from public office.\nGary Meeks could not comment on the story and has stayed out of the sale to minimize any appearance of a conflict of interest.\nOnce Gary Meeks leaves office in May, the town and the county can begin the process that would finally see the land placed under ownership of Orange Park. Then, it can be developed into what Pat Meeks has always wanted it to be.\nWhen Pat\u2019s father passed away, she and her sister inherited the land and since that day, they\u2019ve been waiting for the right way to make their mother and father\u2019s dream come true. When Bradley and Cummings came knocking on her door, Meeks knew it was time.\nWhen Meeks\u2019 father purchased the land in 1948, it was a fish camp. Her family continued to use it as a fish camp, which is why Meeks has such fond memories of fishing with her family. Before her father purchased it, there was a long pier built by the Town of Orange Park where boats from all over would tie up. But, in 1944, a boat caught fire and destroyed most of the pier.\nToday, the charred pier\u2019s wooden pilings are still visible from the shore. Meeks wonders if the pier can be resurrected in some way. Regardless of what happens, she just hopes that when it gets back into the hands of Orange Park, they make her father\u2019s dream come true.\n\u201cAnd so that\u2019s why I say it was just the perfect fit when [Bradley and Cummings] came to us to suggest turning it into a park,\u201d Meeks said.\nWhile there\u2019s no guarantee, Meeks hopes that when Orange Park takes possession of the 10-acre plot of land, they allow her give input to shape what the park looks like.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to turn it into what dad always imagined,\u201d Meeks said.\nChris Rodatz, chairman of the Clay County Bicycles, Blueways and Trails Committee, said that while he has not yet heard of this development, it does sound in line with what the county is trying to do to boost nature tourism.\n\u201cWe\u2019re promoting kayaking, canoeing and everything on the water from a tour"}

The reporting notes that suspicious activity reports are not evidence of a crime and often document lawful-but-unusual activity, though such reports can help investigations.\nMueller's team subpoenaed Stephen Bannon, the former White House strategist and head of Breitbart, to testify before a grand jury, according to the New York Times. This instance is the first public reporting of a grand jury subpoena issued in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. On Tuesday, Bannon testified for 10 hours before the House intelligence committee, which also issued a subpoena to compel the former strategist to answer questions.

The Chinese government had imprisoned or killed over a dozen CIA informants since 2010. In May, the Times reported on the what was believed to be one of the worst intelligence failures in decades; officials say the losses of informants was on par with those resulting from Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen\u2019s leaking of classified information to the Soviet Union and Russia. The arrest undermines support for the alternative theory that some intelligence officers believed: that Chinese intelligence has infiltrated covert CIA communications systems.

With him were the five teen-age members of the Bar-Kays, a group which made the popular instrumental, \u201cSoul Finger,\u201d and who backed Otis on his recent tours and appearances.\nOtis was headed from Cleveland, Ohio, to a Sunday evening concert in Madison, Wisconsin. It was his first tour in the private plane he had just purchased. His plane hit the surface of the fog-shrouded lake with tremendous force, widely scattering the debris.

On Tuesday, teams of divers were still dredging the bottom of the lake in a search for the bodies.\nRedding\u2019s singing career began when he won fifteen straight Sunday night talent shows in Macon. One day he drove with a friend of his to Memphis for a recording session, cut two sides himself and was immediately a major talent. Among the many songs he was responsible for were \u201cPain in My Heart,\u201d done in a later version by some of his greatest admirers, the Rolling Stones; \u201cMr. Pitiful,\u201d a song so popular on the rhythm and blues charts that for a long time he was known as Mr. Pitiful; \u201cThat\u2019s How Strong My Love Is,\u201d another song which was picked up by the Rolling Stones.\nAmong the others, Otis\u2019 great recordings included \u201cShake,\u201d a Sam Cooke song with which he broke up the Monterey Pop Festival; \u201cI\u2019ve Been Loving You Too Long,\u201d and \u201cTry A Little Tenderness,\u201d soul ballads which he made so effective by singing the tenderest lines against driving uptempo beats.

{"idx": "15902", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: The last session of the 15th Lok Sabha brings to an end one of the most disappointing periods in the short parliamentary history of India.\nThe numbers tell part of the story: this Lok Sabha saw over 800 hours, or almost 40 percent of its scheduled time lost to disruptions; the least number of bills were passed in a full term, and some important ones without any discussion; the budget was passed last year without discussing the expenditure allocation for ministries; over 40 percent of Question Hour was lost to disruptions, implying that ministers were not held accountable for their actions. The images include that of pepper spray, blackout of proceedings, and an important bill on creating a new state passed through a voice vote.\nWhat is of even greater concern is that parliament continued to slide in the performance of some of its core roles. In a parliamentary democracy (and indeed, as per our constitution), the government is formed by the group of people (party or coalition of parties) who have the confidence of the majority of the members (in our case, the Lok Sabha).\nThis majority can be tested from time to time, by any group of MPs. Indeed, this is one of the fundamental roles of parliament - to confer legitimacy to the government. The last session of parliament saw an event when the legitimacy of the government was challenged but was not tested.\nA number of MPs brought a notice for a no- confidence motion against the government. The rules of procedure state that a minimum of 50 MPs are required to move a no-confidence motion -- this will ensure that frivolous attempts are thwarted.\nAlso, the no-confidence motion takes priority over all other business because the government's legitimacy has to be established before it proposes policies or undertakes any executive action. The Speaker counts the number of MPs to ensure that there are indeed at least 50 of them who want to move the action. Though the motion was sought to be moved in mid-December, the Speaker was unable to take the count for over three weeks of sittings, as the house was not in order and MPs were not in their seats.\nAnother important role of parliament is as a body that holds the government accountable for its actions. This is done in three main ways: asking questions in the Question Hour, through parliamentary committees, and through debate on key issues on the floor of the house. On all three counts, there could have been a much better performance. Over 40 percent of the time of Question Hour was lost to disruptions. Rajya Sabha experimented for one session with a change in the time of Question Hour to the afternoon but was not successful in reducing disruptions.\nParliamentary committees were also not very effective in bringing clarity and fixing accountability after allegations of wrongdoing -- we still do not have clarity on issues such as the 2G telecom spectrum allocation or the allocation of coal mining leases -- despite reports of the CAG pointing out lapses. As for deliberation in the house, one can count the few debates in which MPs brought out divergent perspectives and had a constructive debate.\nParliament is the only body that can make national laws. This parliament did pass some laws with far- reaching implications. These include the Right to Education Act, the new Companies Act, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, amendments to the IPC and CrPC to protect women against sexual violence, the Pension Act, the Land Acquisition Act, the Food Safety Act, the Lokpal Bill, and the Whistleblower Act"}

Cruise ships dock on the northwest edge of the town at the Rome Cruise Terminal. A second terminal, the ADM, is for ferries and other shipping services. A free shuttle bus ferries passengers between terminals and quays, and to and from the port entrance at Largo della Pace-Largo Plebiscito every 15 minutes from 7am\u201311pm. Many cruise lines and other operators offer private car (or shared shuttle) transfers to the port from Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport (from \u20ac110/\u00a397 for up to three passengers). Trains run half-hourly and take around 1hr 50min (from \u20ac11/\u00a39.70), with a change at Roma Trastevere station (trenitalia.com).\nIf you are not visiting Rome, but wish to spend time in Civitavecchia, then it is a just a few minutes\u2019 walk to the town centre from the port entrance and sights such as the Museo Nazionale Archeologico, and the Forte Michelangelo, a Renaissance fortress. In Rome many sights are widely spread and take time to walk between (see below).\nIn Rome, taxis generally operate from ranks and are difficult to hail on the street. Be sure meters are reset and running when you set off. Buses on key routes such as the #64 between the main railway station (Termini) and St Peter\u2019s are busy.

Standard tickets cost \u20ac1.50 and are valid across bus and metro networks for 100 minutes. Tickets cannot be bought on buses. Rome\u2019s traffic means taxis and buses can be slow. Walking is an option between sights in the heart of the city around the Pantheon, but it takes 40 minutes to walk from St Peter\u2019s to the Colosseum, say, or from the Spanish Steps to the Trastevere district.\nIf you\u2019re extending your cruise with time in Rome, then be sure to book hotels well in advance as the city is always busy.

{"idx": "15915", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: An occasional jump in your heart rate causes temporary changes in your body, but these changes have little if any long-term hemodynamic effect, a term that refers to how your heart circulates blood. When you exercise on a regular basis for a sustained period, your body responds in several very positive ways. One of the most significant, yet gradual changes are in your heart, with a more efficient hemodynamic response.\nRegular exercise over an extended period actually causes your heart muscle to enlarge. While the chambers inside your heart essentially remain the same size, the muscle fibers in the walls surrounding these chambers thicken and get stronger. A person who exercises on a regular basis has a much more efficient hemodynamic response creating improved circulation and greater oxygen utilization, than a person who doesn't consistently exercise. This increased efficiency occurs because the heart becomes conditioned to pump a much larger volume of blood during exercise, and it remains efficient at rest as well.\nOne measure of your heart's efficiency or your hemodynamic status is stroke volume, which is the volume of blood moved by each contraction. The cardiac output is obtained by multiplying the stroke volume by the number of contractions per minute. The harder you exercise, the greater the stroke volume. In response to the increased demands made on your heart during exercise, your faster heartbeat enables your heart to pump more blood per minute.\nA healthy resting heart rate is about 60 to 70 beats per minute, with cardiac output reaching up to 9 pints per minute. During aerobic exercise, such as running or jogging for instance, your heart rate can quickly reach 200 beats per minute, which also increases your cardiac output. This consistent hemodynamic response increases the efficiency of your circulation. Individuals in good physical condition tend to have a slower pulse at rest, yet each heart beat forces a greater volume of blood. A professional athlete can have a heart rate as low as 40 beats per minute.\nYour hemodynamic response during exercise not only increases the efficiency of your heart and circulation, it also has a positive effect on your muscles. During sustained exercise your muscles frequently and rapidly contract and relax. To do this, your muscle cells need energy to contract, and this energy is gained by burning fats and glucose provided by the bloodstream. When you exercise on a regular basis, your improved hemodynamic status causes several significant changes. A greater volume of blood is channeled through your muscles, and the muscle cells become more efficient at storing and utilizing the energy that the blood provides.\nJournal of Applied Physiology: Does Fitness Level Modulate the Cardiovascular Hemodynamic Response to Exercise?"}

He moved past Reggie Miller (320) to break the all-time record for postseason 3-pointers.\n\"It just came out of nowhere,\" said Allen, who spent the first 5 1/2 seasons of his career in Milwaukee and led the Bucks to the 2001 Eastern Conference finals. \"I think about all the guys that came before me and what I've been able to do playing this game. So many great athletes, great shooters ... I've been able to leave my mark ...

The Blueavion f1 by Bluemac provides accurate estimations of aircraft operations at unmonitored or partially monitored airports for use by airport operators and transportation agencies. Aircraft operations are supplemented by available detailed data regarding each operation for use in effective airport management, planning, funding, and community relations. The Blueavion f1 relies solely on aircraft transponder signals (ADS-B and Mode C) and once installed at an airport, runs without further customer intervention. The Blueavion f1 uses the latest technology and security, offered in flexible and customizable device configurations. The device installs at a single location on or near airport property and is combined with a Cloud-based back-end and web-portal for easy access to the data and device status information. No more scraping together pilot logs, implementing manual counts, or maintaining troublesome count methods such as pneumatic tube, acoustic, or video-based to estimate operations. The Blueavion f1 delivers total operation estimates and makes available the underlying data needed to efficiently determine fleet mix, identify high economic value operations, and help optimize the usage for airport-based aircraft. The Made-in-the-USA Blueavion f1 applies Bluemac's roadway system design for robust environmental toughness and proven reliability.\nBy applying a blended approach across ADS-B (including Mode S Extended Squitter) and Mode C transponder data combined with a proven algorithm created by and licensed from Purdue University's Purdue Office of Technology Commercialization, the Blueavion f1 can accurately estimate operations (both General Aviation (GA) and commercial) for an unmonitored or partially monitored airport without additional logging equipment or techniques. Airports should not rely on ADS-B alone for operational counts as even by the 2020 FAA ADS-B mandate, ADS-B will not have 100% penetration in GA. However, by processing Mode C data combined with ADS-B Out using Purdue's algorithm, the Blueavion f1 delivers a high level of accuracy estimating total airport operations. Unlike the various unreliable estimation techniques, earlier versions of the Blueavion f1 field trialed by Purdue University have delivered counts within a few percent of actual operations after 30 days of logging.\nThe Blueavion f1 is completely centered on the airport and not a byproduct of a more general data feed. Alternative crowd-sourced data and reports available for use by airports can cost thousands of dollars per year, yet only cover ADS-B, and are not originally intended for airport operations. Other technologies, such as acoustic and video, are also very expensive and tricky to install and maintain. Pilot logs are unreliable and typically incomplete. The Blueavion f1 is easy to install and after a short self-calibration period (no intervention required) the system delivers accurate operational counts with accompanying detailed data (when available) giving airport operators full insight into who, when, and how their airport is being utilized.\nThe Blueavion f1 provides a cost-efficient means to quantify airport operations. Only one Blueavion f1 is needed for each airport location, and the system self-calibrates upon installation. It can be installed outside of the runway and apron, typically no additional permitting or installation requirements needed \u2013 just a 360"}

Yet, every pot stock dropped following this catalyst, signalling that this monumental catalyst had become a \u201csell the news\u201d event to the market. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aurora (OTCMKTS:ACBFF) have all dropped from their pre-legalization highs.\nThis isn\u2019t the end of pot stocks. Instead, it is just a temporary pause in a long-term secular growth narrative. Once this pause is over, it will be time to buy the best pot stocks. When it comes to the best pot stocks, there is one clear winner: CGC stock.\nDue to its early market leadership, distinguished track record, biggest production capacity, widest portfolio of brands and billion dollar partnership with Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), CGC stock is by far and away the best investment in the cannabis sector. But, that doesn\u2019t make the stock a buy here and now. Instead, investors should expect all pot stocks to be choppy over the next few weeks as the legal roll-out of weed in Canada faces some inevitable road-bumps.\nEventually, those road-bumps will stabilize. So will pot stocks. At that point, fundamentals say CGC stock is a buy. Until then, though, there isn\u2019t any rush to buy the dip in a name that has already run up quite a bit.\nIn other words, patience is the key when it comes to tracking the CGC stock price. The long-term trend is positive, but investors should exercise patience in order to mitigate near-term risks.\nWeed is legal in Canada, and that is a huge thing.\nThe recreational cannabis market measured in at $6 billion in 2017. Inevitably, that number will grow as legalization prompts new people to try cannabis (read this story about first-timer Genevieve Despres). Thus, most estimates peg Canada\u2019s recreational cannabis growing to be anywhere between $6 billion and $9 billion over the next several years.\nMeanwhile, the medical cannabis market is projected to be a $3 billion annual revenue market in Canada. Thus, between the medical and recreational markets, we are talking about roughly a $10 billion annual revenue opportunity in Canada.\nWill all those sales happen legally? At first, no. But over time, yes. Just think about Prohibition in the United States. After Prohibition was repealed, a majority of sales of alcoholic beverages moved to legal channels. Today, essentially all sales happen in legal channels.\nThus, Canopy\u2019s addressable legal cannabis market in Canada should measure around $10 billion within five years. Because CGC is the market leader with the most growing capacity, a wide portfolio of brands, and a big partnership, Constellation Brands is projecting 30% to 40% market share for Canopy. Let\u2019s be more conservative and call it 20% market share. That would imply $2 billion in revenues.\nAt scale, operating margins at Canopy are projected to hit 35%. That implies $700 million in operating profits. Take out 20% for taxes. You\u2019re looking at $560 million in net profits by 2023. Throw a growth-average 20 forward multiple on that.

The shape and pace of the narrative imitates the sharp time and task boundaries of the novel.\nThe book itself is a little beauty, nice to hold with beautiful end-papers and a silk marker to hold your place.\nThe novel opens with Helen, a writer in her mid-60s (also the author's name) freshening up her spare room prior to the arrival of an old friend. Nicola has been invited to stay for three weeks because she signed up for a course of ghastly, expensive, rogue treatments for cancer at Melbourne's Theodore Institute.\nNicola is old stock Australian, hippyish, her gracious manner mixed with a touch of hauteur. She is in denial about the seriousness of her condition and insists the massive vitamin C injections, \"ozone saunas\", \"cupping\" and a compound of ground apricot stones will simply blast away her cancer. Days and nights are spent in a round of clinic-ferrying and sheet-washing - at least twice a night. Helen tries to hold her tongue as the treatments exacerbate Nicola's pain and cause loss of bodily function.\nA most appealing feature of this novel is the elegance and taut style of the narrative voice as she gives expression to large and small questions - friendship, death, tolerance, truthfulness, and the work of the day. The authentic, down-under voice sustains the work through thoughtful and dialogue sequences.\nNicola's character is less realised than Helen's, whose self-image is severely tested - \"I was supposed to be good in a crisis\". We feel her gut-taut patience at Nicola's delusions about her \"dozens of darling old school friends . . . (who'll) take me into their homes with all their hearts\" - and wash her clean after sweats and oozings."}

After taxes, I would say I lost $3 million. And I got a billion dollars of free publicity.\"\nThe USFL was founded with an explicit goal: avoid fights with the NFL. Thanks to novelty and a few marquee players, most notably the Generals' Hershel Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner, the league got off to a promising start. But by the end of the inaugural 1983 season, enthusiasm had ebbed and some cornerstone franchises were struggling.\nThat's when Trump bought the Generals.\nTo people who cared about sports, as opposed to New York development deals, Trump's name wasn't widely known. But the tryouts for the Generals' \"Brig-A-Dears\" cheerleading squad drew broad coverage, setting the stage for a media bonanza. During the first six months of his ownership, Trump's name appeared 161 times in newspapers \u2014 more than it had appeared in the prior four years.\nThe USFL bled money during its first two years. Owners overspent on talent and the league expanded at a rate that its audience could not justify. Whether fixing these mistakes would have been enough to make a spring league viable remains the subject of heated debate decades later, according to interviews with those involved at the time.\nBut even if a spring football season were viable, Trump wouldn't have wanted to be part of a league that was going to be \"low class, all third-rate players\" anyway, he said.\nTrump frequently drew attention by sparring with the NFL.\nWhen the New York Giants got into a public contract dispute with star Lawrence Taylor, Trump wired $1 million into the linebacker's bank account and signed Taylor to a future contract.\nTo get Taylor back, the Giants \"gave me a million dollars and hated me ever after,\" Trump recalls.\nWith much of the league exhausted and in debt, Trump's advocacy for a frontal assault on the NFL ultimately paid off.\nThe case ended up in front of a jury; the NFL painted Trump as the villain. Though jurors found that the NFL was a monopoly, they awarded the USFL only $1 in damages \u2014 dooming the league.\n\"What the NFL did was smart,\" Trump told the AP. \"They purely said, 'This is a Donald Trump thing, and he doesn't need the money.' \"\nThree decades after the league's collapse, many who participated in it see Trump's presidential campaign as a replay of his football days. Some in lower perches in the league said it was a mistake that Trump persuaded fellow owners to support his attempt to break into the clubby world of the NFL."}

Today's report focuses on what some call a \"local rebellion\" in Georgia, described below, but similar issues simmer on several continents.\nAt Headquarters, where UNDP has been without a head of human resources since the abrupt down-shifting of Brian Gleeson in November 2006, the complaints are referred from one office to another, eventually up to Kemal Dervis and Ad Melkert.

In a way they were always built for it, with their animated heroes and bright colors and willingness to bound through space, but the studio famous for its perfectionists seemed to take to the 3D format especially well, even when so,so many other movies out there were simply slapping on the 3D surcharge and calling it a day (we've written about lots of those over the years of this column, you may remember).\nSo does Brave continue the 3D winning streak? Does our heroine Merida, with her bows and arrows and gravity-defying red hair, truly pop in the third dimension, to the point that it's worth paying for both your 3D glasses and the kid-size ones? We're back yet again to help you answer that question, with the latest installment of To 3D or not to 3D. We go through the 3D effects point by point and figure out just how much you're getting for your money when you shell out for that more expensive ticket. Read below and let us help you decide which Brave ticket is the right one.\nBack to what we were saying about Pixar's stellar track record here-- it's hard to imagine something better suited to 3D than Brave, which isn't just an animated film (they always tend to look better in 3D), but one from the studio that's done animated 3D pretty much better than anyone. Add in all the opportunities to have Merida fire her arrow directly at the audience, and it's pretty much a lock.\nIt's always been a little unclear how much thought the Pixar people really put into their 3D effects. They go on and on about the exhaustive work put into developing the story, or the technology for something as groundbreaking as Merida's hair, but the 3D seems to always interest them less-- and I can't really say I blame them. And while there are parts of Brave that do feel carefully structured to take advantage of the 3D, there are plenty of others where it feels like a bit of an afterthought.\nThis is what I like to call the fun part of 3D, and you might call it the gimmicky part. It's when something from the screen pops out at the audience, going \"before\" the window of the screen-- think monsters or swords or anything that might jump out and try to scare you. And Brave is both a supremely silly Pixar movie and an action-packed one, giving lots of opportunities for before-the-window goodness. In the Highland Games scenes early in the film, for example, logs are tossed and balls rolled, with hordes of burly Scotsmen barreling after them. It's fun to jump out of your chair, and not distracting from the good-natured shenanigans onscreen when they use the Before the Window effect.\n\"Beyond the Window\" is pretty much opposite of before the window, referring to how the 3D affects the depth of the movie-- y'know, like you're looking through a window into a wide world that expands beyond you. Unfortunately, despite Brave's setting in the gorgeous Scottish Highlands, it doesn't have a lot of scenes of vistas or massive armies, and instead sticks to thickly packed forests and the castle where Merida and her family live. There might have been more depth in there that I wasn't seeing, for reasons we'"}
{"idx": "15935", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The idea that passion is a prerequisite to career happiness and achievement is off-base.\nSo stop worrying about passion and learn to love your job.\nYou don't need to feel anxious if you haven't found your passion -- you can find a way to be passionate about what you are doing instead.\nI\u2019ve long believed that the admonition to \u201cFind your passion!\u201d is some of the worst career advice around. It probably comes from my personal experience. I spent too many years pursuing a career in book publishing because I passionately loved books. But I did not love the jobs I had and never made much progress. The first job I truly loved was working as a marketing executive at a business services company \u2014 a job that almost no one would think you could be passionate about.\nThe idea that passion is a prerequisite to career happiness and achievement is off-base. The advice encompasses two damaging myths about passion that, like all myths, have a kernel of truth to them.\nThe first of these myths is that if you do \u201cwhat you love\u201d eventually you\u2019ll get good enough at it that you will be paid lots of money to do it. The advice that follows from this is to not worry about money as you are getting your career off the ground because it will magically fall from the sky after some unspecified period of time you spend doing what you love. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t always true. It is true that people generally perform better at tasks they like than those they don\u2019t, and high performance can lead to compensation. But plenty of people are passionate about things they aren\u2019t good at! And there are also many jobs that even the most skilled people don\u2019t make much money at (poets come to mind). The advice never seems to square those two realities.\nThe second myth is that if you find and follow your passion you will be blissfully happy every minute of your working life. \u201cDo what you love and you\u2019ll never work a day in your life!\u201d the cliched saying goes. I\u2019m here to tell you, as someone who truly, madly, deeply loves her job, that ain\u2019t true. Not even close to true. Lots of \u201cdream\u201d careers include elements that aren\u2019t fun \u2014 some are even painful. I watched a video on Facebook recently about a ballerina -- definitely on the list of passion careers. Well, this ballerina ends every day soaking her feet in a bucket of ice water \u2014 something that looks the opposite of fun. I think this myth is the most damaging because it can lead people to quit jobs that they may be quite good at and could provide them the life the want, to go off an pursue a passion that may still involve, well, work.\nMy advice is this: stop trying to find your passion and instead be passionate! Yes, I\u2019m suggesting you fake it til you make it. There\u2019s science to back up this advice. A study found that smiling can make you happy, even if you weren\u2019t before. So stop worrying about passion and learn to love your job.\nHow? Dive headfirst into your work. Figure out the parts you like the most and work to get better at them. Minimize the less-pleasant tasks, but also accept that every job \u2014 even the very best jobs \u2014 have terrible tasks and terrible days and even some terrible weeks. It doesn\u2019t mean you are destined to live a life of misery. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t mean you should quit your job in what might be a fruitless search for passion. If you can't find a way to be passionate about your current job, try some subtle shifts, either in what you do or where you do it, that could"}

There are several modules working together on the Wallarm platform, including Next Generation Web Application Firewall (NGWAF), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Active Threat Verification and FAST, according to Novikov.\n\"While FAST is a part of Wallarm platform, unlike the other modules it is also available as a stand-alone product,\" he said.\nSince the FAST 1.0 release in April, Novikov said the product has started to build a following and user base. Feedback from the initial group of customers has now helped Wallarm build the feature set for FAST 2.0. Among the major new features in FAST 2.0 are custom codeless detect definitions by customers.\n\"It's possible now to automate detection of custom issues and vulnerabilities to improve basic OWASP Top 10 and fuzzing tests,\" he said.\nNovikov said that another new feature is a Jenkins integration plugin, which enables the integration of FAST with CI/CD (continuous integration/ continuous development) systems easily. He noted that previously only API-based integration was available.\nWhile Wallarm's technology is not open source, the company is enabling its customers to request and review its source code under certain contractual conditions. Looking forward, Novikov said Wallarm will continue to improve its application security platform.\n\"We want to continue our product expansion by releasing new unique approaches to improve our signatureless detection, Active Threat Verification and fuzzing with new impressive techniques,\" he said."}

If I only have 9 cards and I set a goal of 10, my fears disappear and I find it so much easier to approach a person and strike up a conversation.\nI recently attended a Gold Coast Venture Capital Association (GCVCA) event in Boca Raton, FL and felt a little hesistant at first. I had no wingman, I was clearly the youngest in the room and the elephant in the room was obvious \u2013 97% of the people were white males. Most minorities can feel awkward at times like this because you instictively feel that you should interact with the people you most quickly identify with.\nYou scope out the room, look at the way people dress, their mannerisms, their ethnicity, listen for accents (I am Jamaican) and start narrowing down.\nLuckily I grew up in Jamaica so race has never been what I see first, even though being in America has had some negative effect in that regard.\nMy parents taught me that someone\u2019s attitude and intellectual pursuits are more likely to reflect whether or not I would get along with them than their skin colour, age or social background. I headed for the sharpest dressed people first (I was dressed in a dark blue suit, white-collar blue shirt with cufflinks and a yellow tie).\nThat night I met 3 GCVCA board members, 1 potential investor and a Jamaican who runs a strategic advisory firm. The Jamaican loved my elevator pitch and introduced me to 5 more people. I had no idea he was Jamaican when I approached him, he just looked sharp, which for me means that you mean business because I was taught to \u201cdress for success\u201d.\n1 week later he called me.\nHe had spoken to a client who was looking for ventures to invest in and wanted to get our executive summary and business plan because the client was interested in investing up to $500k if the numbers and business made sense to them. (I have also learnt that not people understand what we are trying build so not everyone is actually a good fit from an investor standpoint).\nThat contact has been helping us finetune the plan and financial projections at no cost because he loves our drive and was really grabbed by our pitch.\nIf I had not set that goal of 15 cards for that night, I could very well never have approached him and benefitted from all of this.\nGoal-setting in life is always good so use it to improve your networking skills, especially if you are a shy person.\np.s.

Obama must then wait 90 days before he can apply his signature and send the agreement to Capitol Hill, under the terms of \u201cfast-track\u201d trade legislation approved by Congress in the spring.\nThe president and his top aides are preparing a public relations blitz in the coming weeks to sell the specifics of the deal to the public, with Obama highlighting the economic and foreign policy implications during a trip to Asia later this month.\nBut the fierce political fight waged in the spring over Obama\u2019s trade agenda is ramping up again on both sides of the aisle. The TPP accord has been thrust into the 2016 campaign for the White House. Leading candidates, including Democratic hopefuls Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Republican Donald Trump, have publicly opposed the pact.\nMany of the main flashpoints in the document have emerged in the past several months with leaks of draft portions of the text, including the creation of an international tribunal to settle disputes from multinational corporations, protections for patent for biologic drugs, limitations on tobacco companies to access the tribunals and the terms governing currency ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion, which are not contained in the main agreement.\nThe TPP agreement addresses tariff reductions for agriculture and automobiles, as well as intellectual-property rights for movies and pharmaceutical drugs, the free flow of information on the Internet, wildlife conservation, online commerce and dispute settlement practices for multinational corporations.\nFacing fierce opposition from large swaths of the Democratic Party, Obama has sought to overcome the deep-seated skepticism from labor unions and progressives over past trade deals by pledging that the TPP will establish strong, enforceable protections for workers and the environment.\nThe labor chapter of the agreement requires member nations to live up to internationally recognized standards, including ability to join unions and collectively bargain, the abolition of child labor and forced labor, and freedom from employment discrimination.\nBut administration officials said the deal goes even further with three nations that are the most harsh on workers\u2019 rights, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, each of which agreed to separate compliance plans with the United States that are tied to the overall TPP accord.\nBy the time the TPP goes into effect two years from final ratification, the three countries will be required to change their laws to allow trade unions to form and operate freely, to improve protections for foreign workers and those who may have been illegally trafficked, and to outlaw employment discrimination. The Malaysia agreement also requires that subcontracting not be used to undermine collective bargaining, which has hurt the effectiveness of such labor compacts in the past, but the Vietnam agreement does not.\nLabor union leaders remain skeptical.

High-ranking space agency and military officials listened in the audience.\nFuqua, an Altha Democrat who is chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee, suggested instead that NASA and the Air Force set long- term goals and work toward them.\nThe four-day congress includes panel discussions, presentations of technical reports and a \"meet the astronauts\" session at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the Galaxy Theatre at Kennedy Space Center's Spaceport USA.\nThe government in-fighting began last year when the Air Force requested 10 expendable rockets, two a year to be delivered starting in 1988. The request was approved, and the Air Force decided to buy Titan 34-D7 rockets.\nIn their request for the rockets, Air Force officials said the military will continue to use the space shuttle but needs the rockets to ensure immediate access to space in case a shuttle isn't available.\nNASA had planned the shuttle as the nation's only access to space, and angry agency officials accused the Air Force of trying to undermine the shuttle program.\nThe problem was eased by a presidential directive earlier this year that instructed the Defense Department to work with NASA to make sure the shuttle program has enough business for up to 24 missions a year later this decade. The directive stipulated that military payloads make up at least one-third of shuttle missions when that launch rate begins.\n\"We believe the eight per year is a level that's appropriate to us,\" said Lt. Gen. Forrest McCartney, commander of the Air Force Space Division.\nHe said the controversy has been blown out of proportion and that \"we didn't notice there was a big problem.\"\nMilitary space officials who participated in a panel discussion Tuesday said tight security is needed on military shuttle missions and will continue. The Air Force said nothing about the secret payload launched from the shuttle in January, but it was widely reported to be a $300 million spy satellite put into orbit above the equator south of the Soviet Union.\nThe shuttle security guidelines were the same that have been used for years for secret military rocket launches, McCartney said.\n\"We think those guidelines are appropriate, we think they are absolutely essential for national defense.

It is in the Middle East that the legacy of the Obama administration can be judged to be an abysmal failure.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s signature \u201cachievement\u201d in the Middle East has been the Iran nuclear deal. Its future, much like the future of Obamacare, is questionable. It too might be altered, or replaced. It certainly won\u2019t have the concessionary elements the Obama administration threw into the deal. The Trump administration will not have any \u201clove lost\u201d for the Iranians, nor tolerance for Tehran\u2019s cheating or its arrogant terroristic behavior.\nPresident Obama visited Turkey and Egypt but snubbed Israel on this trip. Moreover, he did not speak of the Jews in the Arab world that were expelled from their ancient homes in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, etc. Nor did he admonish the Arab world, including Egypt for not absorbing as equal citizens the Palestinian refugees as Israel has done with Jewish refugees from Arab countries. He neglected to mention that Israeli checkpoints and security barriers exist, to prevent the killing of innocent Israeli civilians by Palestinian terrorists.\nPresident Obama threw the pro-western Mubarak \u201cunder the bus,\u201d supported Morsi, a radical Islamist and authoritarian president, and condemned the anti-Islamist coup by General Al-Sisi. Egypt was clearly alienated by the Obama administration. Saudi Arabia, the Arab Gulf states, and Israel, likewise resented Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, which insured Iran a nuclear bomb in a decade if not sooner.\nBack in 2009, following the rigged Iranian elections, millions of Iranians begged Obama with placards that read \u201cObama are you with them (the Ayatollahs Regime) or with us.\u201d Obama ignored their pleas for democracy and human rights. Yet, the Obama administration intervened in Libya to bring down a tyrant named Gaddafi who toed a pro-western line and gave up his nuclear ambitions to please the West. The result of that intervention has been the murder of a U.S. ambassador, and total chaos in the country now dominated by Islamists.\nIn the Syrian civil war, the Obama administration abandoned the secular, pro-democracy forces by allowing the Iranians and their Shiite proxies, Hezbollah from Lebanon, and Shiite militias from Iraq along with the Russians, to subdue the Syrian revolution, and undermine the Sunni-Muslim majority. Worse yet, the administration established a \u201cred line,\u201d a warning to the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, to refrain from using chemical weapons on his people. He did anyway. Obama did nothing. As a result, Russia became the \u201cstrong horse\u201d in the Middle East.\nPresident Obama will be remembered for pandering to America\u2019s enemies, and abandoning its friends in the Middle East. This was vividly exemplified last December when the U.S. abstained from the infamous anti-Israel UN Security Council Resolution 2334."}

Both have been linked by some scientists to grave health problems, including liver cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s.\nThe devices previously found them at a Cape Coral canal-front home and at the university\u2019s Vester Field Station in Bonita Springs, in particle sizes able to deeply penetrate human lungs. The initial studies were done in September and October, as last year\u2019s virulent bloom was waning. Ideally, they\u2019ve have started earlier, Parsons said, but it took time to find partners and funding.\nMore research is needed to understand the implications.\nThe pilot study, a cooperative effort between FGCU and Yale, with help from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, initially sampled air in Cape Coral, where there was a thick bloom, and in Bonita Springs, where there wasn\u2019t. Yet the toxins appeared in both places.\nIn Buckingham, \u201cWe were at least a mile away from any retention ponds, and three miles from the Caloosahatchee,\u201d but over 28 days, the devices still picked up the toxins.\nThe next step?

The propaganda that the BJP is no longer concerned about Brahmin interests has been reinforced by the lack of representation of the community in key slots in the party and government. The big two in the party, Narendra Modi and Shah, are non-Brahmins. Besides, there is an extraordinary preponderance of Thakurs as chief ministers.

These days, our music lives on (or streams from) our phones and tablets, meaning we need bookshelf speakers designed to match.\nLike these: For a limited time, and while supplies last, BlueRigger (via Amazon) has the Kinivo M2 2.1-channel Bluetooth speaker system for $59.99 shipped -- $20 off the regular price (which, I'd argue, is already a pretty sweet deal).\nAs noted, these would make a great addition to any bookshelf, but you could also use them as computer or TV speakers. The M2 incorporates Bluetooth for wireless pairing with your mobile devices (and NFC for super-easy wireless pairing), but also has a 3.5mm input jack for connecting with just about anything else.\nThe satellites themselves are wired to the subwoofer (just FYI), and the whole setup cranks out 56 watts of audio goodness -- enough for a small or medium-size room, but maybe insufficient if you're looking to jam in a really big space.\nI have no first-hand (or first-ear) experience with the M2; my only previous exposure to any Kinivo product is the ZX100 mini portable speaker -- which, I must admit, is surprisingly awesome. But the nearly 130 user reviews add up to a 4.6-star average rating, and that says a lot.\nWhether you're looking to give your PC a major audio upgrade (built-in speakers make me want to cry) or want a permanent Bluetooth-speaker addition to your den, this is mighty attractive.\nBonus deal: Remember when desktop-search utilities were all the rage? With good reason: They made quick and easy work of finding the files you needed. Then they all kind of disappeared (cue \"X-Files\" music), leaving behind only a few expensive business-minded products -- like Axonic's Lookeen 10. Well, good news, everyone! The company just released Lookeen Free (Win), a desktop-search tool aimed at home users. With it you can quickly find and preview unlimited files (though only those located on your primary hard drive). Worth a look!\nBonus deal No. 2: Game time! You can name your own price for MacGameStore's 10th-anniversary bundle, which includes four highly regarded indie games and, if you beat the average (currently $5.08), four more highly regarded indie games. All the titles are compatible with both Windows and Mac, and all are DRM-free. Plus, 10 percent of the proceeds goes to Stand Up for Cancer, so dig deep, game fans."}

Madison and Travis will re-enter our lives on Sunday, April 10, more than four months earlier than its Season 1 premiere date. As well, the release dates for Turn Season 3 and the miniseries The Night Manager were also revealed.\nFor fans of the horror drama, this is undoubtedly good news, as it means more of the year will be spent watching zombies wreck shop across certain areas of the U.S. Considering there are more episodes in Season 2 than the six-episode run of Season 1, it totally makes sense that it would be premiering earlier than late summer, but I still didn\u2019t expect it to pop up until June at the earliest, so that it could end right around the time The Walking Dead Season 7 kicked off. I even thought the network might decide to air them back-to-back on the same night, but I guess it\u2019s better to spread the wealth. The fact that it\u2019ll be going up against Game of Thrones, which premieres two weeks later, will likely play a huge role in the ratings it brings in.\nRelease date news wasn\u2019t the only new thing to come out of Fear the Walking Dead today, as the very first Season 2 image was also set afloat.

That plan probably won\u2019t be too successful in the long run, but at least Travis and Daniel look relatively calm in the image, so it\u2019ll probably take at least a few minutes for things to go haywire.\nAside from the more gory fare, AMC viewers can also look forward to seeing Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie going head to head in the six-part miniseries The Night Manager, which will debut on Tuesday, April 19 (at 10:00 p.m. ET), for the network\u2019s first foray into Tuesday night originals. The next week will bring the Season 3 premiere of the war-bound drama Turn: Washington\u2019s Spies, which will debut on Monday, April 25, at 10:00 p.m. ET.\nSo to reiterate, we can look forward to spending the spring with Fear the Walking Dead Season 2, which will debut on AMC on Sunday, April 10, at 9:00 p.m. ET.

An editor who worked with Anbar at the institute wrote about the killing on its Web site this month.\nOn March 26, Anbar went to the al-Moustafa Husseiniya, a political and religious complex in the capital's Shaab neighborhood, to conduct interviews for a story about Shiite Muslims displaced from their homes by violence, said Aos Tammimi, a friend and reporter for U.S.-sponsored Radio Sawa who accompanied him.\nArmored Humvees arrived, and a firefight broke out. Anbar hid for a while in an adjacent house, according to Sadoun Husseini, 56, who owns the house and watched the scene unfold. When Anbar later tried to flee, he was shot through the right cheekbone. Tammimi found his body.\n\"All that he was carrying was a notebook, which I still have, with his name and writing on it,\" said Tammimi, a friend of Anbar's for more than 10 years.\nAt least 16 people were reported killed in the raid by U.S. and Iraqi special forces. The U.S. military announced that 16 insurgents were killed. One hostage was rescued, and 18 detainees taken. Anbar is the first unarmed civilian to be identified among the victims. \"This is the first I have heard that a journalist was there,\" said Lt. Col. Michelle Martin-Hing, a U.S. military spokeswoman in Baghdad.\nThe raid strained already fraying relations between the U.S. military and Iraq's Shiite-led government. In its aftermath, widely divergent accounts were put forward by the military and witnesses, whose accounts Iraqi officials cited in public denunciations of the operation. The complex included an office of the Dawa party, led by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari -- who called the assault a criminal act -- as well as a small prayer room. Iraq's Defense Ministry said it did not authorize the raid.\nVideo footage broadcast hours later on the al-Iraqiya television network, which is closely tied to Jafari, showed bodies strewn among prayer books and no weapons in sight. The building was a mosque, several witnesses said, and people were killed while praying. Witnesses interviewed at the complex later said many unarmed worshipers had been shot while praying, which the U.S. military and the Iraqi commander at the scene have denied.\nNeighborhood residents said al-Moustafa Husseiniya was a gathering place for supporters of the Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia, which the United States has blamed for a slew of killings in Baghdad in recent weeks. Sadr has backed Jafari's contested bid to retain the prime minister's post, while U.S. officials have suggested Jafari should step aside to help break a months-long deadlock.\nIn a statement released the night of the raid, the U.S. military said that the site was a known refuge for kidnappers and killers and that during a firefight"}

A physical attack on an elected leader is not only an attack on a real person with family, friends and neighbors (as opposed to the paper-thin cartoon versions of elected leaders that are created through memes and vitriol), it is an attack on the rule of law and on the political foundation of our country that, for all its faults, we still believe in.

{"idx": "15991", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Obama's lawyers are foundering in explaining the legal rationale for his Libyan adventure. Bruce Ackerman on our broken system of giving presidents legal advice\u2014and how to fix it.\nThe present confrontation over the War Powers Act requires Congress to rethink some tragic events of the past decade. It has been tempting to view the torture memos as an unfortunate accident\u2014the result of legal ideologues finding themselves at key positions at a moment of crisis. But the debate over President Obama's bombing campaign in Libya forces us to ask whether there is an emerging crisis of legality within the executive branch.\nIt is hardly surprising that the president wants to make life easy for himself and claim that the War Powers Act doesn't require him to gain explicit congressional authorization for continued bombing\u2014despite its insistence that he do so within 60 days of commencing \"hostilities.\" But it is disturbing when his lawyers present arguments that are so profoundly unpersuasive. An initial effort by White House Counsel Robert Bauer was painfully inadequate, amounting to a single paragraph of conclusory assertion. To beef up its case, the administration has now sent Harold Koh, legal adviser to the State Department, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nKoh got off on the wrong track by treating \"hostilities\" as an \"ambiguous term of art\" divorced from common-sense understandings. So far as he is concerned, it doesn't matter whether most Americans think that a billion-dollar bombing campaign is a paradigm case of \"hostilities\"; the president can cut himself from public opinion and insist that he, and he alone, can decide whether his lawyer's clever arguments are good enough to cut Congress out of the decision.\nEven by Beltway standards, Koh's arguments were unimpressive. Our mission was too limited to amount to \"hostilities,\" he explained, even though its duration is entirely open-ended, and U.S. planes and drones could continue bombing for years, with costs rising into the billions. He also recognized that our support was central to the entire multinational effort, warning that its elimination would \"undo NATO's progress.\" But despite our centrality to the overall campaign, the U.S. Air Force wasn\u2019t killing enough people to satisfy the administration\u2019s demanding standards for \"hostilities\" that require congressional approval.\nBy joining George W. Bush in blazing novel legal pathways for super-presidentialism, Obama's break with the War Powers Act suggests a deeper pathology. There is something wrong with the basic system through which presidents get their legal advice. Without fundamental reform, we can expect repeated scenarios in which top administration lawyers rubber-stamp power-grabs even when they are in blatant violation of fundamental laws.\nThe current hyper-politicized system is the product of a series of historical accidents. One great change involves the rise of the White House counsel to a position of legal authority. When the job was created in 1943, it was occupied by senior statesmen like Sam Rosenman and Clark Clifford. Since they operated as free-wheeling presidential advisers and speechwriters, they saw no need to hire a permanent professional staff\u2014leaving presidents to rely exclusively on the Justice Department for serious legal analysis. This only changed when Richard Nixon appointed John Dean his White House counsel. The 31-year old Dean lacked the heft of his predecessors, so he had to find some new mission for himself. This led him to create an \"in-house\" legal office to provide White House staffers with advice on a host of low-level matters."}

The aims of these refurbishments are to increase turf root zone and bring back a degree of cushion to the racing surface, through heavy aerating and spreading of sand.\nThe equipment and materials for this project have been supplied by Racing Queensland.\nGreat success has been achieved over the past 18 months in terms of increased turf root zone and improving cushion in the track, despite the track surface taking several weeks to fully consolidate after each refurb.\nIn hindsight the ITC erred in completing this refurbishment too close to a race day on February 22. The postponement of that meeting to the following Monday was the right move with the rail moved back to true where the refurbishment was completed earlier.\nThe problem that followed was a series of directions from RQ to cease irrigation and aeration of parts of the track which suffered over the next few weeks in temperatures as high as 41 degrees.\nThe RQ direction that followed was to place turf plugs in affected areas and it was these unconsolidated plugs that were correctly deemed by QRIC as unsafe for racing last week. Hence the meeting was transferred to Doomben.\nThis series of events occurred just prior to a break of 16 days until the next programmed ITC race meeting on March 29 - just about enough time to revert to the ITC maintenance program, and to allow restoration of the track near to where it was in mid-February.\nIt was just a month ago that the industry was applauding the Ipswich track as among the best surfaces in Queensland - albeit with poor drainage.\nHowever, a hot dry summer had all forgetting about the impact of rainfall on the Ipswich track on the morning of a race meeting.\nOne highly positive point to come out of the past month is a pledge by RQ to work with the ITC in coming up with a future solution to the drainage problems which have beset the Bundamba surface for 130 years.\nSuch a solution would be costly and necessitate months off from racing and the analysis has already commenced.\nThe radio TAB interview with ITC chairman Wayne Patch last week clearly described this situation and is well worth a listen.\nDESPITE the issues with the track over the past month, there is as usual great interest from the Community of Ipswich in the Ipswich Cup on June 15.\nPrivate marquees on the grandstand side have been basically sold out while infield private marquees are in strong demand as well.\nPlentiful online"}

The teams officially announced the trade about an hour later, allowing the Giants to add the kind of proven outfielder they\u2019ve been seeking all off-season.\nIn exchange, Pittsburgh gets pitcher Kyle Crick, minor league outfielder Bryan Reynolds and $500,000 in international bonus pool space. The Giants get McCutchen as well as cash considerations. Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, who first reported the trade, said the Pirates will send the Giants $2.5 million as part of the deal.\nMcCutchen will make $14.75 million in salary this year before being eligible for free agency.\nThe four-time Silver Slugger winner is expected to continue to wear the No. 22 he sported in Pittsburgh. That\u2019s jersey number made famous in these parts by sweet-swinging Will Clark.\nGiants right fielder Hunter Pence was among the first to welcome McCutchen to the fold, posting a GIF of the Pirates outfielder trying to shoo ducks off the field in Pittsburgh.\n\u201cEager to chase birds with you in the outfield,\u201d Pence wrote.\nThe move is reminiscent of the Giants trade that landed third baseman Evan Longoria, 32, in December. The team gets another respected veteran reaching his post-peak years.\nMcCutchen, 31, is coming off a season in which he batted .279 with 28 homers, 88 RBI and 11 stolen bases. He had a .363 on-base percentage, .486 slugging percentage and an .849 OPS.\nHe has topped the 20-homer mark in each of the past seven seasons. McCutchen is also durable \u2014 he\u2019s played at least 146 games in eight consecutive years.\nOnce considered an elite defender \u2014 he won the Gold Glove in 2012 \u2014 McCutchen\u2019s reputation in the field has waned in recent seasons. Sarah Langs of ESPN noted that the outfielders with the fewest defensive runs saved since 2015 are McCutchen (-50), Matt Kemp (-50) and Denard Span (-44).\nAt the Winter Meetings in December, Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said McCutchen was motivated last season to prove the skeptics (and the metrics) are wrong in regards to his decline in center field.\nMcCutchen made 1,310 career starts in center field while in Pittsburgh. The only two players in Pirates history with more were Hall-of-Famers Lloyd Waner (1,518) and Max Carey (1,416).\nWherever he ends up in the Giants outfield, the team will be counting on his offensive production after a season in which they ranked last in several categories. McCutchen batted .336 against left-handed pitchers last season, eighth in the N.L.\nThough long mentioned in trade rumors, it was still jarring to see McCutchen bid farewell to Pittsburgh, the only major league home he has ever known.\nThe Pirates drafted McCutchen"}

This was the ultimate Geek Tour.\nIt's actually fairly amazing that these six physics majors, now 70, have managed to stay in such close contact all these years. Reunions are pretty much yearly, some related to weddings or milestone birthdays, others for no reason other than the pleasure of getting together.\nOlof still likes to recall his first exposure to freshman physics professor and by-then Nobelist Richard Feynman as an undergraduate at Cal Tech. It involved a heavy steel ball attached by a cable to the lecture hall ceiling which was intentionally hurled at considerable velocity at the professor's face, and, by not killing him, demonstrated some extremely important law of physics. It definitely got his students' attention.\nWhenever Olof and I have traveled over the years, Olof was always immediately attracted to the technical aspects of whatever we were doing. When we lived in Sweden and were considering a trip up above the Arctic Circle to Kiruna, friends said, \"Why would you go there? There is nothing there but a huge iron ore mine.\" Olof lit up like a Christmas tree. \"There's a mine?\" (As an engineer, Olof's heart beats faster at the thought of excavation.) When he learned that one could take a three-hour mine tour, this trip was sealed in steel.\nTwo of Olof's college roommates live in Washington state, and as it turns out, there is no lack of tech-y, physics-y stuff to do there. Fearing glassy-eyed spouses whining \"Are we done yet?\" they opted this year to reune without us. We wives imagined them geeking out by day, and hanging out at a local bar at night, lamenting the demise of the slide rule.\nUp first for the guys was a trip to Hanford in the southeast corner of Washington for a tour of Reactor B where plutonium was first manufactured as part of the Manhattan Project. (Please ignore all errors; I truly have no idea what I'm talking about.) Clean-up is still underway all these years later to make sure that all the reactor fuel is truly, safely \"cocooned.\" Afterwards they went for lunch to what Olof described as a \"nearby winery.\"\n\"How nearby?\" I inquired. \"Were the grapes the size of baseballs? Did the wine glow in the dark?\" Apparently not THAT nearby.\nThe next day they were off to LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) which is a large-scale physics laboratory aimed at directly detecting gravitational waves. As I understand it (and believe me, I really DON'T understand it), gravitational waves were predicted to exist by Einstein based on his theory of general relativity, but he apparently didn't think it could be proven. But the detectors at LIGO were able to detect gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. For people with Olof's background, life doesn't get more exciting than this.\nA brief somewhat sentimental (such as these guys get sentimental) side trip was taken to visit the nearby potato farm that was one of the roommate's first investments. In fact, he had tried to entice Olof to move up there and use his technical skills to manage a processing plant that would convert all those potatoes into frozen potato products. Olof's vision for himself at the time didn't include being a potato farmer in eastern Washington"}

French fans jeered Williams and cheered her mistakes, but the Centre Court crowd at Wimbledon had only applause for the defending champion.\nShe'll play for another title on Saturday against her sister Venus or Kim Clijsters, who were scheduled to meet later Thursday.\nIf Williams needed any other motivation against Henin-Hardenne, there was this: A loss would have ended her one-year reign atop the rankings, with Clijsters overtaking her for No. 1.\nThe start of the first semifinal was delayed 2 hours by rain, but when play finally began, Williams was ready. She came out hitting so ferociously that by the second game the huge hoop earring on her left ear was gone \u2014 albeit only temporarily.\nThe force of her strokes sometimes sent her airborne, and several times she let out a jubilant shriek after winning a point. Despite Williams' aggressiveness, her play was remarkably error-free.\nThe rallies were often long and vigorous, as the speedy Henin-Hardenne kept chasing down shots that would elude most players.\nBut Williams' power took a toll. One long exchange early in the second set left Henin-Hardenne panting, and she then double faulted to lose the game.\nAnd when Henin-Hardenne tried coming to the net, Williams repeatedly passed her, often on the run.\nFrench fans booed Williams when she brusquely shook hands with Henin-Hardenne following their match in Paris. This time Williams greeted the Belgian at the net with a grin, a firm handshake and a conciliatory pat on the shoulder.\nIn Henin-Hardenne's first two service game, Williams had six break points and converted two as she took a 4-0 lead. They played 22 minutes before Henin-Hardenne won a game. Then she won two more to make it 4-3.\nWhen Williams slammed a winner to finish off one 18-stroke exchange, she screamed, \"C'mon!\" She let out an emotional yelp when she broke for a 5-3 lead, then held serve, closing out the set when Henin-Hardenne sailed an errant forehand to end a 13-shot rally.\nWilliams fell into a love-40 hole serving in the second game of the final set, then dug out by winning five consecutive points, the last with a leaping overhead winner again accompanied by a yelp.\nShe easily held serve from there and broke for a 5-2 lead, screaming \"Yes!\" as Henin-Hardenne's lob flew long on break point.\nPartly cloudy skies were a welcome change after rain prevented any matches from being completed Wednesday.\nMark Philippoussis endured rain delays and erased a two-set deficit Wednesday before dampness and darkness forced the suspension of his quarterfinal match against Alexander Popp. The unseeded Philippoussis was serving and holding a two-point lead, 4-6, 4-6, 6"}
