One component of that program is the Work Ready fitness test. It is mandatory this season for ski patrollers, ski instructors, lift operators and other mountain-operations workers.\nMore than 800 employees had been tested as of Thursday, and fewer than 1 percent of them had failed, Vetter said. All failures were related to medical conditions. The tests will be modified due to each individual\u2019s specific conditions and they will be able to retake the test, she said.\nThe test has eight components. In chronological order, they feature a five-minute step test on a 12-inch-high box while stepping at a rate of 96 beats per minute; 15 push-ups (from the knees allowed) in one minute; 15 crunches or sit-ups in one minute; a side plank with 15 hip dips on each side within one minute for each side; and a fifth station that tests agility with a side-to-side slalom hop over a 10-foot-long course. Patrollers, lift-operator leads and ski-instructor trainers must complete the agility test within six seconds. Regular ski instructors and lift operators have 13 seconds.\nRounding out the stations are weightlifting, which features a 75-pound dead lift for patrollers and 50-pound dead lift for everyone else; a dead lift to upright row of 25 pounds for everyone; a 15-pound overhead lift only for patrollers, lift-operator leads and ski-instructor trainers; balance on a cushy foam pad on one foot for 10 seconds each; and a flexibility test where employees must come within 6 inches of touching their toes.\nThe balance test has been the most challenging, Vetter said, because the pad has varying degrees of density to simulate conditions that employees might encounter on the slopes \u2014 from hard pack to icy to powder. While it is the most challenging, she said, most employees have completed it within the three attempts allowed.\nA ski instructor fresh off his test early one recent morning said the balance was the only station that challenged him. It was like balancing with one foot in a cow pie, he said.\nAnother ski instructor said she passed with no trouble and would prefer to see a tougher overall test in the future. Another employee said some Skico workers spent more energy worrying about the test than on the test itself.\nVetter said she checks out every employee who comes through the Work Ready test and always asks them how it went. When the testing started in October, most Skico employees said they were nervous at the beginning but found it wasn\u2019t so bad, she said. About one month into the testing, most employees were saying it was fine, according to Vetter.\n\u201cSome say they had heard it was no big deal from their friends, and some have even said it was fun,\u201d Vetter said.\nSome ski patrollers raced the clock in their individual tests to try to record the best time in the agility test. The contenders were completing the test in less than three seconds.\nSkico Chief Human Resource Officer Jim Laing said the tests weren\u2019t created with the intention of flunking a certain percentage of workers.

In fact, he started the first one by finishing 39th. So a relatively routine (for him) fourth-place finish in which he picked up 5 bonus points by leading 14 laps could signal the march to an unprecedented fourth straight title.\nA team that started the year in chaos after a merger appears to be ending it the same way. Kasey Kahne must now deal not only with the pressure of the Chase, but also with the distractions created by the news that his organization will join forces with Yates Racing in 2010 and switch from Dodge to Ford. That news, combined with the departure of vice president Mark McArdle, leaves the team in flux at the worst possible time. A good run at New Hampshire could have cured a lot of ills; instead Kahne finished 38th with a blown engine. Finally, on the last lap, RPM driver A.J. Allmendinger spun out, forcing NASCAR to throw a caution flag that froze the field and cut short a thrilling sprint to the finish.\nBefore the Chase opener, Tony Stewart, who led the points after the first 26 races, said he thought the accomplishment was worth a million-dollar bonus \u2013 \u201cand not just because it\u2019s us.\u201d Stewart\u2019s point is valid.

{"idx": "5025", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Is Intel Corporation Finally Turning the Corner?\nSome good things are happening at two of the core revenue-generating divisions of chip manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). While the company boosted its revenue guidance for the current quarter, buoyed by enhanced sales of business PCs, Intel also developed a customizable technology that could significantly brighten the prospects of its highly profitable server chip division.\nThe recent developments amount to welcome news for a company that has witnessed a steady slowdown in growth in the face of a shift toward smartphones and tablets. That's one area where Intel has failed to secure its market presence until now, leading to persistent doubts about the long-term sustainability of these events.\nIntel's stock price rose by more than 5% after the company raised its revenue projections for the ongoing quarter by around $700 million. While this was prompted by a welcome increase in demand for PCs that cater to business, the scenario was not totally unexpected.\nCompanies like Intel are likely to enjoy the extended benefits of Microsoft's decision to end support for the Windows XP operating system in April this year, given the sheer number of computers that still run the 12-year old OS and need to be upgraded as a result.\nHere's the catch: Until now, this trend has largely been limited to business in developed markets such as the US. The retail segment, on the other hand, continues to see a steady decline in demand for PCs that have been sidelined in favor of more handy devices such as tablets. And with research firm IDC continuing to predict a 6% fall in PC unit shipments for the current year, this may be nothing more than a temporary shot in the arm for Intel.\nThe competition is never far behind, as industry rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) unveils a technology that is set to improve the energy efficiency of its products by as much as 25 times by the year 2020. That's something that again highlights Intel's continuous need to innovate and stay ahead in the race.\nApart from PC chips, Intel's highly profitable server chip division, which recorded a 11% year-over-year increase in revenue during the recent first quarter, also seems to be giving reason to feel good at the moment. Apart from introducing a newer and more efficient version of its popular Xeon series of processors, Intel recently adopted a new technology that enables it to produce customizable variants of its server chips for large companies like Facebook and eBay that specifically require such products.\nWhile this is definitely a good move, given the competition that the company is facing in the form of low-power chips designed using technology from ARM Holdings, the entire server industry continues to feel threatened by long-term concerns about cloud computing. At the same time, while server chips yield higher profit margins than those made for PCs, they are certainly no match for the latter category in terms of volume sales.\nNone of the above feel-good factors are enough to erase the memory of the stunning $929 million operating loss incurred by Intel's mobile and communications segment during its recent first quarter. That has proved to be the single biggest setback for Intel's plans to catch up with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the established market leader in the smartphone processor category.\nQualcomm has its own share of problems. The company has watched its profit growth shrink as a result of slowing high-end smartphone sales in the developed markets and is now increasingly focusing on emerging markets like China in a bid to cater to the mid- and low-range smartphone category.\nBut even here, Qualcomm has to fight it"}

His wife was christened Claire \u2014 an ironic choice for a woman who always has an ulterior motive.\nEven the couple's surname, \"Underwood,\" hints at their hypocrisy by echoing \"underhanded.\"\nIt's costume designer Johanna Argan's job to subliminally convey that duplicity to the audience through the clothes the characters wear.\n\"The other characters think they're getting one thing from Frank and Claire,\" Argan said in a phone interview. \"But all the time, the Underwoods have a hidden agenda. It's very two different sides that the audience sees.\"\nSo far, the first two seasons of the drama have been a kind of modern update of \"Macbeth,\" set in Washington, D.C., instead of 11th-century Scotland. By the end of season two, the power couple has conspired to knock off the king (in this case, the fictitious U.S. President Garrett Walker) and are about to ascend the throne.\nThere are times when the plot adheres with remarkable fidelity to Shakespeare's play. There's even a reference to the famous and horrifying speech in which Lady Macbeth declares that she would dash out her baby's brains to further her political ambitions. Instead, Claire threatens to let a former employee's unborn child \"wither away inside you\" by withholding life-saving medicine unless the mother-to-be drops a wrongful-termination lawsuit.\n\"House of Cards'\" creator Beau Willimon and director David Fincher specified a design scheme in keeping with the drama's chilled-to-the-bone emotional atmosphere.\n\"We adhere to a very strict color palette,\" Argan said.\n\"Claire wears only black, gray, blue and navy. You'll never see anyone wearing red. Mr. Fincher has a very distinct style. He shoots dark against light, and that's kind of the opposite of what most people do.\"\nThese are characters who see the world perpetually in a monotone of beige and gray. The plot is filled with highly charged events, but none provide an emotional jolt to the couple. They never express either great sadness or joy.\nThe design tells viewers that not only are Frank and Claire morally compromised, but they're probably also depressed.\n\"They keep everything between the two of them,\" Argan said, \"and even then, they have secrets from each other.\"\nIt's also no surprise then, that Argan, who joined the cable drama in the second season, plays with the notion in the back of her mind of chain mail and breastplates when she's designing clothes for the actress Robin Wright, who portrays Claire, and actor Kevin Spacey, who stars as Frank.\n\"Everything the Underwoods do is very Shakespearean,\" Argan said. \"Everything they do, say and wear is very controlled and thought out.\"\nFor Claire Underwood, Argan opted for an ultra-refined look, from simple sheath dresses to crisp blouses to pencil skirts with a knee-length hem. Because Claire is supremely conscious of the message she's sending to Washington insiders and the public, she combines designer attire with off-the-rack items: a short and structured Dior jacket with a skirt from Theory or Anthropologie.\n\"The lines of her clothing are very structured and very tailored,\" Argan"}

Richard Mell, 33rd, already has the support of Mayor Rahm Emanuel. However, a coalition of organizations supporting the measure expects it to face opposition from banks and the real estate industry. The proposal is expected to be heard May 1 by the City Council's Housing Committee.\nStanding outside a dilapidated, partially boarded-up multifamily building in Chicago's Austin neighborhood, with another one across the street, two dozen supporters of the proposed ordinance waved orange signs that read \"less vacancy equals less crime' and \"less evictions means less crime.\"\nAs proposed, lenders that repossess any foreclosed rental building, regardless of whether it is a single-family rental home or an apartment high-rise, would either have to pay tenants $12,000 per rental unit to relocate or would have to offer them rent-controlled leases until the building was sold. The proposal would apply to any other entity that purchases a rental building at a court-ordered foreclosure auction. The rules would not apply to a buyer that purchases a foreclosed property in a private transaction after the auction.\nLawyers Committee for Better Housing, a member of the Keep Chicago Renting coalition, undertook the report because if wanted to quantify the anecdotal reports form community organizations about instability in neighborhoods rife with foreclosures and vacant buildings. In a separate report released last year, the group found that almost 52,000 apartment building units in Chicago went into foreclosure between 2009 and 2011.

From their shopping experiences, they want (and expect) it all\u2014value for their dollars, high-quality products, authentic and honest store environments\u2014and they want it fast. So when Atlanta-based Miller Zell partnered with Philadelphia-based Aramark\u2019s Higher Education division to develop a new college campus c-store concept, they started by delving into research on the shopping habits of today\u2019s college students.\nUltimately, the research and project objectives culminated in the creation of a new campus c-store concept, dubbed Provisions on Demand (P.O.D.) Market. Name generation, brand identity, interior design and engineering for the project were completed in less than 16 weeks. Designed to meet the demands of students looking for fresh, healthy and grab-and-go dining options, P.O.D. reinvents the campus store experience by blending the quick convenience of a \u201ccorner store\u201d with the style and service of a modern market. Piloted in fall 2008 on three campuses, including Brandeis University, University of Tennessee and The University of Toledo, additional P.O.D. locations are slated to roll out over the next three years, with plans to customize each store based on the specific needs of the campus community.\nWhile P.O.D. stores vary in size\u2014from 500 sq. ft. to 2,500 sq. ft.\u2014the layouts are similar, anchored by four key destinations: \u201cFresh & Green\u201d (fresh market and prepared foods); \u201cRecharge\u201d (hot bar, coffee and fountain); \u201cChillin\u201d (chilled beverages and frozen foods); and \u201cSweet & Salty\u201d (snacks and candy). A convenience check-out module is strategically placed to provide service and access to sundries, while the center of the space offers groceries and promotional items.\nThe design team wanted to deliver the right balance of sophisticated design and casual simplicity to develop a destination that is practical and hip, says Paul Pizzini, vice president design director at Miller Zell. \u201cToday\u2019s college students are tech savvy, sophisticated and like to be treated as adults,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a genuine concern for the environment and a sense of social responsibility.\u201d Along those lines, Miller Zell and Aramark crafted the P.O.D. brand around five pillars\u2014Attention, Choice, Fair Pricing, Freshness and Responsibility. \u201cThese serve as key business guideposts defining the P.O.D. experience,\u201d Pizzini says.\nTo further a sense of sophistication, Miller Zell employed rich residential finishes not often seen in c-stores. Touches like resin-cast stone panels offer permanence and warmth without the costs of major construction, Pizzini points out. Overhead ceiling clouds feature lightweight wood and composite construction, and a perimeter panel system replicates a wood finish in recycled styrene. Energy-efficient fluorescent lights create an ambience that Pizzini describes as soft and inviting, while high-output wall washers punctuate the perimeter.\nIt also was important that P.O.D. encompass a wide and current product selection. \u201cWhile some Millennials are purely concerned with how far they can stretch their dollar, others are more concerned with product quality and content, such as all-natural or low-carb foods,\u201d Pizzini explains. \u201cOthers place greater value on the item\u2019s global imprint, such as its green value and good corporate citizenship.\u201d To address students\u2019"}

About $75 billion to $100 billion of the government funding will come from the second tranche of the TARP.\nThe Obama administration's latest plan comes amid a growing taxpayer backlash about aid to Wall Street, as well as what many consider exorbitant executive pay.\nAdministration officials Monday addressed those concerns, emphasizing that public and private money was being used together.\n\"We're sharing in a partnership form,\" said White House economist Austan Goolsbee on CNBC. \"If the private sector profits, then the government profits.\"\nPublic and lawmaker fury over the bonuses, and efforts on Capitol Hill to claw them back, have made many investors skittish about partnering with the government. But the Treasury specified that private partners in its latest effort to revive credit markets will not face tough executive pay restrictions.\nIn one initiative, the government will create up to five public-private partnerships, run by approved asset managers, with the government and private firms each providing 50 percent of the capital. The structure is meant to create a market for the troubled assets, which have been difficult, if not impossible, to price since the financial crisis first erupted 18-months ago.\nThe FDIC will oversee the program and will also provide financing along with the Treasury.\nUnder the PPIF, participating firms will identify the assets, usually as a pool of loans, which will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The government will determine how much funding is necessary to enable the transaction, with leverage not to exceed a 6-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio.\nThough the toxic assets plan has been eagerly-awaited by Wall Street, the Obama administration was careful Monday not to raise expectations unduly. Goolsbee said the latest initiative was \"one key brick in what's been a multiple brick process, trying to put the house back together.\"\nThe government's Financial Stability Plan also includes a $75 billion foreclosure mitigation plan, up to $1 trillion in support for consumer and business lending and a capital-for-equity swap plan.\nThe plan released Monday will also \"create a lending program that will address the broken markets for securities tied to residential and commercial real estate and consumer credit.\" That will be done through the the previously announced Term Asset-Backed Securities Facility, TALF, which was launched last week by the Federal Reserve.

Far less discussed is the case of Ilan Grapel, 27, a dual American-Israeli citizen who served in the IDF and now studies law at Emory. He was detained by Egyptian authorities in June, first under charges of spying for Israel and then under ones of incitement; as yet, no indictment has been served. Then, last week, there was much action concerning him, suggesting that his situation might be tethered to Shalit\u2019s. Over the weekend, there emerged reports that Grapel, too, is likely to be freed\u2014following the exchange of more than 80 Egyptian nationals currently in Israeli prisons, most for illegal immigration-type offenses.\n\u2026 Huh? The general assumption was that Grapel was not a spy, but rather some idealistic American kid who decided to visit Tahrir Square, foolishly lied about being a journalist, and unluckily ended up in Egyptian custody. But Israel\u2019s willingness to trade prisoners for him\u2014especially given that he is the United States\u2019 responsibility, having entered Egypt with his American passport\u2014maybe suggests otherwise? I talked to Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence hand and now senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, to get a handle on what\u2019s going on with what is, after all, an American citizen one year older than myself.\nIt seems likely either that the exchange for Grapel is part of the Shalit deal, or that it is less closely linked: that the Shalit deal created a climate in which the Grapel deal could happen and also that Shalit could distract people from it\u2014the Egyptian government is worried that its people will be angry about letting Grapel go. Which do you think it is?\nI think it\u2019s the latter. It\u2019s an opportune moment to clean out the file system. And particularly the Egyptians want to do it because they want to continue to earn good favor with the United States and try to re-establish strong intelligence links. Our intelligence relationship was built around Omar Suleiman [former President Mubarak\u2019s number two, now deposed]\u2014it was very much a one-man show.

AT&T's basic monthly service delivers 5GB worth of data for $50; additional gigs cost $10 each. The hub can also be used outside the U.S with an international service plan.\nThe Liberate also lets you wirelessly share files and images loaded onto the device via a microSD card.

She also alleged that Punjab BJP leaders refused to stand by her husband, Amritsar MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, when he decided to leave the city as some of his pet projects had been jeopardised by the state government at the behest of 'powerful' Akali leaders.\nState BJP chief Kamal Sharma is at the centre of Dr Sidhu's criticism for failing to assert himself and come to the defence of his party MLAs and colleagues. Sharma has apparently made no effort to meet Navjot Singh Sidhu and bring him back to his constituency, though he did acknowledge that Sidhu was still the best bet for the party from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.\nIn the absence of a strong leader, the BJP has time and again succumbed to the Akalis' pressure tactics.

And I welcome that,\" she said.\nTony Little, the headmaster of Eton, says independent schools will be distracted from their main aim \u2014 teaching \u2014 by the demands of a \"vast bureaucratic exercise\".\nSuch comments are unlikely to deflect Dame Suzi.

Zika\u2019s links to neurological conditions, such as microcephaly\u2014abnormal brain development in newborns\u2014remain unproven.\nA team of Brazilian and African scientists (link in Portuguese) believe rapid and thorough testing for Zika will be key to solving that mystery. Given Brazil\u2019s vast size and limited infrastructure, though, they\u2019re having to deploy an inventive diagnostic tool to achieve that: A suitcase-sized laboratory.\nSince the beginning of the year, researchers from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of S\u00e3o Paulo University and the Pasteur Institute of Dakar, Senegal have been working to adapt mobile-laboratory technology, which was used in Africa to detect Ebola, to analyze Brazil\u2019s Zika epidemic.\nThe whole thing weighs less than 20 kgs (44 pounds) and is operated with a laptop. The components used to test samples, which would have to be kept frozen in a traditional lab setting, are all in powder form, not unlike a boxed cake mix that only requires water.\nThe mobile lab will start testing patients\u2019 saliva, blood and urine in the northeastern state of Sergipe, where dozens of microcephaly cases (Portuguese) have been reported, in mid-February. The test results will be available within 30 minutes, instead of the many hours or even days that commonly used techniques require.\nIn West Africa, a portable gene-sequencing device called MinION helped researchers map the spread of Ebola by linking the lineages of cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone. (The research has just been published in Nature.) The mobile lab in Brazil doesn\u2019t do gene-sequencing\u2014the MinION is too expensive, Daniel Ferreira, one of the researchers on the project, told Quartz. But it will still make disease-mapping easier and quicker, by identifying Zika samples that can then be sent to be sequenced at a full-fledged lab.\n\u201cOur goal is to understand what\u2019s happening in remote areas of Brazil and actually interfere with the process,\u201d Ferreira said.\nZika presents its own particular challenges, though. While not as deadly as Ebola, it\u2019s harder to track, because many people who get infected never show symptoms. Those people won\u2019t seek medical help, says Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology at University of California, Berkeley, making it harder to collect information. \u201cIt\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg that you can possibly identify,\u201d he tells Quartz.\nZika is also hard to test for. Many tests based on blood serum can\u2019t distinguish Zika conclusively from other mosquito-borne viruses in the same area, such as yellow fever or West Nile, says Nikos Vasilakis of University of Texas Medical Branch, who is working to develop better ways of identifying Zika.\n\u201cBasically, you can get false positives all the time,\u201d he tells Quartz.\nThe other testing technique, which looks for the virus\u2019s genetic signature, is complicated as well. To identify a virus by its genes, scientists need recent samples of it for comparison (since viruses mutate).

He launched a campaign against corruption by taking a decision in one day by instituting an effective mechanism to crack down on the corrupt.\nThe campaign started by targeting former prime minister Najib Abdul Razak, his wife Rosmah Mansor and some of their relatives with the aim of recovering billions of dollars smuggled out of the country through money laundering for over a decade.\nOn May 10, Mahathir entered the royal palace in the capital Kuala Lumpur to take the oath of office and officially begin his work as prime minister, after his party \u2018Alliance of Hope\u2019 won in the parliamentary elections, which Mahathir had participated in after changing his decision of quitting politics in 2003.\nThe first decision Mahathir took after assuming office was opening the corruption file. He has returned to politics and to premiership for this specific purpose after completing 22 years in the high office (1981-2003) during which he transformed Malaysia from being a poor agricultural and underdeveloped country into an Asian tiger and a major industrial state, by virtue of his integrity, efficiency and patriotism.\nIn this context, he issued a decision to prevent his corrupt predecessor and his wife from traveling and began investigating the corruption cases filed against them. He has also ordered investigating other senior officials of the ministry of finance and the public prosecutor\u2019s office over their involvement in corruption cases.\nMahathir announced that his government will work toward recovering billions of dollars that have been transferred to the US, Switzerland and other countries through money laundering.\nOn May 17, Mahathir established a government commission to combat corruption in all state institutions. The next day, the commission called on the former prime minister to appear before it while the police raided his house and found 284 boxes of handbags and 72 bags stuffed with money and jewelry.\nMr. Abadi has now at least two months before the new government is formed, whether under his presidency or someone else. In these two months he can do what Mahathir accomplished in nine days if he wishes so, but does he want to?"}

Most fatal opioid overdoses involve prescribed pain relievers that people started by taking legally. Most who become addicted to nicotine do so before they\u2019re even old enough to make a legal personal choice for themselves; according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 80 percent of adult smokers started before they were 18.\nYet opioids, unless they are provided through a legal prescription, are illegal, and smoking is legal. Not only that; opioids physically harm only the people who take them; second-hand smoke harms the people who are near smokers.\nWhy, then, these divergent views about the two addictive drugs? One is viewed as a national crisis demanding immediate attention; the other is a personal choice.\nProbably it\u2019s because opioid deaths occur more quickly and dramatically and, for the most part, among younger people. Unless a person dies in a fire caused by a smoldering cigarette, smoking deaths occur over decades and are defined as illnesses: lung cancer, emphysema, stroke, heart attack.\nBut they are not really natural deaths; on average, smoking reduces life expectancy by 10 years. Maybe if we defined the fatal diseases brought on by smoking as long-term cigarette overdoses, we\u2019d view them differently.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now proposing a drastic reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes, to levels where they would be far less addictive. It\u2019s unclear whether the agency can do this; the law prohibits it from requiring that all nicotine be removed, and if it aims for miniscule levels, tobacco companies might argue in court that this is virtually the same as eliminating it.\nBut if the levels aren\u2019t dropped to miniscule amounts, it could do more damage. If nicotine levels are at, say, 10 to 20 percent of normal, might people smoke five to 10 times as much to get their fix? It\u2019s the smoke that causes most of the disease, not the nicotine.\nThe FDA is still working out the details, but with the tobacco industry ready to fight \u2013 and to buy allies in Congress \u2013 the key is public support. Are we ready to beat down, once and for all, the biggest addictive killer in our nation?"}

{"idx": "5051", "prompt": "Continue the following text: The Act on External Audit of Stock Companies protects investors and stakeholders by redressing possible shortfalls of the internal audit control system through an external audit by an independent auditor and an audit review by the Securities and Futures Commission.\nThe audit review system provides an added layer of protection by verifying the process of an external audit to ensure the quality of financial information contained in the financial statements and audit reports.\nGenerally, a company will undergo an audit review when there is a reason to believe the company has violated accounting standards or standards for accounting audits, or if the company is under insolvency proceedings or court receivership.\nOn the other hand, a company may also be selected for an audit review without any particular reason through random sampling by the SFC.\nDuring an audit review, the SFC verifies whether the financial statements of a company subject to an external audit and the audit report prepared by the independent auditor performing the external audit conform to aforementioned standards.\nAs part of this audit review process, the SFC inspects the company\u2019s books and records, examines other documents and materials related to the company\u2019s accounting in the company\u2019s or independent auditor\u2019s possession and obtains testimonies from the officers and employees of the company and independent auditor.\nIf a violation is discovered during, the SFC imposes a sanction, the degree of which depends on the gravity and motive of violation.\nIn assessing the gravity of a violation, it is initially classified into one of four types based on the impact on financial statements. Then within each type of violation, it is subdivided into five further levels of severity.\nIn terms of motives, a violation is categorized as either intentional, grossly negligent or negligent. The final disposition of a sanction is determined by deriving a baseline sanction in joint consideration of the gravity and motive, then applying any aggravating or mitigating factors to the baseline sanction.\nTypes of sanctions that may be imposed by the SFC slightly vary between the company and independent auditor.\nThe company, along with officers and employees of it, may receive a sanction for a corrective order, warning, penalty surcharge, restriction on new share issuance, designation of SFC-nominated auditor, recommendation for termination of employment of the representative director or the officer in charge and report or notification to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\nThe independent auditor may receive a sanction for a warning, penalty surcharge, additional contribution to the joint fund for damages, restriction on performance of auditing works, recommendation for revocation of license for the certified public accountants involved, recommendation for suspension of business and report to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\nAdditionally, for a listed company -- whether on the main Kospi or secondary Kosdaq bourse -- a violation of accounting standards may subject the company to an eligibility review for possible delisting, and the trading of the company\u2019s shares will be suspended during the period of review.\nFinally, in the event a listed company is found to have made a false disclosure as a consequence of its violation, the shareholders of the company who have incurred damages from purchasing the company\u2019s stock in reliance of such false disclosure may file a class action suit against the company and its independent auditor.\nIn conclusion, given that the financial condition of a company serves as one of the key considerations affecting investors\u2019 decisions, it is axiomatic that investors will suffer substantial damages from an accounting fraud or deficiency that misstates the financial condition of the company.\nAccordingly, it is the responsibility of the company and independent auditor to prepare the financial statements and audit"}

Zaun to hear his thoughts.\"\nShould Iowa's university presidents be allowed tenure?\nJoe Gorton, a professor of criminology at the University of Northern Iowa, said the proposed legislation shows Zaun misunderstands how tenure works to ensure universities attract the best and the brightest faculty members, not to offer protection for those underperforming.\n\"Tenure does not prevent faculty from being terminated for just cause,\" said Gorton, who also serves as president of United Faculty, the union that represents UNI's 550 faculty members. \"It does prevent firing faculty for exercising our freedom to teach and conduct research about controversial or politically unpopular topics. This protection is a critical bulwark in the protection of American democracy.\"\nThe American Association of University Professors, a century-old professional organization for academics, defines tenure as \"an indefinite appointment that can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances such as financial exigency and program discontinuation.\"\nJoerg Tiede, an associate secretary for the national AAUP, described Zaun's bill as being \"part of a larger legislative assault on higher education in the U.S.\"\nA similar bill was introduced earlier this month in the Missouri Legislature.\nZaun, who chairs the Iowa Senate Judiciary Committee, said he has filed similar legislation during the past few years, but those bills received little attention because he was in the minority. Because Republicans now claim a majority of the Iowa Senate, however, some of his bills are receiving significantly more attention this session.\nSince the 2016 election gave Republicans control of both state legislative chambers and the governor's mansion, many faculty members have expressed concerns that Iowa might follow Wisconsin's recent example of weakening longstanding protections for tenured faculty.\n\"Abolishing tenure would destroy public higher education in the state of Iowa,\" said Loren Glass, a UI professor of English who chairs the membership committee for university's AAUP chapter. \"Any Iowan who cares about the quality and value of the degrees our public colleges and universities confer should oppose this bill.\"\nTiede said the bill before the Iowa Legislature would go beyond efforts in Wisconsin, where lawmakers removed long-standing tenure protections from state law and directed that state's Board of Regents draft new policy.\n\"This is stronger than what passed in Wisconsin,\" Tiede said. \"This is would prohibit the Iowa regents from having tenure at all.\"\nThe bill's prospects for becoming law remain unclear.\nSen.

But this excuse is invalid once you start working for a real company. And big companies don't take lightly to their employees taking 'self-care' days every time they reach their quota for social interaction.\nMore often than not, most companies will expound upon all the glories that would await you, should you just have 'good communication skills' and 'willing to work well in a team.' It's the Kryptonite for all introverts. For this particular introvert, just thinking about working in a team drains her just about as much as actually working in a team. Companies would also prefer you to be generally sociable: just to know you more as a person, build up inter-office relationships so that everything works well, and frankly, building a good rapport with the boss is a big part of being part of an office.\nNo matter how draining it seems, teamwork really does make the dream work\u2014as clich\u00e9 as it sounds. It's often more difficult for one person to get the job done on time or with the right degree of specialty, whereas a more diverse pool would find better solutions.\nThat doesn't change the fact that you are, at the core, an introvert who doesn't like any of these things. These are not your forte: while you're alright with going about these things sometimes, doesn't mean you're up for it all the time. So, how should you go about this?\nHere are a few things introverts bring to the big bad table that seems to be dominated by extroverts.\n1. It's not all mostly extroverts. It would be a gross misrepresentation to assume all the people you see around you, communicating and teamwork-ing are extroverts. They are just being professional, and you can do that too. You don't need to have a personal connection with people at work. Just fake it till you make it.\n2. Introverts make deadlines. I'm sure my editor would disagree, but most introverts don't miss deadlines. This comes from their straightforward focus on their jobs and less time wasted catching up on all the office gossip and whether or not Jim would finally date Pam.\n3. Not speaking doesn't mean not having anything to say. The idea is that introverts don't like talking right? But that's not always true. Find something an introvert is passionate about, and watch all that repressed passion just explode. Aim that at an issue the company is facing and you have a goldmine.\nAll in all, you'd find that introverts tend to have more things to bring to the table. They just would prefer they could take a nap to recharge first.\nAdiba Hossain is a final year law student and she's always stressed out.

He now speaks with young people on the verge of joining gangs and engaging in criminal activity, discussing his contrition over missing his children\u2019s upbringing and their anger at parents who are locked away.\nThe group he works with, Release Aging People in Prison, will attend the hearing, he said, to try to reshape the senators\u2019 image of parolees and communicate their contributions to society.\nGallivan notes that he voted to confirm each of the six new parole board members after exhaustive hearings and deemed them qualified. And the work of deciding who is fit for freedom inevitably involves a subjective element, he said, but added he is now unhappy with some of the new commissioners he approved.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s both philosophical but I also do think that there\u2019s a couple of individuals that aren\u2019t doing their job properly,\u201d Gallivan said, though he declined to name them.

In another room, a chatty inmate with almond-shaped eyes made animated gestures between sips of tea.\nThe military believes the first man has information about missing Americans. The other man is a high school teacher suspected of teaching insurgents how to make bombs. What the two tell interrogators could help save lives.\nThe grueling process does produce some successes. Maj. Gen. William Brandenburg, the new commander of U.S.-run prisons in Iraq, including Abu Ghraib, said interrogations at Abu Ghraib were instrumental in dismantling five or six car-bomb factories in recent weeks. Intelligence from the prison also led authorities this month to the shallow grave of William Bradley, a civilian truck driver from New Hampshire who'd been missing since his fuel convoy was ambushed west of Baghdad on April 9.\n\"Those kinds of victories, each and every one, collectively have an impact on the insurgency,\" Brandenburg said. \"Most of the operations done today are driven by human intelligence.\"\nThe Fallujah backlog has lessened now, and the last interrogation of the day begins at midnight. The military has time again for nagging cases, such as the suspect purportedly involved with the missing Americans and the alleged teacher-turned-bomber. Neither detainee was in the hot seat for the first time, Black told a Knight Ridder reporter who was offered a rare glimpse at interrogations under way.\nThe first man, middle-aged and quiet, was rounded up in a group of people believed to have information on the location of Americans \"killed in action,\" Black said. It was the man's second session in the debriefing room.\nThe only American soldier reported missing is Army Spc. Keith M. Maupin, who was ambushed along with two civilian contractors last April. A video released to Arab satellite TV channels purported to show Maupin shot in the head in front of a hole dug in the ground. Nine Americans were kidnapped in the ambush; one escaped, and six bodies later were found. There's been no word on the fate of the others.\nBlack would neither confirm nor deny that the interrogation involved Maupin's and the contractor's whereabouts.\nThe other man's case was older. He's an Iraqi teacher in his late 40s, and intelligence experts were trying to figure out his role in the insurgency, given his alleged expertise in remote-detonated bombs.\n\"Let's just say he was using his instructional background for a different kind of teaching,\" Black said.\nDuring questioning, analysts in adjacent observation rooms compared the suspects' previous statements with the new information they heard through headphones.

Heading into his fourth year at the helm, Davis' mentality remains the same.\n\"The expectation is to win a state championship as it always is,\" he said. \"We were young in some places but we are a lot better in some places [this year], especially on the defensive front.\"\nHere are three things to know about the Patriots ahead of Friday's season opener against Magnolia Heights.\nDavis said he liked what he saw from the defense in preseason play. Through two scrimmages, the unit has shown a propensity for turning turnovers into points while keeping opponents out of the endzone.\n\"We've had two scrimmages and scored three times on defense and only given up one touchdown. They've shown they'll execute,\" Davis said.\nThe Pats head coach said the strength of the unit lies up front in a defensive line led by All-MAIS selection John Cartwright and All-District linemen Jake Flynt and Samuel Shufelt. He praised the linebackers, a unit headlined by freshman Stone Blanton and senior Ridge Futral.\nWith some time and maturity that's sure to come through the grind of a season, Davis said the Pats can be really good offensively.\nMRA landed a new quarterback when junior Philip Short transferred in from Northwest Rankin. In limited time for the Cougars in 2017, Short completed 50 passes for 590 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\"I like his presence, arm strength and his decision making,\" Davis said. \"He still has to fully learn the system but when he does I think he'll be able to make some plays.\"\nShort should have plenty of options to throw to since MRA will implement a six-man rotation at wide receiver that features several players with the ability to make plays. Senior running back William Milam is returning from injury, and Davis expects him to be a threat to break off big plays as well.\nPreseason All-MAIS center Nicolas Rowan leads an offensive line that is breaking in three starters.\nMRA's schedule doesn't look too challenging based on the first four games. In that span, they'll face just one opponent, Briarcrest Christian, that won more than six games last season.\nBut that trend ends the second Friday of September when they square off against Copiah Academy, a team that won six games last season. From there, every team MRA faces the rest of the season won six or more games last year.\nThe true test of just how good this Patriots team can be will begin Sept. 28 against a Parklane Academy team that won 10 games in 2017. It doesn't get easier from there with games against Jackson Academy, Jackson Prep, Oak Forest Academy and Presbyterian Christian to round out the season.\n\"The thing for us is we have to do a better job being disciplined and playing at a level where nobody plays harder or more physical than us,\" Davis said. \"You can't make mistakes.\""}

The N PW Statesman, that bastion of ad- vanced ideas, was more Philistine than the Times. As late as 1940, when Moore showed his great works of the late thirties at the Leicester Galleries, the New Statesman called them \"ex- quisite chimney-piece ornaments . . . as deadly dryas late Stravinsky.\" Moore has never responded to vili- fication. Today, if hooligans tar-and- feather his work, as they have done at least once, he thinks it best to pretend that he hasn't heard ahout it. But in the thirties the attacks had consequences. Even Sir John Rothenstein, when he was director of the City Art Galleries in Sheffield in the nineteen-thirties, was timid about showing Moore, whom he admired greatly. \"The people there had never seen anything except 1850- to-I880 art,\" Sir John said recently. \"Therefore, I horrowed things by Pi- casso, Rouault, and Italian primitives- not by Henry MoorE: I wanted to avoid controversy.\" (The Picasso was Blue Period. ) Ultimately) the attacks cost Moore his job at the Royal Col- lege. A note in the official chronology of his life, in the first volume of the catalogup raisonn\u00e9 of his work, says primly, \"On expiration of appointment at the Royal College of Art moved to the Chelsea School of Art. . . .\" But the move was 1nvoluntary. It was in 1932, the year after his first Leicester Galleries show, that his appointment was up, and that he moved over to Chelsea, where Raymond Coxon was already teaching. The Morning Post review of the Leicester Galleries show had said it was a scandal that the p rpetrator of such monstrosities was allowed to pervert the young by teaching at the Royal College of Art. Moore's 1mmediate boss, who was academic, took the article to Sir William Rothenstein and demanded that Moore be fired. Then the Royal College of Art Old Students' Association, most of whom were art teachers, passed a resolution demanding the same thing. Moore had not minded the newspaper abuse (to be attacked by the ignorant can be con- strued as a good sign), but now he felt that he was a burden to his old patron Sir William. He offered to find a job teaching somewhere else (Chelsea had already approached him), and, a little to his surprise, Sir William accepted his offer.

The Oct. 22 Chilean government statement denied this report.\nSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 The president of an appeals court in Chile has denied reports that the court will order the Archdiocese of Santiago to pay some $650,000 to three victims of a laicized priest at the center of the sexual-abuse scandal in that country.\n\u201cThere is no ruling; no sentence has been issued, nor is there even a draft decision,\u201d Dobra Lusic, the president of the Court of Appeals of Santiago, said in an Oct. 22 statement.\nThe lawsuit against the archdiocese was rejected in March 2017. The plaintiffs appealed, and the case was heard by a Chilean appellate court on Thursday.\nChilean newspaper La Tercera reported Oct. 21 that a decision in the case was expected to be issued Monday.\nLa Tercera reported that the archdiocese would be ordered to pay \u201cmoral damages\u201d of 450 million pesos for its efforts to cover up crimes committed against minors. While the verdict would be open to appeal to the country\u2019s Supreme Court, it would reportedly have been the highest judgment rendered against the Church in Chile.\nThe Oct. 22 statement released by the Chilean government denied this report.\nThe three plaintiffs in the lawsuit, James Hamilton, Jose Andres Murillo and Juan Carlos Cruz, say they were sexually abused by Father Fernando Karadima over a period of years. The public testimony of the men, especially Cruz, was instrumental in bringing the Chilean abuse crisis to international attention.\nThe suit argues that Cardinals Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz and Ricardo Ezzati were responsible for covering up Karadima\u2019s crimes. Cardinal Ezzati is the archbishop of Santiago; Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz is his predecessor.\nProtests against the promotion of Bishop Juan Barros, alleged to have been one of Karadima\u2019s proteges and protectors, turned the Chilean sexual-abuse crisis into a global concern for the Church. The matter escalated during a papal visit to the country in January 2018, during which Pope Francis initially defended Bishop Barros.\nCruz and other victims traveled to Rome earlier this year to meet in private with the Pope, who expressed public regret for failing to act on the matter earlier and for expressing skepticism about the allegations.\nBishop Barros\u2019 resignation was accepted by the Pope in June.\nKaradima, 88, was a highly influential Santiago-area priest who for decades led a lay movement from his parish in El Bosque. He is considered to have personally fostered around 40 vocations to the priesthood.\nWhile Karadima himself has never stood trial for his alleged crimes because of the statute of limitations, the hierarchy of the Church in Chile stands accused of systematically covering up his abuse and of doing the same for other accused priests.\nOn Sept. 27, Pope Francis laicised Karadima, expelling him from the clerical state in a move the Vatican described as an \u201cexceptional measure\u201d taken in response to the \u201cexceptional damage\u201d done by Karadima\u2019s crimes.\nFollowing a crisis meeting May 15-17, during which the Pope expressed his anger at evidence of systematic attempts to suppress and ignore allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the country, 34 Chilean bishops submitted their resignations.\nTo date, Francis has accepted seven"}

While these obscure labels may be unfamiliar, these are backed by thousands of glowing reviews and customer before-and-after\u2019s to boot.\nMany indie and up-and-coming brands often look to Amazon as their entry-level marketplace to sell their merchandise because there\u2019s little overhead and the platform reduces the need for fancy marketing endeavors and social media campaigning without compromising visibility to potential customers. With that being said, just because these under-the-radar brands may or not be available for sale in brick and mortar beauty stores, and may have less than stellar logos and packaging designs, the astonishingly above-average reviews to rating ratios have elevated these products to beauty\u2019s coveted cult status sector- not mention the fact that they\u2019ve also become regulars in our shopping carts.\nOf course, another bonus to less than luxe art direction and packaging, is that these products retain their efficacy without heightening the price to pay for a team of graphic designers or a social media department.

New, revised figures show growth decelerated by two-tenths of a percentage point in the first three months, versus the initial estimate of a minus 0.7% drop.\nWhile blame is placed on the cold weather and the west coast port strikes, Stephanie Pomboy at MacroMavens notes a weird anomaly that may explain why growth continues to flatten.\nConsumer spending growth is key to the U.S. economy. But spending slowed just as job growth stepped up, as the U.S. economy continues to muddle through in its seventh year of the weakest recovery in the postwar era. Since President Obama took office in January 2009, GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 1.8%.\n\u201cIt should be patently clear that something isn\u2019t what it purports to be on the surface,\u201d Pomboy says. Something else is trimming away at consumer wallets, besides glacial job and wage growth.\nSomething that a rejiggering of one-seventh of the U.S. economy didn\u2019t stop\u2014inexorably rising healthcare costs, that, along with the downward trend in salaried jobs, is dragging on consumer spending and in turn sectors like retail, dependent on these outlays.\nPomboy says: \u201cSpending on healthcare (insurance and services) has increased $232 billion over the last twelve months.\u201d But that increase accounts for a big \u201ctwo-thirds of the $353 billion in consumer spending and one-third of the $666 billion growth in total GDP over the stretch,\u201d she says.\nAnd wage gains are being wiped out by rising health costs. \u201cThe increase in healthcare outlays over the last year is roughly equal to the $284 billion in wage gains for households during that time,\u201d Pomboy says.\nDespite all the promises that health reform would take a meat axe to health costs, consumers are spending more on health care. Total national health expenditures amounted to $2.9 trillion, up from $2.6 trillion in 2010, the year health reform was enacted, says Kaiser Family Foundation, as the health industry blob that runs our medical system continues to expand.\nBut ask anyone in the Administration or supporters of health reform about that, and they become about as animated as a CPR dummy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s shovel-ready money printing to create confidence, spending, and job growth has been undone by the high cost of affordable health care.\nJust as concerning, Pomboy says, is the change in consumer credit, a government release that usually comes in the dead zone hour of 3 p.m. on a Friday afternoon.\nAnother not-so good trend: How we now define jobs, which might also explain flat to tepid wage growth. \u201cThis ain\u2019t our old economy. In fact, it is changing before our eyes,\u201d says Pomboy.\nThe analyst notes that, in the last three months, total nonfarm employment increased 537,000. Dig deeper, and you\u2019ll find a 219,000 drop in salaried workers that was offset by a 756,000 gain in the ranks of the self-employed, who may earn less, notably in the way of benefits.\n\u201cOf course no mention of the boom in \u2018bloggers\u2019\u201d anywhere \u201cin the giddy celebration of the jobs numbers and the economy\u2019s virility,\u201d Pomboy"}

At my call center, managers \"listened in\" to assess the impact of the sales conversation, to identify missed opportunities for upselling pen and ink refills, and to coach us on better advising customers to purchase lap desks they never knew they needed in the first place. Though I dubbed my supervisor \"director of wiretapping,\" my sales doubled after I implemented her feedback. Mousepads and folios flew off warehouse shelves. Never in my career, before or since, have I received more feedback on my own advice-giving than I did after those late nights by the phone.\nThese days, we give a lot of lip service to increasing the amount of feedback given to teachers. Research indicates that these efforts are worthwhile. Teachers' improvement can be predicted by the extent of their interactions with those more expert in teaching and by the extent to which they seek instructional advice from their colleagues. Further, in order for classroom observations to be meaningful to teachers, they must be accompanied by high-quality feedback.\nThe problem is that districts and states are spending an increasing amount of time training observers to measure performance, but very little time training them to give useful feedback. Identifying the difference between \"proficient\" and \"effective\" differentiation, for example, isn't worth much if you can't support a teacher in understanding how this plays out in the classroom and what would make a positive difference to his or her students.\n\"Teachers don\u2019t want a blank check. They want a useful conversation between professionals.\"\nTeachers don't want a blank check. They want a useful conversation between professionals.\nWhen we spoke to administrators, we learned that few of them received formal training on feedback delivery. Instead, they relied on their impression of what good feedback sounds like, either learned through trial and error or recalled from the days when they were teachers. We might call this the \"folkways of feedback.\"\n\u2022 Listen in. Ask observers to audiotape feedback conversations for formative purposes. A cheap way to do this is with smartphones, but remote conversations can be recorded with webinar software, like Adobe Connect. With permission, those tapes can be used for administrator self-reflection, school-leader professional development, or feedback calibration. Observers and coaches want to get better, too.\n\u2022 Collect teacher-level satisfaction data. This is to identify those who are finding the feedback they receive useful. Even easier, ask teachers to nominate great feedback-givers. Find those exemplary coaches and administrators, and ask them to share what they are doing right.\n\u2022 Consider letting teachers videotape their own lessons. These tapes could then be submitted to observers. Many observation platforms allow for tagging comments onto specific moments of the video, closed-captioning style.

The story is ridiculously wrong. Gossip Cop can debunk it.\nThe tabloid\u2019s bogus story is based on a photo of Suri wheeling a suitcase outside of her New York apartment building earlier this month. The unreliable outlet doesn\u2019t bother to mention that the young girl was accompanied by her mom, who was carrying luggage of her own. Suri didn\u2019t pack her bags and flee home.\nIn reality, Holmes and Suri traveled together to Greece to visit a refugee camp. The outlet either fails to realize this or deceptively decided not to mention it. Either way, Gossip Cop can confirm that the 12-year-old didn\u2019t run away from home to see her dad. The publication took a photo of Suri wheeling a suitcase and decided to create a phony narrative out of it.\nAdditionally, the tabloid never bothers to mention how Suri planned on finding her dad or where she was supposedly heading by herself. Cruise may have a home in Florida, but he\u2019s been in California shooting Top Gun: Maverick for the past few months. Did the 12-year-old somehow discover her dad\u2019s exact whereabouts and manage to book a flight without parental supervision? In addition to being false, the magazine\u2019s story is illogical. More importantly, it\u2019s provably untrue.\nThe gossip media has very little insight into the relationship between Cruise and his estranged daughter. Gossip Cop frequently debunks stories surrounding nonexistent reunions between the pair. Most recently, we busted a report about Cruise and Suri meeting up in Orlando.

{"idx": "5087", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer on an annual basis within the United States. However, when it comes to cause of death, no cancer is more terrifying than lung cancer.\nThe deadliest type of cancer ACS statistics point to an estimated 221,200 cases of lung and bronchus cancer diagnosed in 2015, with an estimated 158,040 people dying from the disease, or more than one in four cancer-related deaths. In other words, lung cancer kills as many people each year as breast, colon, prostate, and pancreatic cancer combined.It&apos;s a statistic I hold near and dear to my heart, as I lost my mother to lung cancer in 2010.\nWhat&apos;s even more worrisome is that, while the survival rate has moved substantially higher in other cancer types over the last couple of decades, lung cancer five-year survival rates haven&apos;t witnessed much of an uptick, rising from 12% between 1972 and 1978 to 18% between 2004 and 2010. ACS data demonstrates that five-year survival rates for localized lung cancer are slightly better than 50%, but survival rates for regional or metastasized lung cancer drop to 27% and 4%, respectively, after five years.\nImproved consumer education regarding the dangers of smoking has certainly played some role in stymying lung cancer. Unfortunately, lung cancer isn&apos;t a disease only reserved for smokers. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important for drug developers to devote ample resources to discovering new treatment pathways for this terrible disease.\nLung cancer treatment gets personal The good news is that we may be on the cusp of seeing pharmaceutical companies make a genuine dent into lung cancer -- and it all ties back into the push toward personalizing treatments for patients.\nIn previous decades, global chemotherapies were used to treat lung cancer. While those chemotherapies -- often platinum-based -- did usually lead to some cancer cell death, they also killed proliferating cells indiscriminately, meaning healthy cells perished as well and the patient wound up dealing with a poor quality of life during treatment. New therapies seek to change this, with efficacy and response rates much improved from past-generation global treatments.\nHere are a few lung cancer treatments (some approved, and some still in clinical trials) that are making things personal, and could push the survival and quality of life needles significantly higher.\nKeytruda & OpdivoIn terms of therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration, few have been as exciting as cancer immunotherapies Keytruda from Merck and Opdivo from Bristol Myers-Squibb .\nCancer immunotherapies work by enhancing the body&apos;s immune system to more efficiently locate and kill cancer cells. Most cancer cells are able to go undetected by the immune system, which is what allows them to grow and potentially spread. Checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda and Opdivo attempt to fight the immunosuppressant quality of cancer cells and \"turn on\" the immune system to attack these foreign cells.\nKeytruda and Opdivo were both approved first as treatments for an advanced type of melanoma, but have been given the green light by the FDA this year to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer.

I\u2019m a huge fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Not just the \u201chas merchandise, owns the whole show, owns the whole soundtrack, owns the whole manga\u201d type of fan. I\u2019m also the \u201cgoes to anime conventions to give talks about what it all means\u201d sort of fan. And for lack of a better topic, I\u2019m going to use that presentation\u2019s content for this week.\nFirst we need to consider Evangelion\u2019s historical context. It aired in the 90\u2019s when the anime industry as a whole had started to stagnate. There wasn\u2019t anything new going on. Lots of overused tropes, lots of cash-ins on toy brands and such (not that this is entirely different today, but it suffices to say that it was pretty bad). Then, into this scene stepped Evangelion, along with the likes of Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, and a variety of other anime. Anime such as these were revolutionary for a number of reasons, including standardizing the 26 episode run-time.\nHowever, I feel that Evangelion was particularly interesting because of how brutally it criticized the anime industry and anime fans in general. The discussion of Evangelion as a deconstruction merits an entirely separate post, but for now, just consider Asuka\u2019s character. The tsundere is a widely loved character archetype, and Asuka presents herself as the ideal tsundere from the moment she steps on screen: flamboyant and aggressive, with a bit of a soft side. But later we learn that this is actually just desperate, attention-seeking behavior. In this way, Evangelion\u2019s creator, Hideaki Anno, is likely trying to critique the archetype and people who fawn over it by presenting a more realistically motivated interpretation.\nAnd now, imagine yourself in Hideaki Anno\u2019s shoes. You release this harsh deconstruction and watch as it not only popularizes the archetypes you were critiquing, but also instrumentally brings anime to the west and generates even more thoughtlessly fanatical fans across the pacific. It\u2019s no wonder Anno is on record saying that he hates his creation.\nMore than the show, though, Anno hates the fans. The man is on record as saying that he\u2019s trying to ruin the franchise at this point, but no matter what he does, the fans eat it up. They clamor for more (I am also guilty of this). There\u2019s really quite a bit of hilarious black irony to be understood here, and I recommend you look into this more if you have time."}

Our findings show the exact opposite: High-end link building has an immediate and persistent positive impact. I\u2019ll explain further and share our data here.\nKledzik\u2019s study was on a moderately large site with roughly 200K pages and focused on moderately difficult keyword rankings. She correctly points out that with a multiplicity of variables, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the impact of any given ranking factor (such as a link).\nOur study was conducted entirely differently and, I think, gives a better picture of why, in our experience, the impact of links is immediate and persistent.\nconcentrated in a very short time frame, with the actual link-building component constrained to just a few days.\nLower authority. In general, these small business sites have lower authority \u2014 therefore, we\u2019d expect the impact of any changes to be more dramatic.\nA massive influx of links. For these clients, we didn\u2019t create just one or two new links, but rather made a concerted campaign to drive a large volume of high-quality, relevant links in a short period of time, sometimes increasing the volume of quality links by 50 percent to 300 percent in less than two weeks.\nFocus on traffic instead of rankings. We use traffic as our metric of success, not rankings, because traffic captures long-tail queries and site-wide benefits to individual links and is more relevant as it translates into actual business. This is more pronounced with local businesses like law firms, as local results are heavily influenced by links; therefore, overall site traffic should grow faster with overall domain authority improvements. This is especially the case in hyper-competitive localized markets like legal, where all best-practice fundamentals are in place and a site\u2019s authority profile is a tie-breaker when it comes to visibility.\nFewer variables. Because we are dealing with small business websites, there are fewer additional variables that could explain traffic fluctuations. For these sites, nothing else is happening beyond these link-building campaigns.\nMethodology note: Some of these link-building campaigns were undertaken in response to current events. In the graphs below, I\u2019ve filtered out SEO traffic going to that specific content because I wanted to note the difference in traffic to the rest of the content on the site.\nIn this situation, we ran a link-building program for a law firm involving a specific women\u2019s rights issue. All links were generated within a three-day time period. Inbound traffic jumped immediately by roughly 20 percent upon launch of the campaign.\nWe represented a law firm filing a class action suit against a restaurant chain and utilized social media to reach out to prospective litigants and concurrently generated links regarding the suit. In the graph below, you can see a 17-percent increase in inbound search traffic (bottom graph) immediately after the massive influx of traffic from the paid social media campaign (top graph).\nThis was a one-off link-building engagement, in which our client filed an injury suit against a very well-known technology company. The resulting coverage in large nationwide news sites spilled over into secondary news sites, with 114 domains linking overall.\nYou can see the bump in search traffic (driven by brand name search), followed by an immediate and persistent 46-percent increase"}

A study using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed dysfunction in a region of the brain known as the Amygdala.\nThe Amygdala is located in the middle of the brain and helps process emotion, fear and memory.\nSpecifically, two areas of the Amygdala were of interest: the basolateral (bottom) and centromedial (top) region.\nThese areas are important because of their proximity to other regions of the brain. The basolateral region is linked to the occipital lobe, a brain area responsible for vision, hearing, memory, high level emotions and cognition.\nThe centromedial region is close to the deeper regions of the brain. Specifically, several links are here: the thalamus (an information flow regulator), the brain stem (a controller of heart rate, breathing and neuro-chemical release) and lastly, the cerebellum (control motor skills).\nIn the study, people with GAD displayed a \"mixed up\" communications pattern in their amygdala. Rather than connect to the appropriate function in the respective brain regions, the basolateral region became connected to the centromedial targets and vice versa.\nThe overall reduced connectivity in both regions of the amygdala results in difficulty in determining the importance of stimuli.\nThe result?

The immigration debate plays this role in Mexican-American relations. For a time, the trade dispute over softwood lumber (yes, really) fulfilled this function in Canadian-American relations: At stake were different attitudes toward the role of government in industry, Canada\u2019s sensitivity to American economic power, and many other things besides, though you wouldn\u2019t know it if you weren\u2019t paying attention.\nIn Central Europe, the outstanding example of this phenomenon is the ongoing discussion of the Katyn massacre, the memory of which continues to shape the relationship between Poland and Russia. At stake is an event that took place exactly 70 years ago: the Soviet Union\u2019s murder of some 20,000 Polish officers in the spring of 1940. The officers had been captured by the Red Army, which invaded eastern Poland in 1939, just after Nazi Germany invaded from the west. Soviet secret policemen murdered them on the direct order of Stalin. Later, Stalin switched sides, joined the Allies against Hitler, and blamed the Germans for the officers\u2019 murders. That lie remained part of official Soviet and Polish Communist history until communism collapsed and the Soviet Union fell apart. In 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet Communist leader, took responsibility for the murders, and in 1991, the first Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, published the archival documentation.\nSeventy years is a long time: The grandchildren of the officers who died at Katyn are now middle-aged and elderly. Yet only last month, a Russian magazine sued a Polish magazine for \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201canti-Russian sentiments,\u201d because, among other things, it had published historically accurate articles about Katyn. A couple of years ago, a Russian archivist told me that Russian members of parliament had been pressing him to work on the story: They wanted him to prove that the Germans really had committed the murders and that President Yeltsin had faked those archival documents in order to curry favor with the West.\nIn fact, \u201cKatyn denial\u201d has become, among certain Russian politicians and journalists, a vehicle for expressing anger at Poland\u2019s wholehearted embrace of Western institutions and of Western-style democracy\u2014and this is how Poles understand it. In 2007, a Russian government-owned newspaper printed a nasty review of a Polish movie about the massacres\u2014 Katyn, by Andrzej Wajda\u2014and Russian cinemas subsequently refused to show the film. Rightly or wrongly, Poles interpreted these decisions as proof that Russia still harbors imperial designs on its neighbors. This is not an argument about history, in other words, but rather an argument about contemporary politics conducted in the form of a historical debate.\nAll of which is a roundabout way of explaining why the showing of that film on Russian state television last Friday night was so surprising. All agree that Katyn could not have been shown without the personal agreement of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

Arriving at the Capitol to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, Hicks, dressed in a wide-lapel navy-blue coat, turned her contoured face toward the camera and gave a perfect, ten-out-of-ten smize. \u201cSmizing\u201d\u2014smiling with your eyes\u2014is a neologism that Tyra Banks, the host of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d coined to teach the show\u2019s contestants how to hold a viewer\u2019s attention. To smile without smizing is merely to gesture emptily toward an expression, like a school kid holding a grin for a class picture, or a politician who has already shaken fifty hands and must now shake a fifty-first. But to smize without smiling is to create a frisson of mystery, a hint of some secret mental calculus at work behind the mask of the face.\nThis is harder than it seems. Smizing takes skill. Try it out in your bathroom mirror: you will likely do too much and wind up with crazy eyes (crize?), or do so little that the change is imperceptible. Mona Lisa smizes. The young woman in Vermeer\u2019s \u201cPortrait of a Young Woman\u201d smizes. And, walking into what turned out to be a nine-hour session of questioning about what she may or may not have known regarding Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 election, Hicks smized as if her life depended on it\u2014which, to some extent, it did. If you are going to tell Congress that working as the communications director for the Trump White House involves telling only \u201cwhite lies,\u201d you\u2019d better come with your game face on.\nOr could there be something more to Hicks\u2019s expression, a certain demure acknowledgment that she has finally wound up as the focus of all those camera flashes? During her tenure on Team Trump, Hicks has made a point of avoiding the spotlight. This has involved some bizarre contortions. When the reporter Olivia Nuzzi profiled her for GQ, in 2016, Hicks, then the Trump campaign\u2019s press secretary, declined to be interviewed but opted to sit in the room as Nuzzi interviewed Trump about her. As photogenic as she is, she has tended to appear in the background of White House images\u2014a wise choice, when your boss is a megalomaniac. (There are exceptions. Last fall, at a state dinner in Japan, Hicks made headlines by appearing in a black tuxedo and floppy bow tie, like a Bond girl in Marlene Dietrich drag, upstaging even the First Lady.) Hicks has earned a reputation as a gifted Trump-whisperer, placating the President while resolutely stonewalling the rest of us; never has a White House communications director been so uncommunicative with the public. But her image as an enigmatic, sober figure in a fun house of buffoons has been crucial to her work, and to her success. It is easy to underestimate a young, attractive woman in a position of great responsibility, to see her as a pawn rather than a player on her own terms.\nRecently, though,"}

Seeds were grown into salad sprouts. Whole grains were ground and baked into bread loaves using natural sourdough leavening.\nWe foraged in fields and streams and were rewarded with wild herbs and fish.\nLiving quarters were minimalist, containing only the most necessary pieces of furniture. Roll-up mattresses in lieu of beds freed up floor space during the day; the same principle applied to fold-up work tables and chairs.\nWe made jewelry using recycled metal wires and found objects: pretty shells, colorful pebbles, glass beads from old clothes. On cold nights, their families gathered under crocheted blankets.\nOur generation painted, wrote songs and poems, practiced yoga, believed in freedom, preached equality for all, and showed respect for Mother Nature. Our parents called us hippies.\nToday, our grandchildren are echoing the same mantras we chanted as we hugged trees and tried to save animals and plants from extinction. What goes around comes around.\nFood sustainability begins at the source of what we eat, and goes on to the growing, harvesting, preparing, cooking, and dealing with leftovers.\nToday we are all enjoined to \u201cbuy local\u201d in order to reduce transportation (and therefore fuel) costs while at the same time assisting food producers in our own communities.\nLocal farmers and fishermen are taught to avoid chemical pesticides fertilizers and artificial growth enhancers, as well as antibiotics. Harvesting of ocean products is done with methods that do not hurt young fish, protected species, and their natural habitat.\nHome cooking ensures that the ingredients retain as much of the original nutrients as possible, using methods that conserve fuel and do not pollute the atmosphere.\nTo minimize waste, only the necessary amount of food should be prepared; any excess should be saved and shared with others or recycled in ingenious ways.\nOne of the best ways to avoid waste is the freezer \u201cdump bag\u201d used to separately store animal bones and trimmings and vegetables: peels, stems, and leaves.\nThe animal dump bag produces great soup stock for gravies and stews. These days, I produce excellent ramen stock that would put Osaka\u2019s best to shame.\nSimply dump bones, skin, and meat trimmings into a pot and simmer at very low heat for several hours, skimming off the foam that rises to the surface. Add trimmings from onions, carrots, celery, garlic, and onion leaves.\nCook until ligaments and soft bones disintegrate and broth is creamy and thick.\nThe vegetable dump bag contents can be chopped and added to soups, stews, and stir-fries.\nMeycauayan has surely gone a long way from the days when it was the center of the Philippine tanning industry.\n"}

The funds announced today come from Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) and are in the form of an extended services grant that will build on those earlier efforts.\n\"Based on a comprehensive needs assessment that the district conducted, the sense that school is an unsafe place still pervades the community, and severe post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and grief continue to affect students' performance in and outside of the classroom,\" according to the Education Department.\nWhile previous awards addressed \"the entire school community,\" the latest grant will be more narrowly targeted to those \"who were directly impacted by the incident,\" the Education Department said.\nThe combined funding makes Newtown the recipient of some of the largest Project SERV grants ever awarded. Project SERV \"awards immediate-services and extended-services grants to school districts, colleges, and universities that have experienced a significant traumatic event and need resources to respond, recover, and re-establish safe environments for students.\" Combined with funding from the Department of Justice for safety efforts, Newtown has received a combined total of a little more than $15 million in federal funds since the shootings, U.S. Rep. Elizabeth H. Esty, D-Conn., said in the conference call.\n\"Those needs remain, and this long-term support over this school year and the next school year is very necessary,\" Esty said.\nU.S. Sen.

Perhaps it\u2019s got something to do with the fact people can make music at home and don\u2019t need to form bands as much anymore. People prefer to just do it on their computers as a two-piece rather than a band. It just seems like that stream has been cut short.\nIs \u201948:13\u2032 the album to give it a kick up the backside?

Tembec\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Restructuring Capital Associates, a long time shareholder with a 17.1 per cent stake, also opposed the transaction.\nTogether the two shareholders had the potential to nix the deal, which was being done by way of a plan of arrangement and which required the support of two-thirds of the voting shareholders.\nOaktree\u2019s plan, combined with Restructuring Capital\u2019s opposition, drew a quick response: About a week after their opposition became known, Rayonier and Tembec agreed to a new deal.\nThat higher price did the trick and the two dissident shareholders gave their blessing. At the July 27 shareholders meeting, 95.04 per cent voted for the transaction.\nSecondly, when Rayonier emerged with a new higher offer the market lost the opportunity for a hearing on so-called empty voting \u2014 a situation in which a shareholder votes on a transaction but in which it has no economic interest. The situation occurs because of the difference in time between the record date (the date that gives a shareholder the right to vote provided they own shares on that date) and the meeting date. The shareholder has no economic interest because, after voting, it then sells its shares to another shareholder who is not allowed to vote \u2014 even though they have a stake.\nBut Fairfax, which didn\u2019t enter a lock-up agreement, went on a stock-selling binge.

The purpose of this citizen's arrest was to bring the subject back into the mainstream media and to remind people that Blair is a war criminal. I understood that he would not take me up on the offer to accompany me to a police station; it would be naive of me to believe that he would come voluntarily. My attempt has been widely reported across the world, with many supporting my decision.\nTo quote Desmond Tutu: \"The then leaders of the United States and Great Britain fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies.\" Tutu pointed out that different standards appear to be set for prosecuting African leaders and western ones \u2013 the death toll during and after the Iraq conflict is sufficient on its own for Blair and George W Bush to be tried at the international criminal court. I am inclined to agree that Blair is partly responsible for the deaths of between 100,000 and one million people since 2003, depending on which estimates you believe. The United Nations estimates that in the last year alone at least 7,818 civilians and 1,050 members of the security forces were killed in violent attacks across Iraq \u2013 the highest death toll in five years.\nAnalysis of the war from a legal standpoint is not something anyone should be confused about. The then UN secretary general Kofi Annan said in September 2004: \"From our point of view and the UN charter point of view, it [the war] was illegal.\" The violations of the UN charter are a serious matter. It was created to promote international co-operation and to achieve peace and security. Blair's actions flew in the face of this agreement, unleashing a hellish wave of violence that is still ongoing. The war in Iraq may well have helped to boost al-Qaida recruitment, according to a 2004 report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which stated: \"It is probable that recruitment generally has accelerated on account of Iraq.\" Yet it seems all of this has been forgotten.\nThe soon-to-be-published Chilcot report is expected to contain damning evidence surrounding how Blair and Bush jointly engaged in a rush to war to topple Saddam Hussein in the face of warnings of the risks of triggering sectarian divisions across the region. Blair lied to this country and the international community in 2003, and he is still perpetuating these same mistruths. There has been some backlash against Blair's Observer article this weekend, calling him out on inaccuracies. As Jonathan Eyal, of the Royal United Services Institute, puts it: \"It was not the lack of sufficient knowledge about history and religion which led to the Iraqi debacle, but the lack of restraint among politicians who had all the relevant information at their fingertips.\"\nWhen I confronted Blair he told me I should be \"more concerned with Syria\". Yet if he had come clean about his decisions to go to war, if he had not mislead the international community on his motives, we would not be seeing a unanimous dragging of heels when it comes to intervention in Syria. The international community is scared to intervene in Syria because of the mess Blair and Bush made of Iraq.\nIn 2004, in a statement to the Butler inquiry, Blair said: \""}

Those results appeared to be on track, but shares have dropped more than 4% as of the time of this writing. What happened? Here are the highlights.\nBy the numbersThat reactionary fall didn&apos;t stem from an earnings miss. CVS posted earnings of $1.27 billion -- up 2.1% year over year. On a GAAP basis, that translated to $1.12 per share. Adjusted earnings for second quarter were $1.22 per share excluding $0.03 ofacquisition-related transaction and financing costs. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share.\nCVS Health reported revenue of $37.17 billion in the second quarter. That figure reflected a 7.4% increase over the results from the same quarter last year. It also fell roughly in line with the consensus analysts&apos; expectation of $37.18 billion in revenue.\nLarry Merlo, CVS&apos; President and CEO, stated that results for the second quarter \"exceeded our expectations.\" The company also narrowed its full-year 2015 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of$5.11-$5.18 per share, citing the \"strong performance this quarter.\"\nBehind the numbersAn earnings beat. Revenue in line with expectations. A narrowing of the full-year outlook based on a strong second quarter. So what caused CVS&apos; shares to decline?\nLet&apos;s start with the last item -- full-year outlook. While CVS Health did narrow its earnings guidance and raised the bottom of the projected range, it wasn&apos;t all great news. The previous guidance provided was $5.08-$5.19 per share. The company&apos;s narrowing lowered the upper end of the range to $5.18 per share.\nAlso, CVS&apos; revenue technically missed the consensus analysts&apos; estimate -- albeit by a hair. The company&apos;s pharmacy benefits management unit is still performing nicely, with an 11.9% year-over-year jump in revenue thanks in large part to strong specialty pharmacy growth. However, retail pharmacy revenue growth of 2.2% year over year was more sluggish.\nThe company&apos;s retail unit continues to experience lower volumes of customers shopping in its stores. While that is being offset to some degree by customers buying more, it is still a concern. One key reason behind the softer customer traffic is CVS&apos; removal of tobacco products from all of its stores in the second half of last year.\nBut while the market might have focused on nitpicking the negatives from CVS Health&apos;s results, more careful parsing of the numbers gives reason for encouragement. The upper end of the company&apos;s full-year earnings guidanceis still higher than Wall Street&apos;s estimate of $5.16 per share. CVS continued its streak of beating earnings estimates.\nLooking aheadThere&apos;s plenty to think about regarding the future prospects for CVS Health. The company&apos;s proposed acquisitions of Omnicarealong with Target&apos;spharmacies and clinics should prove to be smart moves over the long run.\nCVS should also continue to benefit from demographic trends in the U.S. Increasing numbers of aging Americans will likely lead to increasing prescription drug usage -- which is a great opportunity for the company&apos;s retail stores and PBM business."}

Social media is one of those topics. In my practice as a Divorce Financial Strategist\u2122, I am seeing more and more that not only can social networks and digital communications contribute to the breakup of a marriage, they can have unforeseen consequences in divorce settlement negotiations, as well.\nFacebook, MySpace, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media and professional networking websites and smartphone applications have become an important part of how people interact in today\u2019s culture. They\u2019re fun and useful, and these days, they\u2019re second nature to many of us. When something happens in our lives, we post about it to let our friends know. When something happens in our careers, we update our profiles to enhance professional connections. We\u2019re sharing personal and professional news, triumphs and tragedies, laughs and tears . . . . and lots and lots of pictures.\nUnfortunately, though, we sometimes do this without thinking through all the potential consequences. Not every \u201cfriend\u201d is a friend. Not every connection is an ally. And many times, a message you thought was private turns out to be anything but.\nOnline activity can provide clues to hidden assets or other dirty tricks.\nMarried couples often have dozens of mutual friends and connections. If the marriage breaks up, obviously some of these people will be more loyal to one spouse than the other. I\u2019ve had more than one client report a steady stream of information about her estranged husband\u2019s financial activities, as relayed by mutual friends who were still following his Facebook updates. So, even if he\u2019s blocked you from seeing his posts directly, your mutual friends can still tell you all about the ski trip he took to Switzerland with his girlfriend a week after claiming he couldn\u2019t afford to pay spousal support.\nYes, we can definitely add social media activity to the list of signs that your husband may be hiding assets during divorce. Sometimes it isn\u2019t the husband\u2019s online activity that gives him away, but his friends\u2019. Maybe your husband\u2019s pals shared pictures of their trip to Vegas in his new BMW, or his girlfriend updated her Facebook status to exclaim over an expensive present, when he just pleaded in Court that he\u2019s broke. Or maybe a college friend of his suddenly appeared in pictures with a \u201cnew\u201d boat \u2013one you recognize as your husband\u2019s, and suspect that this pal is holding it for him until your divorce is finalized. If you think your husband may be hiding assets, social media activity might well bear out your suspicions.\nYou might also check to see what your husband is saying about himself on dating websites, compared to what he\u2019s saying about himself in Court. Don\u2019t assume he\u2019s been smart enough to keep a low profile. His ego might overcome his better judgment.\nEmail and text messages can be admissible evidence in Court.\nIn addition to activity on social media and networking websites, emails and texts \u2013 the routine ways we communicate today \u2013 can sometimes be subpoenaed and gone through with a fine-tooth comb.\nIf your husband refers even obliquely to an impending bonus, a new job offer, or a plan to \u201cget away from it all for a few days,\u201d this might be evidence that he is not telling the truth on his Financial Affidavit. At the very least, it could call his credibility into serious question.\nFamily lawyers advise their clients not to put anything in an email, a text message, online or anywhere that they don\u2019t want the judge to read.

{"idx": "5138", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: China Seeing Dawn of a Labor Movement?\nThis story was filed by CBS News correspondent Celia Hatton in Beijing.\nStriking autoworkers in southern China demanding better pay and job benefits? Just a few weeks ago, that's not something you would have seen in the media headlines here.\nSince foreign companies began flooding into China in the 1980s, low-wage laborers have formed the backbone of the country's flourishing economy. Few other countries could offer an almost endless supply of relatively well-educated, healthy young laborers who would toil for long shifts without complaint.\nThe only legal labor unions in China are sanctioned by the Chinese government, which has ample reason to keep work disputes to a minimum.\nThat could be changing. About 1,900 workers at a Honda manufacturing plant in southern China's Guangdong province successfully negotiated a pay raise after walking off the job for more than ten days. The company had reportedly been hiring trainees to work for less than the Chinese minimum wage of $920 a month.\nNearby, employees at Foxconn, a major manufacturer of Apple products, Nokia phones and Dell computers, are gaining an average 20% raise after a spate of suicides captured international attention. The Chinese media also reported a one-day work stoppage at an auto parts plant outside Beijing that supplies Hyundai.\nChina has long been hailed as the \"world's factory\" but, until now, few have asked what goes on behind the factory's closed doors. In the case of Foxconn, labor activists have complained about conditions there for years, but the world's media ignored the problem until young workers began to kill themselves at an alarming rate.\nSome analysts point out that a factory that employs 400,000 people is the size of a small city; of course some people within such a huge group would commit suicide, they argue. But even if the suicides can be attributed to a variety of things going on in the victims' lives, it's still difficult to shrug away the allegations of military-style discipline used by the company.\nEven China's tight-lipped state-controlled media have devoted front-page coverage to the issue, detailing stories of Foxconn workers who paid middlemen to score jobs on the manufacturing lines, only to find themselves trapped in its prison-like atmosphere. Employees would routinely work long hours of overtime without being allowed to sit down or speak to one another. Chinese media reports detailed how workers would be fined large amounts for minor infractions -- fines collected by violent security guards.\nLow wages are the source of unhappiness at many Chinese manufacturing plants. According to Geoffrey Crothall, an analyst with the Hong Kong-based China Labor Bulletin, says before the recent pay raise, the average Foxconn worker made around $130 a month, working full-time hours. With overtime, that monthly salary would rise to $292 a month.\nChinese media outlets abruptly stopped their coverage of the events at Foxconn, Honda and Hyundai in the past few days, so it' difficult to track the ongoing impact of the uprisings. June 4 is the anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, so this is a sensitive time for the Chinese government.\nHowever, as the months go on, it will be possible to see if any real change has taken place in China's factory belt. It must be noted that, so far, Chinese leaders have only permitted"}

Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars.\nOf the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. \"That's where a lot of the trouble is sitting,\" Lockhart said.\nBecause they would buy the loans at less than face value, these investors would be more willing to renegotiate the terms, including writing down principal, the plan's backers say.\nNo government money would be needed, Dorchuck said. The Treasury would have to provide the banks servicing the loans with legal cover against lawsuits by designating short-sales as \"qualified loss-mitigation activity\" under legislation passed in 2009.\nFor those wondering, James Lockhart is a former regulator of Fannie and Freddie, Jordan Dorchuck is an executive at a major mortgage servicer, and Pete mills is a housing consultant. The assertion lying beneath this explanation is that the only thing standing in the way of as many as one million principal reductions -- and foreclosures prevented -- is a tiny legal barrier.\nSupposedly, if servicers could just sell bad mortgages to distressed debt investors, then everybody would benefit. Banks would get more money than they would through foreclosure, borrowers would have their principal reduced and remain in their home, and the new investor-owner would have a good deal on a loan that is more likely to perform.\nWhy, then, the need for legal cover? The investors in these deals could just get together and amend their agreements. But presumably some of the investors who own these loans would not be thrilled if they were sold to new investors for a loss. Which is likely the kink that has to be worked out. The sale price must satisfy the initial investors as well as the subsequent investors.\nThis could end up being more thank a small issue. Usually, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Someone must lose here, and it could very likely be the initial mortgage investor.\nIf this plan works, the article notes that it could prevent a million foreclosures. That's significant, but it's really just a fraction of the millions of Americans facing default. That's in part because this proposal only applies to so-called \"private label\" mortgages. Those are the ones not guaranteed by the federal government, for which the market dried up after the housing bubble burst. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not allow principal reductions, because they believe doing so would reduce the value of the mortgages, according to the article."}

I spend a lot of time thinking about ed tech, he spends a lot of time thinking about hardware and highly scalable information systems, and the combination of the two always at least makes for some interesting chats. His weekend post, titled \"Textbook of the Future: The challenges\", is the first volley into a series of articles that we'll be posting that will take a fairly deep dive into the changing face of textbooks, learning materials, and hardware platforms that enable a new approach to teaching. As I mentioned, Jason's background is enterprise information systems, big iron, and systems design on a scale that makes all but the largest school IT rollouts look like assembling a PC kit from TigerDirect. It comes as no surprise, then, that he began by looking at 1:1 computing on a massive scale with a big \"what if\" around the idea of getting electronic textbooks into every students' hands. Again, it's no surprise that he concluded that the iPad/iBooks paradigm was neither sustainable nor even a particularly good idea. ZDNet's Ed Bott also weighed in on the pitfalls and foibles of iBooks, both in educational and in private settings when he joined Kirsten Winkler and me on our review:ed webcast last week. Ed's piece is right around minute 33 of the webcast embedded below, but the idea of content flows through the entire show, so I've included download and subscription links if you want to download it or view it later. If not, here's the Cliff's Notes: iBooks ain't it.\nTaking a step back: Do we need a \"tablet in every backpack\"? Jason touched on a number of the ecosystem issues surrounding digital textbooks (both in their current state and as we anticipate their evolution going forward), but before we dig too deep, we should probably ask ourselves (as many readers have), does every student really need a tablet? Do textbooks really have to be digital? And can these devices actually meet all of a K12 student's computing needs? The answers to these questions aren't easy, especially in an age of belt tightening and budget cuts, but the reality is that students must be able to not just hear lectures, read textbooks, and take tests.

{"idx": "5153", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: We would all appreciate a healthy work-life balance, but even those of us who try to unwind outside the office are frustrated by the gentle chime of email at all hours. To our delight and horror, smartphones and tablets have given us the flexibility to respond to work from anywhere, practically becoming one of the family. Entrepreneurs and executives are known for a round-the-clock devotion to work, in contrast to the four-day-week gurus, but what toll does availability take for those whose jobs require it?\nA recent study links extended work availability with decreased calmness, mood, and energy levels. By looking at industries from technical services to nursing, the study evaluated the effects of being on-call \u2014 that is, not at work, but being expected to remain available by phone for questions or customer requests. Participants answered questions in the evening after an on-call day about how often they thought about work or how constrained their activities felt. The next morning, they were quizzed again to better understand how the previous day\u2019s mental requirements affected their mood.\nParticipants marked lower moods the morning after being on-call compared to mornings after days when they were not required to be available, which the researchers believe occurs because readiness to respond makes it harder to recover from work. The possibility alone impeded recovery from work, as the effects persisted even when no calls came.\nThese results were strengthened by an association between psychology and physiology. Cortisol is a stress hormone, and changes in cortisol levels are associated with health problems. While hunter-gatherers probably found these changes useful in preparing for predator attacks, today\u2019s consensus is that the unavoidable daily stressors of modern life change cortisol levels in ways more harmful than helpful.\nNormally, a person\u2019s cortisol level rises each morning and falls over the course of the day, but stressed people tend to have different cortisol profiles. The baseline levels of cortisol in the chronically stressed remain higher overall, and the natural morning peak is quicker to rise. (\u201cBurnout,\u201d heralded by fatigue and exhaustion, occurs when a stressed person\u2019s baseline cortisol falls from the elevated levels right past the norm to unusually low levels, and the morning peak in the hormone is slower or absent.) In this study, an individual\u2019s morning levels of cortisol increased more quickly when participants would be on call, resembling the higher hormone levels seen in job stress. This may simply be the body\u2019s way of preparing for the anticipated stresses ahead, the authors suggest.\nSome secrets to avoiding the damages of daily stress lie in the variation between people. In this study, there was wide variation in the effects on the participants. Some people experienced none at all. What accounts for this? That question has led to research in recent years on the flip side of stress, resilience. The body\u2019s response to stress is so complicated that looking at the people who cope well with stress may give more straightforward coping strategies than working from molecular scratch.\nSpecifically, this on-call study found the measurement that best accounted for a person\u2019s resilience was detachment. Detachment sounds like a stiff drink poured over some disdain, but the psychological detachment in this case constituted positive answers to questions like \u201cThis evening I didn\u2019t think about work at all.\u201d People who were able to detach from work even while on call were most likely to recoup their energies and avoid effects on mood and cortisol. In lieu of actually reducing work availability, practicing mental detachment from work might be the next best approach.\nToday, employees (and employers) feel pressured into responding immediately to"}

The clip showed a very short (and I believe misleading) snippet of the issue, nothing more.\nHowever, since I had watched the debate, I immediately knew that Dardenne said more about the personal income tax issue than the video snippet revealed. Likewise, I felt the snippet and blog comments did not represent Dardenne's argument.\nI asked the blogger, on social media, questions such as--why did he post only a snippet and if he post the video. He said to the latter question, \"no\".\nHe defended his actions and the video, responded (referring to Dardenne), \"He did say he would support an increase on personal taxes\".

Sure, monthly active users turned downward in Q2 and Q3. But this was due to the company's aggressive (and important) efforts to improve the health of its platform. In addition, Twitter's year-over-year revenue growth rates accelerated as the year went on.\nBut there's still one more quarter from 2018 for Twitter to report. The company will release its fourth-quarter update on Feb. 7. Following a period of accelerating revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability, expectations are high. Can Twitter deliver?\nHere's a preview of some key items to watch when Twitter reports fourth-quarter results.\nTwitter's top-line growth has been impressive recently. Third-quarter revenue increased 29% year over year -- an acceleration from 24% revenue growth in Q2. This momentum has been driven by broad-based growth across Twitter's various ad products and geographies.\nThough management didn't provide a forecast for its fourth-quarter revenue, Twitter CFO Ned Segal sounded confident during the company's third-quarter earnings call, noting that the company feels \"really good about the momentum that we've got going into the seasonally strong fourth quarter.\"\nAnalysts, on average, are expecting Twitter to report fourth-quarter revenue of about $870 million, representing 18.9% year-over-year growth.\nWith four quarters in a row of GAAP profitability behind it, Twitter has morphed into a reliably profitable company. Net income in the company's third quarter was $789 million, or $106 million when excluding a one-time net tax benefit recorded during the period. This compares to a loss of $21 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $163 million, up from $78 million in the year-ago quarter. The company's third-quarter non-GAAP profit translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21.\nOn average, analysts are currently expecting Twitter to report non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 in Q4. This compares to non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 in the year-ago quarter.\nTwitter's user trends will likely see extra scrutiny when the company releases its fourth-quarter results. In Q2, Twitter's monthly active users declined by 1 million sequentially. This decline worsened in Q3, when monthly active users fell by 9 million sequentially.\nSome of the key factors that drove this decline in Twitter's monthly active users were the enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and greater prioritization of platform health by removing spammy and suspicious accounts.\nTwitter expects its monthly active users to decline further in Q4, as these factors continue to weigh on the metric.\nImpressively, Twitter's daily active user growth remained strong in Q3. Daily active users increased 9% year over year, helped by double-digit growth in five of the company's top 10 global markets. Investors should look for similarly strong growth in Twitter's daily active users in Q4.\nTwitter reports its fourth-quarter results before market open on Feb. 7."}

However, markets in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis are still seeing an extremely brisk pace of home value appreciation (2 percent or higher).

In Europe, many of those willing to listen to Mormon missionaries are African immigrants.

But the ban still haunts many African-American members. They frequently have to explain themselves and their beliefs to non-Mormons, other black converts, even themselves.\nSuch racist remarks exist in every faith and group, of course, but some Latter-day Saints see the persistence as troubling.\n\u201cThirty-five years after the end of a racial restriction that had so burdened the church,\u201d said Armand Mauss, a pre-eminent Mormon sociologist, \u201cthe old racist folklore that came with it has still not been formally repudiated\u201d by top church leaders.\nMost Mormons did not challenge the ban on black males in the priesthood, but they did want to know why God would institute such a policy. Various explanations, many culled from American culture at the time, emerged.\nThe official position is that only God knows the reason for the 125-year ban, and only a revelation from God could end it.\nDalyn Montgomery, a white Latter-day Saint married to a black convert in Philadelphia, believes he knows what to credit for the progress: Mormonism\u2019s structure.\nThroughout U.S. history, the most segregated day of the week has been Sunday.

He's dwarfed by the headline above him: 'Those Asian-American WHIZ KIDS'. He happened to show it to one person and now it's become part of his story (see also: his very high IQ; the fact he still drives a 2000 Honda Accord). But the funny thing is that although he was a clever child who went to a school for the gifted, he was there mainly because his mother knew the photographer.\nThe second time Oka became the face of Asian America was in 2006, and this time it was less down to luck (although in his self-deprecating way he insists that it was) and more the result of a leap of faith he took six years earlier when he decided to become an actor. The pay-off was huge: a lead role in the NBC series Heroes, the big-budget, ratings-dominating show about ordinary people all over the world discovering that they have superpowers, which airs from Australia to Japan to Germany to South Africa, and whose second season begins this week on BBC2.\nFortunately, though, the brainy little monsters who clung so spitefully to their sandwiches wouldn't tease their fellow pupils for being clever. At a school for the gifted it isn't so much whether you're going to be a geek, rather what type of geek you're going to be. Oka was a maths geek: 'I did love playing with computers and maths and puzzles. I just loved solving problems, and there's something about trying to figure things out and making things work that was always a big thing with me.' When he finished school, he got into Brown, the Ivy League university in Rhode Island, and his major was in maths and computer science.\nThe instant associations conjured up by 'maths and computer science major' aren't pretty: a pallid face lit up by the unearthly glare of a computer monitor, gazing intently at numbers, typing furiously, possibly wearing one of those shirt-pocket protectors. Oka wrestled with the stereotype and managed to push it aside. At college he discovered another side to himself. 'I was so focused on the left brain, about being logical, about problem solving, that I wanted to do something that was right brain, to kind of balance myself, to see the world in a different way. So I started doing a lot of theatre, music, performing, singing.' Admittedly, joining the college a cappella group didn't exactly make him the big man on campus (although, he insists, 'we thought we were rock stars'), but getting a bit of 'wiggle room' to reinvent himself was liberating.\nThe left brain/right brain wiggling didn't stop at Brown. His first job out of college was a covetable position at Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company owned by Lucasfilm. What he loved about computer graphics was that 'when you write an algorithm, you can visually see it, so you can show it to a friend and say, hey, check this out. And they say, oh wow, that's cool! You program a database or something, it's an artform in itself. No offence, but if I show it to my mother it's like...' He gives me a glazed look of deathly boredom.\n"}

He said that discussions over security arrangements regarding establishing a demilitarised buffer zone and alleged backing of rebel groups either side of the border were ongoing.\nIn September the two sides signed a Cooperation Agreement, which will see South Sudan pay between $9.10 and $11 a barrel to export its crude through the north. Juba will also pay $3.08 billion to help Sudan overcome the loss of three quarters of oil production due to Southern secession.\nThe flagging economies of both nations, since South Sudan separated last year, have made a deal to resolve the oil dispute, which began in January, crucial for the finances of both nations.\nSouth Sudan relied on oil revenues for 98% of its income and Sudan had budgeted for transit fees of over $30 per barrel in its annual budget. South Sudan\u2019s pre-shutdown oil production was approximately 350,000 barrels per day (bpd).\nHowever, Sudan has insisted that border security arrangements agreed in the September deal must be finalised before oil exports can resume.\nMeetings earlier this month in Juba, chaired by the defense ministers of the two countries to discuss the establishment of the demilitarized border buffer zone and the ways to end cross border attacks and rebel presence on both sides of border, ended without progress.\nSpeaking to the Sudanese parliament on 14 November after his return to Khartoum, Sudanese defense minister Abdel-Rahim Mohamed Hussein blamed the South Sudan government for the failure to implement the deal.\nHe accused Juba of rejecting his attempts to place the issue of South Sudan\u2019s alleged backing of rebels in South Sudan on the meeting\u2019s agenda and said his counterpart had refused to hand over the names of northern citizens seeking to join the Southern army (SPLA).\nNilePet\u2019s Adong told Sudan Tribune that Khartoum had begun to include \u201ccompletely new demands\" in the security deal which his country \u201cdid not make a commitment\u201d to during negotiations held in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.\nOn 14 November the Sudanese oil minister Awad al-Jaz told a visiting South Sudanese delegation led by the Undersecretary of South Sudan\u2019s oil ministry, Machar Aciek Ader Nyang, that implementing the oil accord was contingent upon finalizing a deal on security arrangements.\nThe two sides discussed technical details for restarting oil flow in a closed session but Al-Jaz stressed the importance of security to provide a conducive environment for oil production.\nNilePet\u2019s Adong, who was part of a South Sudanese delegation that visited Khartoum last week said that the resumption of oil production has \"been rescheduled because"}

{"idx": "5197", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Property or block management is the process of managing the communal areas of residential leasehold properties through the service charge. Block management involves communication with various parties in respect of maintenance and repairs, insurance of the building, Fire Risk Assessments, the provision of services such as central heating, lifts, porterage, estate staff, lighting and cleaning of common areas. It also requires a good understanding of legislation and leasehold matters, preparation of budgets and annual accounts, as well as routine inspections to check that the property is in good order.\nLeasehold flats can be in purpose-built blocks, in converted houses or above commercial or retail premises. When buying a property, a leaseholder effectively rents from the freeholder for a number of years, decades or centuries. When the freeholder grants a lease, they become a \u201clandlord\u201d. The structure and common parts of the building and the land it stands on are usually owned by the freeholder. The freeholder is, normally, responsible for the maintenance and repair of the building and the costs for doing so are recoverable through the service charges and billed to the leaseholders.\nService charges are payments by the leaseholder to the landlord for all the services the landlord provides. Details of what can (and cannot) be charged by the landlord and the proportion of the charge to be paid by the individual leaseholder will all normally be set out in the lease.\nI am a property manager with over 15 years of experience working for large national corporate organisations in London and in Brighton.

What makes SDL Property Management Tom Lean revolutionary is that I am able to combine the benefits of the local, more personal, one-to-one approach to property management with the backing of a larger corporate national company; the SDL Group. I deal with all management instructions directly, there is a consistent point of contact for all clients and I am the company owner and director meaning that there is no staff turnover. I have been a member of the Institute of Property Management (IRPM) since 2012, and an Associate of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) since 2013, my company is an Associate of Association of Managing Agents (ARMA) and we are members of The Property Ombudsman service.\nWhat makes me different to other property management companies?\nI have found that the corporate approach to property management that larger firms tend to employ, can often lead to clients feeling that they do not receive the local personal service that they desire. Larger firms tend to have a higher turnover of staff with property managers regularly changing. This can result in an inconsistency of service and also makes it difficult for strong relationships to build larger companies can obtain greater economies of scale, offering additional services such as insurance, 24-hour emergency cover, maintenance contracts, among many others, at competitive prices.

In CBP hierarchy, McAleenan is second only to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen.\nThe FBI said this week that the ongoing multi-agency investigation has found no evidence the agents were attacked, disputing claims by national Border Patrol union officials.\nOn the night of Nov. 18, Martinez was found with severe injuries at the bottom of what the CBP memo said was a nine-foot culvert just off Interstate 10, about 12 miles east of Van Horn.\nMartinez died the next day at a hospital in his home city of El Paso and Garland was released from the hospital days later. Martinez's funeral was attended by hundreds of agents as well as U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nAn autopsy by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office released this week found Martinez died of head injuries. The manner of death was undetermined.\n\"The evidence also shows that the other agent fell approximately 22 feet away from where Agent Martinez fell, landing on his back and sustaining significant injuries to his back and skull. His resultant injuries have impaired the agent\u2019s ability to recall the events of the incident,\" McAleenan stated in the memo.\nThe other agent does not remember much of the incident, Border Patrol union officials had said.\nThe CBP memo mentions that the FBI consulted with \"neurology experts associated with a professional sports league familiar with brain injuries including concussions, and Department of Defense medical personnel who have treated combat injuries and casualties.\"\nThe memo does not say what experts told the FBI about possible memory loss linked to such injuries. It also does not name the sports league.\nThe FBI El Paso Division said this week that its investigation, including more than 650 interviews nationwide, has found no signs of a scuffle, altercation or attack linked to the incident.\n\"The absence of evidence is a key factor in this case \u2014 not due to lack of effort or determination, but because evidence which would indicate the presence of other persons or the commission of a criminal act is not present,\" McAleenan stated in the memo.\nThe CBP memo states there were no defense wounds on Martinez or his partner and no third-party DNA or blood evidence found at the scene or the agents' clothing.\nA crime scene examination by trackers found \"an absence of foot sign beyond those of the agents and first responders\" and no unidentified traffic at the scene, the CBP memo stated.\nThe memo adds that license plate reader data was obtained from CBP and"}

Frank Fat's may not be as cool as a place like Hook & Ladder or Red Rabbit, as elegant as Ella, as influential as Mulvaney's or as adored as Biba.\nBut it continues to stand tall for a reason. The food is consistently delicious and eminently accessible, with flavors and ingredients that straddle the line between American and Chinese.\nWho cares where bacon-wrapped scallops come from or whether they get the foodie stamp of approval for being authentic? At Frank Fat's, they're pretty darn amazing \u2013 tender, delicate, meaty, salty and just a tad smoky going down. And they pair nicely with a lychee martini, a nice stiff mai tai cocktail or something from the abbreviated but nicely balanced wine list.\nThe salt-and-pepper calamari is light and crisp and mildly delicious without being greasy or chewy. And Fat's brandy fried chicken is right up there with the best fried chicken in town \u2013 perfectly tender, golden brown, crispy, tasty \u2013 and lots of it.\nKnow what makes all this food taste even better? They treat you like a million bucks. Frank Fat's has been a refuge for movers and shakers practically since the day it opened on L Street. Every governor since has eaten there. Celebrities often drop by. Deals get done.\nWe discovered pretty quickly that whether you're a nobody from Natomas or a big shot with an entourage, you'll get the VIP treatment here.\nOne of our friends ordered the lychee martini. He was curious about what it would taste like. A mouthful of cotton candy or something grown-up and exotic? With a wink and a smile, our excellent server said that if he didn't like it, they'd make him something else. They don't have to check with the manager and make everything awkward \u2013 they simply make the drink go away and make a new one appear.\nFrank Fat, who died in 1997, instilled the personal- service edict in his family and employees, according to son Jerry Fat, president and chief executive officer of Fat City Inc., which presides over the family's four restaurants.\n\"My father treated everybody the same. It didn't matter if you were the governor of California or somebody from the community coming in for dinner,\" he told me by phone.\nJerry remembers busing tables as a teenager in the 1970s when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan's security detail arrived early in the morning to arrange for a visit. Clint Eastwood has eaten at Fat's, though we neglected to ask if he had a conversation with an empty chair. Anthony Kennedy, the U.S. Supreme Court justice and Sacramento native, continues to dine there when he's in town.\nWhen you're in the hands of restaurant pros and veterans who don't need training wheels, it's easy to relax and have a good time.

Check out these tips to learn how to tie a room together.\nTying a room together doesn\u2019t mean having to spend a lot of money or buying several new items for the room. In most cases, you can tie a room together successfully with the furniture and accent pieces you already have, by displaying them properly. Or you can add one or two new items that will make the room \u201cpop.\u201d Here are some secrets to tying a room together.\nUsing items that you have collected \u2014 through your travels, as family heirlooms or items that you just love \u2014 is the perfect way to tie a room together. Choose a few key items that suit the room best, paying attention to size, color and theme. The items do not have to all match each other, but the size of the accent pieces should reflect the scale of the room and furniture, and the collectibles should either be in a similar color grouping or contrasting colors that don\u2019t clash. Don\u2019t try to display all your collectibles in one room, however \u2014 just choose a few special pieces and place them around the room in key places.\nOne beautiful item that reflects the theme or colors of a room can tie the room together, like a large painting over the fireplace or in the focal point of the room. Make sure the room theme and colors are reflected in the painting and the subject of the painting, as well as in the frame. For example, if your room has a country feel to it with soft blue, cream and yellow tones, you\u2019d want to choose a painting with these colors, in a light oak, pine or white frame.\nUsing one type of fabric for accent pieces that match the tone and color of your room can tie everything together. Choose a fabric in a color or pattern that will complement your room and create accent pillows, small tablecloths for end tables or even lampshade covers using this fabric. These small touches can bring together a room with different colors and furniture pieces and make it feel like a finished room.\nDecorative area rugs are another excellent way to pull a room\u2019s decor together. Place one under the coffee table in the sitting area between the sofa and accent chairs or under the dining room table to tie the room\u2019s colors together in that space. Blend the colors from the area rug with the room through the colors of the drapes, curtains or walls. A decorative area rug can bring a room together and give it a warm, cozy feeling."}
{"idx": "5207", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: 'Seize the Day' is a translation of a Latin aphorism, Carpe Diem from a work called Odes by the Roman poet Horace. It certainly has stood the test of time. 'Seize the Day' was written into a song by a rock band \u2013 Avenged Sevenfold. Sam Bellow wrote a novel called \u201cSeize the Day\u201d which was, in turn, made into a 1986 movie about a disillusioned salesman played by Robin Williams.\nSo what does it mean to seize the day?\nTo seize the day means to live in the moment. In other words, forget yesterday and all its problems and stop worrying about what will happen tomorrow. Think instead of what you can do in the present.\nI can tell you from a lifetime of experience that that isn't an easy thing to do. One of the first things you need to do is to forgive anyone who has wronged you in the past. It doesn't matter if they know it. It's just important that you know it. They probably have forgotten it anyway and gone on with their lives. Hatred from the past has a way of coloring the present and the future, not for the person who wronged you but for you, the person who remembers.\nBy the way, while you are forgiving others don't forget to forgive yourself. Regrets can really ruin an otherwise sunny day and a meaningful future.\nSome folks live out their lives in the town in which they were born, surrounded by relatives and friends they grew up with. That can make it hard to give up past grievances but it also means that lasting friendships brighten your days and add to your future plans. When you leave home at 17 like I did, you can lose track of the people you knew in the good old days.\nIt was fun to see faces from the past. I also attended a few high school class reunions until we all got too old to attend them. At our 55th we discussed a 60th reunion and I suggested that if we held it, it should be in a place that was wheel-chair accessible.\nWhen I left home it was a scary time. Waiting at the crowded railroad station all by myself for the train that would take me further from friends and family than I had ever been in my life, made me think of all kinds of things that could go wrong. I could accidentally get on the wrong train or fall asleep on the train and miss my station. My cousin Janet and my friend Leona, who were supposed to be waiting for me when I got off the train in Washington, D.C., might meet the wrong train or forget to be there.\nOf course, they were there and they spent the weekend showing me around the city on street cars. I was soon very much at home there in spite of my worries.\nSometimes at night when I have trouble sleeping I remember things I would like to forget and can't. The worst part is realizing that if I had done this or that differently I could have changed the course of my life. It is a sad and frustrating thing to do to yourself and it doesn't help you sleep. The best thing to do when that happens is to get up and do something productive that you know has to be done \u2014 do the laundry, write a letter, attend to your bill paying, check your bank account. Get yourself back to living in the moment. Sometimes, I can sleep after I get back in bed but if I can't at least I have accomplished something 'in the moment' instead of the meaningless exercise of regretting what you can't change.\nI believe in prayer.

The plans would give Singapore a roughly 9% stake, making it the Swiss group's biggest shareholder.\n\"Conditions in the U.S. mortgage and housing markets have continued to deteriorate, and we have updated our loss assumptions to the levels implied by the current distressed market for mortgage securities,\" said CEO Marcel Rohner in a statement.\n\"In the last several months, continued speculation about the ultimate value of our subprime holdings -- which remains unknowable -- has been distracting,\" Rohner added.\n\"In our judgment these write-downs will create maximum clarity on this issue and will have the effect of substantially eliminating speculation.\"\nWith the latest announcements, UBS has recorded $13.7 billion in write-downs, more than any European bank. The group took a write-down of around $3.4 billion in early October, but warned later in the month that it may have to take more charges if the U.S. housing market deteriorated further.\nUBS had expected to return to profit in the fourth quarter after reporting an 830 million-franc loss in the third quarter.\nBut on Monday the group said it now expects a loss in the fourth quarter and added it's \"possible\" that it'll record a loss for the whole of 2007.\n\"The write-downs and capital raising represent a dramatic u-turn from guidance given by Chief Financial Officer Marco Suter just three weeks ago,\" said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Matthew Clark.\nSuter had guided investors not to expect big write-downs in the fourth quarter, though Clark noted market conditions have deteriorated since then.\n\"Given that the capital-raising outweighs the write-down, this appears to be an attempt to draw a line under UBS's subprime woes,\" he added.\nOn Wall Street, shares in UBS UBS, +0.99% lost as much as 3.4% before swinging higher. At last check, the stock was up 2.2% at $51.59 as investors saw the cash injection as a vote of confidence in the group's core business. Also see Europe Markets.\nThe additional write-downs were partially priced into the shares, which had fallen around 8% since the start of November as credit markets deteriorated again.\nBear Stearns analyst Christopher Wheeler said the announcement helped to move the focus away from UBS' subprime holdings and onto its earnings potential.\nIn a note to clients, Wheeler added that the move would lead to a reduced reliance on investment banking and greater focus on wealth management. UBS has been under fire for its poor investment banking performance for some time and the shift \"must be positive and could help the stock move up in the medium term,\" Wheeler said.\nRohner confirmed that the investment banking arm will focus more on supporting the asset and wealth management units.\n\"In future, we will make certain that our investment banking operations grow by concentrating on serving the needs of institutional and corporate clients,\" he said in the statement.\nUBS' surprise announcement came a day ahead of a planned invest"}

The new appliance also offers compatibility with existing SevOne appliances and clusters.\n\"SevOne's new appliance offers the greatest scalability on the market today, and only uses a single appliance,\" power-supply specialist Telonic's Managing Director Andreas Schlechter said. \"The single install of a SevOne appliance saves on consumption of data storage space and energy, by reducing the hardware platform footprint and implementation time. And the mobile app provides an elegant way to proactively receive critical IT information any time, anywhere.\"\nThe company said this improvement in capacity could help reduce data center space requirements, energy consumption and management costs. Compared with an equivalent number of existing SevOne appliances, the new appliance represents a 70 percent decrease in physical footprint and power consumption. The appliances collect and store one year of raw performance data without requiring aggregation. For users requiring virtual appliance deployments or a combination of virtual and physical appliances, the SevOne solution can also be deployed on VMware vSphere, alongside SevOne physical appliances.\nSevOne appliances are designed to support big data performance management and automatically run baselines across each data point collected, thus helping maintain service-level agreements (SLAs) and deliver continuous operation. Cloud and virtualization management is also part of the company's network performance management solutions, offering real-time visibility into both virtual and physical environments.\nIn addition to the appliance, SevOne's mobile application, available in the iPhone and Android App Stores, offers top-down visibility of the entire network infrastructure, with the ability to drill down into individual alerts, access to administrative alert functionality, including acknowledging, assigning and ignoring alerts and user-friendly installation and user interface, with native SevOne authentication.\n\"Historically, IT performance management products require the administrator to sit in front of the computer and run reports all day,\" SevOne CEO Mike Phelan said. \"SevOne is giving administrators precious time back in their day, by notifying them only when anomalies and deviations from normal behavior occur, and sending these alerts directly to their mobile devices.\""}

{"idx": "5217", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Google now has the dubious distinction of incurring the largest fine ever imposed on a company by the European Union. The EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced June 27 that Google had been slapped with a $2.7 billion fine on the grounds that the search engine giant violated antitrust laws. In a statement, Vestager said Google's business practices harmed competitors and consumers. The move centered on Google\u2019s activities in shopping and search after years of investigation. But there\u2019s much more to the story than Google Shopping, its comparison shopping services. This slide show will cover what ultimately convinced the EU to levy a record-breaking fine against Google.\nGoogle Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kent Walker responded to the fine, saying the company must \u201crespectfully disagree with the conclusions.\u201d However, Google didn\u2019t fire back at the claims; it said it will review the EU\u2019s decision and \u201cconsider an appeal.\u201d In other words, this thing might not be over.\nAccording to the EU, Google used its \u201cmarket dominance\u201d in search to provide \u201cillegal advantages\u201d to Google Shopping, a service that lists products for sale through its search. Competitors operating their own shopping services argued that Google pushed them down in results to benefit its own offering.\nHow Powerful Is Google, Really?\nAt the center of the EU complaint is an argument that Google is the dominant force in the search market with monopoly power. While Google has denied those claims, the EU has pointed to its 90 percent-plus search market share in most European countries as proof of its overwhelming position. The EU believes Google has \u201cspecial responsibilities\u201d to ensure competition in the marketplace.\nThe EU\u2019s accusations were bolstered by complaints from companies either backing or backed by an organization called FairSearch, which was formed in 2010. It counts several prominent companies among its members, including Microsoft, Yelp and Yandex. All argued that Google was abusing its position as a dominant force and should be curbed.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for FairSearch companies to tout the EU\u2019s decision. In letters released June 27, the companies celebrated the decision and said it would go a long way in improving competition in the marketplace. They also argued that a similar action should happen in the US.\nCould Google Find Itself Under Investigation in the U.S.?\nThat brings us to the question: Could Google face a similar fine at the hands of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission? It\u2019s technically possible, and now, with the EU fine in place, it might be easier. However, most antitrust experts say Google is at no risk of facing a fine in the U.S., and American regulators aren\u2019t looking to target its shopping services.\nA fine of $2.7 billion would cripple the finances of all but the biggest companies. But it\u2019s worth noting that during the first quarter of the year, Google generated a $5.4 billion profit. This year, it\u2019s on pace to make more than $20 billion. A $2.7 billion fine means little to a company of that magnitude.\nWhat Are the American-EU Implications?\nThere has been some chatter that the EU\u2019s decision to target Google, an American company, could strain relations between the Eurozone and the U.S. There is already some tension between the EU and the U.S. over fines assessed against Apple over its tax payments, and some observers see the Google fine as more salt in the wound. But so far nobody is calling for a trade war.\nThis isn\u2019t the end for Google. While the company could pay the fine and move"}

He is the first St. Louis player to score at least 35 goals in three straight seasons since Brett Hull did it in five straight from 1989-90 through 1993-94.\nAnd Tarasenko isn't relying on the power play, either. He is tied for third in the League in even-strength goals with 27.\nHe has 69 points, tied for 13th in the League and leading the Blues by 18.\nGeneral manager Doug Armstrong made a difficult decision Feb. 1.\nSince the start of the 2011-12 season, when he hired Hitchcock after 13 games, the Blues had earned a .644 point percentage. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins (.656) and Chicago Blackhawks (.648) had been better.\nHitchcock had taken the Blues to the Western Conference Final last season and within two wins of their first Stanley Cup Final since 1970. He had 781 career wins, one short of tying Al Arbour for third in NHL history.\nBut the Blues had gone 9-14-1 in their past 24 games and were clinging to the second wild card. Armstrong thought they weren't playing as a team.\n\"We have to regain wanting what's best for the Note on the front, not the name on the back,\" Armstrong said then.\nSo Armstrong fired Hitchcock, one of his best friends, and replaced him with Yeo, who had been associate coach and was scheduled to take over next season.\nThe Blues have gone 18-7-2 since.

Hillary Rodham Clinton ran a very average Democratic presidential campaign, and she did so on the most progressive platform a party has put forth in a half-century.

The rest of it was a collection of unprecedented flukes all coming together at once: the Russian hacking, the Comey meddling, journalistic malpractice of a kind that always seems to occur when there's a Clinton on the ballot, and, yes, the latent racism and xenophobia and fear of The Other that always resides in the dwindling white majority when it does anything en masse\u2014like voting.\nThat was the accelerant, as the arson squad says. That was what got people to the rallies. That's what got them on their feet when they were there. That's what got people punched in the head. (Speaking of which, somebody else is going to get to sue the president*, this time on that very issue. Thanks, Paula Jones!) And that was a big part of what got enough people to the polls to activate that creaky slaveowner's doomsday device known as the Electoral College. So, I guess I disagree with what Sanders said at the Orpheum. But I'm not going to define my politics going forward based on that disagreement.\nThis clamorous futility has to end.

Given the controversy around pension transfers following the plight of British Steel workers and subsequent regulatory investigation, she knows this is a brave line.\nBut the director of Surrey-based Trentham Invest has 17 years\u2019 experience as a transfer specialist, having taken G60 in 2001. She believes ardently transferring is a good move for many clients.\nShe even thinks it is better for the economy since people will have more money to spend and companies will have fewer crippling liabilities.\nDowns uses the geese analogy because she believes many people who leave their final salary pension in a scheme are \u2018giving away the goose that lays the golden eggs\u2019.\n\u2018If you free [transfer out] the final salary goose, you will have everlasting eggs,\u2019 she says. \u2018In a private pension, if you die, your wife or husband will get the goose and, if you both die, the children get it.\nShe says the picture of a Canadian goose in the photos shows what it means to clients. One client \u2013 an amateur artist \u2013 painted it and gave it to Downs after she helped him transfer two schemes, boosting income substantially over 10 years compared with staying in the schemes.\nDeveloping the firm\u2019s pension transfer niche has helped boost annual income from \u00a3360,000 to more than \u00a31 million since Downs last appeared on the New Model Adviser\u00ae cover in 2011. But she rebuts any challenge to her increasingly favourable stance on final salary transfers.\nLast year, Downs wrote a book: Your final salary pension options: the truth behind the myth. \u2018One of the biggest myths is that final salary pension benefits are guaranteed,\u2019 she says.\n\u2018There are no guarantees. If you have a \u00a370,000 a year pension and the scheme fails, which has happened many times, and it goes into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), you could end up with less than half the amount. That is particularly true for high earners as the PPF cushion is capped depending on age.\n\u2018Many funding shortfalls in companies are staggering, but there is little information about the overall health of schemes unless you know where to dig. Another myth is that when clients transfer out, this makes them vulnerable to stock market falls.\nDowns says she receives around 17 enquiries about transfers a year, of which around 15 go ahead with the transfer following her advice process.\nThe position of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is that an adviser should start from the assumption a defined benefit pension transfer will be unsuitable. Does she disagree?\nDowns says much of the poor transfer advice the FCA has identified has been due to the unprofessionalism of the advisers concerned, rather than any fundamental problem with the transfer process if followed correctly.\n\u2018We need to fix the human not the computer,\u2019 she says. \u2018I have built my own systems and 10-stage methodology to identify whether transferring is right for the individual.

A natural centre-forward, he started his career with Sliema Rovers in the Amateur League.\nFrom the Rovers to the Wanderers was only a step away and Salvu soon became the regular leader of the Wanderers' attack. When Tony Nicholl burst on to the scene, Salvu moved to the inside-right position with equal success, forming part of a great trio together with Nicholl and 'Brownie' Sammut.\nSalvu Sammut was probably the best Maltese product of that era. In that memorable match against the Spartans in 1931, his brilliance was in evidence for the first time, and from then on he never looked back.\nGreatness is a word used loosely in football but there is no other word which can describe this highly-gifted player.\nMention of Salvu Sammut inevitably brings to mind a happy period in the history of Sliema Wanderers. The immediate pre-World War Two period belonged to the Blues and to the most formidable inside trio in the history of the game in Malta.\nL-G\u0127arawri, Nicholl and Brownie combined between them wits, guile, dash, speed, nippiness and devastating shooting power to set up the highest ever record of goals by an inside trio in Maltese football.\nSammut had a charming personality both on and"}

{"idx": "5231", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: In the preface to \"Between Silences,\" his first book of poetry, published in 1990, Ha Jin proclaimed that he spoke for those who suffered and endured, those fooled or ruined by history - a Chinese writer who wrote in English on behalf of the downtrodden Chinese.\nNearly two decades later, Jin says that he has come to see the \"silliness of that ambition.\"\n\"[T]oo much sincerity is a dangerous thing. It can overheat one's brain,\" he drolly notes in his compelling new collection of essays, \"The Writer as Migrant.\"\nJin, winner of the National Book Award for his novel \"Waiting,\" examines how writers who leave their homelands grapple with issues of identity and tradition. To whom they write, as whom, and in whose interest shapes their artistic vision.\nIn this slender book, Jin does not share much of his early life, already well chronicled in interviews and articles. As a teenager, he served as a soldier during the Cultural Revolution and went on to study English literature in college. While working on his dissertation at Brandeis University, he saw televised coverage of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that helped him decide to stay in the United States.\nRather, Jin draws upon the works and lives of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Lin Yutang, Joseph Conrad, Vladimir Nabokov, V.S. Naipaul, Milan Kundera, among others - a brotherhood of writers, of exiles, who have nourished Jin. He writes: \"[T]he usefulness and beauty of literature lies in its capacity to illuminate life.\"\nThough the issues are weighty, Jin's prose is straightforward and welcoming. He employs the \"we\" - as in we, the reader, we, the writer.\nThe first of Jin's three essays, \"The Spokesman and the Tribe,\" is the most personal, charting his early struggles as a writer, woven in with examples from other migrant authors. Such writers may regard themselves as spokespeople of their native countries, bearing witness and preserving memories. Their critics say that these writers appropriate homeland miseries for personal gain - or worse, are out of touch with the reality of the countries they left.\nNaipaul's \"A Bend in the River\" - a book that changed Jin's life, he says - sustained him when he searched for a job for two years. As he walked to yet another interview, Jin began to doubt his role as spokesman and came to realize that he had to learn to stand alone as a writer.\n\"Just as a creative writer should aspire to be not a broker but a creator of culture, a great novel does not only present a culture but also makes culture; such a work does not only bring news of the world but also evokes the reader's empathy and reminds him of his own existential condition.\"\nIn \"The Language of Betrayal,\" Jin examines the ultimate betrayal by the migrant writer: the choice to write in another language, alienating him from his mother tongue and directing his creativity to another language. He considers how Conrad and Nabokov each dealt with this struggle - Nabokov playful and wisecracking, Conrad developing an elaborate syntax. Jin concludes that migrant writers must imagine ways for their art to transcend any language.\n\"[N]o matter where we go, we cannot shed our past completely - so we must strive to use parts of our past to facilitate our journeys. As we travel along, we should also imagine how"}

According to Bezos, the underpinning of the term \u201cwork-life balance\u201d assumes a tradeoff. Bezos, instead, likens the relationship between the two to a circle. When you\u2019re happier at home, you perform better at work; when you\u2019re happy at work, you\u2019re more present at home.\nThe problem is most employees today don\u2019t feel in control to be able to implement the \u201ccircle\u201d framework proposed by Bezos. Instead, they feel beholden to the demands of their employer. Having burned the midnight oil at work for the greater part of my twenties, I\u2019ve seen the draining effects of stress both at work and at home. Chronic stress, as much as we don't want it, is our modern day birthright.\nHaving seen the negative effects of stress firsthand, I was intrigued to come across Stanford professor Jeffrey Pfeffer\u2019s new book on this very phenomenon, Dying For A Paycheck: How Modern Management Harms Employee Health And Company Performance And What We Can Do About It (HarperCollins, March 2018.) I had long been a fan of Pfeffer\u2019s for his work on power and influence in organizations and was curious to study his research on the toll toxic workplaces produce.\nPfeffer\u2019s book explores the primary drivers of what he calls \u201cworkplace exposures\u201d that negatively impact human health including working long hours in a week (e.g., more than forty hours), facing family-to-work and work-to-family conflicts, having relatively low control over one\u2019s job and job environment, and facing high job demands such as pressure to work fast.\nThe one effect that seemed to be the most pervasive, in my experience, was long working hours. In today\u2019s world it\u2019s taken on a whole new meaning and subsequently has become a primary driver of stress. As Pfeffer points out, \u201clong hours have become the norm for successful employees interested in advancing their careers.\u201d There is little question about that.\nThis isn\u2019t a new problem, but it\u2019s become exacerbated in recent years. Pfeffer quotes David Waldman, vice-president of human resources at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, as saying: \u201cOverwork is not new in this country \u2026. But in some ways, it seems like it\u2019s hitting critical mass.\u201d Long hours are pervasive no matter what job or industry you\u2019re in. Among any working person, the 9-5 is a relic of times past, and anyone who attempts to work those hours is often ridiculed as only working a half day.\nOddly, anyone who has worked long hours (which as far as I can tell is most people) can tell you that it has a lot more to do with image than with productivity. \u201cIn the contest for promotions, work hours become one way of competing.\u201d Working long hours has become synonymous with a successful career. The two are rarely stripped apart. Employees need to show they\u2019re putting in time whether they\u2019re working or not. \u201cIt is expected as part of the \u2018price\u2019 for career success - and in many instances, exceptional levels of income and responsibility.\u201d Employees willingly put in the long hours to stand out. And as more and more people do, it almost becomes the expectation.\nThis might make you wonder: Do these practices, which employers appear to endorse, actually yield better results?\nThe impact on productivity is only the first order effect. The second, far greater, effect is"}

Just look at the numbers.\"\nAnecdotal evidence also paints a picture where males outnumber women significantly at start-up industry networking events and pitching sessions. \"From my experience, if you see 1 to 2 females when you go to pitch events or meetings with accelerators, you'll be lucky,\" Langendorf, a Tunisia-born civil engineer who relocated to Singapore in 2011, added.\nTo be sure, Singapore is no anomaly.\nDespite the rise of female tech icons such as Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, global tech giants continue to grapple with the issue of female underrepresentation in their workforce. For instance, statistics from Twitter in 2014 revealed that only 28 percent of its employees are women, while Facebook and Apple stand slightly higher at 29 percent each.\nWomen keen to pursue entrepreneurial dreams in tech have to overcome traditional views of their roles as wives and mothers, founders told CNBC. This is especially so in Asian countries such as Singapore.\nMeanwhile, female founders also face a harder time with funding, despite Singapore receiving rising interests from VC firms such as Golden Gate Ventures (GGV).\n\"The truth is that the early-stage VC and angel markets are dominated by men, and men may not understand the true potential of women-focused businesses. They will choose to pass up on the opportunity so many women entrepreneurs I know here in Singapore struggle to get that first round of funding,\" Roshni Mahtani, CEO and founder of Female Founders Network, told CNBC by phone. The 31-year-old is also the founder of five-year-old online publishing house Tickled Media, which reaches more than 6 million mothers through her three parenting sites.\nA lack of supportive networks also means that women are more likely to launch companies alone as opposed to having co-founders, rendering women-led firms at a disadvantage in the start-up world where investors prefer more than one founder.\n\"The problem of co-founders is a chicken and egg issue. Firstly, there are not enough females and secondly, the way males network is different from us. Not all females want to go out and network over a beer, and that limits them a lot in accessing networks that may be helpful in starting a start-up,\" Woomentum's Langendorf noted.\nWhile the entrepreneurs whom CNBC spoke to say that gender-based discrimination"}
{"idx": "5234", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: The year was 2012, and digital picture frames were expected to take the living room by storm. The frames were usually LCDs surrounded by decorative wood and metal, and were advertised as innovative replacements for boring, static printed photos. But consumers didn\u2019t bite. U.S. sales of digital photo frames dropped from $159.4 million in 2011 to $88.6 million in 2012, and by 2014, the number of digital photo frame models on the market decreased by a whopping 77 percent.\nThose numbers might scare any company thinking about entering the electronic frame market, but not Art.com. Earlier this month, the art retail giant threw its hat into the ring with Klio, a wall-mounted digital art frame.\nEarly digital frames suffered from a myriad of shortcomings. Some frames were unintuitive, lacking any sort of wireless connectivity and requiring an SD Card or USB drive to load images. Others sported disappointingly low-resolution displays and bulky plastic shells. Many had complicated software that made even the simplest of tasks, such as scheduling a slideshow, complicated chores.\nKlio, a product of Art.com\u2019s experimental Labs division, was designed specifically to address those shortcomings. Boiled down to basics, it\u2019s a wide but thin (the largest model measures 47 x 31 x 3 inches), wall-mounted 4K LED display that downloads photos and artwork via a Wi-Fi connection. It stores artwork data in the cloud and caches it locally as needed, runs a modified version of Google\u2019s Android operating system, and can be managed through a companion app for iOS devices.\nBut the Klio is much more than a sum of its parts, Art.com CTO Nasos Topakas told Digital Trends. Unlike the digital art frames of yore, it isn\u2019t meant to replace existing art; rather, it\u2019s intended to augment it with new forms. \u201c[Klio] is an ongoing, ambient experience that can be a permanent fixture in any room in the house,\u201d said Topakas.\nMuch of that experience involves motion. One form is Chrono Art, or \u201cdigital narratives\u201d comprising video and stills that unfold over the course of days, weeks, months, or even years. Morph Art features subtle, unexpected changes in still life canvases, such as a figure emerging from a small cottage or light appearing from beyond a mountainside. And Chrono Art reflects the passage of time in any number of playful ways. Topakas described an illustration of a London skyline with a prominent, shifting Big Ben clock face. In another, dripping lines of wet paint indicate seconds, minutes, and hours.\nChoosing between artwork is handled mostly by wireless remote. From the settings menu, playlists of artwork \u2014 still art, motion art, and videos up to 4K in resolution \u2014 can be managed and edited, and individual pieces selected, marked as favorites, or deleted.\nYou can upload personal artwork and photos via the app, or choose from Art.com\u2019s digital catalog. The storefront prominently highlights a rotating number of collections. While independent artists use mediums such as social media for promotion, Klio allows their work to be featured as home decor, which may generate a following.\nThe Klio as may be a Trojan Horse for independent artists, but it might soon become more: a source of livelihood. A business model hadn\u2019t yet been finalized, but that Art.com will begin experimenting with \u201climited edition\u201d digital artwork in the near future"}

Few things override an intense craving for sushi, and I was surprised (and relieved) to find five cars to choose from within five blocks of my apartment. It was easy to find the little white and blue Smart car four streets up, and I was on my way in no time.\nCar2go expanded to Seattle in December, and serves 17 cities worldwide. Users can rent cars by the minute for 38 cents, for as long as needed, and may drop them off within the designated city limits. For Seattle, this means between Beacon Hill and Bitter Lake. For now, new customers will receive 30 minutes of free driving when entering the promotion code SOUND when registering, saving them 11 dollars.\nJennifer Duffy found out about car2go in January and has used it about 10 times. She often takes one home from work when convenient, and likes the parking perk.\nThe car has a GPS and will inform the driver when they have gone outside the designated limits. One advantage of car2go over competing Zipcar is that users may park in metered areas instead of designated lots where they picked cars up.\nDuffy said that the price is always cheaper than a taxi, and her bill for January will only be $11.\n\u201cMost of the time when I take it home it\u2019s less than five dollars. It\u2019s awesome. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no base rate and taxis have a base rate. With car2go it\u2019s literally just how many minutes you\u2019re in the car,\u201d she said.\nMy trip to the restaurant cost about four dollars, and indeed was easy to park outside the restaurant. But having never been in a Smart car, I felt a little uneasy driving it at first. The makers assure its stability, but I won\u2019t be taking it on the freeway anytime soon.\nDuffy feels the same way, feeling unsafe with all the SUVs and buses on the freeway.\nRichard Schurman is a Zipcar member, and though he likes the car2go business model, the car design is the only con that would keep him from signing up. Zipcar gives customers the possibility of choosing from different car makes and models.\nWhile the cars do not have to be reserved in advance (though you can), there are disadvantages. West Seattle is not covered in the designated area, and it seems by the amount of cars that are left of the South end of the accessible border, customers would like the area to expand farther than it currently is.\nAnother hindrance is more the risk of leaving the car. Say a user would like to go to the grocery store for a half hour, but not pay for the car while shopping. It\u2019s completely reasonable to do so, but they run the risk of another member taking the car off the street.\nI held by breath as I walked out of the sushi restaurant, knowing the walk home would be brutal with a belly stuffed with rice and sashimi. But I turned the corner and came face-to-face with the Smart car that would take me all the way back to my front door.\nI love the idea of Car2Go and would love to try it. Sadly, my area is decidedly rural. Even if we had the option, a car a few blocks away would be a 2-4 mile walk! Usually I don\u2019t mind, but it does mean that you really have to have your own vehicle all the time."}

Boasting over 700,000 developers using its services, it has provisioned enough numbers to be the second largest telecoms company in the US, and supports a rapidly growing number of transactions.\nEarlier this summer at Twilio's Signal conference, I sat down with company CEO Jeff Lawson to talk about how he saw application development changing, and his company's role in the new world of service-based development.\nAs Lawson points out, the interaction models we use for telephony have changed very little. \"The first telephone arrived almost 150 years ago, and how we interact has changed very little. The phone is still stupid, and while we've gone from rotary dialing to the number pad, context is lost on the old network,\" he said.\nLawson firmly believes that the future of communications and software is in understanding user context and using that to build better applications. \"The context of our lives is in software, and if we use it to reshape communications, it's time now to make things better as well,\" he explained.\nTwilio's APIs are key here, as they're intended to allow developers to blend communications into their apps. Lawson sees a future where the current generation of monolithic applications are broken up, adding new communication layers. High level APIs like WebRTC mean it's now easy to add video to applications, and Twilio is adding support for it (and related network traversal tools) to its SDKs. \"We're building a cloud-scale communications platform,\" he said, \"and it's orders of magnitude cheaper.\"\nLawson pointed out how services like Twilio's are changing the way telecoms services and applications are built and run. \"In the old world American Express had 8,000 agents, delivering 100 million interactions annually. In the new companies like Uber have 200,000 agents, and two billion interactions.\"\nA Czech-led project is aiming to deliver call center software that can analyse speech and provide answers to customer queries in real time.\nWhat Lawson is charting is the end of the traditional call center, with the cloud offering distributed services that can be routed anywhere in the world. If an operator in London is busy, a call can be sent to a phone in Dublin, or Auckland, or Kansas City, along with the context of the caller, allowing an agent working at home to respond quickly and efficiently, with no need for an expensive telecoms infrastructure. The caller will never know that the agent they're talking to is using a web app running on their PC, or on their smartphone.\nLawson points to what Twilio calls its \"Hall of Doers\" as an example of how APIs change things.\nWinners this year included a high school hackathon winner, a transgender support hotline with 70 trained volunteer operators, a tool to support the hearing impaired, and a browser that uses SMS to transfer data, bringing the web to places without wireless internet.\nTwilio's own services have expanded beyond voice and SMS, as Lawson notes, \"Authy's been part of Twilio since February. It's a two-factor authentications system that we're bringing to consumers everywhere. We work with developers to give them a UI, and have two apps.

John Allen flew to Logar province to personally deliver his regrets to villagers and provincial officials for the deaths of women, children and village elders in Wednesday's pre-dawn raid to capture a Taliban operative.\nAfghan officials have said the airstrike called in by NATO troops killed 18 civilians.\n\"I know that no apology can bring back the lives of the children or the people who perished in this tragedy and this accident, but I want you to know that you have my apology and we will do the right thing by the families,\" Allen told the group of about two dozen Afghans gathered at a base at the provincial capital of Pul-i-Alam.\nNATO and Afghan officials have said the troops were on an operation to capture a Taliban leader who had holed up in the house in Baraki Barak district's Sajawand village. As they tried to breach the compound, they came under fire and fought back, eventually calling in an airstrike.\nVillagers have said there was a wedding at the house the evening before and that it was full of families visiting for the celebration. The morning after the bombing, they piled the bodies of the dead into vans and drove them to the provincial capital to protest the strike.\nAn Afghan doctor who examined the bodies and interviewed two women injured in the airstrike said a group of Taliban fighters decided to spend the night in the house because they thought the wedding would provide them cover. When NATO and Afghan troops started advancing on the house in the middle of the night, they called out for civilians to come out, but the insurgents didn't allow them to leave, said Wali Wakil.\n\"The Taliban stopped them from getting out of the house,\" Wakil said. He said the 18 dead civilians including four women, two old men, three teenage boys and nine young children. Six Taliban fighters were also killed, Wakil said, citing the witnesses.\nAllen said that the troops did not know that there were civilians inside the house when they called in the airstrike.\n\"They were taken under fire. A hand grenade was thrown. Three of our people were wounded. We called for the people who were shooting to come out and then the situation became more grave and innocent people were killed,\" he told The Associated Press after talking with the group gathered in Logar.\n\"Our weapons killed these people,\" Allen said.\nIn Logar, Allen met with the governor before taking his message to the assembled group of Baraki Barak residents and local officials. He invoked his own family, saying that he kept seeing the faces of his own children as he thought about the children who had been killed.\nNighttime raids on militants taking cover in villages have been a repeated source of strain between the Afghan government, which says the raids put civilians in the crossfire, and its international allies, who say such operations are key to capturing and killing insurgent leaders.\nA deal signed in April was supposed to resolve the issue by putting the Afghan government in charge of such operations and the troops involved in Wednesday raid included both NATO and Afghan military. But Afghan President Hamid Karzai has put the blame for this week's deaths squarely on the international coalition, condemning their actions and calling for them to give a full account of how civilians ended up dead."}

People have the power!\"\nSmall, slender Dolores Huerta, with her soft but firm voice, was whipping up a crowd at a Los Angeles rally against an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Dozens of people boisterously echoed her words.\n\"She's an icon,\" actress Jane Fonda told AFP. Fonda, who had organized the protest, has frequently crossed paths with the indefatigable militant Huerta, an activist in an impressive array of movements: for union, feminist, ecologist and human rights -- and for nonviolence.\nAt 86, the inspiration for Barack Obama's \"Yes We Can\" slogan -- he awarded Huerta the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor -- remains largely unknown to the wider public.\nShe was a comrade-in-arms of Cesar Chavez, the famous leader of farm worker protests. Yet while he has had streets named after him and a monument raised in his honor, Huerta remains largely in the shadows.\nBut now, a documentary called \"Dolores,\" previewed at the Sundance Film Festival last month, wants to give Huerta her proper place in history.\nThe film, co-produced by guitarist Carlos Santana, has \"an important message that women's participation in history also has to be recorded and memorialized,\" she said in an interview from the offices of her foundation in Bakersfield, in the heart of California farm country.\n\"Hopefully it will inspire more women to get involved.\"\n\"I call it HIS-tory,\" she said. \"It's easy to see in the last election -- we had a woman that was superbly qualified to be president of the United States that was not elected even if she won the popular vote, and you had a man who had no experience in governing at all that was elected.\"\n\"It shows how women in our societies are devalued and disrespected,\" Huerta said.\nDirector Peter Bratt says Huerta, the descendant of Mexican immigrants who was raised by a single mother during the Depression, \"has impacted our democratic evolution in the last 50 years.\"\n\"Dolores\" traces the birth of the United Farm Workers (UFW), co-founded in the 1960s by Huerta and Chavez.\nIt revisits their struggle for the basic human rights of farm workers: fresh water, functioning toilets, safe working conditions, regular rest breaks, unemployment insurance and a minimum wage.\nHuerta and Chavez organized strikes, spectacular marches on the California legislature, and a nationwide grape boycott to protest the poor conditions facing vineyard workers, notably their exposure to toxic pesticides.\nThis mother of 11 children (she was twice married, and also had children by Chavez's brother Richard) marched for abortion rights alongside Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem.\nShe has been arrested more than 20 times, has been beaten, and was seriously wounded by the police during a 1988 protest in San Francisco.\nTwenty years earlier, she stood on a podium alongside Robert F. Kennedy, the president's brother, just minutes before he was assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968.\nThat incident left her with a fierce commitment to nonviolence and a passionate dislike for firearms.\n\"It was very emotional for me to see the movie,\" she said. \"I relived a lot of things.\"\nShe added: \"Many issues it addresses are still relevant, like police violence, discrimination against women, the use of pesticides...\"\nThe documentary also shows the sacrifices"}

Today, we're going to talk about the question, can real estate deeds be transferred into revocable trusts. Let's talk about what a revocable trust is. A revocable trust is a trust that can switch the beneficiary, it's not a non-revocable trust, means it can't be changed. Revocable trust can be altered and changed. And the benefit is, you don't have to go through that long, lengthy process. Unfortunately, when someone passes away, the assets can be passed to heirs through the trust in a quicker, streamlines, efficient manner. You're going to definitely want to talk to probably a financial planner as well as an attorney for the details of it. But in regards to can real estate transfer deeds be transferred? The answer is yes. You're going to have an attorney prepare a deed, you can do it yourself but it's real complicated. Most people don't want to do it. That's why you have attorneys to do these things. So, you have them prepare the deed, it will then be executed and recorded. And now the deed of your home will be in a trust.

Still, the flood has damaged roads and infrastructure, along with scattered homes and businesses.\nThe flood came at a bad time for farmers, with corn having been flourishing in the nation\u2019s midsection and soybean plants still maturing.\nAround his fields near Illinois\u2019 Warsaw, Zumwalt had cause for jubilance: Crops on just 100 to 200 acres got ruined in the past week or two by Mississippi River water that weaseled its way under the levees.

During its cycle, Apple has seemingly lost market segment share to its rivals and saw its first-ever declines in iPhone unit and revenue shipments year over year.\nApple blamed the year-over-year decline essentially on tough comparisons to the prior cycle, but that alone doesn't explain the market share loss. Clearly, Apple's marketing team failed to determine what features/technologies would be required to keep pace in the marketplace.\nIf Apple were to name its next-generation iPhone family the iPhone 6SE, this would send a pretty negative message to consumers. In particular, it would say to them that this new iPhone isn't much of an improvement over the prior-generation iPhone 6s series, potentially leading to muted upgrade activity.\nIn fact, with a name like the iPhone 6SE, not only would iPhone 6s owners be hard-pressed to upgrade, but average iPhone 6 users -- likely folks who don't follow the nitty-gritty details of each iPhone launch -- might think that the latest phone isn't much improved over what they already have.\nThat's not exactly the message that Apple can afford to send to customers with the coming product cycle -- at least not if it wants to have a reasonable shot at stabilizing/growing iPhone revenues after a rough fiscal year.\nApple's chief rival in many respects is Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). The iPhone and iPhone Plus models generally compete with Samsung's Galaxy S/Galaxy S Edge/Galaxy Note family of products.\nUnlike Apple, which has introduced \"new number\" phones in one year and \"s\" variants of those phones in the next, the Galaxy S phone series sees \"new numbers\" each year. In 2016, Samsung released the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and is on track to release the Galaxy Note 7 (skipping the Galaxy Note 6 entirely).\nIf Apple were to release the iPhone 6SE this year, not only would Apple's fall release be behind in numbering relative to Samsung's latest (this may seem trivial, but marketing/perception is quite important), but Samsung would pull further ahead with the spring launch of the Galaxy S8.\nApple really wouldn't have a good time trying to market an \"iPhone 6SE\" against a \"Galaxy S8.\"\nAs I argued in a previous column, it could be in Apple's best interests to call the next-generation iPhone the iPhone 7s rather than merely the iPhone 7. Such a naming scheme would allow Apple to play up the improvements in going from the iPhone 6s to the next phone.\nThe following iPhone could be called the iPhone 8 and then going forward, the company could eliminate the \"s\" models altogether, instead moving to new numbers from that point on. This would help Apple stay competitive with Samsung from a marketing/branding perspective."}

On Saturday, Nov. 9, 14 performers shared their funniest routines and tickled funny bones in the Buckeye Room at Hotel Millersburg. This casual non-competitive event raised $160 to sponsor four aspiring authors to attend the Wayne Writers Workshop at the University of Akron Orrville next April.\nIt was Denice Hazlett's first-time attempt at standup. \"There are a lot of funny people around here!\" Hazlett noted. She founded the Poesies Poetry Slam, writes for the Bargain Hunter and is working on \"Ray Bradbury,\" a book of short stories.\nLike Hazlett, the majority of the other performers hadn't performed their routines in front of a big audience either, although Zedrick Clark had made it to the final round at Poesies in April. \"I wasn't planning to perform at Comedy Night, but someone threw my name in the hat, and I didn't even know it until shortly before my name was called,\" Clark said.\nRaymond Buckland, who came up with the idea for Comedy Night, said \"It has been 50 years since I last did standup. I thoroughly enjoyed this. For being the first time for the event, it was very successful. The next time it will be a whole lot better.\" Buckland has a long resume in all types of writing and has performed in venues like Fillmore East, in New York, and many other places back in England.\nBuckland was named \"Writer of the Year\" in April at the 2013 Wayne Writers Workshop and has written more than 70 books. His latest book, \"Cursed in the Act,\" is the first in a mystery series and will be released on Jan. 7 by Penguin Books' Berkley Prime Crime. It is available to pre-order now through Amazon.\nIntroducing the performers and controlling the crowd was ably managed by Bill Martino, an efficient Master of Ceremonies.\n\"It was a new experience which I had never done before. I enjoyed it and would do it again,\" said Ed Schrock, who writes a weekly column for \"The Budget\" and is the author of a book of short stories, \"Everybody Was Happy.\"\nBuckland and the other members of Killbuck Valley Writers' Guild (KVWG) are already planning the next Comedy Night that is tentatively scheduled for March 1, 2014 at Hotel Millersburg.

However, widespread implementation of these cells requires production of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Historically, catalysts for the ORR are efficient, but based on noble metals like platinum or palladium. These metals are obviously very expensive which limits possible commercial applications.\nThis research synthesizes and tests inexpensive catalysts using earth abundant metals (like iron or cobalt) for activity. We use previously tested methodology for determining electrical activity and analysis of results, including recent Foot-of-the-Wave analysis (FOWA) to determine turnover frequencies for the selected molecules.

This first step is perfectly aligned with our company\u2019s 2019 growth targets, aiming to expand into the subcontinental market.\"\n\"The main challenges of this project are the location and the timelines.

However, we have a reputation for being resourceful, reactive and able to respond to any client requirement which was certainly a huge benefit here and I believe one of the key reasons we were awarded the contract,\" he added.\nIn addition to providing materials and equipment, ULO Systems said it has deployed a team of highly qualified technicians, to oversee the manufacturing and installation of the concrete mattresses."}

I mean that for any woman that has ever been pregnant, some of her baby\u2019s cells may circulate in her bloodstream for as long as she lives. Those cells often take residence in her lungs, spinal cord, skin, thyroid gland, liver, intestine, cervix, gallbladder, spleen, lymph nodes, and blood vessels. And, yes, the baby\u2019s cells can also live a lifetime in her heart and mind.\nDuring pregnancy, cells sneak across the placenta in both directions. The fetus\u2019s cells enter his mother, and the mother\u2019s cells enter the fetus. A baby\u2019s cells are detectable in his mother\u2019s bloodstream as early as four weeks after conception, and a mother\u2019s cells are detectable in her fetus by week 13. In the first trimester, one out of every fifty thousand cells in her body are from her baby-to-be (this is how some noninvasive prenatal tests check for genetic disorders). In the second and third trimesters, the count is up to one out of every thousand maternal cells. At the end of the pregnancy, up to 6 percent of the DNA in a pregnant woman\u2019s blood plasma comes from the fetus. After birth, the mother\u2019s fetal cell count plummets, but some stick around for the long haul. Those lingerers create their own lineages. Imagine colonies in the motherland.\nMoms usually tolerate the invasion. This is why skin, organ, and bone marrow transplants between mother and child have a much higher success rate than between father and child.\nOf course, we nosy mothers would like to know exactly what our children\u2019s cells are up to while they hang out in us. Are they just biding time in our bodies? Are they mother\u2019s little helpers? Or are they baby rebels, planning an insurgency?\nIt turns out that when fetal cells are good, they are very, very good. They may protect mothers from some forms of cancer. Fetal cells show up significantly more often in the breast tissue of women who don\u2019t have breast cancer than in women who do (43 versus 14 percent). Why is this? Fetal cells are foreign to the mother because they contain DNA from the baby\u2019s father. One theory is that this \u201cotherness\u201d stimulates the mother\u2019s immune system just enough to help keep malignant cells in check. The more fetal cells there are in a woman\u2019s body, the less active are autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. These conditions improve during pregnancy and for some time afterward \u2014 suggesting that the mother\u2019s immune system is more focused on attacking the \u201cother,\u201d not herself. There\u2019s also tantalizing evidence that fetal cells may offer the mother increased resistance to certain diseases, thanks to the presence of the father\u2019s immune system genes. These are new weapons in the war chest.\nSome fetal cells have the potential to grow up and be anything. While many of the cells that enter the mother are immune system cells, some are stem cells. Stem cells have magical properties: they can morph into other types of cells (a process called differentiation), like liver, heart, or brain cells, and become part of those organs.

Lewis immediately shook his right arm before heading to the sidelines, where he watched the remainder of the game. Lewis took a knee to watch the game\u2019s final frantic moments, which included a dropped two-point conversion by Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant that would have tied the game, and a missed 51-yard field goal by Dan Bailey that would have won it.\nLewis is a 13-time Pro Bowl selection, a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year and was the MVP of the Ravens\u2019 Super Bowl XXXV victory over the New York Giants.\nThe news of his season-ending injury prompted several players, including Washington Redskins rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III and Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker LaMarr Woodley, to use their Twitter accounts to wish Lewis a speedy recovery.\n\u201cRay Lewis has helped progress this game so guys like myself have something to strive to be...a professional.

The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc.\nHank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s.\n\u201cI think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,\u201d Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon.\nFor example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz\u2019 Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont.\nTrian is pushing the company\u2019s board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two.

If it's successful it will be the biggest IPO so far this year.\nThe auto industry fallout put a major dent in the company's revenue, more than half of which comes from the auto sector, according to Paul Bard, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital.\nThe auto sector stabilized during the second half of 2009 as sales picked up, but Bard said there are a couple of reasons why investors may stumble over Sensata's offering price.\nFor starters, the company is entering an IPO market that has looked at times more like a flea market. Almost 70 percent of year-to-date IPOs priced below the expected range, according to a report released by Renaissance Capital last month.\nThat compares with an average of just 28 percent from 2001 to 2009.\nAnd like a number of other companies trying to enter the market this year, Sensata comes with a sizable amount of debt, Bard pointed out.\nThe company listed a total debt of more than $2.3 billion in a recent securities filing. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Sensata said it will use about $350 million of the proceeds from its IPO to pay off debt.\nStill, after a rough year, the economy has stabilized and the outlook appears to be growing brighter for Sensata. Revenue in 2009 dipped 20 percent to $1.1 billion, only to rebound by 26 percent in the final three months of the year to $338.1 million.\nMoody's Investors Service cited improving financial results when it boosted Sensata's credit rating last month.\nSensata has a strong position in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil, where robust consumer spending may help lead the world economy out of a rut. The company said 18 percent of its sales last year were in developing countries.\nAnd Sensata makes products intended to make the products of other companies safer, particularly items with engines.\nThat is a growing priority for consumers, Bard said, particularly at a time of massive auto recalls.\nSensata Technologies Holding BV, which is based in the Netherlands, plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"ST.\""}

Why would Sony make such an obvious omission especially when its competitor's $299 console supports it? So it could push gamers to sign up for its digital 4K movie streaming service called ULTRA.\nIn its own words, here's why Sony cut out the 4K UHD Blu-ray player from the PS4 Pro: \"Our feeling is that while physical media continues to be a big part of the games business, we see a trend on video towards streaming. Certainly with our user base, it's the second biggest use case for people's time on the system so we place more emphasis on that area,\" Sony Interactive Entertainment President Andrew House told The Guardian.\nIn actuality, there's a few reasons Sony shaved of 4K UHD Blu-ray support from its new PlayStation 4 Pro. The most obvious reason you'd think is because of the cost of the Blu-ray player itself, but the reality is that the PS4 Pro already has the requisite hardware for 4K UHD video playback, which is the most expensive part.\nNo, Sony cut the feature for many reasons, the first of which so it could push people towards its new premium 4K service called ULTRA, which, outside of YouTube and Netflix, will be the only way to watch 4K movies. But there's one massive problem with this approach: the everyday person doesn't have the internet connection speeds required to stream 80GB+ movies.\nSo let's talk about ULTRA for a bit. The biggest downside of ULTRA is that it doesn't have a monthly subscription service. You have to buy each 4K movie piecemeal for $30 from the Sony Pictures Store and stream it from Sony's network. ULTRA includes a limited selection of movies from Sony Pictures and Columbia's library, which are rendered in 4K and have HDR support. You can also upgrade movies you own in your Ultraviolet library to 4K for a \"fraction of the cost\" of buying them at regular cost.\nULTRA sounds like an extremely clunky and awkward way for consumers to access 4K video content. But there's more: Sony's PS4 Pro will support Netflix content in 4K.\nThis partnership between Sony and Netflix is another big reason that the PS4 Pro lacks a 4K UHD Blu-ray player; if everyone had the choice to pop in 4K discs, no one would smash their internet bandwidth by streaming 4K content via Netflix.\nSony's Andrew House said that Netflix would add over 6,000 hours of 4K content to its catalogue, and all of it would be streamable on the PS4 Pro. Also remember that Netflix charges an extra fee on top of the subscription price to watch content in 4K.\nAnother big reason that the PS4 Pro doesn't have a 4K Blu-ray player is because of the console's lower $399 cost.\nSince the PS4 Pro is outfitted with an AMD Polaris GPU, Sony is likely selling the console at a loss for just $399. I personally expected a minimum price tag of $459 given the capabilities of the console tech. To make up for that loss, the company rose the price of key subscription services like PlayStation Plus and cut the 4K UHD Blu-"}

Budgets sometimes have a line item for social and a line for mobile, but in truth, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell them apart.\nWe know from social networks, research firms and user search queries that users of social networks are frequently accessing them from mobile devices, and mobile users are frequently accessing social networks as part of their daily mobile routines.\nMarketers may be thinking about mobile and social as separate line items that require different specialists, agencies and strategies, and to some extent they do; but their social networking efforts are going to reach mobile users and their mobile efforts will be incomplete without some sort of social component.\nThe blurred line between social and mobile may be obvious in the case of mobile social networks like Foursquare and Gowalla, but the line applies to social networks with more reach as well.\nIn other words, if you\u2019re running a social media campaign in Facebook or Twitter, it\u2019s very likely that your target is viewing it on a mobile device.\nIf your target is a Facebook user, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re engaging with your brand twice as much on a mobile device as they would be on a desktop computer.\nIf your business is doing a Groupon, it\u2019s also likely that a growing number of your customers will never print out the Groupon, but redeem it at the local business with their smartphone.\nIf you consider yourself a video SEO or video marketer and are actively engaging your target audience in YouTube, your target audience is likely being engaged on their mobile device.\nIf you\u2019re a mobile marketer and you\u2019re not thinking about social media, you\u2019re not thinking about the activity that occupies 30% of the most active mobile user group\u2019s time. This especially applies to social media and mobile marketers who target moms, as they use mobile social media more than any other demographic.\nNo wonder a recent survey by PR Week found that the majority of US marketers surveyed believed mobile social would have important consequences for their brand.\nIf you\u2019re running both social media and mobile campaigns and you\u2019re considering the synergies between mobile and social, great. You\u2019re on the right track and you have quite a bit of evidence to justify the spend not just on social media or mobile marketing, but both.\nHowever, if you\u2019re choosing to experiment with one or the other this year, take the rest of the year to plan for how your mobile campaigns will include social media and social media campaigns will include mobile.\nOne strategy Cindy Krum introduced last year is to use social media to target messages to mobile users, through local social networking and providing mobile content. The article contains a lot of great tips and is definitely worth a read for anyone looking to take advantage of the synergies between mobile and social media. But given the fast pace of innovation in mobile and social media, there are even more opportunities for marketers today.\nIn the area of local social networking, Facebook Places was introduced not long after Cindy\u2019s article, and they recently announced group deal opportunities for advertisers and marketers who want to use Facebook places as a mobile marketing vehicle.\nEarlier this week, Google Latitude also announced a check-in service, which could add another dimension to marketers with listings in Google Maps.\nIf you\u2019re a social media marketer or mobile marketer, it can be difficult to pick the right channels to reach your target audience.\nIdeally marketers would have a presence everywhere, but with limited resources to perform the full time job of managing a community, how do social media and mobile marketers prioritize?\nOne good way to prioritize social networks based on"}

Ruled by a former Marxist guerrilla leader since its independence from Ethiopia, Eritrea sees conscription as crucial to its security.\nIn a 2014 lawsuit, Eritreans allege they were forced to work at Nevsun\u2019s Bisha mine between 2008 and 2012. Nevsun, which appealed to Canada\u2019s Supreme Court in January to throw out the case, has said its investment in Eritrea brings social and economic benefits.\nLundin Mining belongs to the Swedish-Canadian Lundin family\u2019s global empire of copper, diamond, gold and oil companies, which has previously invested in such higher-risk jurisdictions as the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe family has become more cautious, the people said, with an ongoing investigation into allegations that Stockholm-listed Lundin Petroleum was complicit in crimes against international humanitarian law in Sudan between 1997 and 2003. Lundin Petroleum denies any wrongdoing.\nIn January, police searched company offices in Stockholm and Geneva and the Lundin family office in Geneva.

Bad choice.\"\nMr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a \"progressive whipping boy,\" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nWith the vigorous attacks on Mr. Summers that have erupted in recent days, now his supporters are engaged in a more public campaign to smooth his knotty reputation as being not just brilliant but also bullheaded and brusque.\n\"It's my experience, and the experience of a lot of people, that he's a great person to work with,\" said Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, who worked with Mr. Summers at the Treasury Department and the World Bank.\nMr. Obama is now in the process of interviewing three candidates for the position at the helm of the central bank: Mr. Summers; Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman at the Federal Reserve, who had generally been considered the front-runner for the job; and a dark horse for the post, Donald L. Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman.\nIn his meeting on Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama stressed that he had not yet made up his mind. People close to the process said the White House is trying to tamp down on the feverish speculation that the race had come down to Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen and deflect some of the attacks on Mr. Summers.\nOne early candidate for Fed chairman was Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary and Obama confidante, insiders said. The White House approached Mr. Geithner to ask if he would be considered for the job, but he declined.\nAmy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, declined to comment about the administration's personnel policy.\nPerhaps no economic official in recent years has a more divergent reputation within the White House and outside of it than Mr. Summers. And it is his reputation among economic policy staff members that might ultimately secure him Mr. Obama's nod.\n\"You can't find a member of the economic team who is for anyone but Larry,\" said a person close to the administration who declined to talk on the record before Mr. Obama makes his decision. \"That's true at Treasury, that's true at the White House. The reason is, Larry has been through this. Larry brings the right skills to bear here.\"\nBy contrast, Mr. Summers's detractors have expressed abject shock that he might be considered for the position. They describe him as an abrasive interlocutor who can be dismissive of ideas, and people, he considers not up to snuff. They also note his arguments for deregulation of parts of the financial industry in the 1990s, and ties to and paychecks from Wall Street today.\nSheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, publicly argued in a recent commentary on CNN/Money that Mr. Obama should pick Ms. Yellen, because \"unlike Larry Summers, Tim Geithner and other Bob Rubin minions frequently mentioned in the financial press as potential Bernanke successors, she was not part of the deregulatory cabal that got us into the 2008 financial crisis.\" Do"}

{"idx": "5320", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, journalists are spewing forth endless retrospectives -- asking people to recall \"where were you when,\" interviewing anguished families of victims, and probing whether politicians have been successful in their \"war on terror.\" It is unlikely, however, that journalists will look at themselves and their profession and ask, \"How did we do post 9/11?\" They should.\nThe role -- many would say, failure -- of the media in the run-up to the Iraq war has been widely debated. But two questions more immediately related to 9/11 have been less loudly argued: Did we exaggerate the threat of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, thus contributing to the collective paranoia, intrusive security measures at airports, and multi-billion dollar security industry that survives on fear? And did we fail to monitor the erosion of civil liberties?\nDuring the Cold War, a communist-under-every-bed hysteria was fueled by demagogic politicians, aided and abetted by journalists who didn't want to risk being branded anti-American, or who perhaps shared the view. I remember a reporter in Egypt once telling me that she knew how to see her stories get on the front-page: put a reference to \"communism\" in the first three graphs. After 9/11, Al Qaeda terrorists were ubiquitous, and \"linked to Al Qaeda\" became a journalistic mantra, still in wide use today.\nWhen I was in Southeast Asia from 2002 until 2006, stories about the Philippine organization Abu Sayyaf routinely asserted that it was \"linked to Al Qaeda.\" Yes, at one time in the early 1990s, Osama bin Laden may have given money to the organization, but after 9/11 it degenerated into a lawless gang of bandits that kidnapped and murdered for money, without any ideological commitment.\nWhat does \"linked to Al Qaeda\" mean, anyway? That the \"linked\" group's leaders pledge allegiance to Osama bin Laden? That some members trained at Al Qaeda camps, or that the terrorists share a hatred of the United States and Jews?\nOsama bin Laden wasn't Einstein, not even Lenin or Che Guevara. He was Charles Manson. Al Qaeda never posed an existential threat to the United States, failed to establish control in a single country, let alone establish a caliphate from Morocco to Indonesia. What he did on 9/11 was a crime, a crime writ large, not the opening salvo in a war, and we should have treated him as a long-bearded psychopath cowering in a cave.\nInstead, like the politicians, journalists were consumed with the fear that there might be a terrorist attack they hadn't anticipated, and that there were Al Qaeda sleeper cells crawling around Europe. Newspapers deployed their resources accordingly.\nThey were far less concerned about civil liberties. Editors long ignored isolated reports that the United States was holding suspected terrorists in secret prisons. \"We wouldn't publish it even if we knew,\" a senior editor at a major American newspaper said when it was suggested that his paper devote its impressive investigative talent to exposing the secret prisons.\nThat outlook, formed by 9/11, was shared throughout the industry.

The order appears aimed at addressing a ruling from a federal court judge in Montana last fall, who halted the project after finding the Trump administration had inadequately considered the environmental impact of the project before allowing it to move forward.\nThat ruling faulted the State Department for not doing a sufficient review as required under the National Environmental Policy Act. But because that law applies to agency actions, as opposed to those by the White House, the president may be able to sidestep the issue by granting the permit himself rather than delegating the cross-border permit to the secretary of state.\nBut environmental advocates were quick to criticize Trump\u2019s latest effort to push the project forward.\nTrump\u2019s move to approve the pipeline does not address a separate legal hurdle that the project faces in Nebraska, where the state Supreme Court is considering a challenge landowners have brought against the pipeline route approved by the Nebraska Public Utilities Commission.\nLast fall\u2019s federal court decision was a rebuke to Trump, who had vowed to support the pipeline and who signed an executive order days into his presidency restarting the project after the Obama administration had halted it over environmental concerns.\nU.S. District Judge Brian Morris, in Montana, issued a 54-page ruling that found the State Department had \u201csimply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change\u201d from the Obama administration in its zeal to further Trump\u2019s goal of letting the pipeline move forward. In doing so, the administration ran afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires \u201creasoned\u201d explanations for government decisions, particularly when they represent reversals of well-studied actions.\n\"An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts\u201d in the present, Morris wrote, citing case law.\nThe court decision did not permanently block a federal permit for Keystone XL. But it required the administration to conduct a more complete review of potential adverse impacts related to climate change, cultural resources and endangered species, as well as reevaluate the effect of current oil prices on the viability of the pipeline. The court basically ordered a do-over.\nThe decade-long saga over the Keystone XL pipeline, which would stretch nearly 1,200 miles from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb., has been full of legal twists. Envisioned in 2008 as a way to connect Canada\u2019s oil sands fields with Gulf Coast refineries, the project has died and been resurrected more than once.\nNative American tribes and Oklahoma oil magnates have weighed in. Opponents chained themselves to a truck carrying pipe and were arrested. Residents of Nebraska and other states fought the company over land rights. Environmental advocates have objected over concerns about the effects on wildlife.\nThe Keystone XL (the initials stand for \u201cexport limited\u201d), which aims to extend the firm\u2019s existing Keystone pipeline, would transport as much as 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day through a 36-inch pipe from Alberta, Canada, and Montana to Oklahoma and the"}

Madeleine Thien\u2019s Do Not Say We Have Nothing (Knopf Canada) has achieved all the success \u2014 critical, award-bestowed, and now that initial print under-runs have been corrected, popular \u2014 that one literary novel reasonably can.\nRather than try to list all its strengths, then, I\u2019ll single out one. Conveying the broad currents of history, as Thien does with the Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen Square, is one thing. Convincingly depicting the most intimate domestic scenes and family interactions is quite another. Balancing the two is a difficult, delicate thing, a hurdle at which plenty of writers have fallen. But Thien gets it just right.\nCatherine Leroux\u2019s The Party Wall (Biblioasis, translated by Lazer Lederhendler from Le mur mitoyen) is a book that defies easy summary: You might read it at first as a story collection, but it slowly sinks in that Leroux has a grander design.\nJumping in setting from Montreal to points all over Canada and the U.S., part of the book\u2019s appeal is in observing the sleight-of-hand with which Leroux juggles and eventually aligns all the seemingly disparate elements. The connecting thread being family rupture, separation and attempted reconciliation, the title \u2014 a party wall both divides and joins \u2014 is the perfect metaphor.\nHere, I strongly suspect, is one of those rare revisit-once-a-year-in-perpetuity reading experiences.\nJacob Wren\u2019s Rich and Poor (BookThug) is political fiction at its sharpest. An aspiring concert pianist, reduced to working as an under-the-table dishwasher, becomes obsessed with taking violent revenge on the man he considers responsible for his plight: a billionaire oligarch who gets his kicks by, among other things, watching children fight.\nWren alternates in first-person between the two, effectively dramatizing the 99-per-cent vs. one-per-cent divide. In lesser hands it might have read as clumsy allegory, but because the two voices are equally compelling, what we get is something like an intellectual thriller.\nRich and Poor is essential and bracing reading, especially at a time when millions of poor Americans can convince themselves that a rich man is their champion.\nGenevi\u00e8ve Pettersen\u2019s The Goddess of Fireflies (V\u00e9hicule Press/Esplanade Books, translated by Neil Smith from La d\u00e9esse des mouches \u00e0 feu) reads at times like anthropological field study, but in the best of ways.\nPettersen takes her experience of growing up in the Saguenay in the grunge \u201990s"}

We hear a lot about 'value chains' and relying on markets, but hardly anything about market failures, and the fact that supply chains are often rigged against small- scale farmers.\"\n\"De Schutter is right that what's important is to re- localise food systems, so that supply chains are shorter and geared towards local communities. It's hard to see how these corporate alliances can play any role in that process,\" Hansen- Kuhn concluded.\nCurrently, 35-40 percent of harvests are lost due to inadequate transportation and storage facilities, while a further 35-40 percent goes to wealthy Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.\nAccording to experts like De Schutter, the inability of 10 percent of the world\u2019s population to feed itself is also a reflection of unsustainable patterns of consumption and deeply flawed models of industrialised agricultural production which, if allowed to continue, will divert 50 percent of global cereal harvests towards feeding cattle by the year 2050.\n\u201cFrom the food crisis in 1974, to the crisis in 2007-2008, and even now during the food crisis of 2010-2011, governments have had the same Pavlovian reaction \u2013 to increase production in order to lower prices and alleviate the burden of food price inflation on the population,\u201d De Schutter said at"}

For this material-switch rollout, Lego has made the admittedly cute decision of using it to produce playsets' tiny Lego plants\u2014as in, trees, shrubs, vines, and patches of grass.\nTo usher in Thursday's news, Lego rolled out its new plant-based hero, Plantis Maximus.\n...which turns into Lego bricks and pieces.\nPlantis starts to spread the gospel of plant-based materials for Lego pieces.\nIn the meantime, production of plant-based plant pieces has already begun.\nThe company's announcement describes the plant-based pieces' composition as \"technically identical\" to its standard blocks' materials, and Lego notes the new pieces have been tested to meet the company's standards. (It doesn't confirm whether this means Arduino-testing rigs or having bedraggled parents accidentally walk over them on bare feet and remark on how similarly painful they feel.) And unsurprisingly, these new pieces will have the company's standard circle-grid structure on their bottoms to ensure compatibility with decades of Lego pieces and sets.\nIn spite of this \"technically identical\" composition, the announcement doesn't confirm what the hold-up is to roll this kind of material out beyond a 1 to 2 percent sector. Lego did not confirm whether the hold-up is due to larger piece designs, sugarcane polyethylene production sourcing, green tint from that specific kind of polyethylene, or other issues.\nIn 2012, Lego announced a corporate initiative to find more \"sustainable\" materials for its block pieces, which the company once estimated are produced to the tune of \"more than 60 billion\" a year. That was followed in 2015 by the announcement of a corporate Sustainable Materials Center and a hiring drive of over 100 R&D staffers. All these initiatives align with the company's long-stated goal of using a complete \"sustainable material\" pipeline for its Lego bricks and pieces by the year 2030. Thursday's announcement sees the company stick to that timeline, as opposed to fast forwarding it in any way.\nResearch about plant-based polyethylene has pointed to environmental impact such as cropland expansion and fertilizer use, but the literature ultimately points to a net gain compared to the use of fossil fuels for the materials."}
{"idx": "5347", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Vancouver-based firm CA Cloud is offering CIOs the chance to run their own private cloud implementations, using open sourced cloud platform OpenStack.\nThe benefits of cloud computing are well understood: elasticity, cost-effectiveness, and the option for automation and self-provisioning of services. For many companies, moving to a public cloud-based infrastructure (where lots of customers share a single server) is too risky. Heavy regulation and compliance issues, along with their own security concerns, may prevent them being part of a multi-tenanted environment.\nMany may not have the time or resource to build up a cloud infrastructure outside their own organisation. Private clouds, are another option, in which the same automation benefits are provided on a dedicated computing system for a single customer.\nCA Cloud is a division of Canadian Web Hosting. The company is Canadian, and so is able to take Canadian companies\u2019 privacy requirements into account, said chief strategy officer Matt McKinney. The firm already offers private cloud solutions powered by VMware, but now it\u2019s offering an OpenStack version. Why would CIOs care what runs at the back end, though?\nDeveloped by data centre giant RackSpace in 2010, OpenStack is designed to handle all the tasks that come along with cloud computing. It handles a variety of virtualised components, including virtual machines, block storage, and networking.\nTraditionally, there has been a trade-off for this flexibility: usability. Traditionally, OpenStack hasn\u2019t been packaged for the enterprise. Like many open source projects, administrators have to roll up their sleeves to work with it, instead of enjoying that smooth, seamless out-of-the-box experience that proprietary commercial cloud software vendors invest so much time creating.\nMcKinney said that OpenStack isn\u2019t a complete and perfect system. Neither was it designed to be, he added.\nCA Cloud offering is taking advantage of automation technology from a third company within McKinney\u2019s group: Auro. That company focuses on public cloud computing using OpenStack, and much of its technology has made its way into the private cloud implementation.\n\u201cAuro\u2019s infrastructure makes it easy to onboard into the cloud and comes with the customer support, easy installation, tools for cloud management, and all the other important pieces, like one-click application installation and deployments,\u201d McKinney said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our customers to have to worry about installing OpenStack including elements like Neutron networking, or configuring their distributed storage,\u201d he added.\nCA Cloud isn\u2019t the only OpenStack private cloud solution on the market. Blue Box has an interesting approach, in that it offers not only hosted OpenStack public clouds, but recently announced a managed on-premise solution, where it will set up and maintain your cloud servers for you, on-site. The company just raised $4m in its B-round, making a total $14m in funding so far. Blue Box is based in Seattle, though, whereas CA Cloud is capitalising on its Canadian location.\nPrices start at $65 for a single tenant test system at CA Cloud, moving to $2099 per month for five bare metal servers and local storage.\nShould Canada look to UK's G-Cloud for cloud computing pointers?\nThere's a big data expert shortage in Canada, but does your company really need one?"}

A total of 469 people with brain cancer were questioned, as were 422 people without brain cancer. The study found no significant evidence that those with brain tumours had used a mobile phone for more time than the people in the control sample.\nHowever, because some neural tumours have a long induction period, the scientists believe that studies over a longer time-span are needed. This research, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was carried out between 1994 and 1998.\nEarlier this month, a team at a Spanish University announced that mobile phones have a greater effect on human brain cells than was previously thought. The scientists, based at Madrid's University Complutense, discovered that a cell's non-spherical shape increases the intensity of the electric field generated within it by a mobile phone.\nAnd, writing in The Lancet in December, UK scientist Dr Gerard Hyland warned that children are at the greatest risk from mobile phone radiation -- specifically from low-intensity, pulsed radiation which could affect a number of brain functions.\nThe British government recently launched a \u00a37m research program into the issue of mobile phone safely, but has withdrawn its earlier advice that hands-free mobile phone kits protect against radiation.

Doug DeCosta, Bumpus and other Woods Hole residents made it clear that tradition and village continutity are more important than public safety. After picking a fight with Sgt. DeCosta and virtually every other sound minded person in the community, Selectman Bumpus spoke volumes of her philosphy, lest there be any doubt that she cares little about what happens outside of \"the Hole.\" \"Those of us who are on the road every day think it works,\" she is quoted as saying.\nWell, there you have it. Despite any training in transportation mangagement and public safety, and shy of even a complete term in any elected position, Ms. Bumpus is declaring that because she travels the road and has been free of an accident, the semi-trailers and buses that traverse this treacherous strech of roadway will have to make due.

Moore said police set up a perimeter in the area and began the search for Hall.\nPolice notified Delaware City Schools because the man was in the general area of Willis Education Center, Smith Elementary and Hayes High School and the district placed those schools on a perimeter lockdown, meaning no one was allowed in or out of those buildings.\nMoore said the lockdown was only a precaution and that Hall posed no direct threat to any of the schools in the vicinity of the pursuit.\nHall was apprehended by police a short time later and taken to the Delaware County Jail. The lockdown was lifted around 10:35 a.m.\nMoore said Hall will likely be facing additionally charges, including obstructing official police business.\nHall was being held in the Delaware County Jail on Tuesday."}

Unhappiest?\nThe resulting raw percentages were posted online at \u201cWIN/Gallup International\u2019s 40th Annual Global End of Year Survey\u201d, but the nations weren\u2019t ranked there; W/G\u2019s report is more like a data-dump than like a report.\nSo, based upon their numbers, I have here actually ranked the 69 nations, from the happiest, to the unhappiest, according to WIN/Gallup\u2019s own calculations of \u201cNet happiness,\u201d which are their study\u2019s bottom-line figures for each nation. WIN/Gallup says that \u201cNet happiness (happy minus unhappy) globally is +59%,\u201d and this indicates that the world\u2019s average person is happy with his/her life, but not very happy with it. That\u2019s good performance, but not terrific, worldwide.\nHowever, as will be explained below this first-ever presentation of W/G\u2019s rankings, the figures upon which the \u201cNet happiness\u201d calculations were based could be deceptive, because they largely reflect people\u2019s expectations of whether things are getting better in their country, or instead getting worse there; this measure of \u2018happiness\u2019 is an indication \u201cabout your life,\u201d instead of a report that necessarily reflects how they feel right now (or how they did feel at the time they were answering the question). Nobody knows for certain about his/her \u201clife,\u201d but only about what it was or has been, at times that a pollster\u2019s question might specify in the most recent past, such as \u201cyesterday\u201d \u2014 anything that\u2019s in the future, even \u201ctomorrow,\u201d or the totality of \u201cyour life,\u201d is partly speculative, and might be somewhat unrealistic. (Furthermore, people might be more optimistic in some cultures, and more pessimistic in others, and yet the difference might have little to do with how happy the people there are.) A survey to determine a population\u2019s actual \u201chappiness\u201d shouldn\u2019t invite its respondents to be at all speculative. This is a fundamental methodological flaw in the WIN/Gallup study, but it\u2019s common for pollsters to be so sloppy about wording the questions they\u2019re asking; and no poll-results can be any clearer (i.e., any more meaningful) to interpret, than were the questions which were asked. WIN/Gallup is normal in this regard. They\u2019d deserve a \u201cC\u201d rating on meaningfulness. But that\u2019s still something; their findings aren\u2019t total trash \u2014 these data weren\u2019t an utter waste of their time and money to produce (and of readers\u2019 attention to consider), but the results do indicate some combination of how happy a person is, mixed in with how happy the person expects the rest of his/her life to be. And they should be interpreted in that light.\nThe most optimistic countries about economic prosperity are Ghana and Bangladesh (+67% net optimistic each). In contrast, South Korea, Hong Kong and Greece are the most pessimistic (-62%, -56% and -53% respectively).\nOne might therefore say that Iraqis had the least optimism and hope, whereas Fijians, Colombians, and Chinese, had the most. Of course, if two other countries besides Iraq, which were also recently invaded and destroyed by the U.S. \u2014 such as Syria and Libya \u2014 had been surveyed by W/G, they might have scored even lower than Iraq did, but Syria and Libya were excluded from W/G\u2019s poll.

Following that, as always, we'll open it up for questions.\nYesterday, after the close, RigNet reported a net loss of $2.8 million or $0.15 per share, based on revenues of $64.8 million, which were up nearly 8% from the second quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of delivering top line growth and our third consecutive quarter with improved earnings. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure we defined in our press release and one of our key performance metrics, was $8.7 million, up just under 8% from the second quarter. This was our second consecutive quarterly increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nRevenue increased across each of our three reporting segments, both sequentially and versus the prior year period, showing healthy activity across all three segments. We're particularly pleased with the growth in the apps and IoT segment, where revenues were up 13.5% from the second quarter and almost 50% from third quarter 2017.\nLet me take a moment to remind everyone of our overall strategy, which is driving the ongoing transformation of RigNet from a company that's historically been seen as an oilfield services company, to a company that is a holistic"}

The two men disagree profoundly on the need for punctuality. But, as Wilder explained ahead of tomorrow's visit to Carrow Road, his quarrelling with Farke is really a phoney war.\n\"Yeah, it's alright, it's good,\" the Sheffield United manager replied when asked about his relationship with the German. \"Obviously a couple of bits and pieces have happened but what I will say is that we've always had entertaining games. They've not been dull have they. Really, there's no problem. No issues at all.\"\nThe 'bits and pieces' Wilder was referring to trace back to September last year when, already angered by what he perceived as City's deliberate time-wasting en route to a narrow victory at Bramall Lane, he also accused Farke of being disrespectful after reporting late for a pre-match meeting involving himself and the match officials. Four months later, when United avenged that defeat in Norfolk, Wilder sarcastically pointed to his watch during United's post game celebrations.\n\"I made a reaction after the first game, I wasn't happy with a few things and I don't keep that to myself,\" Wilder, whose father in law had been taken ill before the return fixture, said. \"The second time, there was some personal stuff on that that not a lot of people knew about at the time and the third one, earlier this season. that was a really tight match.\"\n\"But I'm full of respect for Dan and his team,\" Wilder, who masterminded his second triumph over Farke in August, continued. \"People like to pick bits and pieces out of it.

He's beaten Scott Pemberton, who was number one challenger for the world title, and has looked good in his last couple of fights.\"\nVictory could see Calzaghe making his 21st WBO title defence in the USA, possibly against former world middleweight champion Jermain Taylor.\n\"We've been in discussions with Taylor and that's a fight we would like, but first he has to come through this one,\" said Warren.\nVictory over Manfredo would enable Calzaghe to equal the 20 world title defences of former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes and Bernard Hopkins, the ex-middleweight title holder.\nIt would also edge him closer to the record of 25 by the great Joe Louis.\n\"What a thing to do to overtake Joe Louis' record. It would be a major achievement.

The Nintendo Switch Pro controller had early support on Linux, but the new code looks to expand compatibility by adding the Joy-Cons.\nInstead of just improving support for the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, which may be connected through USB and Bluetooth, the commit also seeks to add Chrome support for Bluetooth connections with Joy-Cons, both as a pair and as separate devices, and even the Joy-Con Charging Grip through USB.\nChrome\u2019s support is possible through the standard Gamepad API, which means that developers will be able to easily enable Nintendo Switch controllers in their games and apps. There is no definite timeline yet as to when the support for the Nintendo Switch Pro controllers and Joy-Cons will be added to Google Chrome.\nThe addition of support for the devices to Google Chrome is not really a groundbreaking move as of now, as there are a limited number of online games and apps that will offer an improved experience through Nintendo Switch controllers. The importance of the code lies in Google\u2019s future plans in gaming.\nGoogle is set to be part of the Game Developers Conference, where it will reportedly reveal its gaming hardware for Project Yeti, which includes the Project Stream game streaming service and a console that will utilize it.\nProject Stream ended its three-month demo in January, in which gamers played Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey on their Google Chrome browsers. The commit for Nintendo Switch controller support is likely tied to future iterations of Project Stream, to allow games to use the controllers on the game streaming service.\nThe code for Nintendo Switch controller support on Chrome comes after the discovery of patent for a controller that may come with the rumored Google gaming console. The document, filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, reveals a design that looks similar to the PlayStation 4 DualShock controller, with Yanko Design editor Sarang Sheth creating unofficial renders on what the Google gaming controller may look like."}

I grew up as a Liverpool supporter and went to watch games against United long before I played in them, so I always knew what the rivalry means to people and how big this game is.\nMost of the Liverpool players involved this weekend won't quite get that, which in a way is not a bad thing - they can play their normal game and not let the occasion get the better of them.\nInstead it is just another huge game against a big club, and an opportunity to put one over a rival for the top four and gain an edge in that race, which is wide open.\nA fast Liverpool start, but United to attack too?\nThe game is at Anfield so I am expecting a very positive performance from Liverpool and I am anticipating a fast start similar to the one they made against the Gunners.\nSo it will be very interesting to see how United approach the game tactically. When they stay in shape and keep everybody in position, they are very good at soaking up that sort of pressure.\nBut I have an inkling they may try to have a go themselves because of the weakness in Liverpool's back four at the moment, and the calls for Louis van Gaal to play more attack-minded football like we saw in United's draw at Newcastle.\nBoth teams have been inconsistent so it is very difficult to predict the outcome, but if Liverpool play with the same intensity they did against Arsenal on Wednesday they have got a really good chance.\nThey certainly do not have anything to fear - and there is more pressure on United to get a positive result at the weekend.\nHow Liverpool end this week will give a good indication of their chances of the top four, but whether they win or lose against United it is still too soon to judge Klopp's impact on the club.\nThis time next season we will be in a much better position to do that, when he has brought in some of his own players and then had some proper time, including a pre-season, to work with the team.\nRight now it is too early to tell. It is just over three months since he took charge and in that time Liverpool have had some great games and some really poor ones, much like they did under his predecessor Brendan Rodgers in the first part of the season.\nThere have been some encouraging signs, such as the zest and zip in their play during the first 30 minutes against Arsenal, and their response when things were not going well to drag themselves back into that game and pick up a point.\nBut the Liverpool we saw against the Gunners - and in their impressive wins over Chelsea and Manchester City - were nowhere to be seen when they went to Watford and West Ham and were well beaten.\nThe amount of hamstring injuries Liverpool's players have suffered under Klopp is also a concern, because there are too many to push under the carpet.\nThey will be linked with what the players are doing in training, usually to do with extra sprint work, but I suspect that part of"}

He could\u2019ve chosen to forehand thwack the fuzz out of the ball just as his opponent, Richard Gasquet, had a moment earlier. Instead, half way through a longish rally, one of the very few in this match, Federer\u2019s pink shoes stopped squeaking on court.\nAnd from about two metres behind the baseline, his right wrist, wrapped in a pink sweatband, collapsed.\nThe hitherto speeding projectile turned inert, dropping dead about an inch after crossing the tape.

Don\u2019t believe the eventual scoreline. It was far more humililiating and far more one-sided than 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 could ever suggest.\nThe exhibit lasted just 86 minutes. But it was enough time for him to create a masterpiece. \u201cA masterpiece that outdid every other Federer masterpiece on this court,\u201d according to McEnroe. It had it all \u2014 glorious serves, incredible returns, \u2018tweeners, sabers, screamers and stunners. Even Federer would concede that his game on the night, and fortnight, was a tad surreal.\n\u201cAre you amazed at all at yourself that you\u2019re doing that at this level at this age?\u201d he was asked after his 86-minute workout on court. \u201cYeah, a little bit,\u201d Federer said.\n\u201cYou know, at my age to run through five opponents the way I have done here at the US Open, I don\u2019t consider that normal, to be quite honest.

But this raises significant questions.\nWould the Dolphins, knowing Branch\u2019s history, pay him? Of would they rather another team bet that an inconsistent player who is playing well in a contract year continue to perform once he gets paid?\nObviously, there can be no answer right now.

But only as long Culliver practices well with no setbacks Wednesday and Thursday.\nLast week Bacarri Rambo played 30 of 54 snaps only days after the joining the team.

So I asked Joseph if that is true?\nMaxwell was called for one pass interference penalty Sunday -- that for 26 yards in the fourth quarter -- and Joseph is not sweating that too much.\nWe all know Jordan Phillips had that highlight interception and hurdle against the Jets. But Joseph said the second-year defensive tackle played well throughout the game.\nJoseph has a theory of why Phillips stepped up last week.

Another of Khan\u2019s duties with New Orleans was cutting up film the offensive quality control coach, keeping him close to the field and unquestionably increasing his football IQ.\nBy all accounts from Brown\u2019s profile on him, the Steelers have themselves a tireless worker and a guy who genuinely loves his job.\nNo contract is finalized without his blessing.

Not since the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into fragments and collided with Jupiter in 1994 has there been as much news and excitement over a single event in the scientific community.\nRather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today\u2019s news focused on the sub-atomic level. Scientists flipped the switch on the world\u2019s largest particle collider \u2013 known as the Large Hadron Collider \u2013 in the first major test of the $10 billion project.\nIt will be at least a year before the Large Hadron Collider reaches full power, yet today marks the beginning of a new frontier in particle physics.\nBuried 330 feet beneath the Swiss and French Alps, the 17-mile long collider is the most powerful in the world. Two photon beams will be accelerated to near the speed of light within the tunnels, and when they collide a collection of even smaller particles and anti-matter will appear, disappear, and shower onto nearby detectors.\nThere are many reasons why the LHC has sparked so much interest in the scientific community. The LHC represents the largest (and most expensive) terrestial scientific experiment ever undertaken by mankind. While the Europeans have taken the lead, 60 nations in all have contributed to the event, including $531 million from the United States.\nThe reason for such high expenditures is in the potentially groundbreaking science. Many are hoping that some of the most puzzling questions in science \u2014 from those of dark matter, dark energy, and the possible existence of hidden dimensions of time and space \u2014 can be answered by the LHC.\nMuch as the quantum theories of the early 1900s led to many of today\u2019s everyday technological devices, the discoveries made at the LHC promise to transform common life far into the future.\nAmong the most exciting possible discoveries is the existence of the so-called \u201cGod Particle,\u201d or Higgs boson, which would help confirm current theories of how particles acquire mass.\nString theorists will also be on the lookout for evidence of other dimensions. The LHC reaches much higher energies than its American counterpart, the Fermilab Particle Accelerator in Batavia, Ill., which may allow for particles to zip into other dimensions and then suddenly reappear again \u2013 proving the existence of other dimensions interwoven into our universe.\nSuch a discovery would be a major victory for string theory, a description of the Universe which posits that the most basic particles in the universe are miniscule, vibrating strings. Various permutations of the theory have come and gone, but all require multiple dimensions, and none have yet developed a comprehensive, cogent, mathematical description of the universe.\n2 Comments on \"Part I: Don't expect CERN's Large Hadron Collider to reveal new dimensions of space and time\"\nbut it willnot be complete.\n(Breaking News: September 11, 2008 - 'Peter Higgs launches attack against Nobel rival Stephen Hawking' - The Times: \"Professor Peter Higgs, the scientist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, the particle at the centre of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment, launched a withering attack on Professor Stephen Hawking, saying his work was \"not good enough\".\" \""}

The effort aims to provide consistency and transparency for British companies to communicate their products\u2019 carbon footprints to consumers. DEFRA, the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, co-sponsored the voluntary system with the Carbon Trust in response to companies looking to count their carbon emissions and consumers wanting to know what how companies are doing just that.\nPAS 2050 is an audit system that will help companies calculate the life cycle greenhouse gases emissions of goods and services like food, buildings and electronics. It considers all the life cycle stages of a product from raw materials extraction to end of life (waste management). According to the BSI, the methodology includes six greenhouse gases identified under the Kyoto Protocol and can be used by all sizes and types of organizations. The Carbon Trust developed the method to calculate the total emissions of greenhouse gases in carbon equivalents from a product across its life cycle, but it currently excludes in-use emissions. This could be an issue for electronic products or buildings whose impacts can be important during the use phase, but for products such as food it\u2019s not as big of a deal.\nThe Carbon Trust has already piloted PAS 2050 with 75 product ranges across a wide range of companies including: PepsiCo, Boots, Innocent, Marshalls, Tesco, Cadbury, Halifax, Coca Cola, Kimberly Clark, The Co-operative Group, Scottish & Newcastle, Coors Brewers, Muller, British Sugar, ABAgri, Sainsbury\u2019s, Danone, Continental Clothing Company, Colors Fruit, Morphy Richards, Mey Selections and Aggregate Industries.\nFor its Botanics shampoo, Boots has redesigned its logistics network so that products could be delivered direct to stores, reducing road miles and packaging, this alone has reduced the carbon footprint of making the shampoo by 10 per cent.\nIt will be interesting to see how this audit scheme is coordinated with the already existing ISO 14040 life cycle assessment standard that is used internationally. Although not perfect, this method allows companies to assess the complete life cycle impacts of a product and does not reduce impacts to CO2 equivalents, but looks at broader impacts and includes not only GHG emissions but aquatic toxicity, ozone depletion, eutrophification, etc. One must be careful when reducing results to single indicators as they can be misleading for consumers.\nThis is an important step forward for helping companies look at carbon footprintsand also in keeping consumers better informed at the point of purchase. It should aid consumers in their quest for responsible purchases and more sustainable lifestyle choices.\nIs a Negative CO2 Footprint Possible?\nShould Food Labelling Show Water Footprint?"}

And I certainly agree that a focus on health and support is important for well-being.\nBut unfortunately, that\u2019s pretty much where my applause ends. While the article gets many things right, it also seems to misrepresent some of the complexity in this area of research and its translation to real life.\nFor one, while one of Hobbes\u2019 central points \u2014 that diets don\u2019t work \u2014 is, of course, spot on, his assertion that scientists have known this fact but have actively chosen to ignore it discounts the fact that some of us have been desperately trying to share this truth for decades. I even wrote a book called \u201cSmart People Don\u2019t Diet\u201d back in 2014 out of desperation to alert the public to something that was so glaringly obvious to researchers, and yet so seldom discussed publicly. I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s written (and often donated copies of) books like this, developed entire college classes on the topic and spoken at libraries, schools and community centers (usually for free) in the hopes of informing the public.\nBut people don\u2019t want to listen. The message that diets don\u2019t work isn\u2019t nearly as appealing to consumers as plans, pills or potions that purport to \u201ccure\u201d the concerns they have (warranted or not) about their weight. It\u2019s sexier to follow a social media influencer\u2019s 30-day detox plan than to read an evidence-based book about the life-lengthening benefits of walking. What messages prevail isn\u2019t just about what doctors put out, it\u2019s also about what consumers pick up.\nPlus, we do know that there are people who lose weight and keep it off. In fact, since 1994, the National Weight Control Registry has collected data from over 10,000 people who have successfully lost weight (an average of 66 pounds) and kept it off long term. Although what works for one person may not be the best method for another, this research suggests that people who lose weight and keep it off are likely to reduce their caloric and fat intake permanently (not for merely a week or two), exercise for an average of one hour a day, eat breakfast every day, weigh themselves weekly and watch less than 10 hours of TV per week. Although not everyone wants to or can adopt these behaviors, the evidence suggests they are reasonable, healthy and sustainable ways to lose weight for many people.\nResearch has also shown that people can lose weight and keep it off via surgery, which was once considered a drastic approach, but is increasingly safe and effective. One Cochrane review of 26 studies on the topic reported that people lost an average of 46 pounds eight years after surgery compared to people in control groups, who gained weight eight years after receiving \u201cconventional\u201d treatments (like dieting).\nNot only is it sometimes possible to lose weight and keep it off, but it also can lead to better health and even happiness \u2014 links Hobbes seems to deny.

I'm not even sure you can point to the presence of an antidepressant as an indicator of someone's mental health, considering 11 percent (!) of this country is taking them and they're used to treat such a wide variety of issues.\nAt any rate, we don't need a medical report to tell us that something was terribly, terribly wrong with Tony Scott. You don't just choose to leave behind a wife, two young sons, and a well-respected career because you're having a bad morning. I can sort of understand why the brain cancer rumor started, because it's so inexplicable why he ended his life -- especially for those who say they had zero indication he was suffering -- but now that the results are in, it's time for the questioning to stop.\nEven taking into consideration the suicide notes he reportedly left for his loved ones, the only person who knows why Tony Scott committed suicide is Tony Scott. And hopefully, he's resting at peace now.\nDid you think there would be some sort of explanation revealed in Tony Scott's autopsy?"}

James Hausman's attorneys argued during a nine-day trial that dozens of other passengers have been injured by the doors on Holland America Line cruises because of problems with their sensors, The Seattle Times reported Tuesday (http://bit.ly/1QinDj4).\nThe company has denied that claim and asked the court to reduce the judgment. It says it will appeal.\nSurveillance video shows Hausman, 61, of Springfield, Illinois, walking through an automatic door when it shut on Nov. 26, 2011, as the M/S Amsterdam approached Hawaii. Hausman, who was traveling with his wife and daughter on the beginning leg of a cruise around the world, got hit in the face and side of the head.\nHolland America said in court documents that Hausman walked into the closing doors.\nA ship doctor diagnosed him with a concussion, and he finished the trip. But Hausman's attorneys say tests later showed that he suffered a minor brain injury that has caused seizures, memory loss and vertigo.\n\"He still has trouble with things that would have been simple before,\" said Hausman's lawyer, Rick Friedman, adding that his client has sold his gold and precious-metals retail business.\nFriedman alleged that Holland America did not reveal documentation on up to 34 other sliding-door incidents throughout its fleet going back three years. U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein allowed the jury to hear about 16 of those incidents that she decided were relevant.\nMotion sensors on the doors were set to open and close faster than normal, Friedman said. Holland America denied that allegation said it had no comment on the specifics of Hausman's lawsuit.\n\"Holland America Line is committed to the safety and security of our guests and take all incidents very seriously,\" the company said in a statement.\nThis story has been corrected to show that James Hausman was on a cruise around the world, not one to Amsterdam."}

Every year, approximately 10,000 people experience roundworm-related health symptoms, often getting roundworms (Toxocara spp.) from direct contact with contaminated soil. Keep your family safe by getting rid of the various roundworm risk factors in your backyard. By simply removing the source of roundworms -- namely pets and their feces -- the problem quickly goes away on its own.\nPick up and discard any animal waste in your yard, such as feces from your pet cat or dog, immediately. Use a plastic bag to prevent contact between your hand and the feces. Because it takes approximately 14 days for roundworm eggs in feces to hatch and become infective, proactive waste removal quickly breaks the worm's life cycle and helps eradicate the problem in your yard.\nDeworm your pets with a deworming kit provided by your pet's veterinarian, and have your pet tested for roundworms every six to 12 months. Because domestic pets are the chief contributors of roundworms in a backyard, keeping them free of worms prevents reintroduction of the problem.\nDeter your pets, and any wandering pets in your neighborhood, from using your yard's bare dirt areas as a restroom. Animals are frequently drawn to flower beds and similar soil surfaces. Lay a 1-inch mesh fence over the surface of your flowerbeds and vegetable garden beds. This deters pets from going there while not stopping your plants from growing.\nIf you're worried about roundworms in a specific area of your yard, such as a flowerbed, solarize it before handling the dirt. Simply clear the area of existing vegetation, lay a clear plastic tarp over the soil and weigh down the edges with rocks or bricks. The sun's heat will bake through the tarp and, after four weeks, will kill any roundworms in the underlying dirt.\nAlways wash your hands after playing with your pets or handling soil or pet waste.\nDuvauchelle, Joshua. \"How to Get Rid of Roundworms in the Yard.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/rid-roundworms-yard-52093.html. 09 December 2018."}

You could also upload your own work, but that wasn\u2019t the main focus of the site. Smashwords, on the other hand, is a web site devoted to self-publishing. It doesn\u2019t lend itself to collaboration, necessarily, but it does present another possible method of content delivery, and for web workers looking for another revenue stream, it may provide an avenue for monetizing your content.\nFor me, it also raises the age-old question: is self-publishing really just a form of vanity publishing, along with all the negative connotations that implies?\nIt\u2019s a thorny question, and one that takes on new significance as we slowly but surely move away from print media towards online publishing. I went to school for writing, and had it drilled into me pretty much every day that unless it was someone else\u2019s name on the masthead of the journal or press I was publishing with, I wasn\u2019t accomplishing anything.\nOnline, however, many of the most successful professionals are self-published, and self-made. Darren Rowse, Guy Kawasaki and Om Malik Richard MacManus come to mind. They are dealing primarily in the medium of the blog, however. The stigma associated with self-publishing doesn\u2019t seem to have entirely disappeared when it comes to books.\nSmashwords is a service for self-publishing your own eBook. Once you\u2019ve signed up for an account you can upload your original work and offer it for sale at a price of your own choosing. Your book will also be available for purchase via Stanza for the iPhone, the most popular and fastest-growing eReader available. Authors make a royalty of 85% of the net proceeds from the sale of their work. Readers using the service get free samples of all the books available on the site, and get access to search and library-building services.\nIt\u2019s a good system, but will it work? Even if you already have a built-in readership from a successful blogging career, will users be willing to take the extra step and pay for your content in eBook form? The answer probably depends on what kind of content you\u2019re offering. If you\u2019re just repackaging your blog as paid content, it probably won\u2019t pay off. But if you\u2019re offering valuable content that extends, rather than mirrors, your blog-based content, Smashwords may be a useful platform.\nTo me, the benefit of a service like Smashwords, and self-publishing in general, is the same benefit that consulting firms get from preparing free research reports for distribution to clients. It\u2019s a proof of competency, a means to show you can and will deliver the type of results they\u2019re looking for. And with distribution via Stanza, there\u2019s also the possibility that you could reach potential clients where you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, even if you do end up just reformatting your blog content for alternative distribution.\nWhat do you think about self-publishing? Is it a good means to increase your revenue or profile as a web worker?\nVanity publishers are similar to traditional publishers, but, without much of the structured roadblocks set before an author. However, like any other profit seeking entity it has to have some form of content access mechanisms in order to control what is being offered by the untold millions worldwide; in contrast to what the average reader can get access to via the traditional realm of book publishing.

Thirty-two-miles long and up to 3 miles wide, the lake and Lake George Village on its southern tip have long been tourist destinations. Many sites are open year-round or are in remote locations, making it easy for campers in Lake George to avoid the summer crowds.\nForty-four of Lake George\u2019s 170 islands have campsites, and larger islands have picnic shelters and day-use facilities. The sole amenity, other than grills and picnic tables, on smaller islands might be a pit toilet. The Long Island Group, at the southern end of the lake, has campsites large enough to accommodate six people. Some of them are on the lakefront. North of the Long Island Group near Bolton Landing is the Glen Island Group, with sites that allow between two and six campers. The quietest and most remote island camping location is the Narrow Island Group. Reservations are required for all island camping and are available through ReserveAmerica.\nRed Rock Bay, on the east side of Lake George, north of Bolton Landing and in view of Black Mountain, is designated for cruiser camping. There are docks, but there\u2019s no shore camping -- boaters must sleep on board. Each site has a fire ring, picnic table and pit toilet for camper\u2019s use. Paradise Bay, a secluded spot for swimming and diving, is a short walk through the woods from some of the sites. Stop at the Glen Island Ranger Station for a camping permit.\nLake George and the surrounding area is home to more than 20 RV parks, many of them resorts complete with swimming pools, planned activities and fully-equipped game rooms. Several are served by trolleys that take campers into Lake George Village, allowing guests to leave their cars at the resort and avoid the often gridlocked traffic in town. Many of the RV parks have sites for tent campers in a section away from the big rigs, where tent campers enjoy the same amenities at a lower cost. Most of the private campgrounds are centered on the lower end of the lake.\nLake George Battleground was named one of the Top 25 Educational and Historical Facilities by active.com in 2010. The campground, near a self-guided historic walking trail, has tent and RV sites with easy access to Lake George. Two miles north of the Village, Hearthstone Point has 251 tent and trailer sites, modern bathhouse facilities and a sandy beach. The state also operates campgrounds at Lake George Islands and Rogers Rock. Backcountry and equestrian camping are allowed at the Lake George Wild Forest.\nSummer is generally mild in Lake George, with temperatures in the 60s and 70s and occasional thunderstorms. Pitch your tent away from natural hazards like poison ivy and anthills, and make sure it\u2019s protected from winds and dead or diseased trees that might fall if a storm blows in. Winters are very cold and snowy. Lows sometimes reach well below zero, so make sure you have a four-season tent, preferably a dark color to retain heat, and appropriate clothing and sleeping bags. The Adirondack Mountains are home to the largest population of black bears in New York. Never leave food out, clean up spills immediately, keep your campsite clean and don\u2019t wear clothes to bed that you\u2019ve worn while cooking.

Many are from students Richards, in his role overseeing the equivalent of the American junior and senior grades of high school, has successfully prodded into college.\nThis is not as easy of a job as the pastoral campus in these comparatively affluent surroundings suggests, teeming as it is with earnest-looking youngsters in neat school uniforms. A comprehensive school (the American equivalent of public school), Calderstones takes students from inner-city Liverpool, whose neighborhoods a Church of England charity reports include five of the 10 poorest in the country. Thirty-seven percent come from families with low incomes.\nThose once included a teenaged John Lennon, who named the band that would eventually become the Beatles\u2014the Quarrymen\u2014after Quarry Bank High School, as the Calderstones School was called when he went here.\nLike him, some will never get much further in their educations. \u201cCertainly on the road to failure \u2026 hopeless,\u201d one of Lennon\u2019s teachers wrote in an end-of-term report, widely reported much later by the British tabloids. And while he was narrowly accepted into art school, he dropped out before he finished.\nHow Should Online Teacher Programs Be Judged?\nBut a growing number of low-income students do end up moving on successfully to higher education, thanks to not only Richards and his faculty but also to an impressive and expensive amount of work by local universities. That\u2019s something to which many colleges and universities in the United States devote far fewer resources, and at which they have been much less successful.\nWhat\u2019s even more noteworthy is that British universities have managed to increase the proportion of their students who are low-income during a period in which tuition was imposed and rapidly increased after previously being essentially free. And while the progress is uneven and vulnerable to still more changes ahead\u2014including a shift next year from grants to loans for students\u2019 living expenses\u2014how they have succeeded shows it can be done, and offers some examples of exactly how.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost counterintuitive. Since the higher level of fees have come in, we\u2019ve seen the highest proportion ever of low-income students in higher education,\u201d said Les Ebdon, a former university vice-chancellor, or president, who now holds the singularly British title of national director of fair access to higher education.\nUniversities here have been allowed by the government since 2004 to set varying levels of tuition\u2014at first, up to \u00a33,000 per year, or $4,236, a maximum that has since grown to \u00a39,000, or $12,708. Students repay the money later as a portion of their earnings once they reach an income of \u00a321,000, or just under $30,000.\nBut to get permission to impose the highest fees, they have to set and meet goals approved by Ebdon\u2019s office for enrolling more low-income, racial and ethnic minority, and first-generation students. This rule, which was put in place to mollify political opposition at the same time that the varying tuition was approved, costs the universities millions, but the expense is more than offset by the additional revenues that come from higher fees. \u201cThere\u2019s an economic imperative for them to do this,\u201d Ebdon said in the library-quiet headquarters of the Office for Fair Access in London\u2019s Chancery"}

One magical beer, called Drunken Monkey Barkleywine, forever changed Miller's relationship with beer. And that expansive relationship led to his nationally syndicated column and popular blog, \"The Beer Nut,\" hosted by the Daily News and GateHouse Media. Now Miller has recently published his first book, \"Beer Lover's New England.\"\nWhat this book offers in detail is every brewery, brew, brewpub and beer bar in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island. Each brewery is profiled in detail, from who the founders are, what they brew and Miller's top choice from each stop. The book hits on the big names like Boston Beer Company (yes, they make Samuel Adams) to the stellar but tiny The Alchemist in Vermont that makes only one beer, the phenomenal and super hoppy Heady Topper.\nFor added content, the book also dishes out food recipes from brewpubs. Want to to know the secret to the Portsmouth Brewery's hanger steak or a fanatstic beef stew made by Milly's Tavern in Manchester? It's in the book.\nWhat's also in the book is Miller's plainspoken sense of humor. A beer snob or foodie elite Miller is not. He's not above calling his hometown of Leominster a beer wasteland, and he freely admits that he named his beer fridge Beatrice. This is a book that delivers on knowledge gained from years of ... well, drinking. And drinking well judging from the reviews about the quality of craft beer in New England.\nYou went from not liking beer to developing a taste for craft beer to becoming an expert in the field. What motivated you along that path?\nI used to work at a newspaper in Laconia, N.H., and there was a small brewpub that was close to the office, and we used to go there all of the time. It turned out to be cheaper to buy the beer than it was to buy mixed drinks, so I decided to try some, and quickly found out that beer can have flavor. It wasn't like all of the stuff that I tried in college that tasted like slightly flavored water. From there, it was just buying any beer I could find and finding stuff I really liked.\nWith an already solid base of knowledge of the New England brewing scene, did anything you learned during the research for the book surprise you?\nThere are just so many breweries that are in the middle of nowhere that, unless you happen to be in that area, you've probably never heard of them. The one thing that all of these places had with the more well-known breweries was the passion they have in their voices when they speak about their beer. They legitimately love what they do, and many of them left much more lucrative jobs to do what they really love to do.\nInevitably you must come across some breweries or beers that you think are poor examples of quality beer, yet the book offers no harsh criticism. How do you manage that?\nThis really wasn't a book of reviews. It was more of letting people know what a brewery, brewpub or bar offers. Sure,"}

I'm sure you clicked into this post, already dubious about the contents. But before you cry \"clickbait,\" hear me out! Next week is almost certainly the finale of American Horror Story: Apocalypse. We have a preview for the episode that says it's the finale. Even very early on, that was the song everyone was singing. Check IMDb, check Wikipedia, check all the other outlets. It's 10 episodes! But based on where we are in the story, based on the fact that Ryan Murphy is loves drama and twists, based on the fact that the finale is called \"Apocalypse Then\" . . . what if there are more than 10 episodes?\nLet's break this down piece by piece. First of all, let's consider where we are in the season. After merely three episodes in the present timeline (you know, when the apocalypse is in full effect), we have since flashed back to a space in time that's three years before the apocalypse. That's where we've been for the last six (yes, six!) episodes. Sure, there's been plenty of important information in these six episodes. We've basically seen how Michael came to be, why he hates the witches so much, and how he brought about the apocalypse. But even by the end of the ninth episode, we still haven't caught up to the current storyline.\nEven in the preview for next week, it's clear we're going to dedicate a chunk of the finale to this past timeline. We have to see how Cordelia manages to erase the identities of Malloy, Coco, and Dinah. Then, we have to see how the witches survive the apocalypse. Then, and only then, will we be caught up to the place we were at in episode three.\nEven when we get to that point, there's still so much we have to tie up! We have to see a final showdown between Michael and the witches. A showdown that presumably includes Fiona, Delphine, and Marie. We have to get answers about Timothy and Emily! What's their role in all this? What are Mallory's true powers? Is she really the Supreme? What is this supposed Sanctuary Michael has been talking about? With all that, we then have to arrive at some kind of conclusion. And you're telling me we can get all that done in, like, 43 minutes? Seems like a pretty tall order, even for AHS.\nThere are other things pointing to a potential fake-out. There's the fact that Murphy has before teased double installments of the show, one in Fall and one in Spring. There's the fact that he's working on a secret season that he place to \"shoot on the sly\" and drop without notice. These quotes aren't necessarily related to the surprise bank of episodes I'm hoping for, but rather they're a signifier that Ryan Murphy always has more tricks up his sleeve. I fully believe he's capable of shooting three additional episodes right under our noses. It would be such a fun twist.\nPlus, like I said, the supposed \"finale\" is called \"Apocalypse Then.\" If that doesn't sound unfinished, like a big 'ol loose end, then I don't know what does. OK, I've said my piece! In all likelihood, I'm wrong and we'll get a very slapped-together ending to"}

Back then they were only a seventh of the size of the US and their economic policies would have barely registered.\nSince the 1980s China has seen an impressive transition from an emerging to an almost fully emerged economy. In just one generation\u2019s time the Chinese economy will grow to $123 trillion \u2013 three times more than the entire world output of the year 2000. Robert Fogel predicts that by 2040 the Chinese economy will dwarf that of the US by growing to 3 times its size.\nOn paper, China looks set to become the most powerful economic nation on earth. Since 1970 the income per capita has increased from under $500 to $7000. China has the largest growing middle-class society in the world, it is set to overtake the US in the near future. Levels of disposable income and spending are increasing as Chinese citizens strive to improve their standards of living.\nThis is reflected in data which shows the PRC is now number one in the world for energy consumption, it now rivals the US in its demand for oil. This demand will only increase as the country strives to secure its oil supply by investing heavily in the new trans-Asia oil pipeline.\nTheir increased demand for energy is being spent of various projects, particularly in R&D. In 2011 they filed the highest number of patents across the globe, beating both Japan and USA. Analysts say this is part of a quest for products to be known as \u2018Designed in China\u2019 rather than \u2018Made in China\u2019. Published patent applications have risen by 16.7% since 2006, by 2015 China is expected to have filed nearly 500,000 submissions.\nTheir technical ability is already in high demand as last year China\u2019s number one export to the USA became computer equipment. Whilst the US\u2019s number one export to China was rubbish. This becomes more painful for the US when they, a deficit riddled country, realise that in 2010 for every $1 spent in China on American goods, the Americans spend $3.90 on Chinese goods in the USA.\nBarack Obama stated a few years back that he would not accept second place for America, but these figures suggest he might just have to, whilst the rest of us lag further behind.\nBut, is this huge growth and progress sustainable? Are these figures even real?\nDespite the impressive figures quoted above, it is well documented that the Chinese economy is starting to experience a slowdown. But can it recover before it hits rock bottom? As Bill Bonner stated earlier this week, many views on the economic future of the country range from apocalyptic to the \u2018unfailingly sunny\u2019. Though Ben Simpendorfer, as Mr Bonner points out, offers an insightful and balanced view on how the future of the Chinese economy will pan out.\nFor Mr Simpendorfer the country will have some struggles but he expects \u2018\u2026no hard landing in 2012.\u2019 He believes that the Chinese government has, \u201cthe ability to continue borrowing, or further relax fiscal and monetary policy\u201d. The government are embarking on an artificial stimulus which will see state-owned banks and SOEs build a 7 million housing units, per annum, over the next five years.

{"idx": "5426", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Every three years since 1989, the Federal Reserve Board has prepared a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which carefully measures the net worth of all households in the nation\u2013that is, the total assets owned by all Americans. The survey, the most complete and thorough analysis of individual wealth, summarizes the financial resources of different groups of the population, such as bank accounts, stocks, bonds, business assets and real estate. The most recent report, issued early in April 2006, details the massive inequality of wealth in the United States between a small number of households at the top of the income scale and those in the bottom half. This report and other similar studies emphasize that this wealth inequality is growing and is becoming a permanent part of our society.\nThe total net worth of all Americans in 1989 was $25 trillion (in 2004 dollars). Of that amount, the top 1 percent owned 30 percent, or $7.775 trillion. The bottom half owned 3 percent of the total, or $763 billion.\nFifteen years later, in 2004, the total wealth of all Americans had doubled to $50.25 trillion. The top 1 percent of the population now owns 33.4 percent of the total, or $16.774 trillion. Their percentage share of the total has increased by more than 3 percent in fifteen years. At the same time, the total wealth owned by the bottom 50 percent increased to $1.278 trillion, but its percentage of total wealth declined from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in the same time period.\nThus the wealth of the top 1 percent was ten times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent in 1989. Fifteen years later, the wealth of the top 1 percent was thirteen times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent.\nExamining the type of wealth owned by each group, the SCF reports that the top 5 percent of the population owns 85 percent of closely held business assets in the country, 79 percent of the publicly traded stocks and 70 percent of mutual funds.\nAt the bottom of the scale, the story is far different. While many reports have claimed that about 50 percent of households own some stocks or shares in mutual funds (either directly or through IRAs or company pension plans), the actual amount held is quite small. According to the SCF, the bottom 50 percent own less than 1 percent of business assets, stocks and mutual funds\u2013so much for President Bush\u2019s claim that we need to reduce taxes on dividends and capital gains because we are an \u201cownership society\u201d with so many Americans owning shares. The principal asset of the bottom 50 percent is the value of their homes, usually heavily mortgaged.\nThe reason for this change is not difficult to discern. Beginning with the reduction of income tax rates in the Reagan Administration (from a high of 70 percent for the richest taxpayers in 1980 to 35 percent now), Congress has steadily reduced tax rates. It has reduced and is seeking to eliminate the estate tax altogether. In 2003 Congress lowered the tax on dividends to 15 percent, rather than treat it as ordinary income subject to the highest tax rate of 35 percent. It also reduced taxes on capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. Necessarily, these changes greatly benefited the households at the top of the wealth ladder.\nWhere can this largesse for the wealthy come from? If the government has a program of tax reductions"}

You've checked off the more-than-basics. But you still can't fight a nagging feeling that it's not quite enough. At a certain point, if a nation-state wants to compromise your devices or your privacy badly enough, it's going to find a way. You can at least make it harder for them. Here are a few measures designed to do just that.\nThe best way not to get your computer hacked? Don't connect it to any other computer, a practice known as air-gapping. In a world where practically every machine connects to the internet, that\u2019s not easy. But for ultra-sensitive files and tasks\u2014storing a Bitcoin cache or working with leaked files from a whistleblower\u2014the inconvenience of working entirely offline can be worth it.\nWhile any laptop lets you turn off basic radio connections like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the safest way to air-gap your machine is to physically remove all wireless hardware, says David Huerta, a digital security fellow at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Better still, use a computer that doesn't come with any; Huerta points to the Intel Nuc, Gigabyte Brix, and older Mac Mini desktops as a few examples of those radio-optional computers.\nPractically the only way someone can compromise an air-gapped computer is if they have physical access\u2014they have to be able to walk up and physically plug in a USB drive, or other type of storage media.\nAn air-gapped machine generally functions as a viewing station, a way to work with sensitive files while ensuring they\u2019re not subject to being hacked, or themselves infecting your network. Huerta recommends taking the further step of removing the computer\u2019s hard drive too. Instead, you can boot it from a USB installed with the ephemeral operating system Tails, which ensures that no trace is left on the computer after use. That means you can\u2019t store any files on your air-gapped machine. But it also makes that \u201cclean\u201d machine virtually impossible for any hacker to meaningfully attack.\nIf you truly don\u2019t want to be tracked, turning off your phone helps some. But security experts have warned for years that sophisticated malware can track or use a phone for audio surveillance even when you think it's powered down, likely by spoofing its \u201coff\u201d state while continuing to leave key functions running.\nPulling out a phone\u2019s battery can thwart that eavesdropping. But for the iPhone and other mobile devices without easily removable batteries, the supremely cautious rely on Faraday cages or bags. These are essentially metal shields that block all radio frequencies. Slip your phone into one of the metal-lined wallets, and it goes dark for anyone attempting to communicate with its radios. No info can go in or, more importantly, out. They're also not hard to come by; you can find them on Amazon for relatively cheap.\nIn a pinch, any sufficiently shielded metal box, like a safe or even a microwave, will do. NSA leaker Edward Snowden asked visitors to his Hong Kong hotel room to put their cell phones in a minifridge. Just know that while the cage or bag might block your phone from revealing its location, it doesn\u2019t necessarily stop it from collecting audio if it\u2019s already been hacked\u2014and its spying powers switched on\u2014before it got black-bagged."}

In my work, I have seen firsthand the loneliness, fear, and eventual loss of autonomy that the elderly face in their final years. Caring for the elderly can be a tough, thankless job, and caregiver burnout and stress can lead to abuse and elderly abandonment. In a competitive society when it comes down to juggle between caring for their children, their livelihood, or their aged parents, I have seen how some choose to take the easy way out.\nThe 18-year-old me probably would have argued that boosting the healthcare capabilities of our country would help ease the increased medical demand from our ageing population, but I now know that the problems run far deeper than medicine can cure.\n5. 'Human need, rather than profit, should always be the main concern of scientific research.' Discuss.\nAt the age of 18, I would have almost certainly taken the stand that human needs, but not profit, should be the main concern of scientific research. In my university days, I have defended the idea that science is noble and should never be economically driven.\nMy thinking has since evolved. Upon graduation, my friends and I founded a biotech startup. All of us were from academic backgrounds and had no experience in business. We developed a unique technology and turned it into research products that generated a healthy stream of revenue. After covering our operating expenses, the profit enabled us to further our scientific research to develop novel clinical products.\nIn a competitive biotech industry, one can only survive and generate sustainable profit by tackling critical, un"}

Reginald Bourgeois and his wife, Stephanie, can be doubly proud because for the second year in a row, one of their children has claimed the highest honor at Hohenfels Middle/High School. This year's valedictorian was Caroline Bourgeois, while the honor went to her brother Rene in 2012.\n\"We're extremely proud \u2026 but not surprised,\" said Lt. Col. Bourgeois. \"They can do anything they put their minds to.\"\nThey put their minds to a lot. Coming from the extremely competitive German Gymnasium system, a tough university prep program, Rene entered HMHS as a freshman with Caroline starting in the eighth grade. Both were active in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC), Advanced Placement and distance learning courses, as well as various sports.\n\"(They are) not only scholars, but also fitness and outdoor buffs,\" said retired Maj. Dan Parker, JROTC senior Army instructor at HMHS. \"(They) have been championship baseball and tennis players. Additionally, both were members of the air rifle team, which placed sixth nationally, traveling to the States in 2011 to compete.\"\nBoth served as Raider commander, organizing sporting events such as kayaking, skiing, archery and other outdoor activities associated with the program. Caroline said JROTC had a major influence on her development throughout high school.\n\"When I first got here, I was really shy and would not talk at all, and JROTC really helped because they made you stand up in front of people and lead,\" she said.\n\"She has done unusually well \u2026 coming from a totally foreign background and stepping into our school and saying, 'OK, this is how we do it,'\" said Parker. \"Both have been exemplary leaders, showing great concern and patience with their peers who are not so academically talented.\"\nLt. Col. Bourgeois said it was easy to see early on that all three of their children had the capability to succeed in any endeavor.\n\"The issue would be desire and discipline,\" he said. \"What we discovered is that discipline begins way before high school.\"\nLt. Col. Bourgeois said that desire results from having goals and objectives beginning in elementary school. As early as sixth grade, they were quizzing their children on what they may like to do in the future.\n\"Not specific like 'I want to be a doctor,' but 'where are you having fun?' Success is fun, so roll with your successes,\" he said.\nAll the children wanted to be in a profession, so Lt. Col. Bourgeois said he didn't sugar coat the issue.\n\"They'll have to be in the top of their class. They knew that,\" he said. \"As time went on they began to enjoy the competition and the rewards; positive reinforcement.\"\nCaroline appreciated the challenge.

The movie series may be best known for its space battles (or 'star wars' if you will) as opposed to planetside conflicts, but The Empire Strikes Back defied expectations with its first Rebel/Empire face-off. Not to mention set the standard for Rebel bases existing on some of the harshest, most dangerous, and least habitable worlds in the Star Wars galaxy. And in a new comic series from IDW, it's the franchise's fighting women who are getting the spotlight.\nWith Star Wars: The Last Jedi resembling Hoth in more than one way, it seems the perfect time to revisit the snowy planet in the new, Disney-approved canon. That's one of the stories set to be told in the series, beginning with Star Wars: Forces of Destiny - Leia #1. And now that the first pages of the book have been revealed ahead of its January release, the Star Wars canon needs a change. Because Rebels heroine Hera Syndulla is also on Hoth before The Empire Strikes Back begins.\nIt's not the first time that Hera in particular has been woven into new parts of Star Wars (especially those that take place close to, or alongside Rebels). She's included in a Rogue One cameo as \"General Syndulla,\" confirming her promotion from where Rebels finds her. And in the animated series that preceded the Forces of Destiny comic, it was also confirmed that Hera was at the Battle of Endor. Now, she was also riding Tauntauns across Hoth with Han and Leia before the Empire even discovered the Rebels' new hideout.\nThe preview only gives away this small cameo appearance, with Hera Syndulla's full role in the issue hard to predict. Of course, for Star Wars fans looking to see where and how the new canon is being expanded and interconnected, every new link is to be celebrated (and mentally logged for future reference). Now that Hera Syndulla has shown up as a key member of the Rebellion at both Hoth and Endor (the major battles of Episode V and Episode VI), fans will certainly ask... did Hera play a role in the Battle of Yavin, too? The Death Star is coming to Star Wars: Rebels at some point, so anything is possible.\nThose drawn to the idea of seeing more Star Wars heroines get time in the spotlight are in for even more of a treat than a Leia-Hera team-up.

{"idx": "5448", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: \u200bEurozone growth is now outrunning the U.S.\nLONDON - It has been a long and tortuous journey, but the eurozone economy is finally back to the size it was before the global financial crisis.\nOfficial figures released Friday show that the eurozone, the world's second-largest economy with 340 million people, accelerated unexpectedly at the start of the year to bring it back to the level it was before the recessions of the past eight years.\nEurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, said the 19-country currency bloc expanded by a quarterly rate of 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year. The increase was double the previous quarter's rate and ahead of market expectations for a more modest 0.4 percent.\nThe increase means that the eurozone economy is now 0.4 percent bigger than it was in the first quarter of 2008, before the deep recession stoked by the global financial crisis. Since then, the eurozone has had a torrid time, falling in and out of recession as the global financial crisis morphed into a regional debt crisis that at various times threatened the future of the euro currency itself.\nThough the size of the eurozone economy is back to where it was in 2008, it's still got a way to go to heal fully. That's most evident in the unemployment rate, which at 10.2 percent is still 3 percentage points higher than it was in 2008. It's far higher in the countries that have suffered most financially, such as Greece and Spain.\nWhile the eurozone was dealing with the debt problems of a number of its member states, other economies, such as the U.S. and Britain were recouping the ground lost in the wake of the global financial crisis, which triggered the deepest global recession since World War II. The U.S., for example, reached prerecession levels in 2011 and has since managed to eke out consistent growth and seen unemployment fall sharply.\nThe eurozone's last recession ended nearly three years ago, but growth has been slow. The acceleration in the first quarter may be the clearest indicator yet that the region is finally moving into a higher gear -- particularly because it came during a period when financial markets were volatile due to worries over a Chinese economic slowdown and a sharp fall in the price of oil.\nOn an annualized basis, the eurozone growth in the first quarter was 2.5 percent, way more than the U.S. rate of 0.5 percent.\nThough Eurostat offered no details beyond the headline numbers, it seems that the eurozone has benefited from a number of factors, particularly the fall in oil prices, which helps an economy that's a net importer of crude. The slide in the euro's value has helped the region's exporters, particularly in Germany. In addition, the European Central Bank's monetary stimulus measures and less stringent budgetary policies by governments appear to be helping.\nWhether the economy will keep expanding at this rate will depend on a number of factors, many of which are external to the eurozone, such as the British vote on June 23 on whether to leave the European Union and slowing demand from China. Within the eurozone, worries over Greece's future in the single currency bloc could flare up again, and the upcoming Spanish general election may cause jitters.\n\"False dawns have been common since the financial crisis and nowhere more so than in Europe,\" cautioned Alas"}
{"idx": "5449", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: OVER the last few months we have heard countless stories about young men from Step Street stealing, shooting, getting shot and being killed.\nWhat is the problem? Are we really addressing the problem? This piece does not answer any questions, but asks, \u2018Why are we letting this happen?\u2019 It simply throws up more questions.\nStep Street is only the latest example of a space that we have created as if it were outside of us, an outlier in the Bahamas, so far removed from our own realities that we cannot identify with it. Yet we are all a part of the cause of this. Do we ever stop to ask who is responsible for the mess?\nWhen we think of gang violence, we tend to think of the way we see things play out in the movies. We tend to picture large organisations of white or Latino guys running a part of town from a Godfather like operation. We think that young black kids cannot organise in this way. We dismiss our own.\nToday\u2019s gangs are different, though, especially in the Bahamas. They are as organised as the Mafia from the Godfather films, they are as violent, or perhaps even more so, and they are larger and more dispersed.\nOne reason gangs develop is to protect turf; they work in favour of an area or neighbourhood where they have been squashed into the corners of a world.\nThey have been refused entry into the mainstream. They have become the underclass and strive to protect themselves, and to be seen and heard in a society that refuses to acknowledge their presence.\nThey can also be used for political gain, as they have been in Jamaica. It must be underscored too, though, that gangs exist to protect a group and to prevent that group from being further exploited.\nIn Jamaica, gangs were built around areas, but also around political affiliations. The PNP had their gangs and the JLP had theirs. The system used the gangs to protect itself.\nThe politicians used the gangs to empower themselves while apparently empowering the young guys in the gangs, but actually ultimately disempowering them. They created criminals who would die for their representative.\nThis product was exported to the United States, for example, and grew stronger. It was then later reimported to Jamaica and worsened. The Bahamas has followed this model well.\nAs the country sat back and pointed its finger at Jamaica laughingly, the internal situation was worsening, only we chose to ignore it.\nNow we have a growing group of angry, black youth that fear nothing and have even less to lose.\nHistorically, the Bahamas has looked askance at Jamaica because of the level of violence there, the supposed poverty and crime, the lack of ability to move up the social ladder.\nNow Jamaica has given over its position as the most violent country in the Caribbean to the Bahamas. Our murders surpass theirs, our gang violence surpasses theirs and our sexual assaults are leading the region. Where are we heading? Well, gang violence seems to be increasing rather than decreasing.\nA few months ago, the Minister for National Security claimed that murder was down. Is murder still down? Are young men not dying at an alarming rate? Why are they so angry? Are we working on addressing their anger? Are we taking their frustrations seriously? Or are we simply dismissing them as a bunch of angry, young, black men who happen to be from the lower socio-economic group and so easier to dismiss and/or marginalise? We can socially exclude what we choose not to see if it is an inconvenient truth.\nGang violence and sexual violence as well as gender"}

They were not taken to the hospital, the official said. There were 75 people in the building at the time of the explosion.\nPolice said they \u201chope\u201d this is an isolated incident and do not yet know if it is connected to the Austin bombings.\nA law enforcement source tells ABC News that it is going to take a considerable amount of time before any post-blast investigation can occur. The site is complicated and potentially dangerous to render safe, with other FedEx packages of unknown contents all over. Authorities will have to move slowly and methodically to process the complex scene.\n\u201c[T]he package was moving from an elevated conveyor belt to a lower section when it exploded,\u201d the television station reports.\nThe package \u201ccontained shrapnel consisting of nails and pieces of metal, sources said,\u201d according to the CBS affiliate, which said the Schertz facility has 75 employees.\nThe latest blast, which injured two men walking through a residential area Sunday night, marked an escalation in both the tactics and skills displayed by the bomber or bombers, police said. While the three previous devices were hidden in packages delivered to homes in residential neighborhoods, the fourth device \u2014 anchored to a for-sale sign \u2014 was left on the side of the road and was rigged with a tripwire, showing \u201ca higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill,\u201d said Brian Manley, the interim Austin police chief.\nManley said the fourth device had \u201csimilarities\u201d to the three bombs that detonated in the Texas capital in the past three weeks, killing two people and injuring two others, one seriously. The explosion Sunday night plunged the city further into a frightening uncertainty that has left residents on edge. Authorities have seemed vexed, completely at a loss to explain who could be setting off the devices \u2014 or why \u2014 and asking the unknown attacker to communicate with them. They also have offered rewards of up to $115,000 for information in the case.\nThe first three explosives all hit eastern Austin, affecting areas where black and Hispanic residents live, prompting some to question whether the initial blast on March 2 would have prompted more urgency had it gone off in a more affluent, predominantly white neighborhood \u2014 like where the attack Sunday night happened, injuring two white men.\nIf the FedEx explosion came from a device built by the same bomber, it seems that targeting demographics isn\u2019t the point. It\u2019s still possible that the FedEx bomb came from someone else, but that would mean that two different domestic terrorists are operating in the Austin-San Antonio region at the same time using similar attack methods. That seems a little too coincidental to believe, but it\u2019s not entirely out of the question, either.\nThe big question everyone wonders is why. What is the motive, and what does the bomber want? Law enforcement took the extraordinary step of asking the bomber to contact them in order to set up a \u201cdialogue.\u201d At some point, the perp or perps will want their motive known, in manifestos or declarations of some kind. Meanwhile, the residents of Austin now not only have to worry about unexpected packages without legit shipping labels but even those that do have them, plus have to worry about walking down their own sidewalks.

Five other defendants cited by the judge also failed to show for the trial&acute;s opening, for reasons not known by Monday evening.\nThe decision by the judge to suspend the proceedings on account of Montealegre&acute;s absence has only fueled speculation that the trial has more to do with targeting him personally than anything else.\nThe Sandinistas alone don&acute;t have the number of votes needed to strip Montealegre of his immunity, and would need the support of ex-President Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n&acute;s Liberal Constitutional Party to proceed.

The Cenis, which were allegedly renegotiated at a higher interest rate to favor the three private banking institutions that purchased them, have cost the government some $600 million. Payments on the bonds are still being made, although the government calls the bonds illegal.\nThe state has never investigated who was responsible for the collapse of the banks, and instead has focused on going after those responsible for the Cenis bailout bonds.\nEven President Daniel Ortega has publicly accused Montealegre of being a &ldquo;delinquent&rdquo; responsible for stealing $600 million &ndash; raising serious concerns about how he could expect to get a fair trial in a country where the president who appointed the judge has already announced his verdict (NT, June 19)."}

Almost certainly they do.

{"idx": "5455", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Across the industrialized world and across employers, there are huge variations in what Stanford economics professor Nick Bloom calls being-nice-to-people practices. These are policies that try to address the fact that men and women in today's workforce are often struggling to balance their work and family responsibilities.\nThe French have reduced the legal work week to 35 hours. The Australians have added paid parental leave of 18 weeks for the primary caregiver of newborns. The United States requires larger employers to offer unpaid leave to employees with seriously ill family members. Some companies allow some workers to decide when and where to work, but flexibility is not generally the case, according to a 2010 report on work-life balance by the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisors. What many employers would like to know, says Bloom, is whether more flexibility in working arrangements would hurt or help the company's profitability and competitiveness. In a new study with three colleagues, he found solid evidence at one company that allowing workers to work from home produced a large productivity boost as well as happier workers.\nThe study was conducted over 10 months at CTrip.com, a billion-dollar NASDAQ-listed company based in Shanghai. Bloom and coauthors \u2014 business school economics professor John Roberts; economics department graduate student Zhichun Jenny Ying; and business school doctoral alumnus James Liang, a cofounder of the company \u2014 compared the productivity of call-center workers who worked from home four days a week with workers performing the same work from rows of office cubicles.\nCTrip's home workers were more productive. An analysis showed they answered more calls and worked more hours because they took shorter breaks and used less sick leave. The home workers also reported being happier than the office workers, and fewer of them quit. Retention of quality workers is important to keeping company recruitment and training costs down, so Bloom calls it a \"no brainer\" for CTrip to offer a working-from-home alternative to other workers. In this case, the average home worker saved the company about $2,000, nearly as much as his or her annual salary.\nBloom cautions managers and policy makers who would substitute flexibility with requiring workers to work from home. The home workers in the study were randomly selected from a larger group that wanted to work from home. While the mean productivity and happiness of those who worked from home was greater than for their office-based counterparts, the home workers' productivity varied substantially, with a few not doing as well from home. And when the experiment was over, almost half of the workers who had worked from home chose to go back to the office despite the added cost of commuting. In interviews with researcher Ying, these mostly young workers on the low end of the wage scale indicated they were lonely. At least in this case, Bloom says, flexibility for workers to work where they prefer to work is critical to retention.\nThere are many potential implications from this experiment, say Bloom and Roberts. By positioning the company to roll out remote working to far-flung regional offices, the experiment shows how the advent of mobile computing might lead to more regional income equality and less pollution and traffic in crowded cities, as well as better family and community life.\n\"If people can work where they live, they are going to live in different places,\" Roberts says. \"The CTrip employees, many of whom come from rural China and have come to Shanghai to find work, would much rather be at home in the villages and working from there. We interviewed them and they want to do that.\" Flexible work, then, may not just be a gain for particular employees or companies, but potentially for society."}

For the Dolphins, like the 31 other teams, it\u2019s also about filling out their roster \u2014 with one eye on their own pending free agents and another on the veteran players who might become available in the next few weeks.\nThe Dolphins have more than a dozen unrestricted free agents, including significant contributors in Jared Odrick, Charles Clay, Louis Delmas and Jimmy Wilson. They presumably want to keep many of these players. But they have yet to make significant headway on any of them.\nThat probably will change this week. The belief in league circles is the Dolphins will dive headfirst into the process in Indianapolis. A potential agenda item would be beginning the arduous process of working out a long-term extension with Ryan Tannehill. The team wants to lock him up for the foreseeable future, but there is no rush; they own his rights through the 2016 season.\nTannehill has improved statistically each year of his career. But if more Dolphins players developed like he has, they wouldn\u2019t have to hit free agency as hard as they are expected to again this spring.\nFrankly, not enough of their own draft picks are contributing \u2014 either through lack of ability or lack of opportunity.\nSince Joe Philbin became coach in 2012, the Dolphins have drafted 26 players. Ten of them started at least one game for the Dolphins last year, but just seven started more than three.\nCompare that with the Super Bowl champion Patriots, who started 14 of their own draft picks, as well as Ryan Wendell, whom they signed as a rookie free agent, in Super Bowl 49.\nA prevailing thought in league circles is that the Dolphins\u2019 win-now attitude has stunted the growth of their players. Instead of relying on their young players to blossom, they have thrown big money at free agents \u2014 with mixed success. For every Branden Albert, there\u2019s a Dannell Ellerbe and a Philip Wheeler.\nAn example: The team signed four established offensive linemen in free agency last year and still allowed 46 sacks, the 10th-most in football.\nThere are success stories. Lamar Miller and Olivier Vernon, teammates at the University of Miami and now with the Dolphins, have emerged as dependable starters. Jarvis Landry looks to be on his way to becoming a star.\nThe Dolphins\u2019 problem is that they need more of those hits and fewer misses.\nCritics point to the team\u2019s inability to adapt to its talent, both homegrown and imported. Mike Wallace was so unhappy last season in large part because the Dolphins didn\u2019t play to his strengths.\nAnd with a few notable exceptions \u2014 Tannehill and Ja\u2019Wuan James being the most obvious \u2014 Philbin has not trusted his young draft picks, or known exactly how to use them.\nDion Jordan, the third pick in the 2013 draft, has started one game in his career \u2014 and it was in a role different from the one the team envisioned when it took him.\nCorners Will Davis and Jamar Taylor, taken in the first three rounds in \u201913, have played well in the few chances they have had, but defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle doesn\u2019t appear convinced that they are the answer at the position moving forward. Most expect the team to sign a veteran to at least compete"}

In the past, BlackBerry argued that government agencies wouldn't forsake its \"best in breed\" end-to-end security for the convenience of using more popular iOS or Android devices.\nUnfortunately for BlackBerry, Apple and Android device maker Samsung got better at securing their devices, and relaxed BYOD (bring your own device) policies enabled agencies to let more government employees use their own personal devices at work.\nBack in 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense approved iOS and Samsung KNOX devices for unclassified communications alongside BlackBerry devices. In early July, the U.S. Senate went a step further and announced that it would stop issuing BlackBerry devices to its entire staff and replace them with Apple and Samsung devices. Does this government-level abandonment of BlackBerry devices indicate that the end is nigh for the company's struggling hardware business?\nAn accidental glimpse into the future?\nThe Senate memo claimed that BlackBerry told Verizon and AT&T that it was ceasing the production of all BB 0 devices (the Q10, Z10, Z30, Passport and Classic), so future orders could no longer be guaranteed. That was a stunning revelation, since BlackBerry had only recently discontinued the Classic.\nBlackBerry responded by calling the Senate statement \"incorrect,\" and that it will keep updating BB10 as it supports new Android devices. BlackBerry claims that the Senate staff misunderstood the discontinuation of the Classic as the end of all BB10 devices. Nonetheless, the Senate apparently hasn't changed its mind about replacing BlackBerries with iPhones and Samsung devices.\nIf the discontinuation of the Classic is a preview of BlackBerry's future, it isn't a surprising one. The company has been pivoting toward Android devices over the past year, and recently announced the development of three new Android devices. The company's first Android device, the Priv, received a lukewarm response due to its high price tag.\nBlackBerry only sold half a million phones last quarter and controlled about 0.2% of the global smartphone market. Back in 2009, it controlled nearly 20% of that market.\nBlackBerry's rapid decline over the subsequent years can be attributed to its early refusal to switch physical keyboards for touchscreens, its inability to create a popular app ecosystem like Apple and Google, and mismanagement by co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie and their successor Thorsten Heins.\nCEO John Chen, who took over in 2013, finally convinced BlackBerry to swallow its pride and partner with Samsung in 2014 to integrate KNOX with BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Service), the core pillar of its software business. This move complemented Chen's mission of transforming BlackBerry into a company focused on cross-platform software growth instead of hardware sales. BES plays a central role in this strategy, because it's a \"control panel\" for businesses to monitor iOS, Android, Windows"}

That includes an 8-point drop in the number of evangelical white Protestants, an important political group.\nReflecting the change among Protestants, the share of Christians overall has declined from 83 percent of the adult population in 2003 to 72 percent on average last year. In the same time, the number of Americans who say they have no religion has nearly doubled, to 21 percent.\nCatholic self-identification (22 percent) has held steady during this time. The share of adults who identify with another form of Christianity \u2013 including Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons and Greek or Russian Orthodox, for example \u2013 has risen modestly, from 11 to 14 percent.\nThis analysis, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is based on a very large dataset \u2013 174,485 random-sample telephone interviews in ABC News and ABC News/Washington Post polls conducted from 2003 to 2017. We focus mainly on 2003 and 2017 data, including 7,185 and 5,017 interviews, respectively.\nAmong all Protestants, 56 percent currently say they\u2019re evangelical or born-again; that has held essentially steady since 2003, with virtually equal declines in the number who say they\u2019re either evangelical or non-evangelical Protestants, down 7 and 6 points, respectively.\nEvangelical white Protestants are of particular interest in political terms, since they\u2019re a core group within the Republican coalition; 80 percent supported Donald Trump in 2016. Evangelical white Protestants\u2019 share of the total adult population has gone from 21 percent in 2003 to 13 percent last year. Non-evangelical white Protestants have gone from 17 to 11 percent.\nPart of the decline in evangelical white Protestants reflects the fact that the change in Protestant self-identification overall has occurred disproportionately among whites. Thirty-nine percent of whites now identify themselves as members of a Protestant denomination, down 13 points since 2003. That compares with an 8-point decline among Hispanics (from 22 to 14 percent) and just 3 points among blacks (from 64 to 61 percent). An additional factor is the shrinking white non-Hispanic population, from 69 percent of all Americans in 2000 to an estimated 61 percent in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nWith the exception of race, the decline in Protestant affiliation has been broadly distributed among demographic groups.\nMost Protestants don\u2019t identify themselves as Protestant but as a member of a particular Protestant denomination \u2013 Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Pentecostalist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian and others.

{"idx": "5478", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe offering comes with its own unique tone and style, but comedy has always stood out as a critical element of each movie. These movies almost always come packed to the brim with gags, but few have ever reached the heights of humor in Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and The Wasp. Not only is it a hilarious movie in its own right, but it also offers up a perfect antidote for the overwhelming sadness of Avengers: Infinity War.\nOn that note, and with the movie now in theaters, we have put together a list of the funniest moments from Ant-Man and The Wasp. With so many awesome scenes to get to, let's get started with where we find Scott Lang at the beginning of the movie.\nWarning: spoilers ahead for Ant-Man and The Wasp! Read ahead at your own risk!\nPaul Rudd is the kind of movie star who oozes charisma, and Ant-Man and The Wasp capitalizes on that by just letting him cut loose in one of Scott Lang's first scenes. The guy has been on house arrest for the last two years, and it's clear that he has gotten pretty bored, so he's taken up more than a few strange habits. It makes for a fantastic montage, as we see Scott do everything in his power to try and pass the time -- ranging from playing the drums to crying while reading The Fault in Our Stars. It's honestly a perfect way to set up the movie, as well as to remind us that Scott Lang is not a macho tough guy like Thor or even Captain America; he's a sensitive dad who's not afraid to have some fun.\nGlobal politics are hard to dumb down for a child to understand, and Agent Woo does an abysmal job of explaining Scott Lang's crimes during the events of Captain America: Civil War to Cassie, Scott's daughter. Initially starting off on the right foot with a metaphor about how it's bad to draw on the walls, the explanation falls apart when he starts talking about Scott going to Germany and drawing on the walls with Captain America, eventually devolving into complicated exposition regarding the legal ramifications of Scott's actions. Cassie Lang is very clearly a smart girl in the Ant-Man movies, but Woo did not read his audience well at all when he opened his mouth.\nAnt-Man and The Wasp doesn't skimp when it comes to awesome, well-utilized science-fiction tropes, and one of the best examples is when Janet van Dyne possesses Scott Lang to provide Hank and Hope with the information that they need in order to get her out of the Quantum Realm. The scene is heavy on exposition, but it also gets some of the biggest laughs, especially once the audience remembers that Scott Lang is actually completely unaware of what is happening to him (which shines through perfectly when he comes to and notices that he's holding Hank's hand). The kicker? Paul Rudd actually does an amazing impersonation of Michelle Pfeiffer, and we wonder how much he practiced that.\nAnt-Man and The Wasp is packed with some great running gags, one of which comes in the form of the ever-present debate over whether or not truth serum actually exists.

{"idx": "5480", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I remember my first taste of vinegar, and at the age of 8, it was anything but a pleasing sensation. In fact, most of the distilled white vinegar ended up on the carpet along with whatever other contents had been in my stomach. My mom had heard from her friend that drinking vinegar \u201cshots\u201d would help clear out her intestinal track, and she figured I was as good a candidate as any to try it out. It worked a little too well. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I realized my mom had missed an important piece of information \u2014 this body-cleansing, pH-balancing remedy works best using apple cider vinegar. Save the distilled white for cleaning chores.\n1. Disinfectant: A natural antibacterial, vinegar makes a great base for any nontoxic cleaning solution. For an all-purpose disinfecting solution, dilute 1 part vinegar in 4 parts water and use anywhere germs are found, such as countertops, keyboards, shared phones, doorknobs and remote controls. Vinegar teams up with a little baking soda to re-incarnate into enough forms to clean your entire house.\n2. Toilet Bowl Cleaner: Clean, disinfect and deodorize your toilet by pouring 1 cup of vinegar around the inside of the bowl. Let sit for an hour, use a brush to remove rings, then flush.\n3. Drain Cleaner: To keep drains clog-free, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain, then follow with 1/2 cup of vinegar. Wait for foaming to subside, then follow with a gallon of boiling water. If necessary, remove hair and other debris with a wire. Repeat if drain is still slow. Got a persistent clog? Here are some more simple, chemical-free methods to clear out your drains.\n4. Residue Remover: Forget the gummy, toxic Goo-Gone. Clean the glue residue that labels and stickers leave behind by wiping the sticky surface with a rag dipped in a vinegar-water solution.\n5. Hair Rinse: Don\u2019t worry: Your hair will not take on the pungent smell of vinegar. Shampoos and other hair products can leave behind residue, making hair lackluster. But there are more than simply aesthetic reasons to give up conventional shampoos (see Three Reasons to Live Shampoo Free). Remove buildup by diluting 2 tablespoons vinegar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in 3 cups water and mixing well. After shampooing, pour rinse over hair before rinsing with water. The vinegar will close the cuticle and leave hair soft and shiny. An added bonus: It keeps dandruff at bay.\n6. Stain Remover: Purge grass stains and blood spots by whipping up your own natural stain remover. Mix 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup baking soda and 3 cups water in a spray bottle. Just spray on the stain and toss clothing into the laundry! While you\u2019re at it, combine vinegar with a handful of other cheap ingredients for a natural laundry detergent.\n7. Greens Reviver: Leafy greens looking wilted? Soak them in a bath of 2 cups cold water and 1/2 teaspoon vinegar to bring them back to life. Heck, at that point, you are not that far away from making a delicious vinegar-based salad dressing to accompany your lively greens.\n"}

Tajikistan has been a low priority for U.S. foreign policy makers since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Suddenly, it has become a strategic partner in the U.S. government's counter-terrorism campaign following the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C.. It is also a potential haven for tens of thousands of displaced people seeking to flee Afghanistan.\nTajikistan was embroiled in a civil war from 1992 to 1997 that took a disastrous toll on the civilian population and crippled its economy. Four years after a U.N.-brokered peace accord, high-profile political assassinations and other forms of political violence remain common, and discord reigns among government military and political leaders.\nTajikistan has serious human rights problems. The government has obstructed political opposition, severely restricted the media, and arrested people on religious grounds. Police and security forces are notorious for brutal torture and ill-treatment.\nTajikistan is the poorest of the post- Soviet republics. United Nations agencies estimate that 80 percent of the population of 6.5 million live below the poverty line. Two years of severe drought have resulted in catastrophic food shortages, and humanitarian organizations have predicted the starvation of one million people in upcoming months should emergency food supplies not become available.\nThe country's four major geographic regions are home to distinct regional and ethnic groups, which play a critical role in internal politics and were crucial in determining loyalty in the civil war. These regions are Sugd (formerly Leninabad) province in the north, bordering Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan; the northeast, including the Gharm and Karetegin valleys; Khatlon province in the south, bordering Afghanistan; and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, in the Pamir mountain range, bordering Afghanistan to the south and China to the east.\nThe civil war in Tajikistan broke out in May 1992. While its most active phase lasted a mere six months, hostilities continued through December 1996, claiming as many as 50,000 lives and displacing more than 800,000 people. The conflict was the culmination of a power struggle between a communist-led government that was dominated by people from Leninabad (known as \"Leninabadis\"), and an opposition coalition that drew support primarily from people whose origins were from the northeast (\"Gharmis\") and Gorno-Badakhshan (\"Pamiris\"). The government was supported in the civil war by people from Kuliab (\"Kuliabis),\" a district in the southern Khatlon province. The United Tajik Opposition (UTO) was an amalgam of nationalist and Islamist parties and movements. The war's greatest destruction and toll in civilian deaths was in the south, where Kuliabis and their allies conducted campaigns of \"ethnic cleansing\" against local residents of Gharmi and Pamiri origin.\nAt the height of the war as many as 150,000 Tajiks fled to northern Afghanistan, to regions dominated by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks; all were repatriated by 1997. Until 1998 the UTO enjoyed the support of the pre"}

{"idx": "5490", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Walmart's spending heavily to promote online grocery ordering.\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has rapidly expanded its online grocery service following Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) aggressive move into the category. Walmart plans to expand its delivery service to 100 metro areas by the end of this year. The service was only available in six markets as of March 2018.\nTo its credit, Walmart has made good progress on its expansion plans. Delivery is now available in nearly 50 markets, and delivery was available from over 320 stores by the end of July.\nWalmart has tried several approaches to grocery delivery, including (failed) partnerships with Uber and Lyft and trying to convince its workers to deliver items on their way home from a shift. Now Walmart is testing its own fleet of independent delivery drivers similar to Amazon's Flex program. Amazon uses Flex to deliver items purchased through Prime Now, its 2-hour delivery service available to Prime members in select markets. It's also using those drivers to deliver grocery orders from Whole Foods, a program it plans to expand nationwide in the near future.\nCan Walmart handle grocery delivery?\nWalmart's efforts to expand its online grocery ordering options have put a lot of pressure on its profits. Last quarter, Walmart's overall operating margin fell to 4.5% from 4.8% in the second quarter last year. Walmart U.S. operating profits, specifically, climbed by $0.1 billion, but the margin fell about 20 basis points to 5.4%.\nAs Walmart expands grocery delivery, it could put further pressure on its operating margin. Unlike Amazon, Walmart is charging shoppers for each delivery. (Amazon includes same-day grocery delivery as part of Prime.) The $9.95 fee Walmart charges has to cover the driver delivery fee, paying workers to pick and pack produce, and everything else that goes along with processing online orders. Walmart is also paying a third party to recruit, screen, and handle payment for independent contractors. With a promise of drivers being able to earn over $20 per hour delivering for Walmart, depending on the number of orders delivered, there might not be a lot left over in terms of profit.\nAmazon has always been willing to participate in margin-destroying activities in an effort to take market share and scale its operations. Its strategy with Whole Foods seems to be no different, and that's going to impact the biggest players -- such as Walmart -- the most as they try to stay ahead.\nOver half of Walmart's revenue comes from groceries. As more shopping shifts online, Walmart has moved quickly to enable online grocery ordering for most of its stores. You can now order groceries for pickup at over 1,800 Walmart locations around the country.\nWhat makes groceries such a valuable market for Walmart is that it brings customers into its stores, where they're likely to pick up a few things from the non-grocery side of the store as well. When people order groceries online and pick them up curbside (or have them delivered to their door), Walmart loses that benefit of its massive grocery business.\nAmazon's strategy of integrating Whole Foods delivery and pickup into its Prime membership provides a much greater benefit to Amazon. Prime members generally spend more on Amazon than non-members since there's a bit of a sunk-cost factor pushing them to shop more.\nThere's still time for Walmart to develop ways to encourage online grocery shoppers to also buy non-grocery items (either online"}

Our community is incredibly fortunate to have this team of \u201cMen and Women for Others,\u201d tirelessly working to ensure the standard of living we have become so accustomed to on this campus. We hope to recognize their impact through their stories. This is Bobby Breen\u2019s story. Check out the others here.\nlmost 40 years ago, Boston College was leasing a property in Brighton. On Dec. 28, 1978, it brought one of the property\u2019s maintenance staff members onto its own staff as a third-shift custodian.\nAround 10 years later, Bobby Breen was promoted to lead custodian, and he\u2019s held that position ever since. He describes his position as a foreman for the custodial staff. He works alongside them despite his seniority\u2014a leadership style he says he picked up from the second lead he ever worked under at BC.\nBreen has made it a priority to make sure those who work with him are treated the same way. Gerard Boyle, director of custodial and facilities services, described Breen as a hard worker who never calls in sick despite being such a long-time employee, always going the extra mile for the custodial staff he works with while serving as their link to the supervisors.\nBreen\u2019s job is to run the custodial staff on Lower Campus, subbing in for any members who need a day off, and takes care of work orders that come across his desk as well.\nNo matter what, according to Boyle, Breen is always taking on extra work to ease the burden on his coworkers. His kindness and attention to detail are what have made the humble man such an important part of the department that serves as BC\u2019s backbone.\nBreen feels like the love has gone both ways.\n\u201cWhen my mother passed away, I kept getting fruit baskets from members of the administration, and then from housekeeping and condolences from all around,\u201d he said.\nUltimately, Breen thinks the most important part of his job is building off BC\u2019s family atmosphere to make sure facilities has the same attitude. Teamwork makes the dream work: Breen believes that whenever his team is working together\u2014or whenever he has worked as a part of a larger team for that matter\u2014facilities has worked better and more effectively than they have on their own. The reason Breen and his custodial staff are able to cover so much ground and keep Lower Campus as clean as possible is that they\u2019ve taken BC\u2019s values and directly to how they approach keeping the campus looking as good as possible.\nBreen also also references how other departments look out for him and his fellow staffers as being a key aspect of facilities\u2019 excellent work. In the winters, Breen and others work to shovel out campus, they aren\u2019t responsible for buying shovels and jackets that get worn into some of the worst weather in the northeast. Luckily, BC\u2019s charitable attitude means Breen and Co. get access to the best shovels and jackets available so they\u2019re more prepared to fight storms. That way, when students wake up in the morning after a foot of snow falls on the ground, they don\u2019t have to worry about running over to a dining hall only to open the door into a foot of snow they can\u2019t get through."}

The drug was banned in the U.S. around 25 years ago after several cases were reported of it causing a unique type of toxicity - lactic acidosis.\nLactic acidosis is the build-up of lactic acid in the body.\nWhile welcoming the ban on the drug, which was introduced in 1957, M.P. Agarwal of the Delhi Diabetic Forum said most qualified doctors in the country handling diabetic patients had stopped recommending its use at least four years ago.\n\"No qualified doctors have been prescribing phenformin for the last four to five years after having read widely circulated reports overseas about it leading to lactic acidosis, a dangerous condition, though it has not been reported in India,\" Agarwal told IANS.\nLike phenformin, doctors in India are not recommending another diabetic drug, troglitazone, after reports of several fatalities in the West, Agarwal said.\nOn October 1 the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) issued a notification prohibiting the manufacture, sale or distribution of this drug as the \"use of phenformin is likely to involve risk to human beings\".\nMumbai-based USV Ltd is the only company that sells phenformin, under the brand name of DBI and DBI-TD. The sales figures of the company show that the offtake of the drug has been falling steadily over the last few years.\nIndia is among the countries with a high incidence of diabetics. According to Agarwal, there are around 30 million confirmed cases.\nIndians are rated as being highly vulnerable to diabetes and become afflicted at a relatively younger age than in the West, said Agarwal.\nLast year the drugs technical advisory board of DCGI referred phenformin to a sub-committee for review. The committee did not favour banning the drug because cases of lactic acidosis due to the drug were not so common in India.\nIn a subsequent review, the DCGI decided to ban the drug in October 2002 but took a year to notify the decision.\nThe Indian Drug Manufacturers Association has supported the government move.\n\"The advisory committee of the DCGI has been functioning well. We support its move as it must have felt justified in addressing the anxieties of some quarter, though the drug is still being manufactured in some countries,\" said G. Wakankar, executive director of the association.\nAn official of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the negative effects of phenformin were well known. \"The ban will not cause any hardship in India as there already exists a good substitute without the ill effects of phenformin.\""}

Overall, the Yes vote was up by around 20% across the country. In June 2008, only 10 out of Ireland's 43 parliamentary constituencies voted in favour of Lisbon; in this referendum, 41 constituencies have endorsed it.\nLast night, Irish opponents of Lisbon challenged David Cameron to give the British people a referendum on the EU's future if the Tories take power next year. Richard Greene, a leading figure in the anti-Lisbon C\u00f3ir movement, issued a direct public appeal to the Conservative leader to hold a referendum on Europe in the next British parliament.\nSpeaking at the main Dublin count in the RDS conference centre, Green told the Observer that the onus was now on Cameron to halt what he and other Irish No campaigners see as the drive towards an EU superstate.\n\"The British people were never colonised, so they will not be bullied.

It appeared over the last couple of days, as it became clear that there was going to be a Yes vote in Ireland, that Mr Cameron and Mr Hague were beginning to weasel out of that. I would say that is not good enough \u2013 because it can't be right just to have the Irish voting on the future of British democracy as well as their own.

Should the government abstain from selling food stocks if it is simultaneously requesting food aid?\nThe basic problem in Cambodia with food production is that they don't have a lot of storage capacity, and unless you have the storage capacity, you can't keep the food in the country.\nSo, often, it is wiser to export because you can't stock it. One of the things we will be doing with the food facility will be to help them increase storage.\nDoes Cambodian agriculture require an overhaul?\nI think the main problem is to try to help them increase production because, according to statistics, 65 percent of rural households in Cambodia are net food buyers, which is enormous.\nDoes Cambodia have a food security problem?\nThere's a problem. The very fact that we have this food facility which is going to help with production means there is a serious production problem. I wouldn't say food crisis, but help is needed.\nA common criticism of the economy is that it relies on two sectors: tourism and garments. How resilient does the Cambodian economy appear in the face of the global downturn?\nWe need to help Cambodia diversify. It only has two export sectors. Garments make up 80 percent of exports; manufacturing of shoes makes 11 percent.\nThey need to do other things and we want to help them diversify into light manufacturing. And there's more that can be done in the agricultural field, with processed agricultural products.\nHas the EC identified Cambodia as a country that may be in need of a bailout in response to local fallout from the global recession?\nBailout is not the word we would use.\nWe are focusing on helping the poorest Cambodians - in terms of food supply and primary education.\nIn fact, the EU as a whole - that means the EC plus its member states - have programmed assistance between 2009 and 2011 of the order of \u20ac600 million. So we are giving a great deal of assistance to Cambodia.\nWe need to help cambodia diversify. it has only two export sectors.\nThey are the major beneficiary per capita in the whole region.\nWe're focusing on rural, agricultural development. We're focusing on working with the government on its strategy; what's important is ownership.\nWe don't want to do things that the government doesn't want us to do. We want to focus on things the Cambodians are doing themselves.\nWe're helping with primary education. We have a \u20ac35 million program for education.\nWe're focusing on helping with public financial management, which is very important - helping them to manage their finances better than they do at the moment.\nHuman rights and democracy is an area of great importance, as well.\nWe've got a huge program of \u20ac10 million that's up-and-coming, including supporting the tribunals, judicial reform, areas like that.\nThe story of Cambodia's oil prospects has attracted a lot of attention.

Evolution is systematically downplayed in the proposed new set of state science standards soon to be considered by the state board of education.\nYet the proposed standards feebly describe it as \u201can explanation\u201d for the unity and diversity of life.\nThe flaws of the standards extend further than misrepresenting the scientific status of evolution. Of particular concern is the omission of any mention of common ancestry: the principle that organisms have descended, with modification, from shared ancestors.\nCommon ancestry is at the center of the evolutionary sciences, and the evidence for it is massive. Understanding common ancestry is important not only theoretically but also practically, in fields of applied science such as agriculture, conservation and medicine.\nThe National Research Council\u2019s \u201cA Framework for K-12 Education\u201d similarly emphasizes the importance of understanding the evidence of common ancestry as part of understanding biological evolution. And yet common ancestry is not to be found in the current draft of the standards.\nThe reason for these flaws and omissions is clear.\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas is on record as stating that intelligent design, a brand of creationism, ought to be taught with evolution in public school science classrooms, despite the unbroken string of federal court decisions finding that teaching creationism in the public schools is unconstitutional.\nDouglas\u2019 staff subsequently sabotaged the treatment of evolution in a prior draft of the standards. She then appointed a creationist to the committee charged with revising the portions of the standards addressing evolution.\nArizona\u2019s science teachers, the professionals primarily responsible for implementing whatever standards the board adopts, understand the importance of evolution in science education.\nThese are the views, not Douglas\u2019s, that the board ought to heed.\nDouglas is on her way out, owing to her failure to secure her party\u2019s nomination for her post. But the proposed standards to which she caused so much damage still pose a threat to the integrity of science education in Arizona\u2019s public schools, which would linger for years to come.\nWhen the state board of education is asked to approve these standards, it should refuse.

Arison, chairman of Arison Holdings Ltd., signed a contract with Buky Oren, former chairman of Mekorot, Israel's National Water Company, for investment into the development of projects in the field of water technology. In September, Housing and Construction, in which Arison has a 35.7 percent stake, won the bid with IDE Technologies to build the Hadera desalination plant. On Wednesday, On Arison Holdings came to an agreement with Housing & Construction employees led by Chief Executive Officer Uzi Vardi-Zer, to buy another 20% of the company at NIS 6.18 per share. In the initial phase of the new venture, which will start its activity in a couple of months, Oren will develop a detailed business plan outlining the activities of the venture and identify companies and projects for investment. The investment vehicle has an interest in companies that have complementary and unique technologies at different stages of development and whose products are aimed at the global market. Next week, an international delegations of scientists, industrialists and academics from Hong Kong, China, Australia, Europe, Africa and the Palestinian Authority will gather at a global conference at the Water Research Center in Sde Boker to discuss the relations between academic research and the private sector in all that relates to water solutions, production of new water and improving the quality of water. \"It is important to provide exposure and disclose the inventions, which are developed at academic institutes and research centers, to potential investors and industrialists in the water sector,\" said Eilan Adar, director of the Zuckerman Institute for Water Research in Sde Boker. \"There is a lot of material in academia and research centers, which partly can be applied for the development of products.\" At the three-day conference, which will start on Tuesday, the \"National Center for Advanced Water Solutions,\" will be launched in the presence of Shimon Peres, Minister for the Development of the Galilee and the Negev; Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Minister of National Infrastructure; MK Avishai Braverman; and the President of the Ben-Gurion University Prof. Rivka Carmi.

We straightened but still rocked side to side. The runway ahead stood on struts in the ocean, exposed and precarious. It was like landing on a trestle table.\nThe pilot wrestled us into position. Closer, closer, closer we came... nearly... but no. With a last-minute engine thrust, we lurched upwards, sky-bound again. The trestle table receded. The weather had won, this time.\nIt took us a few attempts to touch down at Madeira\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo Airport, a terminus as tricksy as its namesake\u2019s feet. It\u2019s known as one of the world\u2019s most difficult landings for pilots, thanks to the cross winds that whip its runway. This seemed quite the contradictory introduction to an island that is more often considered sedate, conventional, maybe even nice-but-dull. However, that perception is being challenged.\nAll the good things about Madeira still exist \u2013 the safety, the hospitality, exotic flowers, just three hours from home. But a new campaign, Madeira Ocean Trails, is aiming to highlight the island\u2019s more active possibilities, especially for the growing number of trail runners and hikers.\nTopographically, Madeira is constantly falling over itself \u2013 it\u2019s a crumple of volcanic basalt, rampant greenery, deep troughs and gnarly ridges; there\u2019s hardly a flat bit to be found. Now, this terrain has been recognised as a perfect playground for those seeking on-foot adventures.\nSo, dull? Not a chance. The island \u2013 like its airport \u2013 is apt to knock you sideways.

{"idx": "5525", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: When the United States entered World War II, legendary filmmaker John Ford had already been a member of the Navy for months. Aware the war effort could be helped, and documented, by men from Hollywood, the director of Stagecoach and The Grapes Of Wrath spent much of 1941 preparing for what was to come. His footage from the Battle Of Midway remains a groundbreaking feat for American filmmaking. While Ford was the first director to enlist, luminaries such as Frank Capra (It\u2019s A Wonderful Life), William Wyler (Ben-Hur), John Huston (The Maltese Falcon), and George Stevens (Giant) all became part of the war effort after Pearl Harbor.\nFive Came Back chronicles the lives of these men throughout the war, from the early days of enlistment and the founding of the Office Of War Information, to their return home from the terrors of D-Day and Dachau. Skipping from one director to the next, Mark Harris weaves a fascinating narrative that remains insightful and propulsive even as it switches focus. The book manages to be a history of Hollywood, American propaganda, and a biography of five men without ever dragging or feeling overstuffed.\nThe men at the center of the book provide its thrust, and Harris manages to translate the largesse of war and filmmaking into personal terms. By laying out each man\u2019s life in tandem, Five Came Back reaches a gripping critical mass. Capra and Ford were heavyweights by the time the war came, with more clout (and money) than their colleagues. Capra\u2019s cachet in Hollywood translated to a prominent role inside the Army\u2019s propaganda wing, where he sought to educate the American people in a similar way to his peacetime films. Ford, who pioneered outdoor shooting and may be the greatest director of Westerns, was a man who felt the need to prove himself heroically, and was burdened by the fact that he had not participated in the Great War. Wyler, a Jew from Alsace, felt a personal responsibility to help the war effort, and Huston, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, saw a chance to expand on his blooming career. Stevens was known for his comedies, but the terrors that he saw in war lead him to make masterpieces such as Shane and Giant.\nStevens\u2019 journey may be the most riveting (though none of the men\u2019s stories could be considered boring). His time spent at D-Day and the march through France, ending with his filming of the destruction of human life at Dachau is harrowing to read, but his bravery in the face of such evil is stirring. He came back to America a changed man, his previous life destroyed by what he\u2019d seen.\nHarris writes in a spare, vigorous style, but is more than up to the challenge of describing both the composition of some of the greatest shots of film history, and the fractured psyches of men returning home from war. Although Capra never really left Washington, the other four men found themselves in the middle of combat, or worse, and Harris tackles their issues of post-traumatic stress empathetically without ever falling into melodrama.\nFive Came Back is a welcome addition to film history, and well worth reading for anyone interested in film, World War II, or the use of propaganda in American life. Mark Harris has done a superb job winding the separate narratives of five of America\u2019s greatest directors together, and his poise in tackling so vast an epoch is a joy to read."}

{"idx": "5529", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: If you\u2019re early to a concert by Linkin Park, which one publication recently declared \u201cThe Biggest Rock Band on the Planet,\u201d you\u2019ll have many opportunities to make the world a better place. You can get your cheek swabbed by the folks from Love Hope Strength to see if you\u2019re a match to donate bone marrow and save someone\u2019s life, as sixteen Linkin Park fans have already been. You\u2019ll learn how you can help the environment from Reverb, a nonprofit that worked with Linkin Park\u2019s crew to minimize the environmental impact caused by the tour. Or you can visit the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America booth, where you\u2019ll meet Quan Nguyen, who will tell you about IAVA\u2019s efforts to protect the vulnerable veteran population.\nAnd you\u2019ll meet the aptly-named Missy Allgood, who will tell you about Music for Relief, the organization Linkin Park founded in 2005 to raise money and awareness and provide direct help with disaster relief and environmental protection. Music for Relief has already raised more than $6 million for survivors of natural disasters and has planted 1 million trees to help reduce global warming.\nHow is Linkin Park able to accomplish this? Like any band, Linkin Park\u2019s six members are a top management team. Though they were able to get on the same page musically, when it came to politics they were all over the map.\nTriggered by compassion, the band sprung into action, using its existing resources and infrastructure.\nLinkin Park was in fact sitting on major untapped resources. First was their huge and passionate fan base. A pioneer in using the Internet to nurture its community of fans, Linkin Park now has more than 66 million fans on Facebook. Second was its organization, from management to crew, dozens of employees, subcontractors and service providers. Third was its network of fellow bands, each with its own dedicated community of fans.\nThe band realized it could make the greatest impact by providing its own compassion triggers for others . They contributed to the \u201cNot Alone\u201d video to raise awareness and funds for Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. The Secretary General of the United Nation was so pleased by the response (more than 9 million YouTube views at the time), that he asked the band to support his Sustainable Energy for All initiative, promoting universal access to electricity. The resulting collaboration is called Power the World, which has been providing solar electricity systems to health clinics in Uganda, biogas cookstoves for households in Nepal and soccer balls that are also portable generators to communities in South America.\nBut more than awareness, the band sees Music for Relief as an infrastructure to engage people who want to use their skills to provide physical help. To that end, they organize tree plantings, park cleanups and construction projects for their fans and crew.\nThrough such activities, Linkin Park has been able to permeate its organization with a culture of care. According to a recent paper by professors Kevin Andr\u00e9 and Anne-Claire Pache at the EESEC Business School, effective corporate social action builds on creating an organization where people have opportunities to do good for others, where they are encouraged to care for each other and where they can interact with those who benefit from their services.\nHere is where Linkin Park can serve as an example for any kind of organization that wants to do social good .\nIn South Africa in 2012, twenty Linkin Park crew members planted trees at an elementary school. \u201cIt was the best day,\u201d said Missy Allgood, \u201cIt was so sweet. These little kids in uniforms in 80-degree weather, and it was beautiful."}

But one security expert says the report may not be as much as it appears.\nNot only that, the data on the phone may be encrypted with a separate system that has to be cracked. As Schneier points out, we don\u2019t know if the Cellebrite technology allows access to data or even metadata on a device.\nEncryption is a two-edged sword for law enforcement and government intelligence agencies. On the one hand it protects their secrets, but it also allows criminals to protect theirs.\nThe problem came to a head in 2015 when the FBI couldn\u2019t get into an iPhone 5C owned by one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. After five wrong guesses on that device the phone refuses to allow another attempt for one minute. Eventually \u2014 and that could take months or longer \u2014 the code can be broken, but in a running investigation time is important. Apple said it helped the FBI in some ways, but refused a request to build software to get around the problem.\nUltimately the FBI reportedly was able to get into that phone. But since then a number of law enforcement agencies around the world, including the RCMP, have urged their governments and tech companies to find a way police can lawfully access an encrypted device and still allow reasonable privacy. However, experts like Schneier say any solution could also be exploited by sophisticated criminals or nation-states with access to huge computing resources.\nIn looking into the difficulty facing investigators in the San Bernadino case, the Washington Post noted the kind of password on a device describes its ability to be cracked. A four-digit passcode can be jiggled in 10,000 ways. The newspaper said it would only take 13 minutes for the FBI to try out all the different combinations under ideal conditions. However, a mixed six-letter passcode with capital and lower-case letters and numbers would have 56.8 billion possibilities."}

Crowds stampeded after a Vaporeon inCentral Park and people fell off cliffs playing it in California.\nAt an Apple event on Sept. 7, Niantic CEO John Hanke said 500 million people had downloaded the game in just two months. It was the first mobile game to go mainstream in a big way since \u201cCandy Crush\u201d in 2014 or \u201cAngry Birds\u201d in 2012. It was also the first to incorporate augmented reality, a blending of the real and virtual worlds.\nBut the buzz has decidedly cooled. Last Tuesday, the game ended its reign as the top-grossing U.S. iPhone app after 74 days on top, replaced by \u201cClash Royale,\u201d a popular battling game, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Twitter mentions of the game peaked at 1.7 million on July 11, five days after its launch, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That number had fallen by 98 percent, to 131,000, by Sept. 7, when Apple featured it.\nWas it all a summer fever dream? While experts say the game is likely to remain popular for a while, it needs to evolve to have real staying power \u2014 just like its namesake digital creatures.\nOf course, an enormous number of people still play the game. Research firm App Annie estimates 1 in 10 smartphone owners in the U.S. are playing; in Japan, that number is 1 in 4. Those U.S. figures are half what App Annie saw the week after the game launched \u2014 but to put them in perspective, they still reflect roughly the same user interest as Twitter or Pinterest.\nThe longer users interact with the game, the more time a company has to figure out how to get money from them, Nicolas said. It took a year for some successful games like \u201cClash of Clans,\u201d \u201dPuzzle\u201d and \u201cDragon\u201d to earn revenue of $1 billion, but \u201cPokemon Go\u201d has already made more than $500 million in revenue in two months alone, according to App Annie. The game is free, but lets users purchase items in the game.\nBut with social chatter dying down and a new smartphone game based on a beloved 1990s character \u2014 \u201cSuper Mario Run\u201d \u2014 hitting app stores in December, Pok\u00e9mon will have to reinvent itself.\nKari Amarosso, a public relations manager at Arizona State University, started playing \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go\u201d with her 19-year-old son as a fun mother-son summer activity sparked by 1990s Pok\u00e9mon-card nostalgia. They\u2019d go to the mall or to meetups like one in Tempe, Arizona, where thousands of people walked around Tempe Town Lake capturing digital monsters.\nBut the allure wore off after about six weeks, she said. \u201cI lost interest or just plain forgot to play,\u201d she says \u2014 and her son has stopped as well. \u201cHis route doesn\u2019t change much from work, to home, and he lost interest,\u201d she says.\nNiantic has been trying to freshen things up.

{"idx": "5535", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Gaming stocks have done very well over the past year. Third-party publishers have benefited from the introduction of new consoles from Sony and Microsoft as well asincreasing digital sales, and these tailwinds helped every third-party console game publisher except for Ubisoft beat the market over the last 12 months. While Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive both posted solid gains, Electronic Arts performed best of all, nearly doubling over the period.\nThe company&apos;s incredible stock gains have pushed its forward P/E ratio to roughly 28. Using this metric, EA stands as the priciest of the third-party games publishers. Yet, with a strong position in a growing industry and apparent improvement in the company&apos;s operations, Electronic Artsis alsothe most expensive stock worth buying in the realm of gaming companies.\nSurveying the fieldElectronic Arts develops and publishes hit franchises like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, and has ridden strong software performance to gains of roughly 93% over the last year. The company has also posted the best growth of any gaming company in the last five years, delivering gains of roughly 217% while the S&P 500 increased roughly 82%. Across the same stretch, Activision, Take Two, and Ubisoft made gains of 109%, 136%, and 46%, respectively. Surveying the competition: Activision Blizzard looks solid even as the Call of Duty series is losing some of its pull, Take Two seems to be building a stronger lineup on top of the megahit Grand Theft Auto series, while Ubisoft is looking a bit weak due todeclining performance from its Assassin&apos;s Creed property.\nEA is winning the digitaldistribution gameAlso key to Electronic Arts&apos; growth is the advancement of its mobile presence and booming digital software sales. Selling games digitally rather than through retailers like GameStop is enabling the company to improve its margins and drive revenues through direct-to-consumer promotions.This has helped the company deliver results forits last four quarters that were significantly better than the average analyst estimate, and each earnings release prompted a significant stock bump.For the company&apos;s fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014, roughly 45% of the company&apos;s revenue came from digital sales. This impressive figure was partially propelled by a 47% year-over-yearincrease in the sale of downloadable content for games.\nEA looks to have room to further improve its margins as digital distribution continues to make gains at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers. The company&apos;s EA Access program functions as a year-long subscription to previously released games from some of its big series at a relatively low price of $30, and the company has indicated that the package has been quite successful. These types of direct-to-consumer promotions help the publisher to absorb revenue that might have otherwise been generated from used copies of its games.\nBig franchises, mobile growth, and beyondElectronic Arts seems primed for more strong performance in the year to come, with new installments in some of the company&apos;s biggest franchises set to release, as well as the revival of the Star Wars: Battlefont series. The company should continue to benefit from the expanding user base for the new gaming consoles, as well as the ongoing growth in digital sales. It also hasa major growth opportunity in mobile.\nWith strong footing in console and mobile gaming, and"}

England would then be left in an alliance with Wales.\nHe said the coming trade negotiations are painstaking line-by-line, sector-by-sector work, and the current lack of capacity would require the UK government to search for skilled negotiators outside Whitehall.\nHe also disclosed that internal Brexit teams are being set up in every Whitehall department to report through a boosted European secretariat in the Cabinet Office led by Oliver Letwin.\nHe added the UK will have to boost its staff in Brussels to prepare for the Brexit negotiations, as well as increase staff in embassies, as it fights to make the UK\u2019s voice heard in a new competition with the EU, the US and other countries.\nFraser said in his call for extra staff: \u201cWe will be competing in other countries for attention if we leave the EU and we will have to work much harder to make our voice heard so we will have to be more active.\u201d He also warned the now real threat of a break-up of the union with Scotland \u201cwill diminish our weight and international standing in the world,\u201d as well as have implications for British Overseas Territories and Gibraltar.\nIs Nigel Farage right to say MEPs have not done 'proper jobs'?\nFraser was Foreign Office permanent secretary from 2010 to 2015 as well as business department permanent secretary.\nHe added that it was sensible for the UK to seek to pause invoking Article 50 until the beginning of the autumn to give the government more time to work out its initial bargaining position on Brexit. He accepted some EU countries had difficult domestic audiences and pressure may mount to demand clarity from the UK and a start to the talks. In addition, he said, people in the UK will start to expect the outcome of the referendum to be put into practice.\n\u201cLegally speaking, it is only the British government that can trigger this process,\u201d Fraser said.\nFraser also said the UK government will need to look at the future of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

He said if Renzi is beaten, all bets are off so there was a case in terms of talks where \u201cwe hang loose, trust in God and keep our powder dry\u201d.\nHe added that despite the ban on informal talks between the UK and EU until it invokes Article 50, \u201cnature abhors a vacuum and I bet you there will be informal contacts.

De Rossi's name should have gone into the black book instead, for shameful simulation.\nBatres sensibly stayed in the middle of the pitch after he whistled for halftime, standing side-by-side with his linesmen.\nHe waved Kiwi striker Chris Killen away but he still got a spray from All Whites kitman Matt Hockin before he was pulled away by manager Phil Warbrick.\nIt must have been a lonely march up the tunnel for Batres with the Kiwi management staff trailing behind him.\nThey had every reason to be irate.\nThe All Whites got the rough end of the pineapple from the man in the middle for most of the first half. Ironic cheers erupted whenever he awarded a freekick to the Kiwis.\nStriker Rory Fallon was cautioned for use of the elbow during some push and shove which saw three teak-tough Italian defenders crash to the ground, clutching their chins.\nBut there was also something unedifying about the way the Italians clamoured around the ref, appealing for a red card against Fallon and coach Ricki Herbert was later forced to withdraw him to \"save his tournament\".\nBut, there seemed one rule for the aristocrats and another for the artisans.

It's even lighter than the first generation iPad Mini, and with a really narrow build, it's one of the easiest tablets to hold in one hand. There's an easy-to-find power button and volume rocker in the side, and a headphone jack on the top. There's a 1.2-megapixel camera on the front and a 5-megapixel back camera. They're not bad cameras, but are pretty typically unimpressive, even for tablet cameras. The back texture isn't as inviting or comfortable as the originals, but it's not unpleasant, either. There's a micro-USB port on the bottom, and with the purchase of a $30 SlimPort adapter will also double as an HDMI port. It has speaker grills on the top and bottom, which allows for a pretty effective surround sound. It ships with Android 4.3, which gives you three major new features: Restricted User Profiles allows you to add a kid- friendly profile; OpenGL ES 3.0 improves polygonal graphics performance; and Bluetooth Smart allows the Nexus 7 to connect to a newer generation of Bluetooth devices. Near Field Communication support returns, and we also get wireless charging-- which according to Google, will allow any Qi-compatible charger to fill the Nexus 7's battery. However, the actual charging speed was painfully slow compared to a wire charge. The screen has a 1920x1200 resolution and responds quickly to touches and swipes. Switching between different apps is fast, and scrolling through web pages is smooth and zippy. WiFi speeds were consistently high with no spotty connection issues when within a reasonable distance from the network. In our official battery test, it lasted an impressive 11.5 hours while running a movie in Airplane Mode. Real Racing 3 and Riptide GP2 both looked really impressive with smooth frame rates and sharp graphics with minimal aliasing on the edges. 2D games like Angry Birds also pack in the pixels and look impressively sharp. While it doesn't completely blow away the competition starting at just $230 for 16 gigabytes of storage, the new Nexus 7 has enough improvements to easily earn the best small tablet crown-- at least for now. I'm Eric Franklin, and this has been the first look at the Google Nexus 7."}

Carter\u2019s shot missed wide, the Blues were granted a stay of execution, and Leipsic was denied the helper.\nLeipsic\u2019s primary assists on the goals by Tyler Toffoli and Paul Ladue \u2013 which proved to be the game-winner \u2013 were no less aesthetically pleasing.\nThe Kings claimed Leipsic off waivers from the Canucks on Dec. 3. They are Leipsic\u2019s fifth franchise in the last four years.\nFor the moribund Kings, Leipsic has a better opportunity than he could probably expect in Vancouver, Las Vegas, Toronto or Nashville. He logged just under 2 minutes on the power play Monday and made the most of his open-ice looks at even strength against St. Louis.\nHead coach Willie Desjardins said that Leipsic showed some of the flashes he\u2019s displayed before.\nGoaltender Jonathan Quick passed Mike Richter into sole possession of fourth place for the most wins by an American-born goalie with 302.\nQuick grew up a New York Rangers fan in suburban Connecticut. At the time, Richter was his favorite goalie on his favorite team. Quick typically casually brushes off the importance of milestones like a soft shot into his chest protector. This milestone \u2013 at least, this player \u2013 means more to him than most.\nQuick figures to remain fourth on this list for a while. Next up is Tom Barrasso with 369 wins.\nForward Matt Luff was reassigned to the Ontario Reign prior to Monday\u2019s game. By demoting Luff, who was likely to be a healthy scratch against the Blues, the Kings were able to scrimp a bit. Any player not on an NHL roster does not count against his team\u2019s daily salary cap calculation.\nLuff, 21, had seven goals and three assists in 30 games with the Kings this season. He hadn\u2019t scored in seven games since the Christmas break.\nDefenseman Sean Walker is expected to be re-assigned to the Reign on Tuesday.

Park is a celebrity in South Korea and is swamped with fans wherever he goes. His hometown, Suwon, near to Seoul, built a park and named a road after Park to commemorate him becoming the first Premier League-r in South Korean history.\nPark may even become the first Asian to win a Championship League medal after this season. Nicknamed \"Three-lung Park\" for his seemingly overflowing energy supply, the South Korean papers plaster their front pages with Park if he scores and give out the smallest details of how many minutes he ran in each match.\nBut Park's football career had not really drawn much attention until the recent years.

{"idx": "5554", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety.\nBoth categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can\u2019t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.\nThe X PlusOne offers the best of both worlds. Designed by aerospace engineer JD Claridge and freshly launched on Kickstarter, this drone blurs the line between winged and multi-rotor aircraft. Thanks to an ingenious form factor, the X PlusOne is able to take off, hover, and land like a traditional quadcopter, and also accelerate forward like a wing drone.\nThe key to this ability is the craft\u2019s innovative design. In place of the usual crossbars that hold up a drone\u2019s four rotors, the X PlusOne uses an upward-facing wing. When in hover mode, this wing doesn\u2019t do much of anything, but if the drone tilts upward 90 degrees and kicks up the speed a bit, the wing\u2019s shape can provide enough lift to keep the craft airborne. Once it\u2019s in this position, with all four rotors providing forward thrust, the X PlusOne can achieve speeds of up to 62 miles per hour (100 km) \u2014 nearly double what traditional multi-rotor drones are capable of.\nIt\u2019s also packed to the gills with additional tech that presumably makes the craft easier to fly. Built-in stabilization algorithms keep the drone rock-steady no matter how windy it might get, and there\u2019s even an auto-hover function that\u2019ll take over and level out if you ever get into trouble. To keep your GoPro steady and give you those drool-worthy uber-smooth aerial shots, X PlusOne is also equipped with a 2-axis gimbal stabilizer mount.\nThere are almost more features than we\u2019ve got room to list in this article, so we\u2019ll let you dig through the rest on the the X PlusOne\u2019s Kickstarter page. Launched just this week, the campaign is seeking $50K to finalize the drone\u2019s design and get it ready for production. Early bird backers can lock one down for about $480, whereas those who are late to the party will need to shell out $600."}

Bach called L.A. and Paris, the last remaining candidates for the 2024 games, \"two such great cities\u2026promoting the Olympic games and the Olympic spirit in such a great way.\"\nBoth cities also plan to use what Bach calls a record number of existing facilities, as opposed to building stadiums, Olympic villages and more that may then go unused after the games. \"This is something that we have not seen before,\" which \"will make the games more sustainable and more feasible.\"\nAmong the factors pushing the 2024 games to Paris, one is more sentimental. 2024 would be the 100th anniversary of the last time Paris hosted the games, in 1924.\nAnother boils down to political climate, specifically the U.S. President. Andrei S. Markovits, Professor of European Politics at University of Michigan and an expert on sports and sports culture, told me back this winter that \"There's absolutely no question that President Trump is a huge liability for L.A., big time.\"\nMeanwhile, France has just elected Emmanuel Macron as its new President on a largely internationalist platform, as opposed to President Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric.

Washington's Russian embassy also would not comment.\nBut the Russian state-controlled arms trader Rosoboronexport said the firm will fulfill its arms contract with Syria, the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency said.\n\"No one can ever accuse Russia of violating the rules of armaments trade set by the international community,\" Rosoboronexport Deputy CEO Igor Sevastyanov said when asked about Russia's supply of mobile gun and missile air defense systems to Syria, RIA Novosti said.\nSevastyanov added, \"The contract was signed long ago, and we supply armaments that are self-defense rather than attack weapons.\"\nAlthough a Pentagon spokesman was unaware of a Russian helicopter shipment to Syria, Capt. John Kirby told reporters Tuesday al-Assad forces have been using helicopter gunships against their own people, calling the attacks \"intolerable, unacceptable and just further evidence of the degree to which they are willing to kill their own people for twisted ends.\"\nOn Monday, State Department Spokesperson Victoria Nuland called the helicopter attacks on civilians a \"new horrific tactic\" that \"constitutes a very serious escalation\" of the conflict.\nRussia has been the long-time principle supplier of arms to Syria since the days when it was the Soviet Union. The weapons sales have more than doubled in recent years. According to Congressional Research Service, Russia sold Syria $4.7 billion in arms from 2007 to 2010, compared to $2.1 billion from 2003 to 2006.\nNuland said the international community continues to press Russia to discontinue the weapons sales. \"We are all making the point in the international community that they are on the wrong side with regard to this - this set of issues. We've had people in Moscow in the last week making these points again and we will continue to do so,\" Nuland said.\nEarlier this month, Clinton said the continued supply of arms from Russia has strengthened the al-Assad regime, despite denials by Russian President Vladimir Putin that any munitions it was providing to Syria were being used against its own people.\nThe Obama administration is also being criticized for its relationship with a Russian arms broker that is a major supplier of weapons to Syria.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, sent a letter to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday, criticizing the Department of Defense's decision to award an Army contract to Rosoboronexport to buy helicopters for the Afghanistan military. \"I remain deeply troubled that the DoD would knowingly do business with a firm that has enabled mass atrocities in Syria,\" Cornyn wrote. \"Such actions by Rosoboronexport warrant the renewal of U.S. sanctions against it,"}

Often alluding to a person's state of mind.\nIt is a gorgeous line like many others written by Sagar Sarhadi and Silsila happily resorts to romanticism to distract us from the ensuing poppycock.\nIrresistible and frustrating in equal measure, it feels like a self-aware, shrewd vanity project playing on our unnatural curiosity about celebrity lives.\nThe very idea of AB, Jaya and Rekha sharing a frame screams sensational.\nIt has been over three decades but public interest in their alleged triangle refuses to die.\nYou can only imagine what a big deal it was in 1981 after Jaya and Rekha replaced the original choices Smita Patil and Parveen Babi. But in trying to tease the viewer and toe the line between speculated and make believe, Silsila oversells its premise.\nPart of the problem is the writing. It is all over the place.\nChopra's best romances are a beautiful blend of breezy courtships and intense conflicts boosted by a sound narrative and pretty aesthetics. Even at their most melodramatic, they are brimming in conviction.\nSilsila's sluggish pace and weakly written roles fail to live up to the boldness it promises.

Michelle Smith, 43rd, said at a recent neighborhood meeting. And the project is one step closer to happening, Smith said, because General Iron Industries, long a staple of Chicago\u2019s Clybourn Corridor, will be leaving Lincoln Park.\nHowever, Randall A. Samborn, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment on whether the company is moving.\nFor Smith and the group of residents, architects, and community and environmental advocates, including Friends of the Parks and Openlands, who have been pushing the city to build a publicly owned riverfront park and nature preserve in the space, the potential news is encouraging: It signals the city could acquire the General Iron site, which occupies nearly half of the space envisioned for the North Branch Park Preserve project.\nSmith and her colleagues, Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, and Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd, say it could cost between $150 million and $200 million for the city to acquire the land from private landlords and build the park.\nIt\u2019s still not clear how the city would fund the plan, announced in March, but it is needed, say its proponents, including Richard Wilson, city design director at Adrian Smith+Gordon Gill Architecture. The park would aid in \u201csoftening the edges of our river,\u201d especially with massive development planned for the North Branch, Wilson said.\nLast year, the city greenlighted zoning changes along a nearly 800-acre swath of the river, a move that could \u201cthrow open the doors to about 18 million square feet of high-rises,\u201d the Tribune\u2019s Ryan Ori reported. Over the next decade, 150,000 people could move to the area as a result \u2014 or more, if Amazon decides to build its HQ2 on the more than 70-acre Lincoln Yards site proposed by developer Sterling Bay.\nBackers estimate the proposed North Branch Park project would cost between $150 million and $200 million dollars to build, including the cost of acquiring the land from private developers.\nThe city could tap funding from its Industrial Corridor System Fund, intended to relocate and expand existing industrial businesses within the city, or its North Branch Corridor Bonus Fund, created to plan, design and build transit, open space, and other infrastructure projects in the corridor, Smith said. Other suggestions included developer in-kind improvements, tax increment financing, as the site is within existing TIF boundaries, special assessment bonds, and grants and loans from the federal or state Environmental Protection Agency, Smith said.\nNonprofit and development partners could also contribute, as well as private philanthropy, she added.\nStill, \u201cthe land acquisition is the No. 1 issue here,\u201d Smith told the audience, made up of more than 100 residents and advocates who were overwhelmingly in support of the proposal.\nThe planned park, in addition to creating needed open space, would make the city more attractive to businesses and increase park-adjacent land values, according to Smith\u2019s presentation Wednesday. Ping Tom Park in Chinatown and La Villita Park in Little Village are examples of where similar plans were implemented, she said."}

{"idx": "5570", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Dark-colored business suits let interviewers know you mean business.\n1 What Does a Teen Wear to an Interview?\n3 How Should Petite Ladies Dress for an Interview?\nOne of the worst interview mistakes is to arrive underdressed. With many professional offices offering full-time business casual dress codes or special days, such as casual Fridays, you don't want to draw negative attention by being too overdressed, either. But brokerage firms are typically a bit old-school, adhering to more formal dress codes and expecting the same from job candidates.\nThe world of finance was once a man's domain, but women are making significant contributions to brokerage firms. Dressing like a man won't help you land the job at the firm, however, so stay away from pant suits. Sticking to traditional, conservative skirt suits gives you credibility during your interview. The shirt you wear under the suit jacket shouldn't reveal cleavage, and both the shirt and jacket should be long-sleeved. Low heels, such as two to three inches, are acceptable, but keep toes closed for a more conservative look.\nMen also should go the conservative-suit route when interviewing at brokerage firms. Go with a solid color rather than a pattern suit with a traditional cut. Pick a tie that complements the suit without being loud or obnoxious. Button your shirt all the way to the top. Your shoes should look shiny and new, so polish them before the interview.\nBoth men and women should pick a dark color for their interview suits, such as charcoal gray or navy blue. Women can also wear black, but men should avoid it. Don't go with a power color, such as red for women, because it might stand out too strongly in a sea of darker colors. Men should shy away from brown, which tends to look dull and unappealing. Both genders can benefit from light-colored shirts. These don't necessarily need to be white, but they should work with your other accessories such as a tie and jewelry.\nGoing basic with your accessories is the best bet when interviewing in the finance world. Pearl stud earrings and a pearl necklace work well for women, while men should avoid jewelry except for wedding bands, if appropriate. Men's belts should match their shoes. Women need hosiery even if they don't normally wear hose. It's best to err on the side of caution and tradition. Keep painted nails neutral, such as a French manicure, and pull your hair back from your face if possible.\nYour entire picture should be one of professionalism. If it's cold, wear a nice-fitting overcoat in a dark color. Padfolios should be leather with a high-end pen inside. Women carrying handbags should make sure they match their shoes. Keep the bags small and inconspicuous.\nMunroe, Shala. \"What to Wear to a Job Interview at a Brokerage Firm.\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/wear-job-interview-brokerage-firm-18548.html.

David wasn't as exciting as he used to be. He was so busy with all of his professorial assignments. Plus, he's head of the department.

I can sum it up by saying that most of the time the boredom stems from a core problem. That problem is disappointment that the spouse doesn't understand his wife better. Or more simply, that it has turned out that he is not very good at mind reading!\nFor example, I discovered that my client was disappointed because her husband wasn't sensitive to her feelings. However, upon further questioning, my client admitted that she didn't make clear to her husband that her feelings were hurt or that she needed extra hugs and attention. She assumed he would just pick up on it. After all, he had said how much he loved her!\nI want to honestly ask you, are you a professional mind reader? I certainly am not.

So she was surprised when, soon after she moved here four years ago from Virginia, she started sniffling and sneezing and suffering from a stuffy nose.\n\"I thought Arizona was supposed to be a good place for people with allergies,\" she said.\nMerrell is not alone. Experts say many people, including some physicians, still have an image of Arizona as a haven for allergy sufferers, a dry, clean desert environment that will cure what ails you.\nThat myth, which Arizona Lung Assn. head Ben Chaiken says was not true even when tuberculosis and asthma patients flocked here decades ago, is even further from the truth now.\n* The widespread use of irrigation has resulted in a 10-month growing season, bad news for those who suffer from pollen and grass allergies.\n* Transplanted residents who imported non-native plants have increased the variety of flora that can trigger allergic reactions. The top local offenders, mulberry and olive trees, are not indigenous.\n* Population growth has resulted in more air pollution, a contributor to allergy problems.\n* Phoenix allergist Dr. William Rieck believes that an additional factor as well may be at play here--an allergy-loaded gene pool.\nBecause people have traditionally moved to the Phoenix area to escape allergy miseries, he said, a higher percentage of the population is allergy-prone. When those people meet and marry others who also suffer from allergies, the odds are good they will pass on allergic tendencies to their children. The process has repeated itself over generations until a city once believed to be allergy-safe actually has a high number of allergy-prone residents.\n\"Nationwide, about 10% to 15% of the population suffer from allergies,\" he said. \"Here, about 20% to 25% do.\"\nDr. Michael Ruff, a Dallas allergist on the public education committee of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology, said this genetics theory makes sense.\nA child with one allergic parent stands a 25% to 40% chance of developing allergies, Ruff said. Offspring of two parents with allergies have a 50% to 75% chance of inheriting those problems, he said.\nRieck said not only are more people here suffering from allergies, but the severity of their problems seems to grow each year. This year record rainfall has resulted in a spring allergy season that is the worst in recent memory.\nMeteorologist Ed Phillips said the Phoenix area received a year's worth of rainfall in the first three months of this year, 8.56 inches in a city where the average annual rainfall is 7.64 inches.\n\"When you have this huge amount of rain before the growing season, you have monstrous growth. While it's beautiful to see the desert in bloom, it's terrible for allergy sufferers,\" he said.\nKelly Serago can already attest to that. A Phoenix native who is allergic to 257 substances, she said her allergies have not been this bad in years: \"I am miserable.\"\nThe Phoenix City Council recently took a step toward alleviating one problem, voting to outlaw offending varieties of olive and mulberry trees.

But two qualified and apparently willing candidates have emerged.\nWhen confronted last week with pervasive rumors that he is on the way out, Tillerson pleaded ignorance. \"Who in the world is telling you that stuff?\" he asked reporters from the Wall Street Journal. He promised to stay in the job \"as long as the president thinks I'm useful.\" Early this month, he held a news conference to deny reports that he had considered quitting. Publicly, Trump has expressed confidence in his top diplomat, despite reports that Tillerson had called the president a \"moron.\"\nInside the White House, officials say privately that Tillerson's repeated disputes with various parts of the Trump inner circle have made his long-term survival untenable. The leading speculation is that he may depart after he has served one full year, to save face and complete the State Department reorganization he has publicly claimed as his primary mission.\nAs several excruciating profiles have detailed, Tillerson's main legacy will likely be a State Department depleted of talent, with the lowest morale in decades and playing a reduced role in the crafting and implementation of U.S. foreign policy. His successor's primary mission will be to reverse that trend. The top two contenders, Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, offer different paths for recovery.\nHaley has been praised both externally and within the Trump team during her short tenure in New York City. She's credited with \"getting it done \" on matters such as North Korea sanctions and toughening up the U.S. stance at the United Nations. Unlike Tillerson, she was quick to get a top-notch staff in place, which has allowed her to be effective inside the interagency process.\nHer appointment would foretell a State Department that hews toward traditionally hawkish GOP positions, including forceful advocacy for freedom and human rights abroad. It could also mean a shift in the current drive to mend relations with Russia. Last week, Haley told the George W. Bush Institute that Russian interference in U.S. elections amounted to \"warfare.\" Haley also defended funding for diplomacy and free trade.\n\"We're not going to see [diplomacy and development funding] gutted, that's just the reality of it, because we can't and the president doesn't want to,\" Haley said. \"I don't see us tearing up any [trade] deals. If that was the case, we would have done it already.\"\nHaley took a middle-of-the-road approach in deliberations on the new Iran strategy, which ended up winning the day. She has met with refugees in the Middle East and is continuing her world tour this week, heading to Ethiopia, South Sudan and Congo. She looks like someone campaigning for a promotion.\nBut the Haley choice is risky for Haley. She already has amassed the foreign policy bona fides required for a future run for president. Her physical distance from the White House has allowed her to avoid internal conflicts and act independently. It's not clear what she gains politically from moving up to secretary of state. Taking the job would be a huge gamble.\nShould Haley move"}

So why is it this group that\u2019s entitled to discounts at the movies, supermarkets, hotels, and nearly everywhere else you turn, while the young and poor pay full price?\nHere\u2019s an idea that\u2019s sure to go over about as well as the fictional \u201cdeath panels\u201d discussed ad nauseum during the 2009 debates over Obamacare. In an op-ed for USA Today, a journalist named Don Campbell calls for the end of across-the-board senior discounts.\nTherefore, firstly, address all of your angry notes about giving up senior discounts only if they\u2019re pried from your cold, dead hands directly to Mr. Campbell. This is his idea, not mine.\nSecondly, to answer the inevitable question: Yes, the writer is, in fact, old enough to be eligible for just about every senior discount on the planet. It\u2019s just that he feels he doesn\u2019t need the discount. Neither, he claims, do the majority of seniors.\nFor evidence, Campbell points to studies such as those conducted by the Pew Research Center (more about that here), which shows that older Americans today are much wealthier than older Americans were a generation ago. After adjusting for inflation, the median net worth for households headed by adults 65 and up was 42% higher in 2009 than their counterparts in 1984.\nThe typical younger American, by contrast, has gotten poorer, with median net worth for households headed by someone under 35 decreasing 68% between 1984 and 2009.\nAnother study, conducted by the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that the group suffering the least financial damage due to the recession was that of households headed by seniors ages 65 to 74. What\u2019s more, according to the study\u2019s data, the median net worth of households in the 55-64 age bracket\u2014prime years for snagging senior discounts\u2014was $222K, substantially higher than the $69K median net worth of families in the discount-ineligible age bracket of 35-44.\nCampbell is especially puzzled with why many senior discounts start at age 50, which is roughly when managers and skilled workers tend to start commanding the largest-ever salaries of their careers. And why is it that so many senior discounts take effect once someone hits 50? It\u2019s not the government or any official agency dictating the age for senior discount eligibility, nor what percentage discount seniors should get. Mostly, senior discounts come down to marketing: Companies are understandably eager to attract the business of a group of citizens known for having plenty of disposable income and time, and discounts seem to do the trick.\nAlso, as Campbell writes, the AARP, a.k.a. \u201cthe nanny-conglomerate lobbying group committed to running your life once you turn 50,\u201d has proved to be pretty good at applying pressure on businesses to offer senior discounts. By the way, you can join the AARP, which originally stood for the American Association of Retired Persons, at age 50, long before most people retire.\nWhat I wonder about is why thirty- and fortysomethings aren\u2019t livid that senior citizens \u2014 the most pampered, patronized and pandered-to group in America \u2014 get to save money simply by maintaining a pulse.\nWell, one reason we\u2019re not up in"}

In fact, you start to see it as soon as you get off the plane.\nThe terminal of Caracas International Airport, a cavernous building built in the 1980s, is mostly empty. International carriers have largely abandoned the country. The combination of foreign exchange controls and the government\u2019s refusal to let airlines repatriate earnings means that long-haul flights into the country have all but disappeared.\nThe picture is bleak, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from official sources. The government has long since stopped releasing figures on everything from inflation to growth to the budget deficit.\nA few days ago, I spoke about this with Asdr\u00fabal Oliveros, one of the country\u2019s most widely cited local economists. Oliveros heads Ecoanal\u00edtica, a firm that provides consulting services to foreign banks as well as Venezuelan companies. His office, ironically enough, is located next to the headquarters of the national tax collection agency. When I point out the coincidence, Oliveros laughs.\n\u201cAn economist in Venezuela is like a detective. You have to be technically solid, of course, but the dearth of public information means you also have to be creative,\u201d he says.\nAccording to his estimates, inflation in the past 12 months is already up to 128 percent. The budget deficit is roughly 20 percent of GDP, and the balance of payments has a deficit of $17 billion. The Economist forecasts that GDP will contract by 4.2 percent this year. Oliveros thinks that is conservative.\nIn order to come up with his numbers, Oliveros relies on a web of contacts \u2013 colleagues, former classmates, and the businesspeople he advises all provide clues about what\u2019s really happening.\nVenezuelans are used to macroeconomic chaos, but the combination of a deep recession with the highest inflation rate in the world (not to mention Venezuelan history) is new.\nPerhaps more importantly, prices have largely stopped signaling what things are worth. This is a country where a dollar may cost very little or very much, depending on whom you know. A kilogram of grapes (price not regulated) costs ten times more than a kilo of price-controlled beef. The grapes are practically unaffordable, and the beef has disappeared from store shelves.\nI wonder \u2013 does Venezuela\u2019s private sector have what it takes to survive, and thrive when the tide turns? He sounds cautiously optimistic.\nOliveros frequently travels to San Crist\u00f3bal, a city of 600,000 people in the western edge of the country, bordering Colombia. Last year, the city was the epicenter of student protests that were violently repressed. Since then, the city has suffered acutely from shortages of basic staples. Price controls mean everything from gasoline to milk is smuggled to neighboring Colombia, where they fetch market prices. This leaves the city starved."}

{"idx": "5595", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: For two years, the Department of Veterans Affairs repeatedly bragged about how it was chipping away at the backlog of disability claims from veterans. The agency said it was nearing its goal of eliminating the backlog by the end of 2015.\nWhen the calendar turned, though, about 70,000 cases remained backlogged. The VA was quiet about that, but Congress made sure that missed goal didn't go unnoticed.\nThe House Veterans Affairs Committee called a hearing last week to question agency officials about it.\nThe accuracy of the VA's data was challenged, too, and questions were raised about whether shifting resources to process disability claims harmed veterans elsewhere in the VA system.\nFor the first time I'm aware of, the VA publicly acknowledged it likely never will eliminate backlogged claims, those that have been pending for more than 125 days.\nNot all claims can be processed accurately in that time, Beth McCoy, deputy undersecretary at the Veterans Benefits Administration, testified at the Jan. 12 hearing.\n\"We won't do that just for the sake of hitting a number,\" McCoy said. \"We want to make sure that every veteran gets every benefit they are entitled to.\"\nShe's right that the VA shouldn't rush through cases to meet an arbitrary deadline. That's how mistakes get made, at the expense of veterans who might not get what they earned and taxpayers who pay for any excessive benefits that are granted.\nBut if the VA knew all along that some claims couldn't be resolved within 125 days, it shouldn't have misled veterans and taxpayers into believing that was a possibility.\nIn the government's world, 125 days is not a long time. But there's also no excuse for the VA to take a year or more. I wrote last year about an Army veteran from Allentown who was told it would take 14 to 19 months for his claim to be resolved.\nMcCoy testified that claims from veterans living in other countries, from those who can't get to medical exams and those who were exposed to radiation, for example, can take longer. She said the average claim had 4.6 health issues to be considered in 2015, up from 2.8 in 2006.\n\"We're doing more work for a claim than we did in the past,\" McCoy said.\nWhile the VA didn't hit its goal of eliminating the backlog, it made significant progress. In March 2013, about 611,000 claims were backlogged. Reducing that to about 70,000 claims is an accomplishment.\nThe agency can't get lazy, though, and allow that number to grow again. And it must make sure keeping that number low doesn't come at the expense of other veterans waiting longer for decisions on other types of claims, such as pensions and spousal benefits. I've written plenty about VA delays in resolving those types of cases, too, which usually aren't as complex.\nRep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, questioned whether the backlog figure even tells the true story. Miller, a Republican from Florida, said 433,000 appeals of claims decisions were pending Jan. 1, up from 250,000 pending appeals in April 2013. But those cases were not included in the backlog data, he said, adding the VA is misleading the public about the progress it is making.\n\"The inference to the American"}

Who in their life hasn\u2019t come across a Billy or Frakta? Most years, the dependable big blue box giant doesn\u2019t make particularly splashy headlines. But 2018 was different, filled with signs, both stark and hopeful, of larger shifts in what consumers want, and how they\u2019d like to shop.\nThe numbers, after all, indicate Ikea is due to reevaluate the direction of its business. Between 2017 and 2018, the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer saw a nearly 40% drop in profits, and just last month, announced it\u2019d be restructuring and cutting 7,500 jobs in the process. In September, Marcus Engman, Ikea\u2019s mediagenic head of design for more than six years, abruptly exited the post to start his own consultancy\u2014but not without first trying a string of bold and wacky attempts at reinventing the company\u2019s product strategy and public image.\nThe story of Ikea in 2018, in many ways, is the story of big-box retail, now perpetually in crisis and set at odds with the swift rise and current dominance of online retail (hello, Amazon). Across industries, traditional department stores have struggled to maintain a foothold in the market: This year alone has seen the retail apocalypse take a hold of Sears and Toys R Us, as both companies shuttered their U.S. stores and filed for bankruptcy. Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, and Walmart, meanwhile, have seen significant declines in the recent years. Yet hope is not lost. Many retailers have found ways to survive and thrive. And Ikea seems to be taking a page from their notebook.\nRead on for our big takeaways from Ikea\u2019s rollercoaster of a year that, need we remind you, kicked off with a bizarre print ad that doubled as a pregnancy test asking users to pee on it.\nGone are the days of making a day-trip out of the city and to the big box store, with plans to get everything in a one-shop stop, Swedish meatballs and hot dog lunch included. The outdated draw of big-box convenience has been trumped by the speed and ease of online shopping, and the retail game has gotten more competitive as a result. Enter the rise of experiential retail and concept pop-up stores by lifestyle startups like Floyd, Glossier, Everlane, or Burrow, that aim to be more than just a place to look at things you\u2019ll buy. Even Amazon has taken note, with the launch of small pop-ups like the \u201cAmazon 4-Star\u201d store in Manhattan, which carries a cross-section of goods that have been rated favorably online by shoppers.

However, the boxing was secondary to the surprising rise of a coalition -- the so-called \"Gutless Four\" -- that changed the competition into a pale imitation of executive producer Mark Burnett's Survivor, while the show once again served up an unsatisfying edit of the actual boxing that is supposedly central to the show.\nThe ninth episode opened with the seven remaining contestants voting to bring back a previously defeated contestant into the second round -- a bizarre decision by the producers, since it had the effect of giving someone a \"bye\" into the quarterfinals. As shown in the show's eighth episode, Contender co-host Sylvester Stallone lobbied for the choice of Ahmed, despite the fact that other boxers such as Miguel Espino performed better in their first-round fights. Perhaps Stallone, a veteran of years in Hollywood, was seduced by Ahmed's pretty face.\nBecause of the hostile relationship between Ahmed and Ishe, a group of four contenders -- Jesse Brinkley, Peter Manfredo, Anthony Bonsante (who was afraid to fight Jimmy Lange in an earlier episode) and Joey Gilbert -- formed a secret coalition to vote for Ahmed, to the surprise of Ishe, Sergio and Alfonso.\nWhen the boxers returned to the loft, a confrontation played out between Ishe and Jesse. In two very different edits, the version shown on TV made Ishe look confrontational and almost out of control, while the less-edited version shown on the Contender web site showed Jesse as the instigator of the fracas ... and led Sergio, who appears to have a lot more wattage upstairs than most of the other contestants, to the conclusion that someone within the coalition was feeding false information to the other coalition members. At the time, Sergio's conclusion was ignored by an angry Jesse, who challenged Ishe to a fight on the spot and said that he wanted to fight Ishe that week.\nFor the quarterfinals, the East and West teams were eliminated, and the individual challenge winner for the week was given the right to either fight or to act as matchmaker. The challenge involved a three-stage medicine ball race, with four eliminated at the start, two eliminated at the second stage, and a final head-to-head showdown. The four survivors of stage one were Jesse, Joey, Sergio and Ishe. In stage two, Jesse won, with Ishe prevailing in a head-to-head battle with Joey for second place -- only to drop the medicine balls just as he was crossing the finish line, leading to Ishe's disqualification. Jesse easily defeated Joey in the final stage, giving him the power to set up the match between himself and Ishe that he had clamored for.\nHowever, Jesse earned the \"Gutless Four\" nickname for his coalition by choosing to match up Ishe and"}

Already, bond yields in India are up nearly 150 basis points from the post-demonetisation lows in 2016 (one basis point is one-hundredth of 1 per cent).\nThe bond market has reacted accordingly and at one point, yields on 10-year US government bonds had reached 2.9 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent at the beginning of December 2017.\nThe yields in the US are now down to 2.72 per cent.\nHistorically there is an inverse relationship between bond yields and equity prices and the current rally in global equities had been preceded by a period of record low yields in 2012 and early 2013.\nThis opened up a big gap between corporate earnings yields and risk-free"}

He is listening to Black Sabbath's Paranoid and freaking out on a toy guitar. \"That was my childhood ambition,\" he laughs. \"Still, to this day, if I could become a killer guitar player in a couple of years, I'd quit playing the piano and start learning now. I'd love to front a thrash metal band!\"\nThankfully, thrash metal's loss has been jazz's gain. At the age of 26, this tiny, impish Armenian-American is the hottest pianist in jazz, selling out arenas and earning fervent praise from the likes of Chick Corea, Brad Mehldau and Herbie Hancock (the latter declared: \"Tigran, you are my teacher now!\"). But Hamasyan isn't even sure if he makes jazz music. \"I suppose it's jazz in the sense that I'm improvising,\" he says. \"But the language I try to use when I'm improvising is not bebop but Armenian folk music.\"\nHamasyan has an omnivorous musical diet. He devours traditional songs from Armenia, Scandinavia and India, and has studied classical music to a high level (he has suggested a budding jazz pianist would be better off playing Bach or Chopin than studying bebop), while his iPod playlist is that of the twentysomething hipster \u2013 J Dilla, Flying Lotus, Radiohead, Sigur R\u00f3s, Skrillex and a heavy dose of thrash metal.\nBut the music he makes doesn't really sound like any of the above. We meet after he's played to a sold-out 2,000-seat theatre in Toulouse, where his 90-minute set lurches from delicate, impressionistic versions of eastern orthodox hymns to bursts of electronica; from Keith Jarrett-like meditations to full-on jazz-rock.\n\"I get into different types of music and really immerse myself in each one and then move on,\" he says. \"But I try to retain that intensity whenever I revisit any particular music.\" In the past 18 months alone he has collaborated with Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu, Tunisian oud player Dhafer Youssef, dubstep collective LV, oddball hip-hop producer Prefuse 73, along with fellow Armenian-American Serj Tankian from prog-metal outfit System of a Down.\nHamasyan was born in Gyumri, near Armenia's border with Turkey. Neither of his parents were musicians (his father was a jeweller, his mother a clothes designer), and he grew up listening to his father's heavy rock collection \u2013 Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Queen. By three, he was picking out pop melodies on the family piano; from six he attended a specialist music school. \"We can be grateful to the old Soviet Union that we had classical education systems in place,\" he says. \"Everybody had a piano in their house, whether they were musicians or not.\" By the age of nine he began to immerse himself in jazz, and even guested as a singer with a local big band (\"I was this weird, talented kid who sang a couple of standards and a Beatles song, Oh Darling\").\nAs a young teenager, he moved on from bebop to experiment with Armenian folk music. \""}

The system, which involves an array of cameras to track shoppers\u2019 purchases alongside weight sensors on shelves, has been rolling out this year to smaller convenience stores across the U.S. in markets including Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and soon New York.\nThe new report says Amazon is now trying out the same technology in a larger space in Seattle, where the ceilings are higher and there are more products to choose from \u2014 things that make the system more challenging to implement.\nThe obvious use case here would be for Amazon-owned Whole Foods, which Amazon has been leveraging to grow its own grocery pickup and delivery business in the U.S. The business challenges rival grocers, as well as Walmart and grocery delivery services like Target\u2019s Shipt, Instacart and others.\nIn particular, it could be difficult to get a cashierless system to work with items where the size, shape and weight varies \u2014 like fresh produce, WSJ notes. Whole Foods stores are also larger, as they\u2019re typically 40,000 sq. ft. and house some 34,000 items.\nBut if the system were perfected, it could allow Amazon to cut or repurpose store staff at Whole Foods, as well as get a better handle on inventory levels for its delivery business. One of the challenges with ordering groceries today from places like Instacart or Shipt is that the stock levels in the app don\u2019t match what\u2019s actually on store shelves. Longer-term, solutions like Amazon\u2019s Go technology could improve that.\nMeanwhile, a system for grocery shopping without waiting in a checkout line could save people time.\nWalmart is doing something to address this problem at Sam\u2019s Club stores, where its Scan-and-Go app lets customers skip the line. But it\u2019s still more labor-intensive than simply picking up items and placing them in a cart. Walmart also ended a test of Scan-and-Go that was taking place across its flagship stores earlier this year.

In particular, we analyze observations from aircraft in situ microphysical probes and airborne and ground-based radar to examine the relative importance of various microphysical processes and ultimately improve the representation of these processes in numerical models. To characterize the evolution of maturing thunderstorms, the University of Wyoming King Air sampled the tops of fresh turrets between -15\u2103 and 0\u2103 on four days in July and August. The microphysical properties of updraft cores from in situ airborne particle measurement probes are investigated. Information about the overall cloud structure that provides context for the interpretation of the detailed cloud microphysical measurements is provided by the Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR), an airborne W-band radar, and a ground based X-band radar operated by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. A novel algorithm for identifying the probability that a particle image from an optical array probe is spherical or ice using a Bayesian classification algorithm is also presented using the COPE data.\nFor a given temperature level, there was a wide variability in the observed liquid and ice crystal concentrations. Significant ice was observed on days where the warm rain process was active, consistent with studies suggesting that raindrops freezing into graupel embroyos as they ascend are critical to ice production in these clouds. In the clouds with graupel and raindrops greater than 1 mm in size present, the WCR reflectivity shows multiple turrets in the sampled clouds, suggesting an environment favorable for precipitation recycling into the updraft. The in situ observations and WCR radar reflectivity also suggest that differences in the amount of liquid water present compared to ice in the updraft core can also be influenced by the depth of the previously formed cloud layer encountered by the turret. The rapid increase in ice concentrations at temperatures from -5 to -8\u2103 suggests that secondary ice production processes are responsible for the ice concentrations observed. It is shown that greyscale capability for identifying out of focus particles as well as a 10 \u00b5m resolution is recommended for distinguishing between spherical and ice particles at sizes useful for identifying first ice initiation in convection."}

According to The New York Times, he was placed under FBI surveillance for a time, but the agency eventually closed its inquiry. There are reports that Mateen called 911 around the time of the assault and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, but no audio of the call has been released to the public.

At least 50 people died in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning after a gunman opened fire at a packed gay dance club. More than 50 others were injured, the victims overwhelmingly Latino and young, between 20 and\u2014in their twenties and thirties. Authorities identified the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, who used a semiautomatic weapon that would have been prohibited under the assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire more than a decade ago.

{"idx": "5642", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: TORONTO \u2013 \u2018Cloud seeding\u2019 is being credited with saving millions of dollars in hail damage in Calgary on Sunday night. But what is this technique, who uses it, and how do we know if it works?\nGlobalnews.ca explains the technology of cloud seeding.\nWhat is it? Cloud seeding is a type of weather modification that can enhance a cloud\u2019s ability to produce precipitation, according to American-based company Weather Modification Inc. Cloud seeding is used in three areas: trying to increase precipitation, disperse fog, and-most recently in the case of Calgary\u2019s storm Sunday evening-attempt to mitigate hail damage using an aircraft.\nHow does it work? In aerial cloud seeding to mitigate hail, planes fly into the cloud area and shoot silver iodide at the top and base of the clouds. Silver iodide is a \u201cseeding agent\u201d which has a chemical structure similar to that of ice and can help shrink the ice stones or induce the formation of ice.\nAerial cloud seeding is typically the most effective way to target a cloud since the aircraft gets as close as possible. Equipment includes burn-in-place flare racks or ejectable flare racks attached to the aircrafts. The operation can last for many hours-12 in the case of Calgary\u2019s hailstorm.\nEnvironment Canada senior climatologist Dave Phillips says the Calgary operation was carried out to produce hail closer to the size of peas rather than baseballs.\nAnother cloud seeding application is to cause rain, with the aim of encouraging precipitation in one location and avoiding another. In this situation, the basic principle is that the tiny water drops that form a cloud are too small to fall down to the ground on their own because of the rising air current. The cloud seeding technology can shoot crystals into the cloud (from the ground as well as from the air) so that the water drops coagulate and become bigger drops. Bigger drops are heavier and the rising air current won\u2019t be able to support their weight; therefore they fall as rain.\nHow much does it cost? Weather Modification Inc., the company responsible for cloud seeding during Calgary\u2019s recent storm, says the project cost depends on factors such as target area size, season, needed equipment and length of desired project period. Dr. Terry Krauss, project director of the Alberta Severe Weather Management Society, says their budget was $2.5 million for this year. These funds come from the private insurance companies of Alberta through a program designed to reduce property damage. Krauss adds the previous record hail storm in Calgary was July 12, 2010 when damages exceeded $400 million.\n\u201cThe economics are what is driving the program and if we happen to reduce the hail on Sunday\u2019s storm by even 10 per cent, that could have saved $50 million and paid for the program 20 times over,\u201d said Krauss in a phone call to Globalnews.ca.\nWho does it? Fifteen-year-old American-based company Weather Modification Inc. was hired by the Alberta Severe Weather Management Society on Sunday (a society funded by a group of insurance companies with a goal of reducing hail damage claims).\nCloud seeding companies exist in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia. Asia is home to the largest cloud seeding systems in the world in the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWhere has it been used before? A notable previous use was at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing to ensure optimal weather during Opening and Closing Cer"}

There's a 2900mAh battery, charged via Micro-USB and a 3.5mm headphone socket for your headphones.\nThose core components mark this out as the affordable handset it is and in many ways help keep the price low.

Witnesses or anyone else with information about the vandalism is asked to contact the Eagle-Holy Cross Ranger District at 970-827-5715.\nDamaging or marking federal property is illegal, and can result in prosecution.\n\u201cThe rules are in place to protect this public treasure, but if people can\u2019t follow them, I have a responsibility to the greater public to tighten restrictions until the behavior is stopped,\u201d Mayville said.\nStaffing and capacity issues on the trail have kept the Forest Service from maintaining regular ranger patrols at Hanging Lake, and summer rangers will not be in place until late May.\n\u201cSpending money to clean up graffiti means I have less to spend on hiring summer rangers, and their patrol season will be shorter,\u201d Mayville said, adding it will cost about $3,000 in staff time to remove the graffiti.\nWarm spring weather has prompted a large volume of early-season visitors at Hanging Lake, and the usual peak season problems have already started.

Privacy fences not only reduce visibility into your yard but also reduce noise, provide security and act as a windbreak from coastal breezes. Ocotillo grows well in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 8 through 11 in full sun and sandy soil. It can be planted at any time of the year to leaf out and fill in your chain-link fence to create a private oasis.\nMeasure a square in your chain-link fence to determine the size of privacy slats you require. Place the tip of a measuring tape on the center inside of a side of the square and read the measurement where the opposite side of the square meets the measuring tape. Rotate the measuring tape 90 degrees and measure the distance between the opposite sides in the same manner. The most common mesh sizes are 2, 2 1/4, or 2 3/8 inches square.\nMeasure the height and length of your chain-link fence. Order fence slats in the same height as your fence and its mesh size.

{"idx": "5659", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The Power of non-Predictive Analytics!\nAnother incident happened recently when a client of ours was describing the need for Predictive Analytics training for his team and the kind of questions they are looking to answer. The client was from a gaming company and was looking for insights into their customer\u2019s behavior not very different from what Charles has described in the NYT article. Their online games have a fremium model, where most customers are playing for free and a small percentage of the customers pay to buy virtual merchandize within the gaming experience. He was in particular interested in understanding how the paying customers profile differed from non-paying customer. The intent was to influence the pay-to-play behavior. By the end of the meeting, I was very certain that his team needed hands-on Business Analytics (BA) training, however he was equally as certain that his team needed Predictive Analytics training.\nYou may wonder why the difference in opinion. The Analytics landscape is still in its formation state and hence the intent/meaning behind terminology is in flux. I have come to surmise that often when folks are talking about PA, they may mean BA. Here, in this article, I am going to describe these terms and their meaning as majority are using right now. These may be refined further in future as standardization hits the analytics world.\nProfiling: What do my customers look like? What kind of customer uses product A vs. product B?\nCorrelation: Was \u201cblue checkout button\u201d more successful in driving conversion than \u201cred checkout button\u201d?\nPortfolio Analysis: What is the product portfolio in terms of profit, margin, loss and what are the primary financials driving these product P&L metrics.\nTrend analysis: Is our revenue growth in Brazil slowing down? Which products are doing better in 2012 vs last year?\nForecasting: What annual revenue will we close the 2012 books with? How many customers would we have acquired by end of 2012? Forecasting does sound like Prediction in future, and thus Predictive Analytics. However I would classify, forecasting as Business Analytics when done using simpler technique like moving average and Predictive Analytics when using advanced techniques, in this case time series algorithm like seasonal ARIMA.\nIn general, Predictive Analytics is an extension of the understanding gained from backward business analytics to predict future events or behavior. And it is often employed to improve the accuracy of insights gained from business analytics.\nTake for example, a case from an ecommerce company, where we are trying to identify drivers of conversion with the hope to increase conversion. Referring the table above, past analysis of \"blue button\" and \"red button\" data gives us the insight that \"blue button\" has 2% higher conversion. This is a powerful insight as we can now get incremental revenue with the same number of starting visitors by using \u201cblue button\".\nA similar correlation analysis between 3-step checkouts vs. 2-step checkout gives us an understanding of relative success between these two versions. As you can imagine, there are many more variants towards successful conversion. And so to understand impact of each one of these variants, we need to understand the interaction between variants and its predictive power on the resultant.\nSo these attributes can be combined to understand predictive correlation between a variant (behavior or event) and conversion with the idea of being able to pull the predictive variant lever and influence the resultant conversion. In our conversion example, let\u2019s say we find the highest positive predictive correlation between visitors with Amex as their credit card and conversion.

For Clark Chow, that opportunity was turning old tires into a brand new product called StompStone, an environmentally friendly solution that can be used in patio and walkway construction. His insights into the value of turning a waste into a usable product are not unique either. There are several other young entrepreneurs in BC who are taking the green movement to heart and to the bank.\nStompStone is a product of Plascon Plastics, and was invented by Chow four years ago. His moment of inspiration came after finding out about a local tire stewardship program from Western Rubber where tires are recycled.\nFor a manufacturer like Plascon Plastics, making a good quality product that is also cost effective is key. What has been keeping them competitive in the market is using a waste stream that has little or no value to it. For Plascon Plastics, rubber is a dream come true. The rubber has decreased their cost of material so significantly that they are able increase production in BC all the while shipping to more distribution networks across North America.\nCommercial recycling is not limited to just industrial production either. Take Growing City, for example. Its goal is to bring urban composting to businesses in Vancouver. Growing City collects the organic waste from offices, apartment buildings, events and other spaces not set up to deal with organic waste. The waste is then turned into a valuable product, in partnership with Enviro-Smart Organics, when it is converted into compost and distributed to local communities.\nA significant amount of Metro Vancouver's waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors which are not set up to handle organic waste. By providing recycling services to this sector, Growing City has diverted more than a 130 tones of waste the equivalent of 340 metric tones of CO2 in the last two years.\nMaking compost is a science that requires a balance between the oxygen, carbon and nitrogen-rich materials and working with the right microorganisms. Von Sturmer mentioned that Growing City collects a lot of nitrogen-rich materials due to the majority of customers producing wet waste like coffee grinds and apple pits; thus some effort has to go into balancing out the materials. However, even with all that is known about composting, educating the public is still a major focus of Von Sturmer's business."}

Analysts believe adherents to the Shia faith in Egypt number between 500,000 and one million.\nWhile some critics blame the Salafist-oriented Nour Party for igniting anti-Shia sentiment, the party has rejected any suggestion of involvement.\n\"We have warned the regime about looming sectarian friction, amid acts of insulting and demonising the Sahabah [the companions of the Prophet Mohamed] which will shock the fabric of Egyptian society, but it paid no heed,\" party spokesman Nader Bakkar said via Twitter late on Sunday.\nDogmatic divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims include differences over the place of the Prophet Mohamed\u2019s companions with each side favouring some over others.\nBakkar said, however, that his party \"does not accept the shedding of Egyptians' blood and dragging them in such an appalling way.\"\nThe hardline group, as well as its ideological parent organisation the Salafist Call, has been largely blamed for the rising extremist rhetoric against Shia Muslims. Posters bearing the logo of both the Salafist Call and the Nour Party have recently appeared in a number of Egyptian cities demonising the sect and its followers.\nSalafist parliamentarians have also expressed misgivings over the restoration of diplomatic ties with Shia-majority Iran, and plans to encourage Iranian tourists to visit Egypt. One MP in May went as far as branding Shiites \"more dangerous than naked women\" and a threat to national security.\nThe Salafist Call, however, dismissed on Monday attempts to link it to the incident, asserting its precept severely condemning violence.\nMeanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood was also quick in denouncing the killing.\n\"Bloodletting of"}

Team officials have begun interviews, according to a source, but are not publicly acknowledging the names of the candidates.\nMets general manager Sandy Alderson told The Post earlier this week he expects to interview a \u201chalf-dozen or so\u201d individuals for the vacancy. Robin Ventura, Joe McEwing, Kevin Long, Bob Geren, Chip Hale and Sandy Alomar Jr. are among the other known potential candidates.\nFarrell likely will not be considered for the Mets\u2019 opening, according to a source.

Though the Mets expect Girardi back with the Yankees, team officials are keeping surveillance on the situation in the event Girardi\u2019s decade-long tenure in the Bronx concludes. Alderson, according to a source, would be open to the idea of Girardi, who fits the GM\u2019s criteria of presenting strong leadership skills.\nAusmus, a Cheshire, Conn., native was fired as Tigers manager last month after four seasons in the position. The Tigers finished 64-98 in 2017 for a third straight season removed from the playoffs.\nAusmus could be the favorite in Boston because of his ties to the team\u2019s president of baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski, who hired Ausmus with the Tigers.\nBut Cora\u2019s name has also been floated in Boston as a potential replacement for Farrell. Cora, the Astros bench coach, could also be a candidate for the openings in Detroit and Philadelphia.\nLong, currently the Mets hitting coach, is highly regarded within the organization for his communication skills and the relationships he\u2019s built in the clubhouse. Though Long has never managed above the Single-A level, team officials see him as capable of making the leap.\nGeren spent four seasons as the Mets bench coach before spending the last two seasons in the same capacity with the Dodgers.

Her son, Boolie, (Aaron Johnson) hires his mother a chauffeur named Hoke (Clarence Cryer) after she gets into one too many accidents in the family car.\nIf the play was just about the relationship between Hoke and Miss Daisy, the production would be satisfying, co-director Sharon DeCoux said.\nBut because Uhry sprinkles in major historical moments \u2013 mostly revolving around the Civil Rights movement and covers the years between 1948 and 1973 \u2013 \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d is much more than just a simple story about two people making a connection.\nDuring one critical moment of the play, Daisy attends a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2013 and leaves Hoke with the car.\nCryer, who was born in Louisiana but grew up in Miami, said he drew inspiration for Hoke from the older African-American men he encountered in his youth.\nCryer\u2019s starring role in \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d marks the first time he\u2019s been on stage since college, he said.\nWhat attracted Morse to the part of Daisy was the character\u2019s ability to change, despite her controlling nature.\nMorse thinks the key theme of the play is nature vs. nurture, she said.\nSo why should people come out to the production?

Whether it\u2019s because of the hills, the cold or the bizarre mixed form of precipitation that we have to walk through on the way to class, perhaps these complaints are warranted.\nWe often can get caught up in the complaining, rather than working together constructively to improve the community around us. In a world of prelims, papers, projects and never ceasing deadlines, who actually has time to care? It\u2019s hard enough to truly be an active citizen within the Cornell bubble, let alone to venture outside of it. I understand that we are all busy, and none of us have lots of time to spare, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try to do our best.\nThis is a call to action, because during our time on the Hill, we affect others in the community more than we realize. And they make an impact on our lives, too. I\u2019m not here to tell you what to believe about Cornell, the institution or students\u2019 relationships with the community. What I can advocate for is that we all should attempt to contribute.\nJust as much as students hate living in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d or lament the existence of \u201ctownies,\u201d the locals should be frustrated with us, too. We trash the streets of Collegetown, raise the price of rent and carelessly demand chain businesses that drive out local companies. We argue that our freshmen deserve free TCAT passes but often forget that many of the thousands of Cornell\u2019s employees, who simply can\u2019t afford to live in Ithaca, commute by TCAT every day. Who is to say that the next time Cornell finds itself in a deficit that these people won\u2019t lose their way to work, to our benefit?\nSmall efforts, such as the Be Engaged and Responsible Walk (also known as the BEaR Walk) hosted by Cornell administrators and city officials this past August, attempt to reconcile the broken relationship that exists between students and residents. Efforts such as this one can never be successful until we all start being better neighbors and caring about how we affect the people around us. Knocking on doors and meeting our neighbors may cause positive behavioral changes for the relatively few students who choose to participate. The problem is that so few people care enough to make that initial step.\nThat is not to say the relationships are all bad. Seventeen percent of students from the Class of 2013 remained in Tompkins county after graduation, according to the Economic Impact Report released by the Office of Budget and Planning earlier this year. As Graduate-Professional Student-Elected Trustee Annie O\u2019Toole grad eloquently stated in her column last week, Cornell has a huge, and largely positive, economic impact in the region. Cornell\u2019s vision as a land-grant institution reaches far beyond economics, though: According to the Cooperative Extension website, over 170 faculty collaborate with 500 local educators to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers, and people across the globe. One quick Google search could show you that Ithaca is one of the top 10 smartest, most walkable or \u2014 simply put \u2014 best college towns in the country. The point I am making here is not that we should disregard all of these positive aspects of Cornell\u2019s symbiotic relationship with Ithaca. Rather, I am asking that as students we take time out of our hectic lives to ask ourselves: What can we do to make the community better?\nOn a daily basis, we can be better neighbors.

The latest batch of economic data also was published today, showing that there were more job openings \u2014 and more people actually hired \u2014 in December than in any single month for several years.\nThere were just over 5 million job openings on the last business day of 2014 (after adjusting for seasonal variations), according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (known as JOLTS), which is produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While that was little changed from November\u2019s level, it was the highest figure since January 2001, just before the dot-com bust. While job openings have been increasing since the latter part of 2009, the pace accelerated markedly last year.\nEmployers hired more than 5.1 million people in December, according to the JOLTS report \u2014 again, little changed from November, but the strongest monthly showing since late 2007. Over the full year, hiring increased particularly strongly in the construction and finance/insurance industries \u2014 both of which had been hit especially hard by the housing bubble\u2019s collapse.\nThe number of people quitting their jobs also has been rising. Economists generally look at that as a good thing, since people generally don\u2019t quit unless they think they get a better job someplace else. Quits plunged in 2008-2009, as involuntary layoffs and discharges surged. While quit levels have risen since then, they\u2019re still lower than they were before both the Great Recession and the dot-com downturn (when it sometimes seemed as if everyone were leaving to seek start-up gold).\nThe JOLTS data tell much the same story as last week\u2019s employment report, which showed employers adding a seasonally adjusted 257,000 payroll jobs last month and hundreds of thousands of people streaming back into the labor force in search of work.\nThat growing optimism is reflected in the latest Pew Research survey, conducted last week. More people now say they\u2019re hearing mostly good news about the jobs picture (28%) than bad news (22%) \u2013 the first time that\u2019s been the case since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. A year ago, just 12% said they were hearing mostly good jobs news, versus 42% who said they were hearing mostly bad news. And in a separate poll conducted last month, 27% of Americans rated economic conditions as excellent or good, up from 21% in October 2014; over that same timeframe, the share of the public rating economic conditions as poor fell from 33% to 24%."}

Not on its own. Not in a headline. Not based on what we know. And not based on what those who are behind the story say.\nButler, it appears, was a cunning predator early in his career. He is a powerhouse youth volleyball coach in Chicago\u2019s suburbs, accused of sexually assaulting several of his pupils decades ago. He\u2019s recently been banned by the Amateur Athletic Union, USA volleyball, etc., and faces a class-action lawsuit for deceiving players and parents into joining his revered Sports Performance volleyball club. He denies wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime, though the statue of limitations had expired when his accusers first came forward in 1995.\nButler might be a monster. He is not MSU\u2019s monster, however.\nHis ties to MSU volleyball coach Cathy George appear no stronger than his ties to several coaches elsewhere. That doesn\u2019t absolve George from not speaking up if she knew anything, or from seeking the truth or setting an example. The shame in the Rick Butler story, beyond Butler, rests with many in the volleyball community.\nMSU is singled out prominently \u2014 though not named \u2014 in the lawsuit against Butler filed in late February for having a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with him, including George serving as one of Butler\u2019s coaches at Sports Performance in the mid-1980s.\nGeorge didn\u2019t respond to a text message seeking an interview. An MSU spokesperson said Wednesday that interim President John Engler\u2019s statement Tuesday would stand for George and the university. That statement, while striking a sympathetic tone, did not address the claims in the lawsuit.\nMSU wasn\u2019t mentioned by accident. This is the influence of the Nassar case, the product of a crumbling reputation, of being associated first and foremost with sexual abuse.\nThat might turn out to be indisputable. But if you read Tuesday\u2019s AP story, you\u2019d get the impression MSU was the chief enabler. Sarah Powers-Barnhard, among the first of Butler\u2019s victims to come forward, told the AP that MSU \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to Butler\u2019s history.\nPowers-Barnhard will also tell you, if you ask, that the coaches at Nebraska and Minnesota were at least as connected to Butler as MSU's George was.

Remember, you can visit both the Brooklyn Mine and today\u2019s places in a single trip, so for driving directions contact me through the Courier\u2019s senior editor, Tim Wiederaenders (use Subject: Brooklyn Rim).\nOriginally Published: October 13, 2018 8:49 p.m.\nBefore I describe today\u2019s visit, here is an update on the Brooklyn Mine I described last article. I asked readers to give me more info on this mine because my research hadn\u2019t found much. Three readers were very helpful. Cal Cordes, whose recent ancestors ran the sheep station at Cordes, told me about his visit to the mine in 1936 when he was 10. Mike Spencer and Tom Blake really know their way around the Web and have shared all sorts of info about the mine. I\u2019ll give you updates later. In future, any reader who has info to share on an Amazing Place, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.\nThere are scores of Indian ruins and hundreds of petroglyphs in the area of the Agua Fria National Monument (AFNM). It\u2019s worth repeating that the heyday for these Indians was the period between 1250 and 1450 AD (CE) \u2013 why they left isn\u2019t fully understood but probably an extended drought. Because the AFNM area is isolated, some of the ruins have been looted, and some of the petroglyphs have even been cut from the cliffs where they were carved centuries ago. People who do this are criminals and have no respect for history \u2013 shame on them! Fortunately, there are many ruins and petroglyphs that can be visited and enjoyed.\nWe\u2019ll begin by going to some pueblo ruins. The first photo shows a room inside one of the pueblos. The roof is long gone but this wall is still intact, neatly constructed from the local rocks \u2013 some colored sandstone, some black basalt (volcanic rock). Originally the wall was probably higher; the floor of the room has filled up a little with dirt blown in over the centuries, and the top of the wall may have crumbled. Along the Brooklyn Rim there are four small pueblos in a line, about \u00bd mile between ruin 1 and ruin 4 \u2013 the aerial map in the driving directions shows each pueblo was different in size (ruin 3 is the largest and best). Perhaps each pueblo housed various generations of a different family. This line of pueblos runs pretty much from north to south along the flat mesa, about 50 feet west of the rim. The rim is a volcanic cliff, whose height varies from 10 to 30 feet, sheer in most places. Below the base of the cliff, the ground slopes down into the basin, 150 feet below, where there is a small creek (and also the Mine). If you explore inside the ruins of these pueblos, don\u2019t climb on the fragile walls. If you see any pottery sherds, don\u2019t touch them or take them \u2013 leave them in place for future archaeologists.\nThe second photo shows one of the many petroglyph panels that extend for about \u00bc mile below the rim. Reaching these petroglyphs could be a challenge unless you are fit and don\u2019t mind scrambling down a gap in the cliff. Once you get to the foot of the cliff, there\u2019s a rough path that other explorers have made for viewing the petroglyphs. In"}

The image was taken on 30 April 2014 by the OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera.\nFar out in space, near the orbit of Jupiter, a European spacecraft named Rosetta is chasing a comet that has recently developed an ethereal veil.\nNew images from Rosetta show that an 800-mile-long (1,300 kilometers) cloud of dust, known as a coma, has sprouted from the core of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta's scientific imaging system, OSIRIS, captured this coma in a series of photos that were taken between March 27 and May 4 and released by the European Space Agency today (May 15).\nOn April 30th, the comet\u2019s coma extended over 1300 km from the nucleus. For the close up view on the right, a long sequence of images (each with a 10 minute exposure) was taken and stacked. The left panel shows the comet against the star field, covering the same area as figure 1.\nRosetta is still 1.2 million miles (2 million km) away from the comet. But in just a few months, the spacecraft will be inside 67P's dusty cloud, accompanying the icy wanderer on an unprecedented journey to the inner reaches of the solar system.\nThe new photos from Rosetta also allowed scientists to refine their estimates of the comet's rotational period: 67P spins around once every 12.4 hours, approximately 20 minutes less than previously thought, the team discovered by tracking changes in the comet's brightness.\nThe 6,600-lb. (3,000 kilograms) Rosetta spacecraft is set to arrive at the comet in August. The probe looks like an aluminum box, measuring about 9 by 6.8 by 6.5 feet (2.8 by 2.1 by 2 m) with long solar panels that span 105 feet (32 m). The spacecraft is also carrying a robotic lander named Philae, which will be the first spacecraft to touch down on a comet if its November deployment goes as planned.\nRosetta's upcoming rendezvous with the comet is more than a decade in the making. The $1.4 billion spacecraft launched in March 2004, but it couldn't take a direct flight to 67P. Instead, the probe was steered through a complex series of gravitational slingshots around Earth and Mars to catch up to the 2.5-mile-wide (4 km) comet. Rosetta was put into a deep sleep in July 2011 for the final and longest leg of its journey and was finally jolted awake in January 2014."}
{"idx": "5692", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The NVIDIA Shield Products which use the NVIDIA Grid gaming service will hit 40 free games this month and these are fast becoming my favorite mobile entertainment product. They not only will have 40 of the top games, streamed for free, but like all Android tablets they\u2019ll run Netflix, Amazon Prime, the new Sling OTA service from Dish, and a variety of streaming music services including my favorite, Slacker.\nIf you carry a Shield Tablet and an HDMI cable that will work with it (one end has to have a Micro HDMI plug) you can then plug it into TVs and with your Shield controller you have a pretty decent traveling game system/set top box for movies and TV. If you have a Sling box at home or a TiVo you can even stream your home TV programs to your tablet.\nAs a result the Shield Tablet may be the best mobile set top box on the market.\nI was traveling with a FireTV for a while just to see if I could get a great experience. Problem is that in many hotels you can\u2019t get access to the TV HDMI ports and, as a result, the typical set top box is largely useless on the road. In addition on a plane or in a car there really isn\u2019t a provision for a set top box, yes you could likely wire it into some cars with a DVD player but the screen often goes blank when you start driving and you still have to have some kind of a network connection.\nAs a result I quickly found that my Kindle HD was far more useful. No it didn\u2019t have the Amazon FireTV voice command feature which I have to admit is really handy when you are searching for something to watch but I could use the Tablet to watch programs even if there was no TV or I couldn\u2019t get access to the TV\u2019s HDMI port.\nSo while I still use my FireTV on the TV at home I started using my tablet a lot more when I travel.\nNow the difference between the two products is that the Kindle provides a better shopping experience but the Shield Tablet has access to 40 top level games for free and when you are traveling games are more important than shopping. However you do need to be able to stream the games and some hotels have started throttling HD content making gaming and HD moving watching a bit painful. The work around is to either get the tablet with the data plan option enabled, which isn\u2019t a cheap date, or use a personal 3G access point (which is what I\u2019ve been doing).\nOn planes I tend to just download movies to watch the day before the trip and I just play the Android games resident on the tablet. So while the Shield Tablet does, and will, have an edge with the 40 free gaming titles if you are hoping to game in most hotels or planes you\u2019ll still likely fall back onto the same game selections the Kindle shares.\nSo the Shield tablet is better than the smaller Kindle tablet but not as much as it would be if planes had access to high bandwidth Wi-Fi. There is no large screen Shield Tablet yet.\nIn the end though I think the Shield tablet points the way to the future when most all of our content will be available on our mobile device which we\u2019ll plug into TV screens, monitors, mice, and keyboards in order to get a richer experience. Kind of like a Super Set Top box but one that can work without a TV when needed and fully become the perfect traveling companion.\nThe NVIDIA Grid system that backs up the Shield family of products is still in its infancy which suggests that as it advances to its final configuration increasingly you simply may not need to carry anything but your tablet in"}

Everything is screwed up because I work nights,\" she said. \"But the money is so good that I'm willing to compromise.\"\nThese Indian \"customer relations executives\" (CREs) are part of an outsourcing industry expected to employ more than one million people and account for $25 billion in exports by 2008.\nThey may well force a tradition-bound country to rethink its age-old social mores.\n\"In this age of globalization, where young women step out of homes to work at night, the attitude of Indian society will have to change,\" said sociologist Myrtle Barse. \"Otherwise, it will lead to plenty of conflict between the generations.\"\nThe change has already fueled a conflict half-way across the globe. After a U.S. political backlash, it has become a prominent issue in the presidential campaign.

{"idx": "5695", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: A central rationale for President Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in 2016 was his appeal to working-class white voters, particularly in Rust Belt states where he promised to resurrect the sagging manufacturing economy. Trump\u2019s win was often attributed to his ability to speak to the economic insecurity about which those voters were concerned.\nOver time, that explanation seemed less compelling as people noted, among other things, that voters who said they were primarily worried about the economy overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. Clinton voters were also more likely to report being economically distressed, including solely among whites.\nBut still that association with working-class white voters persisted, in part, because Trump\u2019s support from those voters was so robust. If it wasn\u2019t about the economy, what was it about?\nNew data from Gallup offers a fairly simple explanation: It was a continuation of a steady trend among whites without a college degree toward the Republican Party.\nTwenty years ago, working-class whites were about as likely to identify as Democrats as Republicans, while college-educated whites were much more likely to identify as Republicans. The two groups moved mostly in tandem for the next few years, according to Gallup, until 2006. That year, a year when Democrats regained the House, both college-educated and non-college-educated white voters were slightly more Democratic than Republican.\nSince then, though, and particularly since shortly after the 2010 midterms \u2014 during which the Republicans romped \u2014 the groups have diverged significantly.\nIn 2016, college-educated white voters were about split between the two parties. Since, they\u2019ve grown much more Democratic, in part thanks to quickly eroding support for Republicans among white college-educated women. White working-class voters have gotten steadily more Republican since 2006.\nThe Gallup data deals with party identification, but the same pattern shows up in actual voting, too. Exit poll data shows a similar split among whites starting about 10 years ago and widening quickly in recent years. Nonwhite voters, both with and without a college education, continue to vote heavily Democratic.\nThere\u2019s another dimension to this that\u2019s worth pointing out. Over time, the density of the electorate that consists of whites without a college degree has dropped, from two-thirds of the electorate in 1980 to about 40 percent in 2018, according to exit polls. The density of the nonwhite vote has grown from about 10 percent in 1980 to 30 percent last year.\nThat means, overlaying those numbers onto our party-split graphic, that groups who vote more heavily Democratic are making up more of the electorate in recent years, offsetting the strong Republican support from whites without a college degree.\nExit polls are election-specific, of course, as the shifts from, say, 2008 to 2010 make clear.\nBut the point Gallup is making is an important one: The white working-class base Trump enjoyed was already growing increasingly Republican. Maybe he turned more of that base out, but it\u2019s not the case that he was uniquely positioned to benefit from their support. It\u2019s probably not the case, then, that his positions on the economy are what spurred such heavy support from those voters.\nThey were largely poised to support the Republican 2016 candidate anyway."}

The other set will tie the module into the station's Russian command-and-control computer system.\nThis will be he 147th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the 11th so far this year, the fourth overall for Yurchikhin and the first for Kornienko. Both cosmonauts will be wearing Russian spacesuits.\nThe spacewalkers plan to open the hatch of the Pirs module around 11:45 p.m. EDT to officially kick off the excursion. The first item on the agenda is replacing a camera used by the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle, or ATV, during final approach to the Zvezda module's aft port.\n\"The ATV is an unmanned spacecraft that brings supplies to the station, and the video camera is used to monitor the approach as it comes in and docks on the aft-end of the Zvezda module,\" said Chris Edelen, NASA\u2019s lead spacewalk flight controller. \"The video camera currently on-orbit has numerous bad pixels, resulting in degraded picture quality.

Four electrical cables, part of the Russian command-and-control system, will be plugged in and routed to the forward Zarya module. From there, the cables will be connected to the new Rassvet module attached to Zarya's Earth-facing port.\n\"First, a cable bundle will be run from the Zvezda and Zarya modules to connect the Rassvet to the Russian command and data handling computers,\" Edelen said. \"Then, a second set of cables will be run from Rassvet to Zarya to provide full functionality of the KURS docking system to allow automated vehicle dockings of Progress and Soyuz spacecraft to the docking port at the bottom of the Rassvet module.\"\nAt the end of the spacewalk, Kornienko and Yurchikhin will move back to Pirs and jettison the old camera, releasing it in the opposite direction of the station's travel. Edelen said the camera is expected to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up in about four months.\n\"It will not be brought back inside the station due to concerns the insulation around the camera has degraded in the space environment and could result in fiberglass particles being shed inside the station resulting in a breathing hazard for the crew,\" Edelen said. \"So at the end of the EVA, we will jettison the old ATV video camera.\""}

Now Trump is out there saying she\u2019s 100 percent correct. I\u2019ve actually read the book and I can tell you Abramson praises the Times at length. But let\u2019s dig into her anti-Trump claim.

At least that was what many perceived the manufacturing of paint to encompass. However, did you know that paint was in itself existent in the prehistoric period?\nFar from the notion that it began being manufactured in the early 1900s, the paint did, in fact, exist as far back as two thousand years ago, it was predominantly common in the prehistoric ages, especially in places like the Indian continent, as well as the Egypt which is in Africa. At the time, paint was used in caves, and was often created by the infusion of soot, earth, ochre, animal blood and fatty oils just to paint the walls of the caves with symbols and animal inscriptions as well as signs to encircle the hieroglyphics alphabet which we can all agree has changed drastically over time.\nBut how does one transform paint into a subject of d\u00e9cor in their space? Textured finish paints. This type of paint adds dimension, vibrancy and gives an insight into your personal taste be it in the office or the home space. Textured paint was initially introduced by the Italians whose art was admired by many and in turn seen as unique. It was subsequently adopted by the Romans, who enhanced it by adding marble dust to give it a finer application over the coarser versions of paint that existed.\nToday, textured paints have become an increasingly common phenomenon among home owners as well as construction companies in the Kenyan sphere as they are looking for more affordable ways to beautify their spaces. This has in turn inspired and influenced the use of textured paints for interior and exterior d\u00e9cor purposes especially in the real estate market in Kenya.\nThat being said, which modern-day textured paints are increasingly becoming best suited for interior d\u00e9cor purposes? With the interior of a home, one would expect warm, inviting and smoothly textured paints which exist locally as well as with technical affiliation with international companies that work in liaison with local paint manufacturers.\nInternational paint manufacturers like San Marco from Italy and San Deco from Turkey partner with local paint manufacturers such as Basco Paints to create products that resemble traditional travertine marble and silky antique appeal. These finishes allow for use on both interior and exterior surfaces.\nSo, if you are looking for a paint to transform those surfaces that need to be inspiring and impressive, be it in the home space or the office space, you might want to consider textured paints.

If Mr. Diesel\u2019s prophecy doesn\u2019t come true, it won\u2019t necessarily be a matter of merit. Movies much worse than this lucky-number episode of an overachieving franchise \u2014 movies far less sure of their intentions, sincere in their themes or kind to their audiences \u2014 have snapped up statuettes. There will no doubt be better movies released in 2015, but \u201cFurious 7\u201d is an early favorite to win the prize for most picture.\nHere is a movie with room for not one but two ruthless supervillains: a snarling pit bull played by Jason Statham and a terrorist mastermind played by Djimon Hounsou. Mr. Statham participates in an early, glass-shattering smackdown with Dwayne Johnson and a climactic, asphalt-shattering donnybrook with Mr. Diesel. And that\u2019s not all. That is as far from all as Tokyo is from Abu Dhabi, or Azerbaijan from Los Angeles, to name just a few of the spots where this movie, kinetically directed by the horror master James Wan, pops its clutch and taps its brakes. Michelle Rodriguez, stunning in a red gown, takes on an all-female Emirati security detail. Mr. Johnson pops his arm out of a cast with the merest twitch of a biceps. Kurt Russell drinks a beer. Ludacris fiddles with a laptop. Paul Walker drives a minivan and trades kicks with Tony Jaa. And I haven\u2019t even really gotten to the cars yet. One of them is a Subaru.\nMotor vehicles are the whole point of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gestalt: the power they confer; the tribal loyalties they inspire; the whine of their engines and the squeal of their tires. From modest beginnings, the series has grown into a global juggernaut. The first installment, released in June 2001 \u2014 before the first Harry Potter movie; before the cinematic dawn of the Marvel Universe; before Tesla \u2014 was a souped-up hot-rod movie, rooted in the street-racing subculture of Southern California.\nAs the movies expanded and internationalized, and characters came and went, the ideal of an automotive misfit fraternity remained at the center of each story. Though Mr. Diesel faded away in early sequels, his Dom Toretto has been the anchor and the glue. With his mouth-full-of-ball-bearings line readings, his heroic trapezius and his infinitely sorrowful eyes, Dom serves as coach, guru and big brother for the rest of the furious speedsters.\nA lot of familiar faces are back for \u201cFurious 7.\u201d Dom\u2019s sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) has settled down with Brian (Mr. Walker).

That\u2019s a welcome development in a country whose last president spent months at a time without talking to the media or answering questions at public meetings.\nBut there are serious questions about whether AMLO\u2019s honeymoon will last beyond his first two years in office. Many fear that Mexico will pay a huge price for his outdated populist-nationalist policies.\nFirst, AMLO is spending much more than the country is likely to earn. He says that he will pay for his social programs with savings generated from eradicating corruption. Trouble is that, without new investments, that alone is not likely to be enough to balance the books.\nBesides, AMLO\u2019s decision to cut the salaries of well-paid public servants is triggering a stampede of talented government technocrats to the private sector. Often they are being replaced by less qualified activists of AMLO\u2019s party.\nLack of business confidence in AMLO\u2019s economic plan and some disastrous presidential decisions \u2014 such as scrapping a $13 billion project to modernize the Mexico City airport, which will cost the country more than $5 billion in losses to indemnify contractors \u2014 have already lowered Mexico\u2019s economic growth projections.\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 growth projection for the country from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent, citing an expected drop in investments. Citibanamex bank lowered its forecast even more, to a 1.4 percent growth rate this year.\nSecond, Mexico\u2019s economy may suffer a big blow if \u2014 as many expect \u2014 the U.S. economy slows down or enters into a recession in late 2020 or 2021. The United States is by far Mexico\u2019s biggest export market.\nIf the U.S. economy slows down, AMLO is likely to print more money to maintain his subsidies to the poor, rather than adopting IMF-recommended austerity measures. That would unleash inflation and start hurting people\u2019s pocketbooks.\nThird, it\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. Congress will approve President Trump\u2019s new NAFTA trade deal with Mexico. And AMLO\u2019s decision to roll back energy reforms that sought to attract foreign investments may further spook investors.\nFourth, AMLO\u2019s actions to dismantle recent education reforms, such as teacher evaluations conducted by autonomous institutions, and to give more power to radical leftist teachers\u2019 unions, will make Mexico lose competitiveness against China and other emerging countries.\nLast, AMLO has shown little interest in innovation. Mar\u00eda Elena Alvarez-Buylla, the newly appointed head of the government\u2019s science and technology agency, CONACYT, was quoted by the daily El Universal as saying that her model country for science and technology planning is Cuba.\nIn fact, Cuba is a technologically backward country that produced only nine international patents last year, compared with 161 by Chile and 91,000 by South Korea, according to the U.N.\u2019s World Intellectual Property Organization.\nSumming up, AMLO is right to focus on the poor. But unless he understands that without investments there is no growth, and that without growth there is no poverty reduction, Mexico is bound to go downhill two years from now \u2014 if not sooner."}

In addition, even ethical smaller banks aren\u2019t directly accountable to the public. L.A., along with other U.S. cities, is now considering another option: a public, city-owned bank that would keep money inside the community, and follow a socially and environmentally responsible charter.\nA public bank, they realized, could be designed to bar unethical business practices. It could also save the city money. Los Angeles, for example, paid private banks more than $100 million in fees in 2016. Instead of taking out loans for infrastructure projects from major banks, and sending fees and interest outside the city, a public bank could handle the city\u2019s needs itself. Public banks can be set up to hold government deposits and give loans to the government and work as a \u201cbanker\u2019s bank\u201d for smaller community banks; in another model, they can also be set up to take consumer deposits. The initial capitalization can come from a variety of sources, including long-term investments, bonds, and crowdfunding.\nIn the U.S., at the moment, only one public bank exists: The Bank of North Dakota. \u201cThe whole idea of the Bank of North Dakota, when it was set up in 1919, was to keep North Dakota money in North Dakota for North Dakotans,\u201d says Ellen Brown, an attorney and founder of the nonprofit Public Banking Institute. Her interest in the model was piqued after the 2008 financial crisis. As Wall Street banks collapsed and most state treasuries went into debt, the Bank of North Dakota grew assets and profits because the model, Brown says, is more efficient than traditional banking.\nSeveral cities are now considering the idea, driven in part by the same divestment movement at work in Los Angeles. Santa Fe, New Mexico, which began working on the concept earlier than most, completed a feasibility study in 2016. Washington, D.C. has money allocated in the 2018 budget for a feasibility study. Seattle and Portland are considering the idea. Oakland is beginning a feasibility study, and a grassroots group of advocates is raising money for a business plan, the next step in the process. San Francisco is also pursuing the idea. New Jersey\u2019s new governor talked about his support for a state public bank as he campaigned (a state bank would work in a similar way, and could also work in conjunction with city banks).\nIn California, marijuana legalization is providing another push for public banks. Other banks won\u2019t give dispensaries accounts because of discrepancies with federal law. \u201cThe whole situation is ridiculous,\u201d says Susan Harmon, an advocate with Friends of the Public Bank of Oakland. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.

As McConaughey eases into middle age, he appears ready to fully commit to being respected as an actor and not just eye candy.\nThere\u2019s no better example of that than his role as Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club, which puts us directly in the middle of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the mid-1980s.\nThe way McConaughey invokes fury, compassion, cockiness and humor \u2014 sometimes within the same scene \u2014 is the mark of a true actor.\nWoodroof was an electrician/rodeo cowboy who tended to live his personal life in as risky a manner as his professions would suggest. When we first meet him, it\u2019s clear that HIV has already taken hold of him, as he\u2019s visibly emaciated.\nAfter receiving the diagnosis, which he and his friends had previously equated with being gay, he sets out to try to find effective treatments, only to discover that almost none can be found in the U.S.\nThis discovery leads him on a quest to get medication wherever it can be found, even if that means smuggling it in from other countries. And he soon realizes that others in his predicament will pay good money for what he\u2019s bringing in, and thus the Dallas Buyers Club is born.\nThe film, directed by Jean-Marc Vallee and written by Craig Borten and Melissa Wallack, plays heavily on the juxtaposition between the good ol\u2019 boy culture Woodroof belonged to prior to his diagnosis and the mostly gay culture he finds himself immersed in post-HIV.\nWoodroof's transformation is sure to occur, but to the film\u2019s credit, it keeps those changes relatively subtle. Woodroof remains his irascible self throughout, even as he grows to accept those he had previously found detestable.\nWith a film called Dallas Buyers Club, you'd think there would be plenty of gratuitous shots of recognizable Dallas landmarks, but anyone looking for them will be sorely disappointed. The film was shot in New Orleans, and Vallee declines to even use establishing shots of the Dallas area. That decision comes off as funny when Woodroof later \"travels around the world\" courtesy of green screen shots.\nThe film can be a bit on the nose at times, and the main conflict between Woodroof and an FDA official hell bent on shutting down his not-quite-illegal operation never truly makes the grade. But it\u2019s Woodroof\u2019s evolving personal relationships with Rayon (Jared Leto), a drag queen who becomes his business partner, and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), with whom he has multiple encounters at the local hospital, that keep the story humming.\nMcConaughey\u2019s performance is riveting, and not just because he starved himself to fully fit the role. The way he invokes fury, compassion, cockiness and humor \u2014 sometimes within the same scene \u2014 is the mark of a true actor.\nLeto, making his first major appearance in six years, is equally as good. Rayon, despite physical appearances, is about as far from a gay caricature as you can get, all of which is due to Leto\u2019s"}

This herbal concoction is used both internally and topically for a plethora of health-promoting purposes. As the name would suggest, oil of oregano is extracted from the oregano herb, with the use of steam distillation. It is commonly sold in health food stores and usually found in dark, glass bottles. Oil of oregano can cause more harm than good if used indiscriminately.\nOil of oregano may have antioxidant properties, which help to scavenge and kill free radicals, preventing them from damaging cells and DNA. It also contains the active ingredient carvacrol, which may help reduce infections as effectively as traditional antibiotics and may also protect against drug-resistant bacteria, according to Georgetown University Medical Center researchers. The carvacrol and thyme found in oil of oregano may also exhibit anti-inflammatory, antiviral and liver-protecting properties.\nDue to oil of oregano's antiviral and antibacterial properties, some natural health practitioners recommend using it to stop a cold or flu from fully developing. They recommend taking a few drops under the tongue at the first sign of trouble; however, this recommendation is based on anecdotal rather than clinical evidence. Oil of oregano may also be added to hot water and inhaled, which may help open up your airways and clear your sinus; or you can add a couple drops to water and drink it to help ease a sore throat.\nAlthough oregano oil is generally recognized as safe, it is a potent medicinal herb, and you should consult with your health care practitioner before using it. Oil of oregano can cause a range of skin reactions when applied topically, and if used in its undiluted form, it can cause burning and redness even in those with the toughest of skin. When taken internally, it can cause gastrointestinal upset, and those with high blood pressure and heart conditions should avoid it. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are also advised to avoid oregano oil because there isn't sufficient data to indicate whether it's safe.\nSome people are allergic to oregano, and if you have an allergy to Lamiaceae family plants, such as basil, hyssop, lavender, marjoram, mint and sage, you should avoid using oil of oregano topically and internally. Also, most antibacterial agents don\u2019t discriminate between good bacteria and bad bacteria. Since oil of oregano has powerful bacteria-killing properties, using it long term may reduce the population of health-promoting bacteria in your gut. However, this is based on speculation, and no studies yet prove this theory.\nJ.J. Ashton is a registered holistic nutritionist. She has been writing since 2007, with work featured in various publications, and holds a B.A. in English.

Vega is among eight offensive starters the team needs to replace.\n\"This isn't the NFL where we can resign a free agent to a five-year contract and hold onto him,\" Albano said. \"We graduate seniors every single year, that is a fact of high school football at every high school in America.

Those radars can track aircraft, including drones, flying as high as 50,000 feet, according to army and air forces officers who\u2019ve previously worked along the border. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the press.\nSharif\u2019s Pakistan Muslim League-N party campaigned in the May general election, in part, on promises to use diplomacy to end the Pakistani Taliban insurgency and U.S. drone strikes. After Sharif assumed the prime minister\u2019s post in June, he publicly ordered the military to end its policy of \u201ccondemning drones in public while being complicit in them.\u201d He used his days in Washington on Oct. 21-24 to press for an end to the strikes.\nWhile members of his government condemned the Nov. 1 strike, Sharif himself has made no public comment.\nOn Thursday, the United States demonstrated that it intends to continue attacking terrorism suspects in Pakistan, using a drone to launch missiles at a seminary in a government-controlled district operated by the Haqqani Network, an Afghan militant insurgent group that\u2019s thought to have links to the Pakistani military.\nThe early morning strike in the Hangu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province was well outside the tribal areas where most U.S. drones are used. Three senior Haqqani network operatives were killed in what was only the second time since 2006 that drones have been used outside the \u201cair corridors\u201d established to contain them.\nIt seemed unlikely that Pakistan\u2019s military would have condoned Thursday\u2019s strike because the Haqqani network has worked with the military in the past. U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized the Pakistani military\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate for tolerating the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, which has regularly attacked U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\nIn his briefing Wednesday to the Pakistani Senate, Aziz didn\u2019t say whether the Obama administration\u2019s warnings on drone strikes extended to leaders of the Haqqani network.\nThe seminary is to the east of North Waziristan, and it\u2019s one of several in an area the Haqqani network has used since the 1980s, when it was part of the U.S.-backed forces fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\nPakistan has defended its relationship with the Haqqani network, saying the group has served as a go-between with the Pakistani Taliban and might prove useful in arranging peace talks with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban and the Afghan and U.S. governments.\nPakistan\u2019s military didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad declined to comment."}

There are realistically five, and maybe seven, drivers who could take home the title this season, and I\u2019m sure the NASCAR marketing people are loving it!\nPersonally, I\u2019d love to see Mark Martin win the championship that has eluded him for so long. Martin is one of the truly nice guys in the sport, a gentleman who races everybody clean.\nOver on the open-wheel side of the fence, the Andretti Green team announced what was pretty much a foregone conclusion, that it would be competing in the Indy Racing League in 2002. The three drivers will be Michael Andretti, Dario Franchitti, and Tony Kanaan, who is leaving Mo Nunn\u2019s team after a frustrating season of DNF (did not finish) results. This latest defection just about completes the turnaround from 1996, when Tony George took his ball (Indianapolis Motor Speedway) and went home, splitting big-time open-wheel racing in this country in two. In the early years of the split, Championship Auto Racing teams had big fields and lots of fans, while IRL languished with second-rate drivers, sparse fields, and small crowds. Now, after several years of mismanagement by CART, the shoe is on the other foot. The sad part is that the crowds are now lackluster for both series (with notable exceptions such as the Indy 500 for IRL and CART\u2019s Canadian venues). Most fans voted with their ticket dollars and went to NASCAR\u2019s Winston Cup, Busch, and Craftsman Truck races. CART, under the leadership of Chris Pook, is faced with the task of rebuilding the series. Reducing costs will enable some teams from feeder series like Formula Atlantic to step up to the Big League, and reduced sanctioning fees and self-promotion of events will keep CART\u2019s schedule filled, but it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle.\nHistory will be made at Indianapolis next weekend, when 21-year-old IRL driver Sarah Fisher will become the first woman to drive a contemporary Formula 1 car in over a decade. Fisher will take a demonstration run in a McLaren MP4-17 after Friday\u2019s practice session for the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis. It will be interesting to see how Fisher, with only oval track experience, handles the McLaren on the USGP road course. There\u2019s also the fact that she\u2019ll have a lot more power under her right foot than she is used to. For you trivia buffs, the last woman to drive an F1 car was Italian racer Giovana Amati, who never managed to qualify her Brabham for a race in 1992.\nAnother Italian, Lella Lombardi, scored half a championship point at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix.

He presented his idea to the company\u2019s top management, including head honcho Sergio Marchionne, and quickly received the proverbial nod of approval.

{"idx": "5745", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: At a recent candidate forum, Republican candidates for the state Legislature voiced opposition to Amendment 1, the Clean Missouri initiative.\nThe basis for their opposition was the requirement for an independent demographer to recommend district boundary adjustments to make races more competitive. In voicing their opposition, the Republican candidates misrepresented the appointment process, the demographer\u2019s power and the likely result of these changes.\nWhy is this reform even needed? The change is needed to make our state legislative representatives accountable to those who live in their districts. Currently, legislative districts are gerrymandered such that most state legislative elections are not competitive, meaning that one party always wins and wins by a substantial margin \u2013 in some districts it is the Democrat and some it is the Republican. In these situations, party primary elections determine the winner and it is easier for party bosses and special interests (including outside interests) to influence who the winning candidate will be while dedicating less effort and money than they would have to in a general election.\nThis is a system that may work well for the Democrat and Republican Party power brokers, for special interest lobbying groups and for incumbents who are more easily able to leverage this system to their advantage in elections; but, it is destructive to a democratic process aimed at electing persons who will place the interests of the people in their district above all others.\nAccording to Amendment 1 language, the state auditor does not select the state demographer as Republicans claimed. The auditor submits lists of qualified candidates to majority and minority legislative leaders who in agreement make the appointment or follow a bi-partisan process to make the selection. The demographer develops district maps to achieve equal populations with representative demographic makeups following existing geographic and political boundary lines in addition to constructing the districts to maximize party competitiveness to the extent \u201cpracticable.\u201d \u201cDistricts shall be designed in a manner that achieves both partisan fairness and, secondarily, competitiveness.\u201d This means that many districts will remain non-competitive because they accurately and fairly represent a political party\u2019s popular support in that area of the state."}

{"idx": "5747", "prompt": "Continue the following text: It shouldn't come as too much of a shock that many Americans aren't saving as much as they should be for their retirement; but the magnitude of the situation may be surprising.\nAccording to a recent report, the shortfall -- that is, the gap between what Americans have saved and what they should have in savings -- could be as high as $14 trillion. Here's how to play catch-up if you've fallen behind.\nIn a study conducted by the National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS), Americans' retirement shortfall is $14 trillion, based on the current balances of retirement accounts. Even when taking into account other assets such as pensions and non-retirement savings, the shortfall is still a staggering $11.1 trillion.\nWhen you include all net worth -- homes and other assets included -- there is still a $6.8 trillion shortfall. And even with the most generous estimate, there's a shortfall of about $28,000 for every American adult. In other words, the average American would need this much more in their retirement accounts just to be on track to have enough income to maintain a comfortable lifestyle throughout their retirement.\nIf you have a shortfall in your own retirement savings, my personal favorite way to remedy this is with an individual retirement arrangement, or IRA. And the reason I prefer this is that it lets you take an active role in your retirement planning.\nIRAs come in two main varieties: Traditional and Roth, and both can be excellent choices. Both account types allow for up to $5,500 in annual contributions, with an extra $1,000 if you're over 50. (Note: this is a total contribution limit. You can't open both a traditional and Roth account and put $5,500 into each one). In both account types, your money is allowed to grow and compound without having to worry about dividend or capital gains taxes each year.\nIRAs deliver strong returns over time.\nSpeaking of taxes, that's the big difference between the two types of IRAs. With a Traditional IRA, you might be able to deduct your contributions on your tax return each year depending on your income, and you'll pay taxes once you withdraw the money in retirement. This is known as a tax-deferred account.\nThe Roth IRA works in the opposite way. You can't deduct your contributions, but any qualified withdrawals will be tax free. The main difference is when you prefer to receive the tax benefit.\nOnce you open an IRA, you can invest in just about any stock, bond, or mutual funds. If you want to use your retirement savings to buy shares of Apple, Facebook, or any other companies you like, you can do it in an IRA. This is the number one reason to invest in an IRA -- it can deliver strong returns over time.\nEven though I thoroughly enjoy investing and the challenge of choosing my own stocks, I realize that not everyone does. Lots of people can think of no worse way to spend their time than by looking over their retirement investments - and that's OK.\nIf you're in this group and are facing a retirement shortfall, you may want to consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), or other employer-sponsored retirement plan. This way, you can simply have more money withheld, and let the funds in your plan do the work for you. If your employer is willing to match a certain amount of contributions, that amount should be the bare minimum you contribute. You are allowed to contribute more than your employer is willing to match, and in some cases, a lot more.\nIf your employer is"}

GMCs are the product of recombinant DNA technology \u2013 the technique of isolating a gene from one organism and inserting it into the DNA of another organism to impart novel characteristics.\nIts power, however, lies in the ability to transfer genetic information from unprecedented sources such as algae, bacteria and viruses to plants, or to move genes between sexually incompatible species.\nFor example, a crop can be engineered to produce its own pesticides, to have drought tolerance, to have elevated nutritional quality, or even to produce vaccines (\u2018pharming\u2019).\nProponents of GMCs argue, quite understandably, that this technology has a potential to increase food production, reduce the use of synthetic pesticides, and actually make foods safer and healthier.\nIndeed, there are a number of constraints in our agricultural productivity imposed by biotic stress from plant diseases, insects and weeds.\nTransgenic herbicide-resistant and insect-resistant crops are specifically designed to target these constraints.\nThe proponents point to the adoption of transgenic insect-resistant maize and herbicide-resistant soybean by South African farmers as proof of their relevance in at least one African country. But do these proponents reflect on the needs and aspirations of the majority farmers in Africa?\nMost of the research on GMCs is conducted by commercial enterprises that hold intellectual property rights on their inventions. How will poor farmers afford GM seeds?\nGMCs will benefit only a few rich farmers. Even more worrisome is the fact that the market for GM seeds will be dominated by a small clique of powerful private companies.\nIt is important that we do not just become recipients of finished products, but full participants in the generation and application of carefully tailored agricultural technologies.\nTechnologies policed to us on \u2018\u2018take it\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018leave it\u2019\u2019 basis should be rejected.

We have traditionally relied on crop diversity for pest, disease control and soil management.\nCentral to the debate on GMCs, however, should be our readiness to deal with the many complex ecological, agronomic and economic implications of this technology on our agriculture.\nThough the risks are event- and context-specific ("}

The rationale has been that the fewer claims you file, the less likely your rate will increase. But if you happen to be in debt, there\u2019s a good chance your car insurance rate is on the higher end. That\u2019s because your auto insurance and credit score are related.\nAuto insurers include your credit score as a factor when determining your premiums, but many motorists have yet to fully appreciate the effect their credit-worthiness has on their car insurance rates.\nOn the flip side of this equation is the fact that three in 10 people mistakenly think that their driving record has a bearing on their credit score, according to a recent survey from Wallet Hub. Nonetheless, insurers say credit-based insurance scores actually reward the fiscally responsible among us.\nYou may be wondering where this idea that how you handle your wallet is related to how you handle your wheels comes from. The most comprehensive public research was done about a decade ago by the Federal Trade Commission in a report on the issue.\nThe agency found that several states bar insurance companies from basing their underwriting decisions solely on people\u2019s credit scores and credit histories. It has a lot to do with the period of time \u2014 the \u201cexposure period\u201d \u2014 insurance companies can incur losses.\nA report by the Insurance Information Institute (III) said that aside from credit scores, other factors, such as where a person lives, previous crashes, age and gender, help insurers determine who is more and less likely to file a claim.\nOf course, every person is different: An 18-year-old who may not have much of a credit history can\u2019t possibly be judged the same standards as, say, a 40-year-old with a job and family, right?\nWhen it comes to teenagers and other people without credit histories, many states mandate that insurers adhere to the National Conference of Insurance Legislators\u2019 (NCOIL) \u201cModel Act Regarding Use of Credit Information in Personal Insurance,\u201d which was released in 2002.\nThe NCOIL rules, which many states have adopted verbatim, say that \u201cno-hits\u201d and \u201cthin files\u201d (people with no or scarce credit histories) should be considered to have \u201cneutral,\u201d or average, credit.

Nicknamed \"Currahee,\" which is a Native American Cherokee term for \"stands alone,\" the regiment parachuted into Normandy during the D-Day invasion in 1944 and then later parachuted into Holland. The regiment raced to liberate Europe amid bouts of fierce fighting in Bastogne, Belgium and then overran Hitler's famed \"Eagle's Nest\" in Germany.\nThe regiment wasn't associated with the \"Band of Brothers\" nickname until the book by historian Stephen Ambrose came out in 1992, reigniting interest in the regiment among the public.

But the mood is more like Christmas morning as staff at the Washington Animal Rescue League wait for the Rescue Waggin' truck to open its doors.\nThe people and the animals have never met, but some greet like old friends. A basset shoots out to lick a face. Jodie Martin holds a small black puppy, one of the almost 40 dogs that she and the driver picked up that morning from two shelters in Ohio, and kisses it on the head before she hands it over.\n\"These are beautiful dogs,\" said a staff member at the Washington, D.C., shelter.\nThe Rescue Waggin' program of PetSmart Charities has moved more than 29,000 dogs since 2004 from communities with high euthanasia rates to shelters with high adoption rates. Their four trucks transport dogs from 53 shelters in 24 states, including a new route that serves Mississippi, Louisiana, southern Tennessee and Arkansas.\nThe pups travel in style: Specially designed trucks have air conditioning, piped-in music and video cameras so the dogs can be monitored in transit. The policy is not to transport animals more than 10 hours at a stretch, so the organization has just built a halfway kennel for overnight breaks to make longer trips a possibility.\nWhen the dogs are led into their temporary home at the Washington Animal Rescue League, there's a full service hospital, a behavior department and a beautiful cageless shelter facility where a soothing fountain cascades over glass ceilings that let in natural light.\n\"We work on their physical, mental and social rehabilitation and transition them to new homes,\" says the league's director, Dr.Gary Weitzman.\nIf you live in a big city with a shelter like this one, it might be hard to understand how different the situation is in communities where the pups come from.\nMark Southwick says that when he started volunteering at the Parke-Vermillion County, Indiana, Humane Society in 2004, the euthanasia rate was 56 percent, including many perfectly adoptable animals, because they simply did not have the resources to either keep them or find them homes.\n\"Our shelter is situated in a very rural setting \u2014 we are literally in the middle of a cornfield,\" he says.\nThe shelter budget allows only enough paid staff to feed and clean. Volunteers like Southwick do all the adoption placement work. Volunteer efforts such as posting animals on Petfinder.com and transporting small groups of puppies to other shelters helped get the euthanasia rate down to 15-20 percent, Southwick says. Now, with Rescue Waggin', it's under 2 percent.\nMoving animals in search of adoptive homes is not a new idea, but the scale of this program is unprecedented. Even a shelter like the Washington Animal Rescue League, which has long transported animals on its own, is enthusiastic about participating.\nWeitzman says that it's a big help not to have to bear all of the costs, and the Rescue Waggin' trucks are state of the art. When he was on a committee to come up with guidelines for animal transportation, he says, \"we found that we couldn't do better.

Outside the town, the fields where shepherds once watched their flocks are being filled by Israeli housing blocs and roads barred to the descendants of those shepherds.\nJesus would observe that Palestinians in the West Bank are prohibited from entering Jerusalem, thus preventing them from worshipping at their holy sites. He would see that travel is also problematic between Palestinian cities and towns due to the presence of hundreds of Israeli roadblocks, military checkpoints and other obstacles. Thus Palestinians find it hard to conduct commerce, leading to increased unemployment and poverty. For Palestinians, it is also difficult to access medical care or to go to schools that may be located in a neighboring community. Palestinians are forced to travel on narrow and often unpaved roads since they are not allowed on the modern Jewish-only highways that Israel built in the West Bank. In addition, travel between Gaza and the West Bank is nearly impossible for Palestinians mainly due to the Israeli blockade of Gaza.\nAmnesty reported that Palestinians\u2019 water consumption in the West Bank barely reaches 70 liters a day per person, well under the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended minimum of 100 liters a day. Israelis consume over 4 times as much water as the Palestinians.\nThe Amnesty Report added: \u201cIn some rural communities Palestinians survive on far less than even the average 70 litres, in some cases barely 20 litres per day, the minimum amount recommended by the WHO for emergency situations response.\nThis description covers only a little of what Jesus might see in Bethlehem today. Sadly, this situation doesn\u2019t live up to the ideas of peace on earth and goodwill to men. Neither do the horrific situations in Iraq and Afghanistan and many other places. Clearly much work remains to be done before peace on earth and goodwill to men are a reality."}

The battle was won, but only over the opposition of Israel and its domestic allies. This year, partly in deference to Israel, the administration may scale back plans to sell new arms to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, two Arab countries of clear strategic importance to the United States.\nOne thing that has changed in six years is the administration's attitude toward Israel. Today Israel is viewed by many in the White House and at the State Department as America's only reliable friend in the troubled Middle East.\nBut Israeli arms shipments to Iran and allegations of Israeli arms shipments to Nicaragua's antigovernment rebels have raised new questions about the US-Israeli relationship.\nUnder recent Presidents the US has sought a degree of evenhandedness in its Mideast policies. It has tried to reconcile many Americans' natural affinity for Israel, based on shared political and religious values, with the interests of moderate Arab states.\nBut balancing US interests in the Middle East has been a difficult, often thankless task for Washington policymakers. Some observers believe that the Reagan administration has wearied of the effort.\nIsrael's 1982 invasion of Lebanon put a strain on its relations with the US that alarmed leaders in both governments. Since then, the US and Israel have grown closer than ever before. The Reagan administration has backed Israel with more aid, more arms, and closer political ties.\nExperts say the warming trend in US-Israeli relations owes much to President Reagan's views. As a candidate for president in 1980, Mr. Reagan argued that Israel had a ``moral'' right to ``Judea and Samaria,'' Israel's biblical designation for the territories it occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\nThe stance, which effectively denied Arab claims to the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights, was partly designed to woo traditionally Democratic Jewish voters away from Jimmy Carter. But experts say it also reflected a fondness for Israel's pro-democratic, antiterrorist, and anticommunist policies.\nAnother factor has been a change of views on the part of Secretary of State George Shultz, following dramatic developments in 1983.\nIn that year Syria undermined a US-brokered agreement ending Israel's occupation of Lebanon. And twin terrorist attacks against the US Embassy in Lebanon and the US Marine peacekeeping contingent killed 258 Americans.\nAnalysts say the events weakened the influence of Arabists in the State Department who for years had linked US interests in the region to resolving the issue of the occupied territories.\n``Shultz initially followed the advice of the Arabists in the department, but the results were catastrophic,'' says Avner Yaniv, a visiting Israeli professor of government at Georgetown University.\nThe result was that Mr. Shultz, who initially aroused concern among many American and Israeli Jews because of his previous business connections with Arab states, has become the most openly pro-Israeli secretary of state in history.\nPraise for Israel here is qualified by concern over recent Israeli actions, including the Lebanon invasion and Israel's 1985 raid on a Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis. State Department officials also worry that Israel may be diverting some US aid to establish permanent settlements on the West Bank.\nStill, Israel is widely regarded in Washington as a generally reliable friend.

But most newspaper companies are finding the important numbers are still headed in the wrong direction.\nBy Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.\nAs we approach the middle of the 2010s, where do newspapers fit in the battle for America\u2019s largest ad sector \u2014 digital? And how well are all those paywalls doing?\nTwo reports tumbled into the public sphere within a week of each other recently, and together, they help us answer both questions.\nThe numbers here show that the newspaper industry overall \u2014 a relative minority of leading-edge players aside \u2014 is trending the wrong way. Both digital ad revenue and reader revenue continue to grow, but both are less positive than they were a year ago.\nLet\u2019s start with the overall digital ad market.\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s 2013 full year report is its usual rosy self. Ten years ago, IAB had to explain what it was. Now, it tracks the country\u2019s No. 1 ad type \u2014 digital. Digital ads passed broadcast TV for the first time, and by a healthy margin, $2.7 billion. Passing TV is another milestone, coming just a year after digital surpassed print (newspaper + magazine) spending. Now, its lead over newspapers, as seen in the IAB chart below, is more than two to one, $42.8 billion to what IAB counts as newspapers\u2019 $18 billion.\nCuriously, that last number \u2014 part of a study PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) did for IAB \u2014 counts $5.8 billion less in overall newspaper advertising than does the Newspaper Association of America (NAA), which released the other big summary 2013 report.\nMetrics are a big issue in the web world, but this ad delta \u2014 print and digital combined \u2014 is an outsized one. Whichever number you want to use \u2014 $23.8 billion or $18 billion \u2014 is highly meaningful. But your choice won\u2019t change our tale much. The gulf between digital and newspaper advertising is now enormous, and still growing: Digital advertising grew 17 percent year over year.\nSo, as digital advertising overall grew by $6.2 billion in a year, newspapers\u2019 digital ad take increased by only $50 million \u2014 less than one percent of that six-billion-dollar growth.\nThat\u2019s a fairly incredible number. But it\u2019s not a surprising one.\nEach newspaper company reports (and internally allocates) its digital ad revenues by its own standards, so it\u2019s tough to get apples-to-apples comparisons about how well these publicly reported numbers differ company by company. (Not to mention the many newspapers going private and only selectively releasing any data at all.) Is McClatchy\u2019s digital-only revenues report significantly different than Gannett\u2019s, or A.H. Belo\u2019s?\nThat takes us back to the recession-wracked year of 2009, when overall advertising dropped 19 percent \u2014 and that\u2019s what took the breath out of the industry. Digital advertising, unsurprisingly, declined 11.8 percent that year. Before that, it all felt like upside: Digital ads grew at annual rates between 18 percent and 31 percent between 2004 and 2007.\nIt didn\u2019t work out that way. F"}

Schools like the FLVS are thriving because online learning serves a wide range of students, from those needing remedial coursework to advanced learners who are bored in the traditional classroom. Virtual learning meets the needs of student athletes, dropouts, advanced-placement students, and those who, for whatever reason, are underserved by the traditional \u201cfour walls\u201d model of schooling.\nSo far, online learning appears to be highly effective. A recent meta-analysis by the U.S. Department of Education of online-learning studies found that \u201con average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.\u201d Virtual education rejects the one-size-fits-all model of learning in favor of what has been dubbed \u201cmass customization\u201d of education, which may be the key to its success.\nOnline instruction democratizes learning. With virtual education, mothers can gain access to the best physics teacher, a native-born French teacher, or a dynamic history teacher for their child. It\u2019s uniquely student-centered. One of the most popular courses at the Florida Virtual School is \u201cWellville\u201d \u2014 the school\u2019s physical-education class. Students who enroll in the virtual town of \u201cWellville\u201d design their own workout plan and track their diet and stress levels. A teacher serves as their personal trainer.\nAnd online learning doesn\u2019t just serve the unique needs of individual students. It liberates teachers as well, by letting them teach anywhere \u2014 or it would, that is, if policymakers removed onerous restrictions such as state-specific certification. Then the education market would work for teachers, instead of teachers working for the state monopoly. Like their students, teachers would not be trapped in the traditional 7:30-4:00 school day. They could set their own hours, but more important, they could offer their talents across the country. The flexible schedule that online instruction permits would also provide an entirely new option for teachers with families.\nAs families across the country learn about their options in the Internet age,"}

Unfortunately, you are part of a growing number of people being hurt by these new scooters, whether while driving over storm grates and uneven roads, colliding with cars that pull out in front of them or make unsafe lane changes, or by being rear-ended. E-scooters are causing a flood of injuries to the emergency rooms throughout the state.\nYour case, in which the scooter\u2019s brakes failed, presents an issue of product liability law. Like other jurisdictions, California law provides a means of seeking accountability for injuries caused by defective products by bringing suit against product designers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and, in this case, providers of products for general use and consumption.\nA claim for product liability may arise where there is a flaw in a product\u2019s design, a manufacturing defect, a failure to properly inspect or maintain a product, or a failure to warn of dangerous and foreseeable risks, even when caused by foreseeable misuse. In order to succeed in such a claim, the product must be in the same or similar condition as when it left the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer. If the product has been modified in a manner that may have contributed to the injury, any party \u201cupstream\u201d from the point when it was modified may be insulated from liability.\nSince products are often designed, manufactured, distributed, and retailed by different entities, and there is a risk that any one or more of them may not be properly insured or financially stable enough to pay for a valid claim, California follows the \u201cchain of distribution\u201d method of financial accountability. Depending on the type of defect (design vs. manufacturing/inspection), anyone \u201cdownstream\u201d in the chain of distribution, from the designer to the retailer, or in this case rental company, may be held financially responsible for your injuries.\nCalifornia law follows what is known as the \u201cconsumer expectations test\u201d in determining whether a product is defective. If a product fails to operate safely when used in such a manner as a consumer could reasonably expect that it should, then the design may, depending on the facts, prove to be defective. If the product leaves a factory with a safety defect deviating from the intended design and manufacturing process (in your case, if the brake cable was fastened incorrectly), then the producer may be held liable for a manufacturing defect claim. The manufacturer may also be held liable for a failure to conduct a reasonable inspection to assure that the scooter was safe and fit for its intended use.\nIf, on the other hand, the product, as designed and manufactured, was safe at its point of initial sale, but Bird, Skip, Scoot, Lime or another rental company failed to properly inspect and maintain the product while it was in the field, then that company may be held responsible under a negligent maintenance theory of liability. These scooters are in heavy use/rotation and are often abused. The company\u2019s inspection and maintenance program should be carefully examined to ascertain whether their methods and practices are adequate to identify and remedy dangerous defects.\nOne hurdle that you may face in making a successful claim, depending on the scooter company you rent through, is that you may have signed a waiver and/or assumption of risk clause when you clicked \u201caccept\u201d and accepted the terms and conditions of use. Some companies have put in a complete waiver in their terms and conditions which they will claim bars any legal action against them. Others have placed a $100 limit on their accountability.

The report says the development of rapid diagnostic tests must be an urgent priority.\n\u201cI find it incredible that doctors must still prescribe antibiotics based only on their immediate assessment of a patient\u2019s symptoms, just like they used to when antibiotics first entered common use in the 1950s,\u201d O\u2019Neill said in the report.\nThat would be an incentive for industry to invent the rapid diagnostic tests needed and a new Global Innovation Fund worth $2bn over five years would help pay for this and other research.

Students can pursue the program in a fully online format and through evening courses on Northwestern\u2019s Chicago campus.\nNorthwestern\u2019s part-time MPPA degree program aims to provide students with the administrative and analytical competence, as well as leadership skills and theoretical background, to rise in the field and drive change at the local, national and international levels. The program encompasses specialized areas, including public administration, public policy, global policy, and health services policy. The school\u2019s courses are guided by the fact that policy challenges are fluid, interconnected and global. The program works to give students an understanding of this complexity and learn to think across diverse groups and boundaries.\nHere are the views of Bill Lester, Faculty Director for the MPPA program.\nGovpro: What are some features of Northwestern\u2019s MPPA offering?\nBill Lester: The MPPA degree provides more coverage of the policy and administrative environment and how they do interact. Also, we offer specializations that allow more focused studies: public policy, public administration, global policy, and health services policy (on-campus). Our program offers unique opportunities that combine world-class expertise in faculty, top students, and a flexible learning environment.\nGovpro: Is 2013 a good time to earn an MPA for government administrators and others?\nBL: We live in an increasingly networked and collaborative world. Higher education helps us all to stay connected to new and productive thinking. While this applies to everyone, government administrators have unique challenges that are addressed in a MPPA program like ours. Those who continue to learn will be the best administrators.\nGovpro: Does Northwestern have any advice for Govpro visitors on choosing the right graduate degree program?\nBL: There are certainly many very good programs around. The MPPA program at Northwestern University is certainly one of those programs. It is important to find well qualified and respected faculty who combine both theory and practice in the classroom. A solid track record of accomplishment from graduates is also an important indicator. It is also important to match program offerings with the educational needs of students. Also, the student needs to consider geographic location for on-ground instruction. However, many programs, like ours at Northwestern University, allow for an online environment that maintains the highest academic standards.\nThis link takes you to highlights of the MPPA program.

The suggestion that licensed mortgage originators are out to get consumers or that consumers should not inherently trust referrals from friends and family is disappointing.

The author of the piece goes on to use the frustratingly inappropriate labels of \u201ctraditional\u201d Catholics versus \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics, e.g. a \u201ctraditional\u201d Catholic is one who follows the official teaching of the Church, or the Magisterium, while a \u201cliberal\u201d Catholic is one who follows some, not all of the teachings, or believes that some teachings are guidelines that do not necessarily need to be lived. The labels themselves perpetuate the lack of unity and belie one thing all Catholics do have in common\u2014whether a \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cconservative,\u201d a Pope Francis groupie or non, Catholics are all sinners.

After Travis Fryman followed Thome's shot with a line single, Ritchie didn't give up another hit for 20 batters until Milton Bradley singled with one out in the eighth.\nWith his fifth straight impressive start, Ritchie reduced his earned-run average to 2.67 and is limiting opposing batters to a meager .197 average.

Carlos Lee took an outside pitch and plunked an opposite-field double to tie the game, and when a lazy throw by right fielder Matt Lawton escaped the cutoff man, Valentin alertly scampered around third to make it 2-1.\nThe Sox added three runs in the seventh and eighth, and Keith Foulke entered in the ninth after Ritchie reached 112 pitches. After allowing a pair of singles, Foulke walked Thome to load the bases with one out, but Fryman grounded into a double play to end the threat.\nThe Sox will throw struggling young pitchers Dan Wright and Jon Garland in the final two games of the series. With three inexperienced pitchers in the rotation, is there less margin of error in games started by Ritchie and Buehrle?\n\"Not really,\" Buehrle said. \"I think they're going to go out there and show that they're capable of getting the job done.

{"idx": "5819", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Second-order consequences need to be considered before it's too late for brands to act.\nOn June 29, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, leading to the creation of America\u2019s Interstate Highway System. Finished 35 years later, one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the United States use the interstate system. As would be expected, the most direct effect of the interstate was on other players in the transportation industry\u2014rail in particular. Passenger rail traffic fell by more than half in the years that followed and trucking went on to be the dominant form of freight, growing 40X to become four times the size of the railways.\nThe impact of the Interstate Highway System reverberated far beyond just the transportation industry. Highways helped build the suburbs, in turn leading to the rise of the shopping mall and retailers like Walmart. Fast food was born to feed a nation of drivers, with drive-thrus offering a quick in-and-out off interstate exits. And sadly, many small towns withered away when the interstate passed them by.\nThe companies of tomorrow will be those that started planning today not just for the direct change in their industry, but the second- and third-order consequences from adjacent sectors and companies as well.\nThe dilemma is that foreseeing Walmart\u2014or what I call predicting the turn\u2014is exactly the challenge facing today\u2019s business leaders. With the pace of change, innovation and disruption increasing by the minute, companies clearly need to be worried about their core industry. The additional challenge is that they also have to study change in adjacent industries and map out just how that change might have an impact on their own business.\nConsider the case of Coca-Cola. The headwinds it faces in its core business of sugary drinks is obvious. When James Quincey took over as CEO in mid-2017, he realized that the second-order consequences were just as challenging as the shift to healthy beverages. He witnessed this firsthand in his work in China where glass bottles had been traditionally very popular in noodle shops.\nBut as consumers shifted to food delivery startups, glass bottles actually became a liability and sales started to decline. In the U.S., the second-order consequence was driven by the increase of ecommerce and the decline of physical retailers. When fewer shoppers visit the local mall, that means fewer shoppers making an impulse purchase at a Coca-Cola vending machine.\nThis is a great testament to what leadership really means in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. The companies of tomorrow will be those that started planning today not just for the direct change in their industry, but the second- and third-order consequences from adjacent sectors and companies as well.\nCase in point if we go back to automobiles: Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz pointed out \u201cthere are two foundational technology changes rolling through the car industry at the moment: electric and autonomy.\u201d Once again, it is fairly easy to see that both of these, particularly electric, will impact the gas station industry.

The Pascal-based chips managed to deliver significant performance increases over their predecessors based on the company&apos;s Maxwell architecture and manufactured in an older 28-nanometer technology.\nNVIDIA&apos;s next architecture after Pascal is known as Volta, which the company has previously said would bring substantial performance-per-watt gains over Pascal. According to a post on Baidu from user USG Ishimura (I am told that this user is a well-known leaker), NVIDIA will be doing some very interesting things with Volta.\nAccording to a translation of USG Ishimura&apos;s post, the performance of GV104 -- the Volta-based successor to the recently released GP104 chip (which powers the GeForce GTX 1070 and GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards) -- will offer \"really strong\" performance.\nThis performance enhancement, the user indicates, is due to the fact that the \"sm structure [has] changed\" relative to the prior-generation Pascal architecture (in NVIDIA&apos;s graphics architecture, \"SM\" is short for \"streaming multiprocessor.\"\nNVIDIA tells me that the company did make \"general SM architectural optimizations,\" so they aren&apos;t identical. However, it&apos;s clear that the company didn&apos;t make the kinds of changes in going from Maxwell to Pascal at the SM level as it did in going from Kepler to Maxwell.\nIn light of this, I think that it makes a lot of sense to expect a dramatically overhauled SM architecture with Volta, driving significant performance-per-watt gains.\nMore high-end gaming chips this time around?\nDuring the Kepler generation, NVIDIA&apos;s highest-end gaming-focused graphics processor was a chip known as GK104. NVIDIA also brought out a chip known as GK110 to serve as higher-end gaming processors (Titan, Titan Black, 780, and 780 Ti), but it was a product aimed mainly at high-performance computing that was forced to do duty as a higher-end gaming product.\nBeginning with the Maxwell generation, NVIDIA sold a chip known as GM204 as the GeForce GTX 980, and then rolled out a part known as GM200 -- essentially a GM204 with 50% more everything -- as the GeForce GTX Titan X and a partially disabled variant known as the GeForce GTX 980 Ti.\nNVIDIA continued with this practice with Pascal, selling GP104 as the GeForce GTX 1080, and GP102 as the new Titan X.\nAccording to USG Ishimura, NVIDIA is actually planning not two, but three high-end gaming graphics processors based on Volta this time around: GV104, GV110, and GV102.\nIt&apos;s not clear how GV110 and GV102 will be differentiated, but I would imagine that GV110 will be an even higher-performance product than GV102, which could potentially allow NVIDIA to introduce a performance and price"}

But hold the champagne. The cost-cutting that made the LCS so affordable might also doom the ships to watery graves in future conflicts.\n\"We have a warship design that is not expected to fight and survive in the very environment in which it was produced to do so,\" one critic at the U.S. Naval Institute blog claims, describing the LCS as \"poorly armed\" and \"poorly protected\" for dangerous, crowded coastal waters.\nWhen the LCS deals were announced last week, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus crowed that they would \"provide needed ships to our fleet in a timely and extraordinarily cost-effective manner.\" Instead of picking one shipbuilder, the Navy tapped rival firms Austal and Lockheed Martin to build 10 LCS apiece through 2015, each using its own distinct design.\nThe cost per ship? Just $450 million, at least $200 million below the cost of each of the four prototypes.\nBut to get those low, low prices, the ships will be built to commercial, rather than military, structural standards \u2013 meaning they're lighter and less blast- and fire-resistant. Indeed, the Navy does not plan to subject the LCS to traditional blast-testing, \"due to the damage that would be sustained by the ship,\" the Congressional Research Service points out.\nThe LCS also optimizes speed over weaponry. Lockheed's version has what Operations Officer Tony Hyde, from USS Freedom (the first Lockheed prototype), described as \"the largest marine gas turbines in the world \u2013 essentially the engines of a 777 jetliner.\"\nThe turbines' 100,000 horsepower can propel the LCS at up to 50 knots, compared to 30 for most warships. But that high speed \"will eat through a fuel supply in half a day,\" the USNI critic scoffs.\nFormer Freedom commanding officer Don Gabrielson said in 2008 that high speed could help the LCS respond better to pirate attacks and assaults by small boats, such as those used by Iran. But an extra 20 knots aren't likely to make much difference if someone's shooting supersonic anti-ship missiles at you, whereas extra armor plating just might.\nSo is the LCS a tremendous bargain for a cash-strapped Navy, or an underweight death-trap for its crew? The answer could be both, with caveats.\nEric Wertheim, an independent naval analyst and author of the authoritative Combat Fleets of the World, tells Danger Room that all shipbuilding plans must take into account \"political considerations, economic considerations, military considerations [and] industrial considerations.\" In other words, a ship isn't just a ship. It's also a jobs program, an industrial subsidy and a number on a treaty document.\n\"As much as it seems like a simple decision of which ship is the best, politicians and military leaders are frequently forced to look at long-term implications for things like the health of the shipbuilding base,\" Wertheim points out. \"For example, what would happen if we don't share work, would one of the shipyards have to close?

But I want to be a Giant for a long time, so we'll see how it goes.\"\nThat's similar to what Cruz has been saying all along, but there's undoubtedly been a slight uptick in tension in the contract negotiations since the regular season ended. That was clear at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, when Giants co-owner John Mara said there was a \"limit\" to how far the Giants would go to re-sign Cruz and he indicated Cruz's asking price was too high.\nCruz's counter was to avoid answering a question later that same day from the Daily News about whether he'd consider a contract holdout.\n\"I have no answer to that,\" Cruz said at the time.\nSince then there was a report that said re-signing Hakeem Nicks was more of a priority for the Giants than Cruz \u2014 a report that Mara said was false when he spoke at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis last week. Meanwhile, according to a source familiar with the situation, talks on a Cruz contract extension have made little progress since the end of the season.\nThe most likely scenario still appears to be that the Giants will place a \"first-round tender\" on Cruz, guaranteeing him a one-year salary of approximately $2.9 million (the exact amount has not been set yet). That would give Cruz the right to seek offers from other teams, but the Giants would have the right to match and the right to compensation in the form of a first-round pick if they don't.\nRestricted free agents \u2014 especially ones with high tenders \u2014 have rarely found much of a market for their services, which would mean Cruz is a virtual lock to remain with the Giants next year.

What's a Big Oil executive to do? Spend millions to lobby Congress to change the rules, of course.\nThe export ban was originally imposed as a response to the 1973 oil crisis and applies only to crude oil, not refined oil products. For the last 40 years, American companies could export products such as gasoline or diesel fuel, but most crude oil drilled in the U.S. has not been allowed on the international market.\n[T]he oil industry has financed organizations whose scholars have generated reports praising the proposal. It has placed op-eds in Capitol Hill newspapers and paid for television spots in key markets, including one round of new ads introduced last week naming a dozen Democratic House members the industry is trying to pressure to back the measure.\nIndustry executives have even pressed foreign governments to communicate their support through \u201cdiplomatic channels.\u201d And they have enlisted help from lawmakers from major oil-producing states, including Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas; Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota; and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. These lawmakers alone have also benefited from more than $3 million combined in direct industry campaign contributions during their careers.\nLouis A. Finkel, the top lobbyist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, calls the effort a \u201ccampaign-style engagement,\u201d more akin to a presidential campaign.\nThink tanks have been a critical part of the repeal effort, with prominent centers like the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute issuing reports or sending scholars to Capitol Hill endorsing the move. These same organizations have taken large donations \u2014 in some instances exceeding $1 million a year, as was the case for Brookings \u2014 in combined contributions from industry donors.\nWhile the offensive will likely work in the Republican-led House, which is set to vote on repeal this Friday, the White House has already intimated it has no interest in reversing the ban, citing environmental concerns associated with increased production, and at least one Senate Democrat is fed up with the so-called \"experts\" Big Oil has trouted out before Congress to downplay the effects of climate change.\n\"We've held a hearing on the export ban in July,\" Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said during a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee last week. \"But the only witness -- the only witness testifying on the climate effects of this bill was a conservative economist who thinks, quote, 'No one really knows' the extent to which humans are causing climate change,\" she added incredulously.\n\"The most obvious effect of lifting the crude oil export ban would be to produce enormous profits for a number of big oil companies,\" Warren continued. \"And that is a reason by itself to be skeptical of study after study and expert after expert that have been funded by big oil to try to sell this deal.\"\n\"This committee apparently has no interest in hearing from any of the many, many experts who apparently do believe that manmade climate change is a problem. And for those of us who want to listen to these scientist, lifting the ban without thoroughly considering and addressing the potential environmental consequences sounds pretty darn reckless,\" she argued.\nWarren, who just last week went after the Brookings Institute last week for shilling before Congress on behalf of corporate interest, conceded that the oil export ban may need to"}

The second alleged member of the group to be collared by law enforcement is 24-year-old Justin Gray Liverman, also known as \"D3f4ult,\" who was arrested in Morehead City, North Carolina.\nAccording to court filings, the two alleged hackers conspired with other members of Crackas With Attitude to break into the personal online accounts of US government officials, family members, and a number of US government computer systems. Prosecutors say that social engineering techniques, including phishing campaigns, were employed to impersonate victims and gain access to these accounts.\nIn some cases, members of Crackas With Attitude then uploaded this information to public forums, harassed both victims and their families through phone calls, and defaced social media accounts belonging to targets.\nThe leak, which took place last year, led to the data of approximately 31,000 FBI, Homeland Security, and Department of Justice (DoJ) agents, as well as the personal email accounts of US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and his wife being accessed without permission.\nCalls intended for the director were then redirected to the Free Palestine Movement, of which the hacking group's activities have been linked to.\nUS law enforcement says \"at least three\" other members of the hacking group are located in the UK and are being investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service. In February, UK police arrested a 16-year-old boy believed to be the leader of Crackas With Attitude.\nBoggs and Liverman are due to stand in the federal courthouse in Alexandria next week, where US Magistrate Judge Theresa Carroll Buchanan will be overseeing the case."}

The boys had not returned to the unit after their shifts.\nOn May 31, the 17-year-old was seen walking north along Lakeland Drive. When a Willmar police officer approached him, he said he was returning to Prairie Lakes. The officer saw injuries to the boy's face and asked what had happened, according to the criminal complaint.\nThe youth said he didn't want to talk about what had happened to him in the open, so the officer drove him to Prairie Lakes, and they talked in the squad car in the parking lot.\nThe youth said he and the other boy had made arrangements for Sanchez and Valadez to drive them to Winona, and they promised to pay them $1,000.\nThe trip was made with two small children in the vehicle. When they stopped at a convenience store in Winona, the youths jumped out of the vehicle and ran because they couldn't pay for the ride. The boy said he \"froze\" when he heard a gunshot behind him, but the other boy kept running, according to the complaint.\nSanchez allegedly held a gun to the youth's back and forced him back into the vehicle. When they couldn't find the other boy, they drove back to Willmar and held the boy captive in their apartment and beat him approximately a dozen times, according to court records.\nAccording to the complaint, a witness also described for officers that she had seen Sanchez May 30, when he showed her a loaded gun in his waistband and the injured boy in the back seat of his vehicle. He allegedly told her he had \"kidnapped this f\u2014-in' white boy.\"\nThe boy said Sanchez and Valadez used meth and did not sleep while he was confined in the apartment in southwest Willmar. Eventually, the boy convinced Sanchez that he could get money for him if he would let him go.\nSanchez released the boy and allegedly told him to return that night, or he would take him to a field, give him a head start and start shooting at him. The boy began walking back to Prairie Lakes.\nPolice identified Sanchez with the youth's description of Sanchez's tattoos. According to the complaint, the boy was too frightened to go into the apartment building but described how to find the apartment. Valadez's name was on the lease. The boy also told officers Sanchez had two firearms.\nSanchez and Valadez were arrested early on June 1 at the restaurant where Sanchez worked.\nUsing search warrants to go through the vehicle and a backpack in it, officers found two .40-caliber hand"}

The bank has also contracted big-name firms including Ogilvy and Federal Street Strategies, whose principals previously worked for powerful lawmakers, financial regulators or President Donald Trump, according to interviews and filings reviewed by Reuters.\nWells Fargo has also been highlighting millions of dollars spent on programs dedicated to homelessness, housing for veterans and financial literacy in key lawmakers\u2019 districts to win back their favor, bank representatives said.\nMoskowitz said he expected his team to meet with important government officials or staff almost every day.\nWells Fargo launched its charm offensive to limit the blowback from a sales scandal that erupted in September 2016, with revelations that employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.\nIn an unprecedented move in February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo. In April, two U.S. regulators jointly fined the bank $1 billion for mistreating auto borrowers. Authorities including the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are still conducting their own probes.\nEach negative headline about Wells Fargo extends how long the bank will remain in the regulatory doghouse, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.\nThe scandal-related fallout has started to hit Wells Fargo\u2019s profits as it needs to work harder to win new customers and additional marketing costs keep expenses high. In the first half of the year, Wells Fargo earned $10.3 billion, 10 percent less than a year earlier. Its full-year profits before taxes are expected to be 5 percent lower, according to Refinitiv.\nThe bank\u2019s Washington team is trying to shift the conversation to what the bank is doing now for communities and away from the misdeeds of the past. Success could mean fewer negative headlines and a looser regulatory leash.\nIn interviews, Wells Fargo representatives said they had been telling lawmakers what the bank is doing to remedy customer abuses and prevent them from happening again. They also offer up the bank\u2019s expertise on lending and economic trends, tout the number of people Wells Fargo employs in lawmakers\u2019 districts and outline philanthropic programs that appeal to them.\nFor instance, Wells Fargo said it has provided $11.3 million in down payment help to homeowners in Los Angeles, which is represented in part by Democrat Maxine Waters.\nWaters is positioned to chair the House Financial Services Committee if Democrats take control of that chamber in the Nov. 6 mid-term election and has been one of Wells Fargo\u2019s harshest critics in Congress.\nShe has said expanding access to affordable housing would be a top priority as committee chair.

There is no doubt that the rapid increase in the population and development in the urban, industrial and social sectors have led to an increase in pollution rates, especially air pollution, due to the large the number of vehicles and the expansion of construction in industrial facilities.\nKuwait Institute for Scientific Research has carried out many studies and research projects to monitor and evaluate air pollution in factories, hospitals and oilfields that are associated with urban growth, which increase pressure on available resources such as electricity and water and exacerbate sand and dust storms.\nIn 2015, the director general of Kuwait Municipality revealed that the rate of solid waste in Kuwait reached 4,000 tons per day, which is very high, and makes Kuwait one of the top countries in the world in this domain and not only in the Gulf region. In July 2018, Kuwait recorded the highest air pollution score of 301 on the air quality index AQi, which measures the level of air pollution. Anything above 300 is considered to be hazardous with serious health effects. Some pollutants have increased due to the dust, gases and vapors.\nI believe this topic is extremely important because it has an impact on the health of people and creates suspicions of the spread of diseases related to the respiratory system and cancer. The director of the Kuwait Cancer Center said in a press release in Feb 2018 that cancer is the second largest cause of death in Kuwait. I think the government\u2019s continued denials and what newspapers and environment groups have mentioned through the years has created confusion with no clear answers.\nWe need to know the truth because inhaling this polluted air is causing a dysfunction in the performance of the body and leads to diseases. I believe that in order to protect the health of people, it is necessary to issue a special legislation for clean air, which will determine air quality standards and the percentage of pollutants allowed from each source, along with the development of a system to measure these elements to support air pollution research and organizing programs and awareness campaigns on pollution to raise awareness among the public.\nAlso, I think we need to conduct a comprehensive environmental survey of traffic in terms of the number of vehicles, study the efficiency of fuel combustion and the existence of systems to control pollution resulting from it. Also, a technical team should be readied to evaluate pollutants and the criteria for selecting air quality monitoring stations, as well as to make these data and information available to everyone and exchange information and experiences with environmental bodies in the GCC."}

{"idx": "5859", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: As a new Vermont resident, I assumed that the most difficult part of assimilating to life in the Green Mountains would be the weather, or perhaps the lack of public transportation. Desperate to fit in, I have made the rookie mistake of referring to myself as a \u201cVermonter\u201d in a bar full of third, fourth, and even fifth-generation Vermonters who never miss an opportunity to remind me that unless my parents were born in Vermont, I must resign myself to the status of an outlander.\nAs an archivist and historian, I find myself eager to more fully understand and contextualize this hearty, proud and often cantankerous Vermont patriotism that seems to have started with Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain boys and has intensified with each new conflict Vermont finds herself confronting both directly and tangentially. Throughout the annals of American history, the eternal torch of patriotism shines brightest when the days ahead seem darkest. This quintessential paradigm has been especially true in regards to the stalwart and steadfast response of Vermonters during times of crisis, and perhaps never as dramatically as during the Great War.\nIn the spring of 1917 amid increasing hostilities between the United States and Germany, Vermont\u2019s Legislature and executive branch began in earnest the anticipatory task of firming up her military and securing a commitment from all Vermonters that the state was ready to bear her share of the burden of war.\nThe War Department\u2019s response faulted the failure of the 64th Congress to allocate funds before the closing session, but this explanation was quickly overshadowed by the news that Congress was also poised to pass the Selective Service Act, which would more than compensate for Vermont\u2019s lack of troops and equipment.\nAs Congress debated the necessity and merits of relying on conscription rather than voluntary enlistment, German submarines attacked and sank three American ships on March 18, 1917, the City of Memphis, the Illinois, and the Vigilancia, finally constituting the \u201covert act\u201d that would propel America into the theater of war.\nMeanwhile, the Old Vermont First under the command of Col. Fred B. Thomas was ordered by Gov. Graham for initial muster at Forth Ethan Allen to commence training and await mobilization. Regimental records show normal camp activity between April and August with training beginning at dawn and lasting until the Fort was enveloped in complete darkness.\nAn unseasonably cold summer provided ample opportunity for Thomas, affectionately referred to as \u201cOld Man,\u201d to train his men in marksmanship, new bayonet combat, and the use of the regimental bugle. Allowing little time for idleness and demanding perfection, the \u201cOld Man\u201d ran a tight ship at Fort Ethan Allen but was deeply revered by all for his sharp wit and approachability.\nAs training intensified, efforts were made to secure enough recruits to fill the ranks of a regiment that was below the authorized strength of a war time organization. Recruiting parties detailed from the Fort visited towns and cities and the rattle of their drums on the quiet village squares aroused the citizens to a sharper realization of the fact that the war was not likely to be confined to newspaper dispatches. The Green Mountain State was calling her sons to gather again beneath her battle flags.\nAn urgent sense of duty combined with patriotic Vermont exceptionalism impressed upon the imaginations of Vermonters a romantic idea \u2014 that \u201cThe Old Vermont First\u201d would be comprised exclusively of intrepid, rugged young Vermonters."}
{"idx": "5860", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: The Tampa Bay Lightning are dead.\nAfter finishing the regular season with a record-tying 62 wins, the Tampa Bay Lightning exited the playoff picture with barely a whimper. One of the most dominant teams of the modern era was swept -- and swept pretty handily -- by a franchise that had never previously won a playoff series in it's nearly 20-year existence.\nThere's no question that it's one of the most stunning upsets in recent NHL memory, but also arguably in recent sports memory...period. So how the hell did it happen? Let's break down where things went oh so wrong for Tampa Bay.\nTampa, the best offensive team in hockey, averaged 3.9 goals per game -- nearly half a goal more than every other team in the field. They were led up front by a three-headed monster in Nikita Kucherov (128 points), Steven Stamkos (98 points) and Brayden Point (92) points, all of whom finished with 40-plus goals.\nWhen they're on their game, it's nearly impossible to match the Lightning's front-end talent. But not only were they not on their game in this series -- they were nearly invisible. None of the three guys mentioned above recorded a single point until Game 4, when Stamkos and Point were finally able to get in the goal column. Too little, too late.\nStamkos, who led the team with 45 goals this year, had just 10 shots on net in series, getting completely blanked during a pivotal Game 3. At even strength, Stamkos was on the ice for just one Lightning goal and four goals against. As the team's captain and one of their most important players, you expect better. You need better.\nKucherov not only failed to score in the series, but took himself out of the lineup for Game 3 thanks to a suspension he earned with a boneheaded check he delivered in Game 2. Climbing out of a 2-0 series hole as the series shifts to your opponents' building is tough enough, but doing so without your best forward in the lineup for a swing game? Salt in the wound.\nAs for Point, who is considered to be one of the league's premier two-way players, he simply didn't do enough on either end of the ice. He had just one point in the series (a power play goal in Game 4) but also had the second-worst even strength shot share among Tampa Bay forwards (47.5 percent). He just wasn't the difference-maker that he's been known to be. None of them were.\nBut you also have to give credit to Sergei Bobrovsky, who became a force in net for Columbus after the opening period of the series. Bobrovsky made two massive stops in that Game 1 to prevent Stamkos from making it 4-0 and, later, 4-1.\nWhen Bobrovsky is at the top of his game, he's an elite goaltender with an ability to be a game-changer. That's what we saw for a large chunk of this series as he helped keep Tampa relatively silent. It's why the Blue Jackets elected to hold onto him for this playoff run rather than sell him off as an expiring asset at the trade deadline, and he has rewarded that decision so far, posting a .932 save percentage through the first round.\nThe Lightning finished the season as the league's top specials teams squad, finishing first in"}

I argued that, after decades of ascendancy, the modern conservative movement had run out of ideas and talent, with no serious answers to the central problems of our time. For all the right wing\u2019s noise and energy and apparent momentum going into this year\u2019s midterms, these points are no less true today, and the Tea Party provides nonstop proof. There are no new conservative ideas, only the old ones presented in their most extreme form. Government is still the problem, tax cuts and deregulation are still the solution, liberal \u00e9lites are still the enemy. All that\u2019s changed is the level of vituperation, ideological rigidity, and anti-intellectualism.\nThe quality of Republican candidates has sunk to sub-Palin levels, from Alaska and Nevada to Delaware and New York. Last week, a local reporter asked the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, why tax cuts should be expected to improve the economy when real incomes actually dropped after the original Bush tax cuts. According to the Times, Toomey \u201cbrushed aside\u201d the question with the reply that he \u201cdid not believe the data.\u201d How convenient for him! But if a candidate deals with core economic realities by asserting his right to his own facts, that\u2019s not a sign of a vibrant political creed, however good his poll numbers (Toomey\u2019s opponent, Joe Sestak, seems to be gaining ground). Nor will the number of seats Republicans pick up next month be a reliable gauge of the party\u2019s long-term health and viability. In 1974 Democrats picked up forty-nine House seats; two years later a Democrat was elected President; and throughout the decade conservative ideas gained ground, leading to a certain revolution in 1980.\nIn the essay, I wrote that if the 2008 elections went against conservatism, the reaction would be either self-reform or self-purification. There hasn\u2019t been much sign of the former. Instead, as David Frum predicted to me at the time, conservatives have resorted to saying the same thing louder (much louder). It will happen again in 2012. The grassroots zeal on the right has been astounding. The party\u2019s refusal to make any effort to help the Administration solve problems created under Republican rule has been shrewd (and deeply irresponsible\u2014I\u2019d say unpatriotic). These things will benefit Republicans next month. Over the longer run, they will help marginalize the party.\nAs for \u201cThe New Liberalism,\u201d a question mark at the end would have been more prudent. We\u2019ve seen several pieces of landmark legislation, including the most important social reform since the Great Society, health care, which is also the first significant blow to economic inequality since the trend started in the late seventies. But there\u2019s no new or revived ism to sustain the values and ideas behind these achievements. Obama has no larger movement behind him; the one he had ended on election night. After all the analysis of his political flaws and tactical mistakes (I\u2019ve engaged in this cheap spectator sport myself), here is the heart of his political weakness. F.D.R. had the labor movement; L.B.J. had the civil-rights movement. Obama had Obama for America. His campaign was based on the man more than any set of ideas or clear vision of the future. Everyone knew what Reaganism stood for. No one knows what Obamaism means"}

The one-time top Mets prospect had seemingly blown through his opportunities when he was sent down earlier this season with an 8.25 ERA, but with injuries taking their toll once again on the pitching staff, he's been given another chance.\nAnd he has impressed - somewhat.\nIn his last two outings, both mop-up assignments, Montero has allowed one run over 6.2 innings pitched.\n\"I think when he first got to the big leagues, we used him because of everything we heard about him, what a strike thrower he was. Then he struggled. Again, I think when you struggle at this level you lose a little confidence in your stuff,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"I don't care what situations you use him in, if you see you can get guys out, it's got to help your confidence and command. These last two outings, he's faced two pretty good lineups and made pretty good pitches.\n\"The next thing is, we get him in a little tighter situation, it has to play,\" Collins continued. \"He's got to do exactly the same thing. Go about your business, as when it's 7-2, as it is 2-2. We're hoping that takes place.\"\nMontero's issue in previous big league stints is that he tries to nibble around the strike zone instead of attacking hitters. The last time he was sent down, Collins told him that he had to throw strikes - or else.\n\"We told him when he left here, if you don't throw strikes, you are not coming back,\" Collins said. \"Well he went down and threw strikes. Now he's up here and throwing strikes. I am very, very pleased with the way he is going about it and his approach here and what got him back here.\"\nNow, Montero has to show he can do it in tighter situations if he is going to stay.\nCollins said he and pitching coach Dan Warthen met with Zack Wheeler after his disastrous two-inning start on Monday and are convinced he is healthy. But he was evasive when asked about what has caused the righthander to give up 15 earned runs over 3.2 innings in his last two starts.\n\"We have an idea,\" Collins said.\nHe did seem to agree with Wheeler that the scouting reports are giving hitters the advantage. Wheeler has struggled to command his secondary pitches, so scouts are telling hitters to just sit on the fastball.\n\"We've got to think there are more guys going up there hunting his fastball,\" Collins said. \"As Zack said, he hasn't had command of his breaking ball for a couple starts. So that's something we talked about today. We've got a couple of ideas how to go about it. We gotta get those pitches back.\"\nAfter playing eight straight games, Wilmer Flores was out of the starting lineup Tuesday night against Dodgers' right hander Brandon McCarthy.\n\"You can kinda see he's dragging a little bit,\" Collins said. \"We are going to let him get off his feet for a little while. We've also got a lot of lefties coming up, we got to get him reenergized.\"\nFlores is hitting .289 with six homers and 20 RBI.\nAs expected, right-hander Tyler Pill was called up from Triple-A Las Vegas and will start for the Mets Wednesday against the Dod"}

Standard table sugar contains 50 per cent glucose and 50 per cent fructose. When ingested, the glucose is used as energy and the fructose is converted to fat. Unlike every other food molecule, fructose does not have a corresponding appetite hormone in the brain that tells us when to stop eating it, which is why we can eat a packet of Hobnobs in one go. Evidence links it to heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. It causes bloating, a rise in adrenaline and concentration loss, and inhibits the immune system. Our body can process nine teaspoons of sugar a day, at most \u2013 which is about 252g a week \u2013 but we are consuming more than a kilogram a week, on average.\nStudies show that it takes eight weeks to change a habit. If you experience energy slumps and sweet cravings, and can't say no to sugary foods, try quitting sugar. Reduce your intake for two weeks to give your gut time to adjust. Then cut out all sugar for six weeks, including fruit. Avoid sugar-free gum and sugar substitutes, as they trigger the same bodily response as sugar.\nKetchup can be the worst offender for high sugar levels, with almost 25% of the calories coming from sugar.\nA glass of fruit juice contains the same amount of fructose as a glass of Coca-Cola. Wine, beer and spirits contain minimal amounts of fructose. Avoid dried fruits: dates and raisins are 70 per cent sugar. Thai food contains palm sugar \u2013 instead, choose Indian food with a tomato base. Pasta sauces can contain four teaspoons of sugar per serving. Sugar is added to low-fat foods to make up for their lack of taste. For example, a small tub of plain, low-fat yogurt can contain six teaspoons of sugar, so eat full fat instead. Be aware that 'healthy' sweeteners often contain high levels of fructose. Agave, for example, is 90 per cent fructose.\nReplace sugar with fats and proteins. Eat good-quality meats, nuts, eggs, full-fat dairy products and avocados, and cook with ghee or coconut oil. I recommend 'crowding out' \u2013 eating as much nutritious food as you want so that you do not feel hunger pangs for sugar. If you do need a fix, choose something fatty, or a protein-rich food, to satisfy your craving for a treat, such as a chunk of halloumi or some warm milk. Often, we are just craving comfort, so do something nurturing, such as phoning someone who makes you feel good, or buying some luxury herbal tea as a treat.\nQuitting sugar will give you more energy and focus, and a clearer complexion. After eight weeks, reintroduce fresh fruit \u2013 grapefruit, raspberries and kiwis are low in fructose \u2013 and use Stevia or rice malt syrup, which contain no fructose, instead of table sugar. Choose foods with less than 6g of sugar per 10"}

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has evidently been so deeply wounded by the invective directed his way on Twitter, 140 to 280 characters at a time, that he has filed a defamation lawsuit against the company and three of its microblogging auteurs. He is seeking a whopping $250 million for the damage he believes they inflicted on his reputation.\nNunes\u2019 lawsuit doesn\u2019t identify the people responsible for DevinNunesMom (which was shut down this month) or DevinCow on Twitter; the third microblogger sued is Liz Mair, a self-described libertarian Republican who has acted as a communications director for a series of Republican candidates across the country.

That led \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Mom\u201d to accuse him of being such things as \u201cpresidential fluffer and swamp rat,\u201d according to the complaint.\nJust guessing here, but the real point of the lawsuit may not be to strike back at Nunes\u2019 critics (although he did just that in his successful 2018 campaign for reelection, sending out a 40-page mailer attacking the negative press he\u2019d received in the Fresno Bee). And his goal may not be to collect a huge sum from Twitter, which is so clearly protected by federal law against this very sort of lawsuit that Nunes\u2019 lawyers had to have told him it was a fool\u2019s errand. Instead, the purpose may simply have been to give Nunes a role in the fight against giant Silicon Valley tech companies that Trump and other Republicans have been waging since before the 2018 election."}

But, a manatee might cause some concern.\nBesides, if you go away for the holiday, what would you do with your adopted manatee? There aren\u2019t any kennels for manatees.

Oh no, this has to turn into open discord between their best player and the man running the shots, as a series of leaks have revealed that the Knicks have tried to move Carmelo Anthony to the Cavaliers in exchange for Kevin Love\u2014and were rebuffed. You can say a lot of things about the Knicks, but not that they\u2019re ever off-brand.\nESPN reports that the Knicks approached Cleveland about an Anthony-for-Love deal, and were prepared to try to convince Melo to waive his no-trade clause \u2014one of only three full NTCs in the NBA, along with Dirk Nowitzki and LeBron James\u2014if the Cavs were interested. They were not interested. Why would they be? Love was a big part of the Cavaliers\u2019 title last year and has been even better this season. He\u2019s four years younger than Melo. And Anthony does not offer what LeBron is so publicly demanding\u2014a big man and a backup point guard to take the weight off of Kyrie Irving.\nReportedly, Cleveland was willing to make this exact deal a year ago, but Melo supposedly wasn\u2019t willing to waive his no-trade clause. Things have obviously changed on both fronts, but what hasn\u2019t changed is that Phil Jackson very clearly would like to move Melo.\nTwo weeks ago, longtime Jackson friend Charley Rosen wrote that \u201cCarmelo Anthony has outlived his usefulness in New York.\u201d People who would know these things believe that Rosen serves as a mouthpiece for Jackson, and was doing so here. Melo read the tea leaves, and held a meeting with Jackson, at which the possibility of seeking trades was reportedly raised. From Melo\u2019s telling, it wasn\u2019t a fruitful meeting.\nEarlier Wednesday, Anthony said his recent meeting with Jackson and Knicks general manager Steve Mills lasted only five to seven minutes \u2014 with Jackson doing most of the talking.\nTrading Anthony does make sense for the Knicks. It\u2019s hard to conceive of them building a team good enough to compete for a title within Anthony\u2019s window, and at age 32, his trade value is still high and yet will never be higher. Jackson reportedly wants to start over and build around Kristaps Porzingis, but he needs to get a good return, and he needs to find a trading partner where Anthony would be willing to go. This mess was set in motion when Jackson okayed that no-trade clause three years ago, and sealed when he failed to build a good roster in the intervening years.\nMelo, at least, is playing his cards close to the vest.\nOh, and the Knicks lost to the Mavericks last night."}

It was also among the first to establish national parks, but initially these were also badly stressed by illegal logging and hunting.\nAt the time, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and even Vietnam had a lot of pristine forests left, with healthy populations of tigers. Tigers had declined in Thailand to the point where in the early 2000s it was thought they were very small and fragmented.\nBut since then, massive illegal exploitation has badly depleted the forests and tiger populations in the other countries - even Myanmar - to the point where Indochinese tigers are believed to be extinct in Cambodia, down to just a handful in Laos and Vietnam and with unknown, but almost certainly greatly reduced numbers in eastern Myanmar.\nMeanwhile, improved conservation strategies have allowed the tiny population of Indochinese tigers in Thailand to recover in some areas, although they have disappeared in others.

That's good news for nervous high school seniors and transfer students who competed against 206,000 others in another record-shattering year for UC applications for 2016.\nThe expansion has pressed officials to find more housing, hire additional faculty and expand support services. On Wednesday, UC President Janet Napolitano announced new efforts to build at least 14,000 more beds for undergraduate and graduate students by 2020.\n\"A key priority is to ensure this housing is and remains affordable to UC students,\" Napolitano said at the UC Regents meeting in San Francisco. \"Many of our campuses are located in some of the most expensive real estate markets in California.\"\nCampuses are already busy hiring new professors and adding additional undergraduate courses.\nIn November, regents approved Napolitano's plan to boost enrollment of California students by 10,000 over the next three years, a response to criticism about the rising number of students from other states and countries taking UC seats. Out-of-state students pay triple the $12,200 in annual tuition Californians pay.\nThe Legislature approved $25 million for an additional 5,000 undergraduates this fall, but UC officials will actually admit 6,500 because enrollment dipped last year from 2014, the baseline year for the increase, according to UC spokeswoman Dianne Klein.\nThe funds, however, will pay for less than half the cost of educating the students. That prompted concerns at the meeting that educational quality could decline without more dollars.\nDaniel Hare, a UC Riverside professor and chair of the Academic Senate, fretted that students could be deprived of more intimate, hands-on learning opportunities in teaching labs and performance studios that he said were crucial supplements to lectures.\n\"You're slowly filling the balloon, and eventually it's going to pop,\" he said. \"Everything we need to maintain for quality requires a commitment for resources that faculty are concerned are not being made.\"\nMohsin Mirza, UC Student Assn. undergraduate committee chairman, told the regents that it was \"highly irresponsible\" to accept more students without making sure they had proper housing, classes, mental health services and other support.\nHe said one student was sleeping in the living room of his university housing, sharing space with two other students.\nJulia Schemmer, a first-year UC Riverside student, said students are sitting on floors at her campus because classrooms are so crowded.

Health competence at EU level is limited and member states fiercely safeguard their competence to organise and manage their health systems.\nOn the other hand, health is one of the most important policy issues for European citizens and increasingly the need to do more together to attain common objectives more effectively and efficiently is being felt by a larger number of member states.\nMalta\u2019s choice of priorities was designed to reflect issues considered to be relevant to the national agenda as well as being a priority and concern for the vast majority of European Union member states.\nWe sought to ensure that there was a focus on public health issues as well as on health system concerns. I am delighted that after months of hard work, last Friday we adopted two sets of Council Conclusions namely; Council conclusions to contribute towards halting the rise in Childhood Overweight and Obesity and Council conclusions on Encouraging member states-driven Voluntary Cooperation between Health Systems.\nIn both these initiatives, we sought to emphasise a flexible and voluntary approach that will enable member states to work towards the stated objectives in the manner that fits best to their local contexts and aspirations.\nThis approach was the fruit of several months of careful planning and consultation with both member states as well as European NGOs and other stakeholders.\nThe consultation process started well in advance of the presidency and I personally took advantage of several informal meetings and events to discuss our plans and ideas with concerned stakeholders.\nDuring the closing plenary session of the European Health Forum Gastein in September 2016, I outlined the plans and objectives for the upcoming Maltese Presidency. The issue of transparency of medicines pricing and the need for member states to work together more closely on this issue was one of the more contentious policy proposals which I was determined to push forward.\nDuring the EPSCO Council I reported upon the outcomes attained in the area of pharmaceuticals during the Maltese Presidency.\nThe setting up of a permanent technical group to support the work of the Pharma Round Table and the signing of the Valletta declaration between eight member states pledging to work more closely together to cooperate in the improving access to medicines for their citizens are both good examples of cooperation.\nThe Valletta declaration is an example of the way in which member states are finding ways to step up their own cooperation mechanisms whilst the Pharma round table serves to reaching out to cooperate with industry. This is absolutely essential if we wish to register progress and move forward effectively in this policy area.\nThe feedback which my team obtained during the months preceding our presidency and in the technical meetings which we organised in Malta early on in our presidency was crucial to inform and fine tune our final proposals.\nThe support of other member states, the European Commission, WHO, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and European stakeholder organisations, was immensely valuable in assisting Malta to reach its goals for the presidency.\nI believe that the value of informal events bringing together a diverse array of experts, politicians and stakeholders together should not be underestimated. It is necessary for all players in the health sector to keep an open dialogue and exchange of views to enable results to be achieved.\nI consider the closure of"}

{"idx": "5912", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The ACLU of Ohio and others sued Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted on Wednesday over the state's process of removing ineligible voters from voter rolls.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio - A federal lawsuit filed Wednesday is suing Ohio Secretary of State over how state officials remove inactive voters from the rolls.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of Ohio A. Phillip Randolph Institute and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, argues people are removed from Ohio voter rolls in violation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also called the \"Motor Voter\" law.\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted said the state manages its voter rolls in compliance with both federal and state laws and has been complying a 2012 settlement requiring voter rolls to be scrutinized and maintained.\n\"This lawsuit is politically motivated, election-year politics, is a waste of taxpayer dollars, and opens the door for voter fraud in Ohio,\" Husted said in a statement.\nThe federal Motor Voter law prohibits states from removing voters for failing to vote. But it also allows states to establish a supplemental process for removing voters who have moved without updating their addresses.\nIn Ohio, the secretary of state's office sends a notice to registered voters who don't vote in elections for a period of time, generally two years, or change their address through the U.S. Postal Service asking them to confirm their registration.\nIf the voter does not respond to the notice or update voter registration information and does not vote or sign a petition within four years, the secretary of state can cancel the voter's registration.\nFor example, someone who did not vote in the 2011 election to repeal Senate Bill 5 nor the 2012 presidential election (primary or general) nor the 2013 primary election would have received a notice that year. If that voter doesn't update or confirm his or her address or does not vote in any election after that, including the 2016 presidential election, the registration would be canceled in 2017.\nThe suit, in the U.S. Southern District Court of Ohio, argues the state is wrong to assume voters are inactive because they have moved. They point to part of the Motor Voter law that requires \"reliable second-hand information\" to determine someone has moved.\nThe notice sent to inactive voters is more like a voter registration form, the complaint says, and is confusing to voters. As a result of a statewide purge last summer, thousands of Ohioans had to cast provisional ballots on Election Day and their votes were later not counted because they weren't registered, according to the complaint.\n\"In Cuyahoga County alone, approximately 40,000 individuals were unlawfully purged merely for choosing not to vote, and a disproportionate number came from low-income neighborhoods and communities of color,\" Andre Washington, the President of the Ohio APRI chapter, said in a news release.\nThe suit seeks a court order that Husted and boards of election immediately stop the supplemental process and restore all voter registrations that were canceled through the method.\nIn 2011, several Ohio counties had more registered voters than eligible voters. Conservative watchdog groups Judicial Watch and True the Vote sued, arguing the state had not done its job in maintaining clean voter rolls.\nThe state settled, and Husted agreed to take several steps to cancel ineligible voter registrations, including matching data with national databases and the Ohio Bureau of Motor"}

You return what you stole or your apology takes on a hollow ring.\"\nHistory cannot be undone; anything we do now must inevitably be an expression of regret and an affirmation of our better values as a nation, not an accounting which balances or erases. . . . That is now beyond anyone's power.\nThe politics of race with respect to African American reparations might begin with an analysis of one root of the continuing problem of race in America - that found within the White American community. Since the generation of racial tension by historic White America, this country has continued to show \"a particular reluctance to absorb people of African descent.\" While progress has and continues to be made, this progress has been slow, cautious, and incremental, resulting in fragmented and often incomplete gains. The reluctance on the part of White America has again become obvious in the movement for African American reparations.\nWhile the courts have suggested African American reparations would be better achieved via congressional legislation, the white congressional leadership has been reluctant to even discuss the possibility of reparations for the past wrongs of America, indeed White America.\nIn response to the reluctance of White America to absorb Black America through reparations, one commentator questions \"Where is the responsible white leadership? . . . When I think about the Southern Baptist Convention's apology two years ago for its defense of slavery in the past, I am hopeful that something more positive is happening out in the rest of America than here in official Washington.\" Once African American reparations legislation moves from committees to the congressional floor for debate, there can be more opportunity for review, discussion, and consideration of the issue. If nothing else, the existence of continuing race problems and their underlying sources and contribution to the perpetuation of race problems today can be acknowledged and addressed.\nAnd, while leadership is one of the cruxes of the problem, the issue of reluctance within the general white community is felt even deeper - grounded in fear and ignorance. The existence, or even the discussion, of the politics of inclusion, and the reality of changing demographics threatens the status quo power structure and its components. Power is a tremendous tool, but the fear of losing that power is even more potent. With White America having founded the power structures in the United States and presently, for the most part, directing and controlling them, there exists a fear of increased competition and the possibility of sharing, or even losing that power and control to others.\nAfrican American reparations requires an admission of wrongdoing and an attendant guilt, which are in-and-of-themselves difficult for White America to accept. In addition, this admission, particularly because of the expansiveness and depth of the past and persistent wrongdoing, even when compared to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, threatens the very structure that the wrongdoing created and maintains. In determining the willingness to discuss and then accept the alternative of reparations, the repairing group must come to terms with the leveling effect of reparations, thereby creating a tension between the morality of repairing those harmed and the possibility of sharing power and control with those it has and continues to oppress and disqualify.\nAs such, this is a difficult position for White America, and the record of the white congressional leadership reveals little effort or even interest in repairing or discussing reparations - the justifications, the continuing problems, the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of reparations, and the potential alternatives.

{"idx": "5916", "prompt": "Continue the following text: At times, the world of financial services appears to be littered with verbal debris. Unfortunately, through slick advertising, it is adorned in fine linen. This makes it nearly impossible for those on the outside to tell if they are receiving good advice or bad advice. How can you tell if an advisor has your interests at heart, or his? In this article, we will address these issues as we pull back the curtain and peak behind the veil. Follow along as we take a brief look at the world of financial advice and try to separate the good from the bad.\nGood advice is well worth the price.\nThere are many conflicts of interest in the financial services industry. One of the most common conflicts involves compensation, which for many, is transaction based. For instance, let\u2019s assume if an advisor sells Product A, they will receive a commission. Moreover, if they sell a lot of Product A, they will win a trip to an exotic destination. Therefore, selling Product A becomes a focus of the advisor. This is a very common scenario in the \u201csales-oriented,\u201d brokerage world. Compensation is the primary driver for many who render financial advice. This tends to place the focus on the advisor rather than the client, which is of course, a clear conflict of interest. Unfortunately, most clients are unaware of it. In addition, a large segment of the financial services industry has no legal obligation to disclose this fact, nor are they inclined to do so. There are many conflicts, but we will leave them for another time.\nHow can you tell if advice is good or bad? Many times, you cannot. In addition, when you can, it is often too late. For example, clients who were advised to load up on tech stocks in late 1999 would not have realized it was bad advice until their portfolio began to implode. Nevertheless, even in early 2000, many experts were advising precisely that. If we fail to learn from the past, we are destined to repeat our mistakes.\nWhere does advice originate? Referring to the definition above, advice is an \u201copinion.\u201d Moreover, opinion stems from ones motive. Therefore, it is essential to understand an advisor\u2019s motive. If the advisor is self-serving, the advice is likely to be biased. Even under the best of circumstances, this issue presents a tremendous challenge for clients. What can a client do to minimize the possibility of bad advice? Choose a good advisor. Here is a prudent step in this process.\nIn a survey of investors conducted about eight years ago, it was discovered that over 70% of clients did not know the difference between a broker and an investment advisor. To minimize the chance of working with an advisor who is selling product, make sure you are working with an investment advisor. It is even better to choose an investment advisor who is independent as opposed to one working for a large institution. I am not suggesting all brokers are dishonest. To the contrary, there are honest and dishonest individuals in all occupations. Working with an independent investment advisor simply minimizes your risk. Let\u2019s explain this now.\nAlthough there are many differences between a broker and an investment advisor, the following table highlights the difference in their requirement to disclose information to clients.\nAn investment advisor must provide full and complete disclosure of all material facts pertaining to the client-advisor relationship. Moreover, because an investment advisor must adhere to a fiduciary standard, clients have a greater degree of protection compared to working with a broker.\nA client can take additional precautions to minimize the risk of receiving and following faulty advice beyond choosing an investment advisor.

Across the table against the wall, next to the hutch, sat a mostly full 5-gallon water jug \u2014 now a necessity.\nHigh nitrate levels in her well made that decision for her.\n\"I don't live in a Third World country and I'm buying my water as far out as I can see,\" she stated. \"This is the plan, this is how we will get our water.\"\nAgriculture contributed more than $550 million to St. Croix County's economy in 2014, according to the most recent information from University of Wisconsin-Extension, and employed roughly 10 percent of the population.\nBut alongside the economic contributions, some residents believe large-scale farming could contribute contaminants \u2014 namely nitrates \u2014 to their drinking water.\nNitrates, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, can enter groundwater from a number of origins: some through farming practices such as spreading manure, some through household sources including lawn fertilizer or septic systems.\nIn December 2016, on the heels of an application to more than triple the animal count at Emerald Sky Dairy, the St. Croix County Board established a committee to study ground and surface water quality in lieu of enacting a moratorium against large-scale farms categorized as concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs.\nMembers were tasked with developing \"sound, science-based recommendations\" for policies to protect the county's water quality and met for the first time just days after a late-December 2016 spill at Emerald Sky Dairy. The spill went unreported until the end of March.\nImproved data-gathering, transparency and weighing current farming and environmental regulations dominated a round of Water Quality Study Group recommendations overwhelmingly approved by the St. Croix County Board at its October meeting.\nThe recommendations stem from nearly nine months of research and discussions by the study group, which enlisted county supervisors, Community Development staff, UW-Extension staff, area farmers and other citizen members.\nOut of more than 30 recommendations, the group narrowed the list to eight for the board.\n\"These were things that were short-term goals,\" said citizen member Tom Zwald, whose family operates a dairy farm in St. Croix County. \"We excluded anything that was long term when we did this just because these are things we can focus on right here in the now.\"\nFor Kim Dupre, a resident of Emerald township who heads Emerald Clean Water for All, a grassroots organization aimed at protecting the community's water supply, the recommendations signal a \"journey \u2014 not a destination.\"\n\"It'd be really easy for the recommendations to end up on a shelf, in a binder and have nobody ever look at them again,\" Dupre said. \"So, our next step is to make sure there is follow-through on these recommendations. That's what I'll be advocating for.\"\nLenz, a citizen member of the Ground and Surface Water Quality Study Group, came away from the nine months of biweekly meetings surprised and disappointed by how little regulatory control is at the local level.\n\"I feel like the really hard recommendations that I would"}

The readiness certificate may help improve that score.\n\u201cWhat we need to figure out is: what\u2019s the benefit of giving this assessment? Is there a benefit to the student?\u201d Superintendent Brian Maher asked board members.\nMaher has not yet asked board members to vote on adding the extra assessment.\nThe measure of college or career readiness is a new one for South Dakota. The state added the metric to its annual school \u201creport cards\u201d in the last year after changes in federal education law became fully cemented.\nThe report cards award points to districts based on assessment scores and the type of coursework students take, e.g. Advanced Placement tests or career and technical education classes.\nIn Sioux Falls, assessment scores currently only measure ACT scores and scores from Smarter Balanced, South Dakota\u2019s statewide standardized test. Both of those tests are primarily academic, but adding NCRC to the mix would give the district a sense of what types of jobs students could handle upon graduation, Assistant Superintendent Teresa Boysen said.\nMore: Schools have fought childhood obesity for decades. Their efforts aren't working.\nThe readiness test \u2013 administered by the Department of Labor \u2013 measures job skills. Questions ask students practical questions from counting back change to reading and interpreting information from charts and documents. Students then earn a certificate they can use to show employers their skill set.\nSince 2013, nearly 100 schools statewide have begun using NCRC, and the number continues to grow, said Laura Scheibe, director of career and technical education for the state Department of Education.\n\u201cRoughly half of our public school kids are taking it,\u201d Scheibe said.\nBoard Member Carly Reiter questioned the measure of the NCRC test, asking if it's an \"easy out\" for students who don't score well on more academic-focused tests like the ACT or Smarter Balanced.\nBut state officials say the tests are intended to show different skills.\n\"You can't equate an NCRC certificate to an ACT score because they're different things ... it's another piece of information to demonstrate whether a student is ready to move on,\" Scheibe said.\nNot all students in South Dakota go on to college. For those who choose to go straight into the workforce, NCRC is a way to show employers what they're ready for, Scheibe said.\nThe readiness assessment isn't something Scheibe sees becoming mandatory for high school students, but since it contributes to how districts are held accountable for student success, she anticipates more schools will sign on to offer the test.\nMaher expressed skepticism of the state's report card and the picture it paints of student preparedness. He noted the difference in accountability scores between the Brandon Valley and Sioux Falls School Districts.\nBrandon's score showed 66 percent of students ready for college or a career, more than double Sioux Falls' score of 32 percent, but Maher said he doesn't see Sioux Falls students as any less prepared.\n\"The scores, I really don\u2019t think they give any"}

When New York launched in launched in 1968, it gave a platform to some of the great writers, editors and designers ever to work in the medium, including Clay Felker, Tom Wolfe, Gloria Steinem, Milton Glaser and Jimmy Breslin.\nIn subsequent decades, it came to be known for excellence and innovation, covering New York City life, culture, politics, finance, entertainment, dining, and more, and at the same time transcending geographic boundaries and becoming a national magazine that viewed the world through the prism of New York. Since 2004, it has won more National Magazine Awards than any other publication, including Magazine of the Year in 2013.\nIn some ways, that legacy of excellence has allowed the brand to aggressively redefine itself in the last decade, with the creation of the vertical websites, including The Cut, a style-and-culture site for women; Grub Street, a food site; Select/All, which covers technology; The Strategist, a shopping and commerce site; and Vulture, which covers culture and entertainment. NYmag.com serves as a portal, hosting Daily Intelligencer (covering news and politics), The Strategist, and Select All on its URL, in addition to restaurant listings and other service content such as travel.\nThe most recent vertical, The Strategist, is an ecommerce site, allowing visitors to read about products of interest, organized in broad categories, and then buy them without having to leave the site.\nMany media companies produce vertical sites with distinct branding, and they do it for several reasons. Separate branding is valuable in reaching new audiences, including groups that might not engage with the well-known parent brand for some reason. Then, once engaged, they serve as feeder sites for the main brand, driving traffic and subscriptions. Web verticals also create advertising inventory on synergistic topics for magazine brands. New York Media began launching digital verticals in 2006, starting with traditional coverage areas like news and politics with Daily Intelligencer), and food and restaurants with Grub Street. The company\u2019s verticals have grown into recognizable brands in their own right. \u201cWe saw the opportunity to grow audiences around topics they were passionate about,\u201d Hallac says. Underscoring the business case for the verticals strategy is the fact that now, the company\u2019s overall advertising is about 60% digital, he adds.\nInterestingly, New York Media has not struggled with the inherent tension between content and commerce. That dynamic\u2014avoiding the appearance of pay-to-play or publishing puff pieces on advertisers\u2014has become even more challenging as pressure on advertising has increased and marketers favor native and custom content.\nFor Hallac, the key is to ensure editorial independence. \u201cShopping recommendations have been in New York magazine\u2019s DNA since the very first issue, with the Best Bets column\u2014the only standing feature that has appeared in every issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Strategist takes its name from New York\u2019s seven-time National Magazine Award-winning print service section, the present home of Best Bets. We realized that there is no inherent conflict between affiliate revenue and editorial\u2014we are compensated to be trustworthy. The Strategist, he adds, saw revenue grow by 400% in 2017."}

In fact, East Carolina may have the best path to a big bowl game in the new College Football Playoff format than North Carolina, Duke, NC State or Wake Forest may have. The highest ranked conference champion from the \u201cGroup of Five\u201d conferences (American Athletic Conference, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West Conference and Sun Belt) will be given a guaranteed spot in the big revenue bowl line-up determined by the College Football Playoff selection committee.\nWas Spurrier out of line? As some have already noted, Ohio State and Michigan could say something similar about playing Kentucky or Vanderbilt most years. Take your pick of Colorado or Utah in the Pac-12, or Kansas in the Big 12 or Wake Forest or Duke in the ACC.\nSouth Carolina hosts East Carolina on September 6, between home games with Texas A&M and Georgia. Each of the last three seasons for South Carolina has ended with a bowl victory over a team from the Big Ten.\nFor what it is worth, East Carolina is 0-4 all-time against the Big Ten, with all four losses coming against Illinois by an average margin of defeat of 13.5 points."}

Or maybe a relative, say a reliably kind aunt, worked for an employer who was signed up for a program where staffers received them for free and so every often, you\u2019d find yourself surprised by a handful of sealed plastic bags of five, delighted. Because in a life of uncertainty, the SEPTA token was one of the only sure things in this world. You could have spent all your money on records, or later, beers, and been alone downtown on a forlorn corner with dead batteries in your Walkman, but at the very least, you had a token. And a token would get you home.\nThe token in your hand represented not just safety, but also possibility. Those plastic bags could get you to Roosevelt Mall, where you could skateboard and smoke cigarettes. They could take you to a girlfriend or a boyfriend in Havertown, long though the ride would be. Perhaps most importantly, they could get you to South Street, where the world you most wanted to inhabit waited with copies of the New Musical Express and big, cheap slices of pizza. If you were ridiculously flush with them, they might even work as an arcade token, depending which one you were in. It was also a sweet move to drop them in your penny loafers; you never know when they might come in handy. The token gave you endless space within a gilded frame, in which you could paint a teenage masterpiece that you could also grow old in. It was magic.\nAnd now, it is gone -- or, more accurately, going. But it leaves a legacy that seems to stretch back forever. The SEPTA token as we\u2019re considering it here today dates back to 1965, when SEPTA was formed out of two previous Philly public transportation agencies. As a work of commercial art, it might have been the most perfect vehicle the SEPTA logo ever found. The token felt sleek in your hand, and the copper stripe across the silver background was more visually satisfying than any United States coin ever minted. Its parent was even better-looking. The SEPTA token\u2019s immediate predecessor dated from as far back as 1940, when the PTC (Philadelphia Transportation Company) first issued its equally iconic tokens. Sometimes, somehow, you\u2019d wind up with one of these in your pocket and wonder how they\u2019d managed to stay in circulation so long?\nIn recent years, people, present company included, wondered that about the SEPTA token, too. New York City had already raised generations on their Metrocard and were transitioning out of it altogether before SEPTA\u2019s Key program was much more than a PowerPoint deck on a slow, company-issued laptop somewhere.

You wouldn\u2019t guess the firm is heading a highly controversial effort to build the first uranium mining and milling operation east of the Mississippi River.\nThe parking lot, holding several cars and pickup trucks, is near the \u201cEnd of State Maintenance\u201d road sign.

The denouement is coming after several years of intense lobbying by proponents and opponents, hundreds of thousands of dollars in studies, and trips paid for by the mining firm to send legislators to Paris. It is pitting neighbor against neighbor, splitting the state Republican Party, and sparking late-night political intrigues in an area that seems better suited for Andy Griffith and Aunt Bea.\nIf Virginia dumps the mining ban, it will be taking a big step into uncharted territory. The state has no experience regulating uranium mining or milling, although a recent government panel did make up a list of what must be done to regulate the industry. The chore would take several years and involve hiring 30 new professionals to monitor drinking water, groundwater, labor conditions, and air pollution.\nThe mining project could make money\u2014some claim up to $7 billion, depending on the fickle global prices for uranium. Investors include a number of mysterious Canadians and a local family headed by a retired U.S. Foreign Service officer named Walter Coles.

Areas underneath the farm\u2019s rolling pastures, as well as more than 2,000 acres of leased land, could be ripped up to reach the radioactive ore. Economic studies say that 1,000 jobs may be created in a region wracked by the loss of thousands of textile, furniture, and tobacco jobs. The unemployment rate in Danville, the largest nearby city, is 9.3 percent, among the worst in the state.\nThe risks of pushing on with uranium mining are immense. The National Academy of Sciences warned in a 2011 study that \u201cthere are many unknowns\u201d and that \u201csteep hurdles\u201d needed to be surmounted if mining goes forward.

But he clearly touched a nerve in a state that\u2019s ranked 35th in the country for teacher pay.\nWhile lawmakers in both parties recognize that teacher pay needs to be higher, $35,000 really isn\u2019t a terrible salary for someone who just graduated college and doesn\u2019t yet have a family to support. My first job out of college paid far less, and I still managed to pay my bills and have plenty left over for beer.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the $35,000 salary figure refers to mostly rural districts where there\u2019s no locally funded salary supplement. Urban Wake County offers a starting salary of $41,037 this year.\nThe bigger problem with North Carolina\u2019s teacher pay is how little your paycheck increases as you log years of experience in the classroom. The base salary for teachers with 10 years of experience is only $40,550, and teachers have to work 25 years before they reach the top of the pay scale: $51,300.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that many of the best teachers take higher paying jobs in school administration or leave the education profession entirely. Private sector salaries often increase far faster for high-performing workers.\nSo far, that effort hasn\u2019t succeeded because it\u2019s very difficult to make that change without shortchanging veteran teachers \u2014 who understandably expect to earn more than their less-seasoned colleagues.\nImagine you\u2019re an elementary school teacher living in the Halifax County town of Littleton. You could drive 15 minutes to the nearest elementary in your county and make a starting salary of $35,000. Or you could commute 30 minutes to an elementary school in Brunswick County, Va., and earn a starting salary of $39,011.\nTo stay in Halifax \u2014 one of the state\u2019s historically troubled school districts \u2014 you\u2019d have to be super loyal to your home county or someone who the Virginia school didn\u2019t want to hire.\nBut there\u2019s also competition between urban and rural North Carolina school districts for the best teachers. I asked Douglas Miller, assistant superintendent for Northampton County Schools, if teacher retention is a problem in the rural county along the Virginia border. \u201cYes, we have teachers that leave for other states, but the majority leave for Wake County or Durham,\u201d he said.\nNorthampton has a small local salary supplement, but six counties don\u2019t have one at all.

Montandon is a writer (full disclosure: he was my editor at Fast Company for several months before leaving to join a startup last year), so his first instinct was to write about his experiences to work through them. He published a story in Gawker that chronicled his journey\u2013including going to the LAPD and exploring the details of his brother\u2019s case. \u201cIt was hard, but it was also extremely cathartic and satisfying, too,\u201d he explains.\nWhat Do Charity Concerts Accomplish?\nWriting left him wanting to do more. Every day, new stories about people getting needlessly shot were making headlines. Montandon\u2019s friend, Josh Mills, an L.A.-based music manager and publicist, was going through a similar range of thoughts and emotions. Even though he had not personally lost anyone in the Sandy Hook shootings, the incident had left him reeling. As they chatted about all of this, Mills and Montandon started thinking about various forms of activism they could pursue and of course, this led to the question of how you even begin to chip away at a problem as immense as gun violence. They settled on throwing a charity concert called Fun Lovers Unite.\nOrganizing a night full of music and comedy might seem like a strange way to tackle something as dark and serious as gun violence. It seems like a soft, frivolous form of activism compared to, say, reaching out to senators or drafting a petition. But to Montandon, it felt like the perfect approach. Gun violence is one of the most hotly contested issues in America; he had no interest in getting into policy debates about second amendment rights. At the same time, it\u2019s an issue that many people don\u2019t like to think about at all, because the details are so grim and horrible.\nMontandon also likes the fact that concerts are inherently fun. Throwing a concert allows him to highlight the beauty of his brother\u2019s life, rather than the meaninglessness of his death. \u201cIt is a combination of pragmatism and passion,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to do some little thing for the cause, while celebrating my brother\u2019s life.\u201d After all, his brother had a huge influence on his cultural life.\n\u201cHe really introduced me to comedy and music in many ways. One of my earliest memories is listening to Steve Martin\u2019s Wild and Crazy Guy on cassette with my brother and dad. I was too young to understand many of the jokes\u2013\u201cGrandpa bought a rubber!\u201d\u2013so I looked at my dad and brother and when they laughed, I laughed. Later he got me into Mel Brooks and the Talking Heads and the Clash and Minor Threat and Led Zeppelin and then later Coen brothers and art movies\u2026Truffaut and French New Wave movies\u2026he loved art and people and wanted to make movies for his career,\u201d Montandon remembers.\nIn November of 2014, Montandon and Mills put together a sold-out charity show called Fun Lovers Unite at a cool L.A. venue called The Echo."}

Accurate fitness tracking. Smartphone notifications. Lots of functionality for the price.\nThe easy-to-use Fitbit Inspire HR fitness tracker packs all the basic features you need to monitor your health and exercise for an affordable price.\nReplacing Fitbit's Alta and Alta HR, the Inspire ($69.95) and Inspire HR ($99.95) track step count, distance, and basic sleep metrics. If you want more detailed insight on your health and fitness, it's worth the extra $30 for the Inspire HR, which we're reviewing here. In addition to continuous heart rate monitoring, the Inspire HR tracks sleep stages (REM, deep, and light sleep) and measures your cardio fitness levels. And like Fitbit's Versa Lite ($159.95), it's very simple to use. For under $100, it provides accurate fitness tracking, smartphone notifications, and up to five days of battery life in a stylish, swim-proof design, making it our Editors' Choice for entry-level fitness trackers.\nThe Inspire HR is small and unobstrusive. You can pair it with jewelry without feeling like your wrist is overcrowded. It's available in black with a black silicone wristband, lilac (which looks more like a dark purple) with a lilac silicone wristband, or black with a white silicone wristband. As you can see, I tested the lilac model, but swapped the silicone band out for a stainless steel mesh strap ($69.95). The Inspire HR features 5 ATM of water resistance, so you can also wear it in the pool and in the shower without damaging it. Unlike the standard Inspire, you can't attach the Inspire HR to Fitbit's clip accessory ($19.95) to wear on your bag or clothes.\nThe plastic case that houses the tracker is shaped similarly to the Charge 3, with a concave back, but the heart rate sensor makes it a little thick toward the bottom. Despite this, the Inspire HR is super lightweight and comfortable to wear all day, including to the gym and in bed. On the right side of the case is a button that turns the display on and off and takes you back to the previous screen. A long press brings you to battery percentage and shortcuts to turn screen wake and notifications on or off.\nWith 128-by-72-pixel resolution, the Inspire HR's monochrome OLED display is sharp enough and bright. But measuring 0.72 inches diagonally, it could be bigger for the size of the case. Instead, the display is surrounded by a pretty thick bezel on all sides. That means you're only able to view one tile of information at a time, and will have to scroll a few times to read through long text messages.\nThankfully, Fitbit has phased out the tap screen (as seen on the Alta and the Charge 2). The display on the Inspire HR is completely sensitive to touch, so you can swipe up to see your metrics and down for access to different apps. Swiping across the display feels responsive and swift, even when sweaty at the gym.\nUnder the hood is an accelerometer, a heart rate"}

Designed for the mobile TV addict, the Slingbox needs a 256Kbps upstream broadband connection and allows you to watch your TV from any PC with sufficient broadband bandwidth. The device consists of a box that sits inline with your TV, set-top box (cable or satellite), and router. Using the SlingPlayer, you can channel surf your living room TV from just about anywhere.\nWhat about your smartphone? At the beginning of the year, Sling Media showed off SlingPlayer Mobile for Windows Mobile and PocketPC devices. Offering support for a number of popular Windows Mobile devices such as the UTStarcom PPC6700 and Treo 700 among others, SlingPlayer Mobile intends to bring the same SlingBox experience to smartphones on 3G networks once it is available in March.\nBut there's one small problem. None of the major cellular providers are willing to open their airwaves to Sling Media.\n\"We have no immediate plans to run that service,\" says Jeffrey Nelson, spokesman for Verizon Wireless, the country's second-largest carrier. \"What runs on our network are our services.\"\nThe reasoning behind the 3G providers' decision is simple. SlingPlayer Mobile competes with the carriers' own video offerings, and Verizon, Cingular, and Sprint do not want to lose potential revenue from their own Vcast and MobiTV video services to a competing service. It's a shame for SlingBox owners, because the video offerings from the cellular carriers are relatively uninspiring. Besides, nothing beats being able to change the channel to what you want, when you want. (And when you're watching TV from your smartphone, you don't have to worry about your spouse complaining that you're changing channels too fast or too often.) And unlike the cellular offerings, Slingbox is a pure IP play. Once you buy the equipment, there's no cost to use it.\nUnfortunately for Sling Media and Slingbox owners, Cingular, Sprint, and Verizon seem to be holding all the cards. They control their networks and could throttle Slingbox traffic to the point where it's unviewable or even block it altogether. They also run the risk of alienating their customers with such a move, but when it comes to 3G networks in the US, those three are currently the only game in town. Consumers who need 3G wireless service won't have any alternative until companies like T-Mobile and US Cellular get their own 3G networks up and running. If a critical mass of customers complains loudly enough, perhaps the carriers will reconsider. But until then, it's a case of the three 800lb. gorillas against a spider monkey."}

The original attic space was in a state of disrepair -- serving as a place for pigeons to roost and as a place to dry clothing.\nDue to unsatisfying results, some of the original beams were replaced by new and together they form the truss, which is an essential part of the design. Upon the old truss, a new one was built, also containing a layer of insulation. The whole roof is covered by sheathings made of steel with standing seams in the color of anthracite.\nWith the structural updates in place, the architects then developed a new design scheme where the over-arching palette is bright white, which helps to visually enlarge the spaces, as well as visually connecting them. In addition, new dormers were constructed in a few of the rooms to create more headroom.\nThis is an intriguing set of stairs leading up to the upper floor -- it seems like a hybrid of a standard stair and an alternating tread stair.\nUpstairs, there is a 'chill-out' space that includes a cozy \"space module\" for the kids to play in. The apartment uses an eco-friendly heating pump to heat its interior, and mineral wool was used as insulation.\nTo see more, visit at26_architects, Facebook and Instagram."}

But there are four events tomorrow that, if nothing else, could set the table for what happens a week later.\nDonald Trump currently leads the most recent polls in the three primary states for March 8: Michigan, Mississippi, and Idaho. Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich seem to be moving up in Michigan, with Marco Rubio steadily slipping into a poor fourth place. Ted Cruz would appear to have a shot in Mississippi and Idaho, particularly if Trump has suffered some long-term damage from the pounding he\u2019s been taking from every direction of late. Hawaii is a bit of a mystery caucus with a very small GOP and no public polling, though Cruz has gotten a couple of notable local endorsements (including one from the only Republican in the state Senate).\nThe stakes for the various candidates in Tuesday\u2019s contests are clear enough. As on Super Tuesday and over this last weekend, Trump and Cruz are jockeying for top billing and the largest delegate haul. Kasich needs a strong \u2014 perhaps second-place \u2014 finish in Michigan as a springboard to the winner-take-all primary next week in his home state of Ohio, which in turn will determine whether he can continue his campaign.\nMarco Rubio, who is 100 percent focused on avoiding a calamitous loss in his own home-state primary next week, would likely prefer that tomorrow\u2019s results are wiped out by some overriding news story. He\u2019s unlikely to finish higher than third anywhere, and is in danger of falling short of the 15 percent minimum thresholds for delegates in Michigan, Mississippi, and Idaho. Since Hawaii has no threshold, he might snag a delegate or two in the wee hours of the morning, but that\u2019s not much of a consolation. Since Trump losing is a condition precedent to an ultimate triumph by any Establishment-backed candidate, that\u2019s where the rooting interests of Team Rubio will lie."}

Does that sound like an audience clamouring for more news? Photo by Nicolas Alejandro, Creative Commons license CC BY 2.0.\nThe federal government seems to mistakenly believe the Canadian news industry\u2019s problems can be cured with money, announcing millions of dollars of support in last week\u2019s budget.\nBut as one of this country\u2019s digital journalism pioneers (I founded a popular online investigative news site called Public Eye before such ventures became fashionable), I believe those woes may have as much to do with whether Canadians actually want news about their own country, and whether newsrooms have not just the resources, but also the willingness, to produce such stories.\nAnd unless we treat those afflictions, no amount of money will turn our news industry around.\nIn fairness to the politicians and bureaucrats who decided to dole out $595 million over five years to support Canadian journalism, many of their potential beneficiaries are also convinced that the bottom line in solving the country\u2019s news media crisis can be found in their own bottom lines.\nFor example, two years ago, Public Policy Forum president Edward Greenspon, the former editor-in-chief of the Globe and Mail, released a government-contracted study called The Shattered Mirror.\nThat\u2019s fine, as far as it goes.\nBut there often seems to be an assumption that Canadians actually want public interest news about our country, in other words news about economic, environmental, health, political and social issues taking place within its borders. This is the product journalists have a societal mandate to produce. It\u2019s the most important thing we do. And it\u2019s easy for journalists and politicians to assume there is a demand for it because we associate with people who want it \u2014 from sources and existing audiences (such as you, dear reader) to supporters and lobbyists. But what about other Canadians?\nI\u2019ve found it difficult to answer that question with any certainty. Most of the data I\u2019ve come across concerns how often Canadians consume the news rather than the kind of news they actually consume.\nBut what we do know is that, when the Canadian Election Study surveyed over 7,500 people in 2015, more respondents correctly remembered the last name of Russia\u2019s prime minister (62.8 per cent) than they did Canada\u2019s Governor General (20.2 per cent), its finance minister (17.2 per cent) and even the premier of their own province (60.1 per cent). This suggests many of us are not routinely reading, listening to and watching news about Canada\u2019s affairs of state.\nMoreover, why should we? Because of party discipline, which forces most provincial and federal elected representatives to vote the way their leaders tell them to rather than the way we might want them to, Canadians have little power over what happens in government between elections. That means there\u2019s little reason to pay attention to public interest during those years. Indeed, paying attention could easily lead to feelings of impotence. And that\u2019s not much of a foundation for a news industry.\nEven if Canadians wanted public interest news about their own country, journalists often don\u2019t have the information to produce such stories. Most of what happens in government happens in private, with its officials and the information they have about our country under lock and key.\nWhat happens in public is just for show: an expensive political theatre meant to convince Canadians that we live in a democracy. And it\u2019s exceedingly difficult for journalists to peak behind the theatre\u2019s curtain. The sources we\u2019re forced"}

Now, it's planning on sharing some of its IPO with the crafty people who made it a success.\nWith the IPO slated to price on Wednesday and start trading on Thursday, the initial stock sale will introduce many of Etsy's vendors into the rarified world of participating in initial stock sales. About 5 percent of the shares were set aside to sell to vendors and small investors, or the types of people who generally lack access to IPOs, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley set up a program that allowed vendors to buy between $100 to $2,500 of Etsy stock in advance of the IPO's pricing, with the bank waiving customary account fees for the program. Another 10 percent of shares were set aside for other small investors, according to the journal. The plan to reach out to smaller investors extends the folksy image that Etsy has carefully crafted during its 10-year history, with its goal of creating an \"Etsy economy\" that enables artists to support themselves through selling directly to consumers who value design over mass-produced merchandise.\nWith IPOs, \"you're always told, 'You can't participate. You're not part of a financial syndicate. Go away, little person,'\" Etsy vendor Jeni Sandberg told The Journal. She said she plans to buy the maximum allotment of $2,500 worth of stock. \"This, I want to do.\"\nEtsy didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nThe Brooklyn-based company is aiming to sell $267 million worth of shares, giving it a valuation of $1.78 billion. About 16.7 million shares will be sold between $14 to $16 per share, the company said last month.\nThat would give it a valuation that's higher than its e-commerce peers, with Bloomberg News noting that it would seek as much as 9.1 times its 2014 sales of $195.6 million. Parent-focused shopping site Zulily, by comparison, has a valuation of just 1.4 times its sales.\nWhile it may be exciting for vendors to take a stake in a high-profile IPO, there are risks to the venture. Etsy is deep in the red, and because it's planning to spend on hiring and an expansion, that could lead to prolonged losses. Investors aren't as patient today with money-losing dot-coms as they were a decade ago, thanks to the poor track record of many would-be Internet giants (remember Pets.com?).\nSome seller services may attract scrutiny, which could dampen volume growth, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said in a statement about the upcoming IPO.\n\"We have identified several examples of sellers sourcing from Alibaba (contrary to Etsy guidelines and sometimes at markups exceeding 30,000%) and possible trademark infringement,\" Luria noted.\nLuria, by the way, has started covering the stock with a \"neutral\" rating and a price target of $14, at the low end of the pricing range that Etsy has set."}

On Christmas Eve 1987, a new ritual began. The Matzoball, a party for Jewish singles held on the night when it was guaranteed they had absolutely nothing else to do, has been bringing nice Jewish boys and girls together for more than 25 years. Not a small number of married couples meet at the Matzoball, which is held in 15 cities across the country, from Austin to Scottsdale. The conceit of the Matzoball is so obvious that some might wonder why an enterprising Jewish capitalist didn\u2019t come up with the idea sooner. The enterprising Jewish capitalist who eventually did is my uncle, Andrew Rudnick.\nAll that he needed now was a catchy name. \u201cThe Heeb Hop\u201d and \u201cTribe Trot\u201d were early contenders, but my grandmother found both of them mildly offensive (\u201cI basically ran everything through my mother,\u201d Andy told me). The inspiration for the title that, for countless Jews across America, would soon become synonymous with Christmas Eve has an unlikely source. Fresh out of college, while trying to hack it as a nightlife promoter, Andy worked a day job at a real-estate company run by an Irish Catholic family. \u201cI used to get razzed by this old Irish guy who made fun of Jews for eating matzo balls, the schmuck brother-in-law of the owner,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I had to work for this guy. Behind his back, we used to call him, \u2018dem dere matzo ball.\u2019 \u201d One of Andy\u2019s friends suggested this would make a fitting moniker, and so he ran it by his mother. She gave him his blessing, and so he went back to Metro\u2019s owners, a pair of brothers named John and Patrick Lyons, with the news that he had created a name for the party and incorporated a group to sponsor the event. The Lyonses, who are Italian, thought that some Jews might find it offensive, \u201clike calling a party for Italians \u2018The Meatball.\u2019 \u201d Yet Andy assured them the party would be a success, and the Matzoball was born.\nA 1992 issue of Young Professional magazine.\nFrom the age of 6 until I graduated high school, I worked at the Matzoball.

Like the Chinese dry cleaner or La Cosa Nostra, the Matzoball was family business. Sure, he would pay us kids (my brother and cousins, who usually ripped tickets, and for whom a $50 bill was manna from heaven) but certainly not my parents or grandparents, who helped their beloved brother/son by taking money at the door.

Russian trappers and Cossacks established a post on the Sea of Okhotsk, in 1647.

The tech bellwether made its last dividend payment in 1995.\nHowever, the dividend brouhaha poses the question: \"Do Apple shareholders have a legal right to the cash, and could they sue Apple to get it?\"\nA famous example of suing a company to pay a dividend occurred almost 100 years ago, when the Dodge brothers sued Ford Motors(:F) to try to extract a dividend.\nIn 1916, the Dodge brothers sued Henry Ford for keeping his company's cash, nearly $60 million (remember when $60 million was a lot of money?) and not distributing it to shareholders. Ultimately, the Michigan Surpreme Court ruled in favor of the Dodge brothers and forced Ford to declare a dividend.\nThe major difference, however, between Apple in 2012 and Ford in 1916 is that Ford was a closely held company, says Lynn Stout, visiting professor of corporate law at Cornell Law School.\n\"Essentially, corporate law reserves the right to say that if the board doesn't want to pay a dividend, the only recourse shareholders have is to replace the board or get them to change their mind,\" Stout recently told TheStreet. \"Dodge v. Ford Motor still applied to closely held companies, but Apple is a public company.\"\nShe also explained that the Dodge v. Ford is frequently mis-cited, and is not applicable in this case.\n\"When you look at Dodge"}
{"idx": "5997", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Advanced Micro Devices avoids a lawsuit by agreeing to pay Intergraph a maximum of $25 million over the next four years.\nAdvanced Micro Devices on Monday settled a patent infringement dispute with Intergraph, avoiding a lawsuit and ending claims against AMD's customers.\nUnder the settlement, AMD will pay Intergraph a maximum of $25 million over the next four years. In return, AMD said, Intergraph will grant AMD a license to its Intergraph Clipper processor patents and will drop its patent claims against AMD.\nAMD will pay Intergraph $10 million, plus 2 percent of the profits from its processor sales for the three-year period beginning in 2005 and ending in 2007. The royalty payments are capped at $5 million per year, AMD said.\nIntergraph developed its Clipper processor for use in workstations that the company used to sell. Workstations are heavy-duty desktop computers generally designed for jobs such as mechanical design.\nIntergraph switched to Intel chips in 1993. But the patents that Intergraph obtained when designing the Clipper chip have become the basis for a number of patent infringement suits filed by Intergraph against companies such as AMD, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Intel.\nHuntsville, Ala.-based Intergraph is now out of the hardware business. The company focuses instead on services and software.\nIntergraph's agreement with AMD comes in the wake of a series of settlements with Intel for larger sums. In 1997, Intergraph sued Intel, claiming its Pentium chips infringed on the Clipper patents and that Intel also violated antitrust regulations. Although a judge threw out the antitrust portion of the case, Intel eventually settled the patent infringement claims for $300 million.\nLater, Intergraph sued Intel over its Itanium server chip. After court battles and a partial settlement of $150 million, Intel said last month that it would pay Intergraph an additional $225 million to settle the remaining claims.\nThat agreement brought all outstanding patent infringement litigation between Intel and Intergraph to a close. It also brought the total amount of settlement money promised to Intergraph by Intel to $675 million.\nIntergraph had also filed suit against Dell, Gateway and HP, claiming that they also violated its Clipper patents. The latest Intel settlement resolved the dispute with Dell, which has an indemnification agreement with Intel. The disputes with Gateway and HP are ongoing. The case against Gateway and HP is expected to be heard in August.\nAMD said that its agreement carries through to its customers and that Intergraph will drop all claims of infringement against computers that use AMD chips, including those in Intergraph's pending lawsuits.\nThus, Intergraph's pledge to discontinue legal proceedings against AMD customers should help HP and might also help Gateway in their Intergraph suits, the AMD representative said, as both companies have offered AMD chips in their computers. Right now, HP sells several different PCs and servers with AMD processors, while Gateway sold them for more than a year, ending in September 2001."}

Holmes, 37, will become the nominee of the Carroll County Democratic Central Committee.\n\"Being state's attorney is not just about knowing the law, it's about making choices and it's about managing people,\" she said yesterday.\n\"I believe that I will bring a fresh perspective and new approach to how the state's attorney's office is run.\"\nMrs. Holmes will run against the winner of the Republican primary in September. Twenty-year incumbent Thomas E. Hickman is running against one of his former employees, Frederick County Assistant State's Attorney Jerry F. Barnes.\nMr. Hickman could not be reached yesterday for comment.\nMr. Barnes said of Mrs. Holmes' entry into the race: \"I think this is very exciting. It's interesting, and it should put a good perspective with three different views on what the future of the prosecutor's office should be.\"\nMrs. Holmes said that one of her priorities would be to change the way the Carroll County Narcotics Task Force operates. The task force, a cooperative group made up of officers from the state police, sheriff's department and the city of Westminster, has been under fire over how it handles its money. The state's attorney is one of the group's policy makers.\n\"I'm not criticizing what they're doing, but I would like to change things so that they [the officers] can go out there and do their jobs,\" she said.\nMrs. Holmes said yesterday she would not plan to replace the staff attorneys in the office. \"I have met all of them, and I have great respect for each of them,\" she said.\nDemocrats have been searching for a state's attorney candidate since fall, when Carroll County Democratic Central Committee Chairman L. Gregory Pecoraro proclaimed his party had a good chance to take the post, which has been in Republican hands since the 1970s.\nMr. Pecoraro said yesterday that he asked Mrs. Holmes in March if she wanted to run for the office. She came forward when she realized the party needed a candidate, he said.\n\"I'm thrilled somebody we asked so early on has come back with a positive answer,\" he said.\n\"She's respected. She's a good attorney. She's been active in the community.\n\"She's a person of real integrity, and I think she's going to set a very different tone for the office.\"\nMrs. Holmes, who began practicing law in Carroll County in February, has been an attorney since 1982. She graduated from Rutgers University in New Jersey, where she was born, in 1976.\nShe moved to Maryland and was a manager for Proctor and Gamble until she entered the University of Maryland School of Law. She was a staff attorney with the U.S. Department of Energy until joining a Baltimore law firm.\nShe took some time off from law to raise her three children -- ages 2 to 7 -- and resumed her law practice in February, focusing on family law. She has been married 12 years.\nLast night, Republican Central Committee Chairman Thomas W. Bowen said that either of his party's candidates could win the general election against Mrs. Holmes.\n\"Quite frankly, I don't think it's time for a change in that office,\" Mr. Bowen said. \"It really surprises me that people in Carroll"}
{"idx": "5999", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: For more than half a century, Werner Herzog has been one of the world\u2019s most iconoclastic filmmakers, making the movies he wants to make, where he wants to make them (he\u2019s said to be the only feature-film director to have shot on all seven continents), and how he wants to make them (he eschews storyboards, preferring to let his imagination dictate on set how a film plays out).\nHerzog\u2019s output is astonishing: more than 70 feature films, documentaries, and television projects. So is his versatility. His subjects range from a conquistador\u2019s search for El Dorado, the land of gold (1972\u2019s Aguirre, the Wrath of God) to an obsessive rubber baron determined to build an opera house in the Peruvian jungle (1982\u2019s Fitzcarraldo) to volcanoes (2016\u2019s Netflix film Into the Inferno) to the existential consequences resulting from the internet (2016\u2019s Lo and Behold: Reveries of a Connected World).\nThe stories about the 76-year-old filmmaker are as famous as his films. He once placed an entire cast under hypnosis (for his 1976 feature film Heart of Glass) to achieve the somnambulistic trance he was looking for. He spent two years figuring out how to lug a 320-ton steamship through the Amazon jungle while shooting Fitzcarraldo. He told mercurial actor Klaus Kinski he would shoot him if he followed through on a threat to walk off a film set. He nearly died from malaria. And he made good on a promise to eat his shoe if documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, then a young film student, would make the film he was always talking about (1978\u2019s Gates of Heaven, a documentary about the pet cemetery business).\nHerzog will discuss his colorful life and distinguished career Monday night in a conversation at the Tsai Performance Center titled Werner Herzog: Every Man for Himself and God against All, moderated by Herbert Golder, a College of Arts & Sciences professor of classical studies and a filmmaker who has collaborated with Herzog on numerous projects. The event is part of the Kilachand Honors College Co-curricular Events series. The conversation is sold out, but there may be last-minute cancellations, so those without a ticket are urged to arrive early to try to score a seat.\n\u201cWerner Herzog is one of the great humanistic visionaries of our time, working in the single most powerful and pervasive myth-making media we possess,\u201d Golder says.\nThe following day, Herzog will join a group of BU students for a breakfast Q&A moderated by James Johnson, a CAS professor of history, at the Photonics Center. A limited number of tickets are still available and can be reserved through Eventbrite. His appearance marks the second installment in BU\u2019s new annual series, \u201cConversations in the Arts & Ideas,\u201d which began last year with a conversation with author Zadie Smith.\nBU Today spoke with Herzog about his career, his thoughts on contemporary films and social media, and the skills necessary to be a great filmmaker. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nBU Today: You grew up in an isolated mountain village in Bavaria. When did you see your first film?\nHerzog: I was already 11, and a traveling projectionist came to our one-room schoolhouse and we saw two films that were screened on a bed"}
