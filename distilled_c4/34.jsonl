But two issues \u2014 trade and talent \u2014 seem to be sounding an ominous drum beat and sending mixed signals in the Q2 2018 edition of the \u201cDeloitte Global CFO Signals\u201d report.\nOn the positive front, many of the CFOs in the eight surveys included in this quarterly round-up voice upbeat outlooks about their organizations\u2019 financial prospects, growth metrics, and, countries\u2019 economic outlooks. In North America, for example, net optimism moderated from last quarter\u2019s survey-high +54, but remains relatively strong at +39, and expectations for revenue, earnings, and hiring all rose. In Australia, 77 percent of surveyed CFOs are optimistic about their companies\u2019 financial prospects, a sentiment that is reflected in local job growth and investment activity. And in India, 94 percent of CFOs surveyed are optimistic about that country\u2019s outlook over the next two-to-three years.\nBut it is the threat of a trade war that has many CFOs on edge. In Australia, for example, more than 50 percent of CFOs surveyed believe a trade war will negatively impact their business in the short-term, whereas in the medium-term, this rises to 70 percent. Among Japanese CFOs surveyed, the threat of a global trade war easily topped their list of external concerns (93 percent). And while CFOs in the U.K. are understandably worried about the long-term effects of Brexit, they also rank \u201cgreater protectionism\u201d as an escalating risk.\n\u201cThe trade tensions between the U.S. and China have continued to evolve,\u201d observes Sitao Xu, chief economist, Deloitte China, \u201cleading to many scenarios, some good, some bad.\u201d He adds that businesses obviously do not want a protracted trade war, but often have little choice except to adopt a wait-and-see attitude \u2014 particularly when reevaluating supply chains.\nWhat is clear, however, is that \u201cbusinesses are very worried about these tensions,\u201d says Patricia Buckley, managing director, Economic Policy and Analysis, Deloitte Services LP in the U.S.\nCompounding matters is the escalation of long-running concerns over talent. For Belgian CFOs, scarce labor is their greatest concern and has been since the second quarter of 2017. Japanese finance chiefs cite labor shortages at the top of their list of domestic concerns (67 percent), and U.S. CFOs who were surveyed name talent as their top internal risk. Likewise, in the U.K., which is feeling the effects of the lowest unemployment rate in 43 years, 44 percent of CFOs reported that recruitment difficulties or skills shortages have risen in the last three months.\nEven more pressing is the fear is that these twin concerns \u2014 trade and talent \u2014 could have a chilling effect on business investment. Indeed, a report recently published by the European Investment Bank, states that the \u201climited availability of people with the right skills impedes the investment activity of more than 70 percent of European firms.\u201d* Going forward, says Michael Grampp, chief economist, Deloitte Switzerland, the shortfall means companies may need to rethink their workforce composition and competencies. \u201cCompanies realize they can\u2019t just rely on the younger generations to fill the gaps,\u201d he explains.\nAmid trade tensions and skills shortages"}

Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio is getting costly for the city.\nCuomo in his new $145 billion state budget plan unveiled Wednesday called on the city to pay significantly more toward CUNY and Medicaid.\nOne source said the city could be on the hook for about $800 million in new costs, which would amount to a large portion of the savings Cuomo has in his budget.\n\"It's a big (slap) at the mayor,\" the source said of Cuomo's plan.\n\"This is a bad budget for New York City,\" added a city official.\nThe changes mean the state is reneging on its pledge to support CUNY and is passing the cost for soaring Medicaid expenses on to city taxpayers.\nUnder the plan, the city, which for decades has paid virtually nothing toward CUNY's budget, would now pay 30% to match the number of appointments it has on the CUNY board.\nThat breaks down to an additional $485 million, which will reduce the state's commitment.\nOn top of that, Cuomo would require the city to cover its own increases in Medicaid expenses. In recent years, the state has covered the extra costs for the city and counties as part of a mandate-relief measure after enacting a law designed to cap property tax hikes at 2%.\nThe change would cost the city $180 million in the first year, Cuomo aides said. Second-year costs for the city could top $300 million, others said.\nDe Blasio, who traveled to Albany for Cuomo's speech and met for 30 minutes with the governor beforehand, called it premature to go into details of a plan he was just seeing. But he did raise concerns.\n\"We're going to look at those issues very carefully,\" he said. \"Obviously, we want to make sure that the interests of New York City are protected.\"\nDe Blasio, who in a July tirade to reporters accused Cuomo of blocking the city's agenda and governing with a vendetta, will return in two weeks to formally testify about Cuomo's budget at a joint legislative hearing.\n\"Clearly, if something actually is going to undercut our ability to provide health care to our people or to support our students, I am not only going to speak up, but work hard to address it,\" he said.\nCuomo aides vehemently deny the governor's proposals are connected to the governor's war with de Blasio.\nOverall, when school aid, prekindergarten and other state funding is factored in, the city actually will receive $322.2 million more under the governor's budget than it is receiving currently, they said.\nAnd that doesn't count the billions Cuomo has committed for homeless and affordable housing, they added.\nThe Cuomo aides argue the city used to contribute to CUNY until the 1970s fiscal crisis, when the state took over almost all the funding. As part of Cuomo's plan Wednesday, he also called for setting aside $240 million in state money to help cover retroactive pay raises for CUNY professors, who are without a contract.\nAs for Medicaid, the city, Cuomo aides said, is not subjected to the property tax cap and has a surplus it can dip into to cover the extra costs.

Then, they came off the better against local rivals Melbourne Avant Gaming when it came to Rocket League. Closing things out, they completed the set by defeating Perth Ground Zero\u2019s finest Street Fighter V players in a fierce best-of-seven showdown.\nThis trio of victories saw Melbourne Order net themselves the Club Championship prize of $30,000. Added to their already sizable winnings, the club walked away with a total of $100,000 in prize money.\nLaunched earlier this year, the Gfinity Elite Series Australia is unique among local esports events for several reasons. Firstly, its a tournament populated by city-based teams rather than independent or brand-owned organizations.\nSecondly, unlike esports events like the recent Intel Extreme Masters Sydney 2018 or Rift Rivals, Gfinity isn\u2019t based around a single title. In its current incarnation, each team has to field players across three titles: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Rocket League and Street Fighter V.\nThirdly, Gfinity\u2019s Elite Series Australia currently the only local esports event that\u2019s regularly made its way onto terrestrial airwaves through a partnership with Network Ten. The partnership, which marks Network Ten\u2019s first entry into the esports space, saw live broadcasts for of all the Elite Series\u2019 Rocket League matches on Ten ONE.\nAll of those points of difference were on our minds, as we caught up with Dominic Remond, CEO of Gfinity Australia, to recap the finale of the inaugural Elite Series' first season.\n\u201cWe had a really good live experience this weekend. The crowds were exceptional and there was some entertainment gameplay. As an entertainment spectacle, it was probably the best we\u2019ve had during the tournament,\u201d he says.\nRemond says that building the Gfinity Arena was actually one of the project\u2019s biggest challenges. \u201cAustralia\u2019s regulations are significantly more complex than both the UK and the US. So when we [did] a lot of the planning process around the build, there [were] certain occupational health and safety issues that hadn't been taken into consideration.\nAccording to him, \u201cthey were a big hurdle to overcome\u201d and resulted in Gfinity delaying the start of the inaugural Elite Series season by two weeks.\n\"That was probably the most complex piece of the whole business: building an arena from scratch based on international specs,\u201d Remond says.\nThankfully - while Season 2 of the first Gfinity Elite Series Australia isn\u2019t due until November, that doesn\u2019t mean that the Gfinity Arena itself will remain dormant until then.\nAnother event that\u2019s due to happen before the inaugural Gfinity Elite Series Australia returns is the upcoming Melbourne Esports Open. The Victorian government say they\u2019re looking to position Melbourne as the home of esports within Australia and with Melbourne Order taking home the gold across all three Gfinity titles, a question was on our minds.\nIs Gfinity likely to stay exclusive to Sydney? The answer, it turns out, is not necessarily.

Just as moneyed criminals get Johnnie Cochran while the indigent make do with underpaid public defenders, so are well-heeled substance abusers more likely to end up in posh rehab clinics than in the prisons where poor addicts are warehoused. Sure, there are exceptions -- actor Robert Downey Jr. and baseball star Daryl Strawberry spring to mind -- but they're not the norm. The norm looks more like Noelle Bush, who, despite several drug violations, has so far served only three days in jail.\nAs most of the country knows by now, the daughter of Florida governor Jeb Bush and niece of President George W. Bush was found with crack inside her shoe in the Center for Drug Free Living in Orlando, where she was sent in January after being arrested for trying to buy Xanax with a forged prescription. It was not the first time she's been busted while in rehab -- her three-day jail term in July came after she was caught with a bag of prescription pills that didn't belong to her.\nDrug-reform advocates certainly don't claim that Noelle Bush has been treated too leniently -- even three days in jail is too harsh, they argue. But, they say, the punishment is even more severe for people without her money or connections. \"The question is whether she's being treated in a unique way,\" says Bruce Bullington, the editor of the Journal of Drug Issues and an associate professor of criminology at Florida State University in Tallahassee. \"I think she is.\"\nHer fellow patients seem to agree. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, Noelle Bush was reported to the police by a woman who said she was a Center for Drug Free Living client incensed by what she felt was the preferential treatment given the governor's daughter.\n\"One of the women here was caught buying crack cocaine tonight,\" the caller said in her Sept. 9 conversation with a 911 dispatcher. \"And a lot of the women are upset because she's been caught about five times. And we want something done because our children are here, and they just keep letting it slip under the counter and carpet ... They said, you know, because it's basically Noelle Bush ... She does this all the time and she gets out of it because she's the governor's daughter.\"\nAccording to the New York Daily News, one Center for Drug Free Living staffer heeded a supervisor's advice and tore up her written statement about finding the drugs rather than show it to the police. Without the statement, the police didn't have probable cause to arrest Bush. Four employees have been subpoenaed after refusing to cooperate with police, citing the center's privacy policies. Bullington says the employees would be in the right if they provided the same measure of protection to all their clients. Whether they do is hard for outsiders to determine, he says, because individual clinics have a \"tremendous amount of latitude\" in creating their policies.\n\"If this is something they do for all their guests, then it's perfect,\" Bullington says. \"The vast majority of people who go into treatment fail very quickly, and fail multiple times.\" But the system isn't designed with that in mind, he says. \"Anyone else who they found with a rock of cocaine, they would turn it over to the police ...

Studies of temperature records show this is already happening. As mentioned above, one recent paper showed that local monthly \"hottest ever\" records are five times as common as before. And a study by Dr. James Hansen two years ago showed that really extreme summer heat records are now 30 times more common than they were in the period from 1950-1980.\nTo illustrate how this trend toward increasing extreme heat played out this winter, I've included four months of NOAA temperature charts below.

After their bank agreed to a short sale \u2014 accepting less for the home than what the family owed \u2014 Jennifer Herrick said she thought her family could finally move on from the storm.\nThat's because a federal tax provision that exempts that forgiven debt from being taxed as regular income expired at the end of last year. Congress has not yet reinstated the legislation.\nHerrick, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of three, said the difference is more than she earns in a year.\nCongress passed the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act in 2007 to exclude debt that had been forgiven on a homeowner\u2019s primary residence through short sales, foreclosures or loan modifications that include principal forgiveness from being taxed as income. The act, which had been extended twice before, expired at the end of 2013 and efforts to reinstate it this year in Congress have so far been unsuccessful.\nWhile the lapse in the tax benefit has national implications, Herrick said the potential financial impact to Sandy-affected families who are struggling to move on from the storm is particularly acute.\nKeith Gumbinger, vice president of Riverdale-based mortgage research firm HSH.com, said \u201cthe forgiveness is treated directly as income.\u201d So, if a homeowner who falls into the 28 percent tax bracket gets $50,000 in debt forgiveness, they\u2019d be on the hook for roughly $14,000 in taxes.\nAnd then you owe taxes on it.\nNine homes have received approval for short sales through the buyout program, according to state Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Joe Seldner, with closings completed on seven of those properties in Sayreville, South River and Woodbridge. The state has so far purchased roughly 200 homes through the program.\nAmer Javaid, 45, bought a home just a few doors down from the Herricks on Weber Avenue in 2008. Javaid\u2019s home also flooded for the third time when the river that runs behind the neighborhood in Middlesex County rose up again during Sandy.\nJavaid said the state first offered him $250,000 for the home. He said he still owed $315,000 on the property. A final appraisal bumped the offer to more than $260,000, which Javaid said his bank accepted as a short sale after he lost his job in the spring.\nAnalysts expect the provision to be reinstated now that the November elections have passed and members of New Jersey's congressional delegation have already publicly expressed their support for extending the act.\nSteven Kaplan, who heads the family tax services group at SaxBST in Clifton, said if Congress does not take action on that measure this year, homeowners may be able to find relief through another avenue.

{"idx": "34021", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Yes, Trump did sound 'presidential.' Here's the science that shows why.\nPresident Donald Trump delivers his first address to a joint session of Congress from the floor of the House of Representatives.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s first address to Congress on Tuesday employed a different style of speech than we've come to expect.\nAccording to data compiled throughout his campaign and into his presidency by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Trump's off-the-cuff speeches are usually an outlier among presidents. He uses simple language, often delivered in a style that lacks analytic or logical reasoning. His speeches are high in displays of authenticity, and overall \u2014 despite a tumultuous first month in office \u2014 positive in tone.\nBut Tuesday\u2019s speech was more in-line with previous presidents than any of Trump\u2019s other formal addresses. Trump, for the most part, stuck to the script. He called for unity and gave an ambitious list of priorities to Congress, though it was thin on detail. He opened his speech by condemning last week\u2019s racially motivated shooting in Kansas City and recent threats to Jewish communities.\n\u201cRecent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis was a very normal speech,\u201d said Kayla Jordan, a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin who has been analyzing Trump\u2019s speech patterns since he was a candidate.\nTo analyze Trump\u2019s language, Jordan used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool, a computerized text analysis tool that connects key vocabulary in speech to psychological traits.\nWhile the library analyzes dozens of metrics, Trump\u2019s unique speaking style can be best measured with three: the degree of analytical thinking used, how authentic it seems, and the overall emotional tone.\nTrump typically scores lower than most politicians on analytic thinking. Jordan said the best way to visualize this is to remember the debates between Trump and Hillary Clinton.\nBut it\u2019s that speaking style that gives him high marks in authentic speech \u2014 speech that is visceral, immediate, direct.\nTone measures how positive the language is, another metric where Trump usually scores well because of his use of words like \u201cwin,\u201d and his campaign slogan.\nEach of these aspects are scored on a scale of 0 to 100, based on algorithms developed through years of language research and experimental trials, Jordan said. Sets of key vocabulary words that relate to each trait are created based on prior research, and then tested through experiment.\nIn general, levels of analytic thinking in presidential language has decreased over the years. Even so, Trump is an outlier among modern presidents.\nTrump\u2019s inaugural address scored low in analytical thinking, especially in comparison to past inaugural addresses.\nBut in his Tuesday speech to Congress, Trump's language was substantially more analytic and less authentic than any of his other formal speeches.\nJordan said Trump\u2019s inaugural speech is probably the closest thus far to his natural speaking style. His speech at the Republican National Convention and Tuesday\u2019s address to Congress more closely match the speech patterns of senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.\nAuthenticity is not necessarily a measure of truthfulness from the speaker, only the way that their language is perceived. And it can shift, based on the confidence and emotional state of the speaker, Jordan said.\nTrump is also surprisingly positive in tone. Tuesday night\u2019s"}

Cuomo on Friday reached an agreement with the New York State Legislature to put back together a long-running affordable housing program, known as 421-a, that gives developers a city tax break in return for building lower-price rental units.\nJust do not call it 421-a.\nThe newly named Affordable New York Housing Program, announced at a news conference in Albany, will annually generate 2,500 units of housing affordable to poor, working-class and middle-class New Yorkers, Mr. Cuomo said. In a change to the nearly 50-year-old program, developers will be required to pay a \u201cfair wage\u201d to construction workers to qualify for the city tax benefits.\nAt a time when housing costs have escalated well beyond the means of many New Yorkers, the program was a subject of contention between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. Both have made affordable housing a hallmark of their administrations.\nBut some housing groups and budget watchdogs said that the new version of the program will be more expensive than past versions and that it was overly generous to developers.\nDevelopers have long argued that the high costs of land, construction materials and taxes make it nearly impossible to build rental housing in the city without some form of subsidy.\nUnder the updated program, developers of market-rate rental buildings of 300 units or more in certain neighborhoods can get a full property tax exemption for 35 years if they set aside 25 to 30 percent of the units for low- and moderate-income tenants. Earlier versions of the program had shorter exemption periods.\nThe program is to remain in effect until at least 2022.\nAdditionally, the program requires developers to pay construction workers an average of $60 an hour in wages, benefits and payroll taxes at projects below 96th Street in Manhattan, and $45 an hour at projects within a mile of the East River waterfront, an area gentrifying rapidly.\nProjects outside those zones can \u201copt in\u201d to the program if they fulfill the requirements.\nThe city comptroller will determine whether developers have complied with the minimum-wage standards \u2014 a challenge given that wages during a typical two-year construction period can vary widely depending on who is on site, such as high-paid crane operators or electricians, or lower-wage laborers.\nThe State Assembly, Mr. Cuomo and the de Blasio administration defeated a push by Senate Republicans to make luxury condominiums eligible for tax breaks, a provision that by some estimates would have raised the cost of the program by $1 billion over 10 years.\nThe city hailed the deal, even as the program\u2019s cost per unit of affordable housing rose above the levels estimated under the de Blasio administration\u2019s 2015 proposal for changing the 421-a.\nThe city plan, the result of long negotiations with the Real Estate Board of New York, the development industry\u2019s powerful lobbying arm, was scuttled by the governor, in part because it did not have a requirement to pay union wages.\nThe city estimates that the housing program will cost $82 million a year more in unrealized taxes than it would have under the 2015 proposal.\nCurrently, the 421-a tax breaks cost the city about $1.4 billion a year in forgiven taxes.\nThe group predicted a \u201crush of developers\u201d applying for the new program, both those with new projects and those seeking to gain benefits for buildings started 18 months ago."}

It was agreed to continue the technical support to strengthen the capacity of GDBOP.

Can Weed Businesses Keep Up?\nMore than 900 cannabis-related bills moved through state capitols and Congress in 2018, and there are already about 600 bills for 2019 sessions, according to Marijuana Moment's Legislative Tracking Tools. Each state has its own regulations regarding the forms cannabis can be sold in, how it needs to be monitored, tested, packaged or advertised, and those rules are in flux as states figure out the best way to regulate the plant.\nThe industry is comprised predominantly by small businesses, so while changes are generally made for good reasons, each can result in a financial burden. For example, when Colorado decided all THC-infused chocolate had to display the THC symbol on the food itself so people would not mistakenly eat an \u201cedible,\u201d chocolate producers had to throw out their custom-made chocolate molds, and design and order new ones.\nLast year, Colorado\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division changed cannabis warning label verbiage from \u201cContains Marijuana. Keep out of reach of children\u201d to \u201cContains Marijuana. Keep away from children.\u201dAri Cohen, vice president of operations for Dixie Brands, one of the industry's larger companies, said this seeming small change resulted in the need to develop new labeling for Dixie\u2019s entire product portfolio. The company had over six months to comply but still had to work to make sure inventory levels of the original packaging and finished goods were significantly reduced prior to the deadline.\nDixie Brands sells cannabis-infused products in 4 states, employing about 100 people at their headquarters in CO, with Q3 2018 revenue of $2,435,000 (about double the sales of Q3 2017.) Like other cannabis companies, it is not allowed to deduct typical business expenses on its tax returns because the plant is still illegal at the federal level, so changes need to be made knowing there is less financial leeway than businesses in other industries.\nMulti-state operators, companies like Dixie Brands that grow or sell cannabis in more than one state, have an especially complicated time with the changing regulations. They seek to establish a unified set of operating procedures, suppliers and product lines while obeying different sets of laws. \u201cConsistency of the brand in terms of product, packaging and distribution is absolutely critical,\u2019 as firms seek to go national, said Nick Kovacevich, CEO of KushCo Holdings a large provider of ancillary products and services for the cannabis industry. Still, those companies need to balance uniformity with individual state requirements.\nThe National Cannabis Industry Association\u2019s map shows which states have legalized adult use of marijuana, which allow medical use of some sort, and which are still prohibition states. Many states, like California, are in transition between legalization on paper and a fully functioning market. And so the rules will continue to evolve."}

For the very first time, a research team has been able to grow human heart tissue that beats totally autonomously in its petri dish home.\nThe tissue itself came from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which started as mature human skin cells and effectively \"reprogrammed\" back to an embryonic state and then coaxed into becoming the desired cell, in this case those with the potential to become heart tissue or multipotential cardiovascular progenitor (MCP) cells. This is the same method that scientists recently used for the far less practical, far more nausea-inducing feat of growing human teeth from urine.\nThis process makes MCPs, which are precursor cells that can further differentiate into three kinds of cells the heart uses, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Nobody has tried using these MCPs for heart regeneration before. It turns out that the heart's extracellular matrix \u2013 the material that is the substrate of heart scaffold \u2013 can send signals to guide the MCPs into becoming the specialized cells that are needed for proper heart function.\nAfter several weeks, not only had the mouse's heart been fully rebuilt with the human cells, it was also beating again entirely on its own at a rate of 40 to 50 beats per minute.

It likely never will be.\nThe Chiefs are a community-owned club, controlled by a board of directors who represent about 16,000 stockholders. Even if someone was able to gain a controlling interest in the team -- meaning 51 percent of the stock -- the club\u2019s certificate of corporation states no one can vote more than 500 shares.\nThe system has been in place since 1961 to help prevent anyone from buying the team and moving it out of Syracuse. That happened twice before, when team owner Marty Haske moved the team from Syracuse to Miami in 1956. The city then obtained an Eastern League team that was moved from Syracuse to Allentown, Pa., by owner Joe Reardon in 1957.\nSo, when Syracuse had an opportunity to get Triple-A baseball back in 1961, measures were put in place to help prevent the team from ever being moved again. The first step was a sale of stock, at the time selling for $10 each, to make it a community-owned team. Each share currently is worth about $126, although the stock is not publicly traded.\nThe team\u2019s board of directors might some day decide to sell the team, but it\u2019s unlikely to ever happen, Simone said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s impossible, but it\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone could get a hold of all these people who own stock to get a majority interest,\u2019\u2019 Simone said.\nThe Chiefs are owned by about 4,000 stockholders who own 15,798 shares of stock. Even if someone did manage to gain a controlling interest and want to move the team, the International League would have to approve the sale, which would be unlikely without the approval from Syracuse\u2019s board of directors.\nThe Chiefs date to 1934, when the International League's Jersey City Skeeters moved to Syracuse and were renamed the Chiefs. The franchise played for 22 consecutive seasons in the IL, through 1955, before Haske sold the team.\nExcept for the brief time in the Eastern League for half the 1957 season, Syracuse was without baseball until the 1961 season, when the Montreal Royals franchise was moved o Syracuse.\nChiefs President Ron Gersbacher said Solomon made no offer to purchase the team, he only inquired.

{"idx": "34052", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: Hosted messaging can lighten the load for your customers. Here's how.\nYes, your customers can use Hotmail, Yahoo mail or even ZDNet mail for their hosted e-mail, but it might not be a wise move. After all, free e-mail services are as far beyond accountability as the moon is from Earth.\nWhen your customers want to get serious about e-mail, you have two options: Install an internal system\u2014which can be time consuming and costly\u2014or turn to a serious, carrier-grade, hosted e-mail solution. In this article, well discuss the latter.\nMaking Money from Mail One way to e-mail hosting profitability is to enter the mail outsourcing business like such companies as Commtouch (www.commtouch.com), Critical Path (www.cp.net) and Electric Mail Company (www.electricmail.com). Typically, those types of businesses provide mail services to other service providers like ISPs or ASPs, or directly to corporate customers. According to a forthcoming report by Ferris Research, a market and technology analysis house specializing in messaging, outsourcing e-mail will remain a rapidly growing business because of customer IT staff shortages and hosted e-mails reduced costs.\nAnother path is simply to add hosted mail services to your menu of ISP or internal mail services. While it may be impossible to make those services separate billing-line items to your customer, you should be able to increase your overall billing rate by delivering improved e-mail capabilities.\nThe Software Basics First, your e-mail server must be Internet-mail capable. That means, at the least, it should support Post Office Protocol (POP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). If your customers intend to use PCs in the office and laptops on the road, Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) is a must. With IMAP, mail resides on the server so a user doesnt have to waste time transferring messages from one machine to another. Other popular mail protocols, like Microsofts Messaging Application Programming Interface or Lotus Vendor-Independent Messaging, are next to useless for Web mail hosting purposes.\nA modern mail server also should be Web-mail capable. While host-based Web e-mail is almost always slower than a POP/SMTP server-client combination, the fact that you can check mail from any Web-connected device makes it wildly popular.\nTo use Web mail safely, though, you must take extra care on both the server and client side. At a minimum, the Web server should support 40-bit Secure Sockets Layer for e-mail connections. IMAPs host-based message storing also helps ensure that valuable messages arent left behind on public access PCs. But none of that will help if the user doesnt understand that he must clear any public Web browsers cache after reading mail, lest the next user can easily read his last messages.\nFor hosting purposes, virtual mail domains also are a must. With that ability, a single mail server can handle the messaging load for multiple domains. For example, with iPlanet Messaging Server you can set up such e-mail domains as accounting.bigcompany.com and marketing.bigcompany.com without the expense of additional server software or registering new domains.\nOne thing thats new, however, is the growing demand for wireless e-mail capability. The popularity of Blackberry handheld devices, which offer wireless e-mail, proves that customers arent willing to wait for a winner to be declared in the standards battle between Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) and i-Mode. So make sure the e-mail server you choose supports"}

Why is he so resolute when it comes to Israel and the Middle East?\nWhen Canada's John Baird took to the podium at the UN Thursday to condemn the vote elevating the Palestinian Authority to a non-member observer state, it was a message few in the chamber wanted to hear.\nThe General Assembly, after all, was just moments away from an overwhelming endorsement of the move, thereby placing Canada in a small minority of opponents along with the U.S. and Israel.\nNor was Canada's opposition a surprise. Prime Minister Stephen Harper had earlier this week rejected the enhanced status, calling it a ''shortcut'' to statehood. His foreign affairs minister labelled it a ''unilateral'' move that would undermine negotiations with Israel for a peaceful, two-state solution.\nWhat most wouldn't have realized as Baird spoke is that Canada's resolve to stand with Israel hardened in September at the opening of the General Assembly, while Harper waited to meet the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\nSources have described the discussion as curt. Though photos of the two men meeting that day show them both smiling and shaking hands.\nBut it was apparently what happened immediately before their brief meeting that reinforced the prime minister's opposition to the Palestinian bid.\nHarper watched as Abbas walked through a gauntlet of world leaders who had just listened to his speech, accepting their praise and support. Few of those leaders bothered to return to the chamber to listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offer his rebuttal.\nInsiders say the spectacle pushed Harper to bluntly warn Abbas privately that there would be further consequences from Canada if the push for enhanced status was not abandoned.\nAnd now Baird's speech Thursday repeated the warning, this time publicly, but without elaborating.\nOn Friday morning, Baird announced that Canada is temporarily recalling its heads of mission to Israel and the West Bank, along with its United Nations representatives in New York and Geneva.\nThere was speculation Canada might not renew its $300 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority or pull the credentials of Palestinian representatives to Canada. Those actions were not taken at this time but remain on the table.\nWhatever the Harper government does, its staunch support of Israel is clearly set, much to the alarm of its critics.\nMany see this harder line as a shift away from Canada's traditional role as both a supporter of Israel, and what retired Canadian diplomat Steve Hibbard recently called a more ''fair-minded'' approach to the issues that bedevil Mideast peace efforts.\nIn an article this month for the Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, Hibbard said the Harper government has undermined that approach and Canada's standing in the Middle East.\n\"Perhaps the most helpful step Canada could take is to use its close ties with Israel to work with Israelis and Palestinians to build mutual trust,'' he concluded.\nFor his part, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair thinks the Conservatives are taking an ever-hardening line against the Palestinians.\nWhat should be Canada's role?\nIn fact, there's no disagreement over the outcome Canada wants for the Middle East. The dispute is over how to get there, and the role this country should play.\nBaird and Harper have both said they make no apologies for standing with Israel, reminding their political opponents at home that Israel is a Jewish state, in a neighbourhood of the world that's hostile to its very existence.\nIn his speech Thursday, Baird"}

He submerged himself in the art of ramen via educational trips to Japan, and tenures at ramen restaurants in Seattle, including famed chain Kizuki Ramen.\nOni's ramen menu is extensive, with three broths including chicken and dashi, which are less common than the popular pork. The menu has at least seven kinds of ramen, such as tonkotsu ramen and tsukemen, the ramen cousin where noodles and other ingredients are served separately from the broth.\nAt Fort Worth, he also does poke.\nDeep Ellum represents his second effort to open in Dallas County; he was previously set to open a location at the CityLine complex in Richardson, but that fell through.\n\"Our original idea was to open in Richardson, but that involved taking on some debt, and I wasn't ready to do that,\" he says. \"And then the Deep Ellum spot opened, and honestly, I feel like it's perfect.

At about 1,200 square feet, the Dallas location is smaller than Fort Worth, so he'll be doing a slightly different menu.\n\"In Fort Worth, we do so many variations, but for Dallas, I'm going to trim it down to just pork broth,\" he says. \"Our signature is miso, but we won't mix it with chicken broth like we do in Fort Worth, and we also won't do poke.

You have very little chance being involved in an airplane accident. But that doesn't stop many people from worrying about flying. And flying long distances over the ocean, such as on a transatlantic flight, causes some people even more concern -- perhaps for good reason.\nMedical emergencies are a danger on transatlantic flights because the airplane can be, at times, a long way from the nearest airport and medical help. A certain amount of danger involved if a passenger requires immediate medical attention, but aircraft traveling these routes carry medical equipment such a defibrillators aboard and have a flight staff trained to use it.\nRegular passengers on transatlantic flights have an increased cancer risk because of cosmic radiation exposure at high altitudes. According to the BBC News website, passengers and crew who routinely make this trek across the ocean get an equivalent of 170 chest X-rays of radiation per year. This increases cancer risks. Pilots who are in the air throughout their careers have a higher incidence of colon, rectal, prostate and brain cancers. Female flight attendants tend to have twice as many occurrences of breast cancer as other women.\nLong flights over the Atlantic can cause edema -- the pooling of blood in the legs that causes swelling in the feet, ankles and legs -- in passengers who sit in the same position for long periods. Getting up and walking around the cabin at least once an hour can combat this problem. Low pressure adversely affects blood flow is adversely and can cause edema. It is usually minor, but can become dangerous if the pooling results in a blood clot.\nWith the increase in distance from safe landing areas comes an increased danger should something go wrong with the plane mechanically.

Flying too far from the nearest airport, especially on transatlantic flights, can be a concern should a problem arise.\nMorgan, Lee. \"What Are the Dangers of Transatlantic Flights?\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/dangers-transatlantic-flights-60395.html.

Corn's popularity, in particular, is rising because of attractive prices and new varieties that allow the crop to be grown in areas where it once was considered too risky.\nIn 2012, North Dakota farmers raised 422 million bushels of corn and 339 million bushels of wheat. Fifteen years earlier, farmers in the state raised 269 million bushels of wheat and only 58 million bushels of corn.\nIn other words, North Dakota in 1997 produced roughly five bushels of wheat for every one bushel of corn.

It is the first expansion of the SEC membership since Arkansas and South Carolina joined the conference in 1992.\nMissouri was a charter member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907, which became the Big Six Conference in 1964, the Big Eight Conference in 1964 and the Big 12 Conference in 1996.\nGeographically, it is a natural fit as the state of Missouri touches more states (Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee) that currently are home to an SEC institution than any other state that is not in the league\u2019s previous 13-member footprint. Like the majority of the cities in the SEC, Columbia, Mo., is a college-centered town with a metropolitan population of 164,283, making it the fifth-largest city in the state of Missouri.\nWith an enrollment of 32,415, the University of Missouri boasts a strong academic resume, as it is one of only five universities nationwide with law, medicine, veterinary medicine and a research reactor on one campus.

It will become the fourth SEC school that is part of the AAU, joining Florida, Texas A&M and Vanderbilt.\nMonday\u2019s announcement marks just the fourth time in the history of the conference that the SEC will expand its membership. In a landscape that has seemed ever-changing in recent years, the SEC has exemplified stability as 10 of its original 13 members remain.\nThe league began as a 13-team league until Sewanee\u2019s departure from the conference in 1940. After Georgia Tech\u2019s move to independent status in 1964, the league had 11 members before Tulane departed in 1966, leaving the SEC as a 10-team conference for more than two decades.\nAt the start of the decade of the 1990s, a similar shift in conference alignment allowed Arkansas and South Carolina to join the SEC. The benefits have been nothing short of outstanding.\nSoon after joining the league, the Razorbacks claimed the 1994 NCAA Championship in men\u2019s basketball and finished as the NCAA runner-up the following year. They made their first appearance in the SEC Championship football game"}

While defacing a marker is nothing new, this is the first time a sign has been erased.\nClarion-Ledger journalist Jerry Mitchell quoted Davis Houck of the Emmett Till Memory Project as saying, \u201cThis time, it\u2019s not someone with a shotgun or somebody trying to run over or tear down the sign.\nThe Till marker stood outside the former Bryant grocery store where the 14-year-old African-American boy from Chicago allegedly made improper advances toward Carolyn Bryant. In retaliation, Bryant\u2019s husband and her half-brother abducted Till. They beat him mercilessly and shot him in the head. After that, they used barbed wire to tie his body to a cotton gin fan and threw him into the Tallahatchie River.\nTill\u2019s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, made the bold decision to have an open casket at her son\u2019s funeral so the world could see what hate did to her baby. The lynching garnered international attention. Despite all the evidence against Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, a jury acquitted them of Till\u2019s murder.\nThe literal erasure of the Emmett Till sign is an illustration of the ways American culture tries to erase the reality of racism. Lynchings \u2014 the extrajudicial murders of black people for real and perceived transgressions \u2014 have been obscured for decades. This is one reason why the exact number of lynchings will forever remain a mystery. Heinous crimes perpetrated against the powerless are routinely ignored or concealed.\nBut it is not only the painful parts of the past that have been obscured, moments of heroism and virtue have been missed as well. Markers for Emmett Till recall not only his unjustified slaying but also the bravery of his mother and other civil rights leaders like Medgar Evers who risked their well-being to expose this crime in the hope that a public sense of righteous outrage might spur positive change.\nHow much rich history have we missed by attempting to erase a past we should learn from but not repeat?\nThe flip side of erasing history is rewriting it. History abhors a vacuum. When one part of history is removed it must be filled, often with idealized visions of the way things were. These memories may be pleasant, but they are mirages that must yield to reality.\nThe best historians use their research to recover the stories that have been rendered invisible by time and intention. C. Vann Woodward penned \"The Strange Career of Jim Crow\" to correct the idea that Jim Crow segregation had always been a fact of the South rather than an innovation designed to perpetuate the racial caste system.\nCommenting on the dangers of superimposing a false story on top of reality, he said, \u201cThe twilight zone that lies between living memory and written history is one of the favorite breeding places of mythology.\u201d Accurate history dispels myths to proclaim the truth, even when it would be easier to forget the shame and imagine a more pleasant past.\nW.E.B.

After all, Gaga is an uncompromising figure in pop music, and the vision of an album like \"Born This Way\" -- its many messages, sonic movements and powerhouse vocals -- is entirely her own.\nSmartly, \"Born This Way: The Remix,\" released two days shy of six months since Gaga's latest album hit stores, does not try to reinvent the wheel, but instead gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes. The lineup is a murderer's row of techno wizards (Sultan + Ned Shepard, Zedd), electro-pop maestros ( Goldfrapp, Metronomy), indie-rock upstarts ( Twin Shadow, Two Door Cinema Club) and, of course, The Weeknd. The mysterious singer, who reinterprets \"Marry The Night\" with Illangelo, is an odd choice for the remix album, since his bare-boned R&B and hedonistic lyrics directly conflict with Gaga's M.O. But like so many of these remixes, the Weeknd marries his vision of the song to Gaga's gorgeous voice without losing the original's integrity.\n\"Born This Way: The Remix\" is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to.

The Edge of Glory (Foster The People Remix): More heavy techno from the \"Pumped Up Kicks\" guys, with a pretty twisted breakdown beginning at the 3:20 mark.\n4. Yo\u00fc and I (Wild Beasts Remix): The indie-rock weirdos of Wild Beasts add headphone-ready shimmer to Gaga's romantic ballad.\n5.

A self-described \"young fat kid,\" Liddell was an offensive linemen who grew into a receiver before giving up football completely as a high school freshman.\nHe switched sports and ended up at Ohio State anyway.\nLiddell committed to the Buckeyes basketball program on Monday, becoming the third member of a three-man 2019 banner class for head coach Chris Holtmann that currently ranks No. 4 in the country, and first in the Big Ten. He joins a class that features five-star point guard DJ Carton and four-star forward Alonzo Gaffney. All three are top-50 national prospects in the 247Sports composite ratings.\n\"I chose Ohio State because those guys are winners, and I thought I was gonna come in and win,\" Liddell, a four-star forward, told cleveland.com on Monday night.\n\"I believe playing with those guys, we can come in and win, and have a big season.\"\nLiddell chose OSU over Illinois and Missouri, the latter two receiving his final official visits.\nThat left Ohio State far from a sure thing despite the Buckeyes being a trendy pick throughout much of Liddell's recruitment. Two potential road blocks stood out. One was getting Liddell to leave his home of Belleville, Illinois, on the border with Missouri and across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Either Mizzou or Illinois would have been a comfortable distance.\nThe second potential hurdle was showing how Liddell can play with Gaffney, himself a forward who could potentially play in the post or on the wing.\nTo get over that, Holtmann and his staff showed Liddell a video cut up of him and Gaffney, of Keita Bates-Diop and Jae'Sean Tate, and of how the staff used forwards Andrew Chrabascz and Kelan Martin playing together at Butler. The positions Bates-Diop was put in last season, which led to him winning Big Ten Player of the Year, stuck out in particular.\n\"I feel like I'm more of a three guy, but I post up because I have mismatches a lot,\" Liddell said. \"So I can shoot, dribble, I feel like my passing is underrated. I think I'm a good passer. I really get on the rebounds, and I can guard anybody on the court.\"\nGaffney is 6-foot-9, Liddell 6-foot-7. Together they help Ohio State fill a bit of a void that exists on the current roster.\nHoltmann talked last week about a limited ability to play more versatile lineups capable of switching and taking advantage of mismatches because Tate and Bates-Diop aren't on the team anymore. The next version of them is coming next year in Liddell and Gaffney. Nice to pair that with a five-star point guard in Carton.\nIt's a foundational class for Holtmann, one that will create excitement and anticipation, and be met with high expectations when paired with a solid 2018 recruiting class to form a deep roster in 2019-20.\nLiddell was the missing piece to that.\n\"He's a matchup nightmare,\" Joe Muniz, Liddell's coach at Belleville West High School told cle"}

Its willfully con- trolled mysteries keep us reading-what is the grudge between Sullivan and his father? what happened in Africa? who was the black woman who saved Tip's life? why were she and her child out so late in Cambridge? who is the other black woman she talks to in her delirium, also named T ennessee?-but even the most pliant reader can get to feeling manipu- lated.

The prosecution has claimed Mr Quirke murdered Mr Ryan so he could rekindle an affair with Ms Lowry (aged 52).\nMr Condon opened by telling the jury to consider the quality, not the quantity of the evidence they have heard. Much of it, he said, relied on Mary Lowry and even if proven true, would say nothing about murder but suggest she was in a relationship with Pat Quirke that was at different times good, bad, and indifferent.\nThe end of the relationship was bitter and petty, like many relationships when they break up, he said.\nMs Lowry's first attempt to revise history, he said, was when she said that the accused was not good friends with her late husband Martin Lowry. All the evidence, he said, states otherwise.\nIn the witness box, she described her affair with Mr Quirke as \"sordid\", but Mr Condon asked if this was just her talking with hindsight, looking back on something she now regrets and trying to put herself in the best light possible.\nShe had also said that she was \"controlled\" by Mr Quirke but, Mr Condon said, this is based only on Ms Lowry's unsupported evidence. He asked them to consider the statement made to garda\u00ed by her brother Eddie Quigley in which he said he told Pat Quirke: \"Mary will make up her own mind and you and me won't change that.\"\nThat, Mr Condon said, is a very different view of Mary Lowry to the \"naive or vulnerable person she seeks to put across\". She was, counsel said, \"about the business of manipulation. She was manipulative.\"\nHe further asked whether the episode - when she gave out to Bobby Ryan for five hours travelling back from Bundoran because he had spent the previous night dancing and talking to another woman - was evidence that Ms Lowry was controlled or controlling.\nShe had made light of it, Mr Condon said, telling the jury that his ear must have been \"reddened\". But Mr Condon reminded them that Bobby Ryan's response was to suggest that they end the relationship.\nShe lied in her account of what happened in Bundoran, Mr Condon said. Firstly, she told garda\u00ed that Bobby wasn't feeling well and didn't want to dance. When he went to the toilet she started dancing with another man and when she came back Bobby was dancing with another woman and spent hours chatting to her.\nIn her evidence to the jury, Mr Condon said, she said she asked Bobby's permission to dance with another man and he said it was fine.

Today, U.S. potash prices are at about $575 per metric ton (mt), compared with $380/mt last year. What caused the upswing?\nFadi Benjamin: Let's look at what caused the potash crash: Back in 2008\u00962009, potash prices had risen to almost $1,000/mt, driven by Chinese demand. Crop prices were relatively low at $3.50 corn, $10.25 soy and $4.44 wheat. Farmers around the world retaliated as they could not justify the economics of these high potash prices and low crop prices. Many farmers, particularly in North America, took a \"potash holiday.\" They stopped applying the mineral to cropland for a couple of years. The holiday was possible because crops do not consume all of the fertilizer immediately, and the remainder stays in the soil as a reserve. But now, all around the globe, the potash content in soils is too low. The demand for potash has returned, and crop prices have significantly increased. We are now in a world of $7.90 spot corn prices, $16.65 spot soy and $8.89 spot wheat. It may take two to three years of aggressive potash application for North American soils to reach 2008 soil levels.\nTER: Will the predicted slowdown of growth in China and other developing countries impact the outlook for potash?\nFB: Slowdown or not, people need to eat. Population is on the rise in developing countries, including China and India. There is a push to grow more crops, to utilize more of the arable land, to improve yields and to raise cattle for meat. Agriculture requires potash.\nTER: Which countries and regions are the largest potash consumers, and which are the largest producers? Is there a regional or global synergy between networks of production and consumption?\nFB: Canada and Russia are the two largest potash producers. India, China, Brazil and the United States are the largest consumers. There are synergies in the form of two marketing organizations. One, Canpotex, represents North American producers, and the other, Belarusian Potash Co., represents Russian producers. Russia and Canada are the gorillas in the potash cage. They ship potash around the globe, especially to China, India and Brazil, the areas of greatest need.\nTER: Saskatchewan holds about 40% of the world's known potash reserves. Should investors look first to Canada for potash production? Which countries are delivering the most bang for the potash investor's buck?\nFB: Junior potash miners are quite active in Africa, which is rich in resource commodities. Companies looking for potash in eastern Africa, specifically Ethiopia, include Allana Potash Corp. (AAA:TSX; ALLRF:OTCQX) and Ethiopian Potash Corp. (FED:TSX.V; FED.WT:TSX.V).

Its sizeable sample of 637 companies should give a fairly accurate picture of OSS adoption beyond Europe. In a nutshell, the conclusion was that 54 percent of SMBs currently use OSS in some form.\nI took a look at the report, \"Open Source Barameter 2009,\" and it is clear to me that the OSS adoption percentage is more or less consistent all the way up to 250-499 employees mark. As such, we're not talking about some fluke here in which a bunch of very small companies end up inflating the figures artificially.\nOf course, since the study was really intended to draw attention to MySQL, it does go on to show how a strong increase in the adoption of MySQL is expected. If this interests you, you might want to check out the actual survey here (free registration required).\nWindows remains the top operating system used.\nUsage appears to be independent of company size.\nSMBs are using open source for a greater percentage of mission-critical apps compared to larger companies.\nFor at least half the SMBs, database selection is based on recommendations by either the system integrator or consultant.\nBased on the above points, my take on the situation is that SMBs are open to the use of OSS, though it is not something they are deliberately going for. This is evidenced by the fact that Windows remains the top OS in use, with no inclination to deploy Linux in sight.\nThe good news for OSS advocates, though, is that SMBs are less averse to using OSS in mission-critical apps, though influence by system integrators or consultants could be the reason here. The latter could explain the fact that usage appears independent of company size.\nI think it would be interesting to hear how SMBs are actually using OSS. Perhaps you could share with us some interesting - or mission-critical - deployments involving OSS in your SMB.\nIn the meantime, you might want to check out an earlier blog I wrote on The Promise and Pain of Open Source.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Charlene Lamb was among the three State Department officials who recently turned in their resignation. If this is political theater it\u2019s almost like those three are hoping to quietly avoid the limelight and quietly slip out the door. While Hillary Clinton has taken the spotlight by having a \u201cdiplomatic illness\u201d that allows her to avoid giving Congressional testimony someone must wonder why those three chose to resign. But we do already know, and it\u2019s only after all the facts have to come to light that we now know the terrible responsibility that follows Charlene Lamb.\nWay back in October the official State Department line agreed upon with the White White was that the Benghazi attacks were not related to terrorism, the attacks could not have been predicted, an anti-Muslim YouTube video sparked a spontaneous demonstration, and that everything was somehow tied into recent protests in Cairo. We now know this all not true but that was the narrative being fed to the American public. The dam only broke when ex-CIA Director David Petraeus bluntly claimed our government knew from the beginning it was a terrorist attack.\n1. The first fact is that Charlene Lamb, who as the State Department official stationed in Washington, was allegedly monitoring electronically from that post what was happening in real time in Benghazi, Libya. This means she would have been intimately aware of what was really going on.\n3. Charlene Lamb was allegedly directly responsible for lowering security by first pushing for requests for help to not be made, claiming there were political reasons for this decision. Then, when continued levels of high protection were requested in spite of her demands, she ignored them anyway. Her lack of action may have contributed to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens,Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) released unclassified cables from March and July that the State Department had refused to release. These cables detailed requests from the US Embassy in Libya for an extension of temporary security forces that were withdrawn in the months prior to the attack.\n4. The rest of the officials in the State Department allegedly knew that terrorism was the cause from the beginning.\n5. Hillary Clinton was in regular contact with the State Department and thus was apprised of everything they knew. Which also means she knew it was a terrorist attack and that statements she later made to the public were a fabrication.\n6. Worse, Hillary Clinton had the capability to monitor events in real time on multiple open lines in her Washington command center. Part of her job was to inform White House officials, especially President Obama, of what was going on.\n7. Many of the statements made by Ambassador Susan Rice attempted to politicize the Benghazi attacks to make them appear favorable to President Obama right before the Presidential elections. The Rice narrative included Al-Qaeda losing ground, which the State Department knew to be untrue, and that the Middle East\u2019s public sentiment toward the United States was improving. The Benghazi attack was specifically stated by to not be connected to any U.S. foreign policy decisions by the Obama White House.\nWe know that prior to the Benghazi attacks Charlene Lamb was responsible for reducing security which indirectly led to the deaths of four Americans. Obviously it\u2019s impossible to determine whether having 11 times the protection would have mattered, but it can be reasonably be speculated that this increase would have made a difference.\nBut this only covers events before the attacks, not during, or after.

Recently, \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d opened to charm audiences, and now the equally entertaining \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d (\u201cThe Elixir of Love\u201d) has arrived.\nBartlett Sher\u2019s production opened the Met season in 2012. The new cast is just as winning as the earlier one.\n\u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d combines silly comedy with pangs of emotion. The plot concerns a country bumpkin named Nemorino, who is in love with the more intelligent Adina. She reads books and tells the villagers the story of how Tristan won the heart of Isolde by drinking a love potion.\nWhen Dulcamara, a seller of fake medicines, arrives in town, he tricks the gullible Nemorino into buying an elixir, which is supposed to cure everything from boils to bed bugs but is really Bordeaux wine.\nMeanwhile, Adina is being wooed by a narcissistic army officer, Sergeant Belcore. She agrees to marry the officer to get even with Nemorino, when he feigns indifference to her. The young man, needing cash to buy more of the potion, signs up for the army after Belcore offers him a bonus to volunteer.\nAfter drinking the liquid, Nemorino finds that hordes of young women are pursuing him. While he thinks the reason is Dulcamara\u2019s drink, in actuality word has spread that Nemorino has inherited a fortune from his recently deceased uncle. Adina confesses her love and the two finally unite.\nBelcore takes her rejection well, expressing his belief that many other women will swoon over his charms. Dulcamara takes the credit for everything, from the satisfying romantic ending to the young man\u2019s inheritance.\nDirector Bartlett Sher claimed that his production stresses the political implications of the libretto by moving the action a bit later to 1836, to coincide with the Risorgimento (the drive for Italian independence). In his view, the locals are Italians and the soldiers, including Belcore, are Austrian. I doubt that many people in the audience picked up on these subtleties.\nThe cast is certainly up to the vocal and dramatic demands of the opera. As Nemorino, tenor Vittorio Grigolo is likeable and brings the house down with \u201cUna furtiva lagrima,\u201d the most famous aria in the opera. He looks young and bounds around the stage with the nervous energy of a teenager.\nAleksandra Kurzak is an entrancing Adina, singing with grace and beauty and acting with charm. She also moves well and even dances a little. Her rendition of the aria \u201cPrendi, per me sei libero\u201d was exquisite.\nThe towering baritone Adam Plachetka is a swaggering Belcore. Alessandro Corbelli is well-suited to the comic role of Dulcamara even if his voice is not especially rich. Soprano Ying Fang made a strong impression in the brief role of Giannetta and is clearly a talent to watch.\nWith Enrique Mazzola conducting, the orchestra and chorus sounded fine.\nBeginning April 2, Mario Chang sings the role of Nemorino, and Pietro Spagnoli plays Dulcamara.

The company's second immuno-oncology therapy, Opdivo, is setting a pace for label expansions that Merck's (NYSE:MRK) competing drug Keytruda is having trouble keeping up with. In less than a year following its first approval, the FDA expanded Opdivo's patient base five times.\nIn November, the FDA approved Opdivo for kidney cancer just seven days after Bristol-Myers finished submitting the application, three months ahead of schedule. Success with regulators has also carried over to sales. Third-quarter earnings reports for both companies showed a widening sales gap between Opdivo and Keytruda.\nWith everything going so smoothly for Bristol, it came as a bit of a shock to see the FDA deny an application to treat a subset of melanoma patients. Let's compare the latest application to those recently approved to see if this is a hiccup or a serious problem.\nIn the race to reach as many patients as possible, Opdivo has taken a commanding lead over Keytruda. Both drugs are approved to treat some melanoma and lung cancer patients, and recently Opdivo became the first to win approval in kidney cancer.\nWhile this looks like a three-to-two lead for Opdivo, their approved indications are anything but straightforward. For example, the tumors of lung cancer patients must show overexpression of the PD-L1 protein to be eligible for treatment with Keytruda, but these same patients can receive Opdivo without testing for this biomarker.\nIn melanoma, Keytruda was approved for patients that progressed following treatment with Yervoy. In October the FDA approved Opdivo for use in combination with Yervoy, advancing it one more notch along standard treatment protocols.\nMinor variance in approved indications adds up to big differences on income statements. When Merck reported third-quarter results, Keytruda sales were $159 million for the period, and $396 million in the first nine months of the year. Bristol reported $305 million in Opdivo sales in the third quarter alone, and $467 million for the first nine months of the year.\nSince Bristol reported last, Opdivo has bagged a stunning three expansions to its melanoma and lung cancer indications and a new kidney cancer indication. I think it's safe to say the acceleration in Opdivo sales is just beginning. For investors that have suffered through a bouncing top line in recent years, the sustained growth of a wholly owned drug like Opdivo is exactly what they need.\nThe recent FDA denial centers around the B-Raf protein. Found in cell membranes, it sends signals inward that direct cell growth, and about half of all melanomas have mutations in the BRAF gene. Recently the FDA approved Opdivo as a first-line, single-agent treatment for people without specific BRAF mutations. Just three days later it denied its application for patients that are BRAF-mutation positive.\nLuckily, FDA didn't completely deny the expansion. Instead it issued a complete response letter. These letters outline why an application wasn't approved, and what needs to be shown next time around. According to Bristol-Myers, what the FDA"}

Quigley House and the State Attorney\u2019s Office often work closely together. Whether it\u2019s Quigley House helping victims report the crimes against them or the State Attorney\u2019s Office recommending their victims go to the program for counseling, the two organizations help each other whenever possible.\nValerie Hernandez, an advocate at the State Attorney\u2019s Office, said Quigley House has an in-house attorney at the Clay County Courthouse who provides services free of charge and is on call 24/7. That can be an invaluable resource for victims who may not have access to other options or the money to pay for a lawyer.\nAt the reception to introduce Martinez-Mullen, the original CEO of Quigley House and the woman who has been the interim-CEO for the past several months, Ellen Siler, was asked to introduce her.\nSiler worked with Martinez-Mullen at Hubbard House and had been fervently hoping that she would apply and be selected for the position at Quigley House. Siler began to get emotional as she spoke about how happy she was that Martinez-Mullen would be taking over in Clay County.\nMartinez-Mullen said she was grateful for her new role as CEO and for her valuable experience at Hubbard House. She talked about how eager she was to begin helping those in need and stressed how much strength it takes for victims to seek help.\nAfter the introductions, Siler spoke about how much Quigley House has changed since it was started in 1988 when she was the only employee.\nQuigley House first began as a telephone hotline before evolving into a shelter for victims in 1991. The program spent the first seven years working out of a borrowed house and was originally only working with domestic violence victims. It has since become a program with its own headquarters and staff and now helps victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.\nAs far Martinez-Mullen, Siler only sees great things in the future for the program under the new CEO.\nThe Quigley House hotline can be reached through two phone numbers.

Now, it's not affordable, and I think it's the 'Unaffordable Care Act.' But ... it's not personal to the president.\"\nRigell's ability to thread that needle\u2014opposing President Obama's agenda while not disrespecting him personally\u2014is central to the Republican's strategy for winning support from his district's large number of African-American voters.\nSupport from black voters is about to become all the more critical: A federal court ruled last month that the district adjacent to Rigell's was illegally gerrymandered, objecting that so many minorities had been packed into a single district. As part of the ruling, the court has ordered the state legislature to redraw the map by Sept. 1, a ruling that will stand barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWhen lawmakers do redraw Rigell's district, it will likely include a new influx of voters from Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott's\u2014where African Americans currently make up 57 percent of the population and where President Obama won 79 percent of the vote in 2012. So in 2016, if Rigell wants to keep his seat, he will likely have to succeed where much of his party has failed: convincing large numbers of African Americans to vote GOP.\nFortunately for Rigell, he won't be attempting this for the first time. He first won the seat in 2010, and he has spent his four and a half years in Congress working to make inroads in the local African-American community, despite his party's heavy reliance on white support. In doing so, he has made allies across the aisle and enemies within his own party, and he has strong ideas of what his party needs to do to win over nonwhite voters.\nAfrican Americans make up 22 percent of Rigell's southeastern Virginia district. When Rigell first ran in 2010, campaign consultants told him he wouldn't win more than 5 percent of their vote.\nIt's impossible to pinpoint what exact percentage of black voters threw in with Rigell in 2010, but\u2014based on the fact that he outperformed other Republicans in predominantly African-American precincts\u2014campaign consultant Jason Miyares estimates the Republican won between 12 percent and 15 percent in 2014.\n\"I'm not saying we've got 51 percent of the black vote.

At the low end of the spectrum, Maine reported only 7 percent of its students took the test. But even among the 17 states where 100 percent of 2018 graduates took the test, South Carolina came in 16th place with a composite score of 18.3, ahead of Nevada (17.7) and behind Mississippi (18.6).\nIn practical terms, the new test results show that despite high school graduation rates that inch upward year after year, most South Carolina students finish high school unprepared to succeed at a four-year college.\nStatewide, 42 percent of graduating students met the ACT's college readiness benchmark for English, along with 30 percent for Reading, 24 percent for Math and 20 percent for Science.\nOnly 14 percent were ready for college in every subject area, despite 63 percent saying on an ACT survey that they aspired to earn a bachelor's or graduate degree.\n\"I am disappointed to see that fewer of our graduates are meeting the benchmarks for college readiness set by ACT,\" said State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman. \"It is clear that the disparity gap between our high-performing schools and districts and our low-performing continues to widen.\"\nMost students take the ACT in 11th grade. In South Carolina, where the 11th-grade assessment was provided free of charge, only about one-quarter of the class of 2018 took the test more than once. The results released this week are largely based on the test given in the spring of 2017.\nThe ACT scores come on the heels of recent results from the 2018 Ready to Work test, which showed that fewer than two-thirds of the state's 11th-graders had the job skills necessary for 65 percent of certain jobs.\nBlack students scored far lower than white students in South Carolina, with an achievement gap similar to other states. Only 5 percent of African-American students, 16 percent of Hispanic or Latino students, and 33 percent of white students met three or more of the benchmarks for college readiness.\n\"I believe that by shining a light on our problem areas and focusing on high-quality classroom instruction and student achievement, we will begin to see improvements across our state,\" Spearman said.\nStatewide, 30 students earned a perfect score of 36. The districts with the highest composite scores were York 4 (21.1), Lexington 5 (20.1), York 2 (19.8), Lexington 1 (19.6), Charleston County (19.5) and Dorchester 2 (19.3).\nLocal school districts Berkeley County (17.8) and Dorchester 4 (16.3) trailed farther behind.\nWhile Charleston County students fared well, the district's average score obscures some wide disparities between schools.

This allocation is designed to give graduate programs additional funds that may be used for the support of quality graduate students who show financial need. The Graduate Financial Aid Office (FAO) manages the awarding process.\n75% of the salary will be covered by FWS funds from the US Department of Education.\n75% of the Tuition & Fee remission will be covered by UC Davis central campus funds.\n25% of the salary, 25% of the Tuition & Fee remission, 100% of vacation, sick, and holiday pay, and 100% of any applicable nonresident supplemental tuition (NRST) remission will be charged to the salary fund source (affiliated department account or an individual faculty research grant). Nonresident supplemental tuition would only be applicable for first-year, domestic, students who have not established CA residency.\nIf your salary fund source is an eligible extramural research grant, the buy-down program will rebate 25% of the Tuition & Fee remission expense and 25% of the NRST remission expense (if applicable) that was charged to the salary fund source.\nThe amount of salary cost that can be covered by FWS funds per quarter is capped at $2,256.75 for one unit (75% of $3,009) and $4,513.50 for two units (75% of $6,018). Should a program decide to hire a student participating in the FWS Program at a GSR step and FTE that pays a gross salary above $3,009 for the quarter (or above $6,018 when awarded two units of FWS), the program is responsible for covering all of the salary cost above $2,256.75 (or $4,513.50 if awarding two units).\nGrant cost-accounting generally requires that charges be in proportion to the effort devoted to that project. Thus, when a GSR appointment is split between multiple fund sources, the apportionment of benefits costs must be allocated according to the FTE allocated to each fund source, as reflected by the percentage appointment. For GSRs participating in the FWS Program, this policy requirement has an impact on the cost sharing of fee and tuition remission between Central Campus funds and the program fund source.\nFor example, if a program decides to award one unit of FWS to a 25% FTE GSR at the GSR Step V salary rate, this would result in gross salary expense for the quarter of $3,465.75 (using 2018-19 salary rates). For one unit of FWS, $2,256.75 of the salary is covered by FWS funds. $2,256.75 is only 65.12% of the total salary cost of $3,465.75. Tuition & Fee remission must follow the salary apportionment according to the distribution of total FTE. Therefore, in this example, 65.12% of the Tuition & Fee remission cost will be allocated to Central Campus funds and 34.88% will be assigned to the program salary fund source.\nIn summary, if you choose to pay a student participating in the FWS Program a gross salary above $3,009, your"}

{"idx": "34110", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Is Osteoporosis Surgery Better than Medication?\nWhile most cases of osteoporosis are caused by normal aging, another leading cause of the bone-loss disease is a condition called hyperparathyroidism, in which the parathyroid glands release an excessive amount of a hormone that regulates the body\u2019s calcium levels.\nDoctors commonly treat hyperparathyroidism using a class of prescription drugs called bisphosphonates, including alendronate (marketed under the brand name Fosamax) and ibandronate (Boniva), which are supposed to strengthen bones.\nNow, a study led by scientists at UCLA found that those drugs actually increase the risk of fracture, meaning that taking them is worse than doing nothing at all to treat the condition. The research also revealed that patients who have surgery to remove the overactive parathyroid glands have fewer subsequent bone fractures.\nThe report appears in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\nAbout 400,000 people in the U.S. \u2014 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1,200 men \u2014 have hyperparathyroidism; and osteoporotic fractures are a major public health and economic burden, said Dr. Michael Yeh, an associate professor of surgery and medicine, and the study\u2019s first author.\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 6,000 people who had been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism between 1995 and 2010. All had health care coverage through Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and their demographic and socioeconomic profiles mirrored those of the greater Los Angeles population.\nAmong study participants who were not treated for hyperparathyroidism, there were 56 hip fractures per 1,000 people after 10 years.\nAmong those who had parathyroid surgery, there were just 20 fractures per 1,000 people.\nFor those taking bisphosphonate medications, the rate of hip fractures was 86 per 1,000 patients \u2014 higher than the combined rate for those who underwent surgery or did nothing at all.\nThe researchers also reviewed the number of bone fractures of all types (including hip fractures), and the results were similar: For people who did not receive treatment, there were 206 fractures per 1,000; for those who had surgery, 157 fractures per 1,000; and for those taking bisphosphonate medications, 303 fractures per 1,000.\nYeh said it was also surprising that people taking medications had a higher risk for fractures, even though X-rays showed that they had similar gains in bone density to the people who had undergone surgery.\nResearchers also found that the risk for fractures among people taking bisphosphonates was higher whether people had osteopenia, or early bone loss, or full-blown osteoporosis, which Yeh said could suggest that either the drugs themselves are harmful or that the people taking them had other risk factors."}
{"idx": "34111", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: Care2 Healthy Living | Are Raw Foods Really Better for You Than Cooked?\nThe raw food trend is getting a lot of media attention lately, both on DietsInReview and in the wider health community. The raw diet tied for the second best diet for weight loss in U.S. News\u2018 assessment, and raw cleanses are a hot trend that\u2019s gaining popularity both for its promises of detoxification and weight loss.\nSupporters of the raw diet believe that raw fruits, vegetables and nuts are the richest sources of vitamins, minerals, enzymes and other nutrients. Some people who follow the raw food diet also include meat and dairy, but many are strict vegans. While a plant-based raw diet is certainly very healthy, cooking some plants actually increases some nutrients and can make others more bio-available.\nOnce you start into the question of raw vs. cooked foods, it immediately becomes a complex matter. Nutrition science has become quite sophisticated, yet there\u2019s still only a limited amount of research available on this subject. Some vitamins may be lost during the cooking process yet other nutrients are enriched by cooking and exposure to heat. However, there are still many gray areas when it comes to the importance of many vitamins, minerals and other phytochemicals, and even more uncertainly when you want to compare their values before and after cooking. Below are some of the facts that we do have about raw and cooked foods, organized by nutrient.\n\u201cHeat readily destroys thiamine (B-1) and vitamin C,\u201d says Mary Hartley, RD, MPH Nutritionist for Calorie Count. Scientific American reports that cooking tomatoes for just two minutes decreases their vitamin C content by 10 percent. Vitamin C is a highly unstable compound that is quickly degraded through oxidization and cooking. \u201cFoods high in thiamin include whole grain and enriched grain foods, fortified cereals, lean pork, wheat germ, legumes, and organ meats,\u201d says Hartley. \u201cVitamin C is found in many fruits and vegetables, especially red and green peppers, oranges, cantaloupe, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, baked potato, and cabbage.\u201d She suggests eating a raw source of vitamin C every day.\nLycopene is an essential nutrient found in tomatoes and other red berries and fruits. A diet rich in lycopene is associated with lower rates of cancer. One study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that one kind of lycopene is made more bioavailable by cooking. \u201cLycopene is a carotenoid, and all carotenoids, along with phenolic acids and flavonoids, are enhanced by cooking,\u201d says Hartley. She adds that studies have shown that carotenoid-rich foods are best eaten in the presence of fat or oil.\nThese vitamins appear to be unchanged by cooking. \u201cFiber, carbohydrates, protein, fat, minerals, trace minerals, and all of vitamins A, D, E and K, remain when vegetables are cooked,\u201d explains Hartley.\nLike vitamin C, B vitamins can be lost through boiling because they are water soluble. To decrease the loss of water soluble vitamins, choose cooking methods that minimize the use of water, such as grilling, roasting and microwaving. Making soups and stews will preserve some of these vitamins in the broth. Raw sources of vitamin B include bananas, oysters, tuna and caviar."}

Many of them, not surprisingly, are quarterbacks looking for more playing time. College Football 24/7's 17 for '17 series continues with a look at 17 transfers who could make the biggest impact at FBS programs this fall, 10 of whom play the quarterback position.\nSheffield originally signed with Alabama in 2015, but after a redshirt season at UA, he was off to Blinn (Texas) College, where Cam Newton once spent a season. Ohio State signed Sheffield from Blinn as the top-rated JuCo cornerback in the country, and after spring drills, coach Urban Meyer has already identified him as the team's third cornerback. He should see plenty of action this fall in an OSU secondary that will be wide open for competition in fall camp.\nIn another case of a transfer landing that reunites player with coach, McCollum made the move to Purdue from Western Kentucky just as new Boilermakers coach Jeff Brohm did. As a graduate transfer, he's immediately eligible. McCollum made 85 tackles for the Hilltoppers last season. He has all the size (6-foot-3, 235 pounds) and more than enough experience to make a clean transition into Big Ten play.\nBrowne's 2017 story could be one of redemption. After waiting three years for the starting quarterback job at USC, it was only his for a few weeks last year. Once Sam Darnold stepped in and led the Trojans to nine straight wins, Browne became a forgotten man. Now he'll look to replace Nathan Peterman at Pitt, and finally start for a complete season, in his last year of eligibility.\nBarnett didn't show enough last year at Alabama to call him a presumptive success at ASU, but there are some factors here working in his favor. For one, he'll be working with a familiar coach in new Sun Devils offensive coordinator Billy Napier, who was Alabama's receivers coach last year. And it's not as though Barnett doesn't have enough arm strength. He was a five-star recruit for a reason, and puts plenty of zip on the ball. He'll battle Manny Wilkins for the starting nod in fall camp.\nSirk reunites with coach Scottie Montgomery in playing his final season at ECU, and if that connection works as well as it did in 2015, the Pirates' offense will be in good hands. Montgomery was Sirk's offensive coordinator at Duke, where he threw for more than 2,600 yards two years ago. An Achilles injury washed out Sirk's 2016 season, while Montgomery took over as head coach at ECU. Montgomery likes to put the ball in the air -- ECU threw 554 passes last year -- so Sirk can expect plenty of action.\nFew listed here have as much game experience -- 347 pass attempts over three years at LSU -- as Harris. He wasn't able to keep the starting job there, but he enters a wide-open opportunity at UNC with the exit of Mitchell Trubisky to the NFL. He should also be able to put his rushing skills to good use in Larry Fedora's offense. Don't be surprised if Harris plays"}

These oceanic crabs spend their adult lives on a single floating object such as a turtle or a piece of plastic. While the crabs are usually found as monogamous pairs on turtles, plastic provides more space and potential mating partners. (Photo by Mike Gil, UC Davis).\nThe oceanic crab Planes minutus lives far from land. The crabs find a refuge between the upper shell and tail of loggerhead sea turtles, where they are nearly always found as a monogamous pair, one male and one female. But floating plastic trash in the ocean provides many new places for these crabs to live \u2014 and more space opens up many different ways for crabs to live and find partners.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is that the morphology of sea turtles seems to promote a particular mating system for the crabs,\u201d said Mike Gil, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis. Gil is co-author on the study, published Sept. 21 in the journal Biology Letters, with Joseph Pfaller of the University of Florida.\nIn 2012 Gil, then a graduate student at the University of Florida, joined a research cruise through the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As the current sweeps around the Pacific north of the equator, it collects floating trash into what is sometimes called the \u201cNorth Pacific Garbage Patch.\u201d The researchers collected pieces of floating plastic trash and looked at the communities of animals living on them, including oceanic crabs.\nOceanic crabs are a rafting species, Gil said. They are only found on floating objects, either living or dead. Crab larvae disperse through the ocean as plankton, but once they settle on a floating object they are essentially stuck on an island with a very limited ability to leave, as these crabs are poor swimmers.\nOnce on their island, they need a refuge in which to hide from predators and shelter from waves. This can be under the shell of a turtle, or among barnacles on a piece of drifting plastic. Venturing out, the crabs will forage on pretty much any organic material they can find on their island.\nThe space between a turtle\u2019s shell and its tail is big enough for two crabs to shelter from waves and predators, and small enough for them to defend against intruders. In ecology-speak, that means the crabs can \u201cmonopolize the resource.\u201d From this refuge, the crabs can roam all over the turtle, collecting food.\nWhen Gil and Pfaller pulled plastic from the ocean they found many more crabs, of both sexes and all ages, on the flotsam. Floating pieces of plastic such as old fishing buoys collect barnacles, and those \u201cforests\u201d of barnacles can provide space for many more crabs to live, and to live in different ways.\nIt\u2019s not quite an island paradise, though. Monogamous crabs on turtles are generally in better condition, while plastic flotsam crabs often have missing limbs, evidence of violent encounters while competing for space, food, mates or all three. Still, the benefits of being able to produce more baby crabs, by more partners, generally seem to outweigh the added cost of competition.\nThe project was part of the Plastics @SEA North Pacific Expedition, operated by the Sea Education Association, Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\nLearn more about Mike Gil's work here."}

It also affects the migration of fish.\n\"The reservoir is trapping the sediment and the sediment is very important for the stability dynamics of the river downstream. If the water has less sediment, it is more erosive. So the shape of the riverbed downstream will be affected.\"\nChina started building large dams on the Upper Mekong, in southwestern Yunnan province, near the border with Laos, in the mid-1980s. The government plans to build eight of them, and has already completed two dams, Manwan and Dachaosan. Work on a third one (Xiaowan) is in progress.\nChina needs the dams to create enough electricity to feed its voracious economic growth.\nExperts say the deep gorges of the Upper Mekong, known in China as Lancang Jiang, are geographically well suited for hydroelectric power generation. Chinese officials defend their dams, saying they help prevent flooding in the Mekong delta during the wet season.\nFeng Yan, a professor at the Asian International Rivers Center of Yunnan University, says China's upstream dams trap water in reservoirs during the wet season, which can then be used during the dry season. Downstream countries then get water in the dry season, and China gets electricity when demand is highest.\n\"Maybe in the future other dams will be built and there will be more water downstream in the Mekong River.\"\nConservationists say it is not only China's dams that are the problem; several large dams in Mekong tributaries are in the planning stage and could further harm the river system.\nLaos is building a large hydropower dam, Nam Theun Two. Much of the power generated from this project will be sold to Thailand. Environmental activists warn that Nam Theun Two will change the natural flow and ecology of the Xe Bang Fai River, which flows into the Mekong in Laos.\nEarlier this month, the Vietnamese government approved the construction of the Ninh Binh Two hydroelectric plant project in northern Vietnam.\nConservationists say halting the building of dams will not solve the problem if countries replace hydroelectric power with something less environmentally friendly."}

The earlier the investment, the riskier the bet. But the more jawdropping the returns if the company hits it big. It\u2019s so lopsided, that typically just 5% of those unsure, early bets create some 95% of the entire venture industry\u2019s returns. Miss one of them, and it haunts you for years. Snag it, and you can brag for even longer. This simple reality is precisely what makes the venture business hard, and the justification for why partners make such huge fees.\nSo what\u2019s up with the surge of the strongest early stage firms jumping so heavily into late stage mega-deal fray? Have the Valley\u2019s superstars lost sight of these rules or are the rules changing?\nEarlier this year, we wrote a lot about the shift in power at the early stages with the rise of super angels, but you could argue there are far greater ripple effects to this new late stage frenzy. That\u2019s not only true for the Valley, it\u2019s true for Wall Street. And you could argue, those ripple effects are less well-understood.\nSuper angels move small chunks of money, hedged across thousands of startups. Worst case, they all go belly up. More likely, the bulk of them barely return capital and a few do really well. Either way, plenty of angels will make bad bets and stop being angels, but the financial damage is otherwise pretty limited. There are plenty of jobs awaiting even the most outrageously failed entrepreneurs.\nBut the billions of dollars in late stage deals being invested by the top firms in Silicon Valley are another matter. First of all, we\u2019re talking about far bigger chunks of cash, mostly from pension funds and endowments. And these firms are making investments in the handful of sure $1 billion-plus winners that Wall Street and the Valley have spent more than a decade of sub-market returns waiting on to mature. Each deal represents dozens or even hundreds of people cashing out, while others take on a greater risk. And each deal represents another delay in companies like Facebook or Zynga going public.\nAnd quietly there\u2019s plenty of grousing going on about the trend. Some of it is pure player-hating, and some of it raises good points.\nFor example, the vast majority of VC firms who can\u2019t raise a $1 billion expansion fund cry that these new mega-funds aren\u2019t real venture capital investing, they are firms acting like hedge funds. Some allege they are even abusing their positions as the current darlings of the venture world to make huge trades in well-baked companies without any board obligations, but still get paid like VCs with huge management fees on these mega funds.\nWithin the elite Sand Hill Road club, VCs snipe about who is still adding value and draw distinctions between a negotiated late-stage deal and a pure secondary stock purchase. And, those who were smart enough to get in early on a giant like Zynga, Twitter or Facebook, chafe when a VC that\u2019s thrown money at a rich secondary valuation now proudly lists those companies as core companies in their portfolios.\nAnd then there are early stage companies hoping to disrupt giants like Zynga and Groupon and wonder if they should take money from a firm who is placing a much bigger bet on the well-funded giant. You could argue a firm staying out of the late-stage fray entirely may have a marketing advantage with them. And, as always, in the"}

And so we'd like to thank Genever, a gin-like spirit from the Netherlands dating back to the 16th century, for helping prepare our taste buds over the few centuries for fish-infused vodka.\nThe name Genever comes from juniper berries (how logical), the same plant that gives gin its distinct pine-like flavor. Who cares? Because gin's ancestor is damn good. Heady. Intense. In your face. The way a really good distillate should be. And it's Friday. We need a drink.\nGenever is related to gin more distantly, sort of like your third cousin at that sweltering summer family reunion (but the fun one who hides sparklers in the Igloo). Should you have a backlog of old cocktail books on your shelf, like Jerry Thomas' Bartenders Guide (the 1862 edition, or the reprint), any recipe calling for gin actually meant genever (the U.S. was primarily a genever, not gin, importer for centuries).\nGenever tastes maltier -- richer, fuller bodied -- than gin, a later variation on genever, because it is. Genever is distilled from maltwine, gin is made from a neutral spirit. Both are flavored with various herbs and botanicals, so what you get varies greatly by brand. Two of our favorites are Bols Genever from Holland, which hit the U.S. market again about two years ago. And California's own Anchor Genevieve (technically a \"genever-style gin\" because it isn't made in Holland, the Champagne vs. Champagne-method argument, if anyone still cares about that sort of thing).\nBuying both for a taste-off this weekend is going to cost you - the Anchor is around $30, the Bols about $10 more. But maybe you can do as Rembrandt did, and pay your genever tasting bill with a painting (notably not his own painting, but one by a student).

In this case, there are no immediately launches in the rumour mill, so we can only guess what will transpire.\nApple refreshed the entry-level Macbook almost exactly a year ago, making it a decent candidate given Apple's tendency toward yearly hardware cycles. But a Sunday launch would be odd, as would all the supposed secrecy for this launch - Apple is reportedly covering up its storefronts on Saturday night while employees work overtime to set up the new hardware.\nApple's long-awaited web services could finally arrive over the weekend. Aside from the iPhone, it's the only product that's been a constant source of recent Apple rumours. On the other hand, I'd expect Apple to hold off on this announcement until its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nA follow-up rumour from Boy Genius Report says Apple is installing NFC payment systems in its stores, but it's not clear how this relates to the rumoured product reveal. It could be the only thing Apple is doing, or it could be just a part of some other product. But given the off-and-on rumours about NFC in future iPhones, I can understand why Apple would want to keep the whole thing secret.\nThe iPod is also nearing its tenth anniversary, having launched in October 2001. The MP3 player was a big part of the Apple Store's early allure, so perhaps Apple wants to commemorate the product with something special. And consider this: the lowly iPod Classic was the only music player that didn't get a refresh last September.\nLest we get ahead of ourselves, Apple's weekend plans are just a rumour, so there's a chance that Sunday will bring nothing but business as usual to the Apple Store. We'll see.\nApple beats recession thanks to iPhone demand iPhone 6 release date: When will the iPhone 6 be launched?"}
{"idx": "34140", "prompt": "Continue the following text: You know it's gotten bad when the president is required to do damage control for his lawyer, but that's exactly what happened Thursday morning, when Donald Trump took to Twitter to explain himself, after Rudolph Giuliani admitted on Fox News that Trump repaid $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels. In suspiciously non-capitalized prose, Trump (or his ghost-tweeter) basically confirmed the story and said it was no biggie.\n\"He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn't a target of the investigation,\" Giuliani said. \"He's entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that, and he couldn't get that. So he fired him, and he said, 'I'm free of this guy.'\"\nIn saying this, Giuliani appears to have thought that he was exonerating Trump. Giuliani was saying Trump didn't fire Comey to obstruct the investigation into Trump campaign collusion with Russian sabotage of our election, but rather because Comey didn't publicly clear him, which Giuliani believes Trump was \"entitled to.\"\nBut this undercuts the leading public rationale that Trump offered for firing Comey. The White House has cited Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as the fake pretext for the firing. But now Trump's own lawyer has confirmed on national television that the rationale was directly related to the Russia investigation.\n\"It seems that Giuliani is trying to suggest that Trump did not obstruct justice when he fired Comey,\" Barbara McQuade, a former prosecutor and current law professor at the University of Michigan, told me. \"But in fact he may just be building the case against him. Even demanding that Comey make a public statement that Trump is not under investigation would itself potentially be obstruction of justice.\"\nMcQuade added that insisting on such a public statement constitutes \"interfering in the investigation.\"\nHere's a key bit of context showing why Giuliani's admission could be important: Remember that Trump himself reportedly made this same demand of Comey - and that special counsel Robert Mueller III appears to be examining that demand as part of his effort to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.\nAfter Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the probe in March of 2017, Trump told Comey in a March 30 phone call that he wanted Comey to confirm he was not personally under investigation, to publicly \"lift the cloud\" that the probe had cast over his presidency, according to Comey's memos. Comey detailed in the memos that he didn't want to do this, because the status of the probe could change (as it ultimately did), and he wanted to avoid having to publicly confirm such a change later. Comey took this exchange seriously enough to report it to his superiors at the Justice Department.\nWhat's more, we know that a short time later, Trump personally asked two other top intelligence officials to publicly confirm what Comey would not. As The Washington Post reported, they both refused the request, which they deemed \"inappropriate.\" Trump subsequently went further, prodding them to directly intervene with Comey to curtail the investigation, which they also refused to do.\nWe also know that Mueller is looking at all of this conduct. To establish obstruction, Mueller needs to show that in trying to hamstring or derail the probe, Trump acted with \"corrupt intent,\" say, to protect himself and his top officials from scrutiny. The leaked questions from Mueller show that he wants to ask Trump about that very same March 30 call with Comey in which"}

Most of them would fit quite nicely on the Rangers roster.\nTake switch-hitting Dexter Fowler, for example. A report earlier in the week suggested the Rangers and White Sox were still bidding for him. He could offer the Rangers protection in left field in case Josh Hamilton can't stay healthy and protection in center in case Delino DeShields can't repeat his rookie season. A .303 career batting average vs. lefties; a career .346 OBP. Some speed, some power.\nWhat's not to like about that?\nSpeaking of, what's not to like about still-unsigned Yovani Gallardo? He made 33 starts for the Rangers last year, pitched 184 innings, got the AL Division Series off to a nice start and, in case you forgot, he's from these parts. And the Rangers could use some starting pitching depth. They are counting on Yu Darvish to return from Tommy John surgery in May, but there are no guarantees with that.\nNot to mention: 2015. The Rangers rotation depth was decimated by the first week of the regular season. Darvish was lost to Tommy John; Derek Holland to shoulder issues. Or 2014: Martin Perez and Matt Harrison crumbled inside a week of another in mid-May; the season crumbled along with those losses.\nFor all the reasons that those kinds of signings would make sense, here's the one over-riding reason why they are - and this being optimistic - \"unlikely:\" The Rangers don't have the dollars.\n\"We are in the range of where we'll end up payroll-wise,\" is the way general manager Jon Daniels put it Wednesday.\nYou can choose whatever conspiracy theory you'd like to support why the Rangers don't have money to spend, but the fact is Daniels was given a budget last fall and told to stick to it.\nAs for the \"range,\" in the parlance of baseball front offices that's usually about 2-3 million dollars, not 8-10 million, which is what it will take to sign Gallardo. That's not say that IF Gallardo is still standing and IF the money continues to fall and IF Daniels and company make an impassioned case, ownership might expand the budget once again. That's a lot of \"ifs.\" Too many to bet on.\nFor the time being, though, they've had no real meaningful contact with reps for either Fowler or Gallardo.\nWhat's more likely: The Rangers will look at the likes of Tim Lincecum, who is supposed to throw a showcase session for teams in the next 10 days or so (the Rangers will be represented), or oft-injured Gavin Floyd, who has pitched a total of 92 innings in the majors over the last three seasons. There are no guarantees about either, but, then again, that might be the exact thing the Rangers are looking for.\nBoth pitchers might have to take minor league contracts, which don't include any guarantees. It would give the Rangers a full six weeks of spring training to look at the duo without committing any real money. And the major league portion of those kinds of contracts is usually built on a very low base salary with real money kicking in for incentives on starts or innings.\nAs they look to round out the roster, this is"}

{"idx": "34149", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Sometime around 1892, a Connecticut dentist named Washington Sheffield\u2014who'd introduced toothpaste to America in 1850\u2014received a letter from his son, Lucius. While studying art in Paris, Lucius had watched realist painters squeezing their oils out of tin tubes and thought the container would be a novel way for his father to package his own product. The dentist agreed and began selling his Doctor Sheffield's Cr\u00e8me Dentifrice in tubes.\nIt's a great story of American innovation, and the reason nobody much remembers it is because, four years after Sheffield's dispenser debuted, a more established brand of toothpaste out of New York adopted the tube. That brand was Colgate.\nWhile Procter & Gamble's Crest is the category leader\u2014with a 34.2 percent share of the market, per Euromonitor\u2014Colgate toothpaste, from Colgate-Palmolive, is the brand that has stood the test of time.\nAs New York dentist and media personality Thomas Connelly points out, toothpaste isn't much of a differentiated category. \"It's a staple, it's habitual, and there are not a whole lot of benefits to changing,\" he noted. So why do people keep reaching for that red and white tube\u2014to the tune of $314 million last year?\nIt's part timing, part marketing. Though challenger brands have chipped away at its dominance, Colgate has never surrendered the advantages that come with being first to market. (Samuel Colgate began selling his toothpaste in jars in 1873.) \"It's the law of first in,\" said Adam Padilla, founder of consultancy BrandFire. \"Colgate was the first, and they originated the tube. Once you have that foothold, you are the immovable piece that everyone else reacts to.\" Colgate didn't just popularize the tube\u2014in 1908, it also added a rectangular opening that forced the paste out in a ribbon shape, a simple innovation that let Colgate position itself as the \"ribbon dental cream\" for years.\nStill, Colgate is seen as the stalwart brand, the inevitable brand, the family brand of toothpaste. And that's no accident. Because parents tend to introduce their kids to toothpaste and because adults usually buy the brands they remember from childhood, Colgate continues to enjoy a kind of pass-down popularity that's difficult to efface, Padilla pointed out.\n\"When you teach your kids, 'Daddy says use Colgate,' they'll stay with the brand,\" he said. \"Once you're in there, you have that recognition.

But have you tried putting your lunch break to good use? Instead of spending the hour chatting at the watercooler while you munch on a snack from the vending machine, grab something healthy and use the rest of the time to tackle some important odds and ends - like your finances. Below, we share 14 tasks that you can accomplish over lunch that will help you build a better financial future.\nCheck your budget from time to time so that you can visualize the progress you're making toward paying down debt or saving. Make it a habit. \"This will help you stay on track and help you feel motivated to keep working hard toward reaching your goal,\" said consumer finance expert Andrea Woroch. She suggests using an app like Mint, which links all of your financial accounts in one place and provides a real-time snapshot of your spending and saving habits.\nRather than just thinking about your financial goals, write them down in a diary or on a vision board. \"You're more likely to stick to your budget if you write down your plans and are specific,\" said Marshay Clarke, a certified financial planner at Betterment, a financial advisory site. Make sure to revisit your goals periodically to stay on track.\nYou're more likely to save money if you have somewhere to put it. During your lunch break, you can easily open a savings account at your current bank or with an online bank that offers a high-yield savings account. While you're at it, set up a recurring monthly transfer from your checking account for automatic savings.\nThere are apps that help you save and take minutes to set up. Dr. Elizabeth Dunn, co-author of the book \"Happy Money\", is an adviser for the Joy app and their free FDIC-insured savings account. The app allows users to automatically save extra cash without having to do much extra work. \"This is important because just adopting the goal to save money doesn't seem to change people's financial behavior,\" Dunn said. \"But getting a little nudge to save a manageable amount of money can make a difference.\"\nOther apps that allow you to save incrementally are Digit and Qapital. Digit will recommend how much you should save, based on your spending habits and financial obligations, whereas with Qapital, you create your own saving rules.\nIf cash is really tight, or you want to save for a large purchase, maybe it's time to pick up a side hustle with Fiverr or TaskRabbit. Plenty of people have been known to use their lunch hours to pick up riders as Uber or Lyft drivers, too. Put those extra funds toward a future goal, like a vacation or down payment for a new home.\nIf something unforeseen should happen in your home, like a fire or a robbery, do you know what you're covered for? If not, take a few minutes to find out so that you're not caught off guard should something occur. No insurance? Research policies online over lunch.\nKnowing your credit score is important because it can positively or negatively affect your ability to secure a loan, qualify for certain credit cards and, in some cases, get a job. A free service like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame will monitor your score and send you emails if something is amiss.\nUse an online retirement calculator to determine if you are saving enough for your long-term goals.

We are delighted that The Ireland Funds have joined us in committing to extending the programme.\nClayton also had a warm welcome to the news that the Stavros Niarchos Foundation which was represented at the dinner had made a special contribution.\nMusic Generation is Ireland\u2019s National Music Education Program which transforms the lives of children and young people through access to high quality, subsidized performance music education. Initiated by Music Network, Music Generation is co-funded by U2, The Ireland Funds, The Department of Education and Skills and Local Music Education Partnerships.\nIn 2015, U2 and The Ireland Funds \u2013 who together gifted a $10m in 2010 to launch the initiative \u2013 are donating a further $3.5million to the program to develop its next phase. Already, Music Generation is established in 12 areas of Ireland, providing access to music education for some 35,000 children and young people annually and creating 350 employment opportunities.\nAnnounced during the event was an additional $1 million gift to Music Generation from The Stavros Niarchos Foundation. Members of the Stavros Niarchos family were in attendance and several young musicians who have benefited from Music Generation attended the Gala and performed moving pieces using traditional Irish instruments.\nThe American Ireland Fund New York Dinner Gala recognized Mike McGavick, CEO of XL Group plc with The Leslie C. Quick Jr Leadership Award for his company\u2019s investment in Ireland and his philanthropic endeavors.\nOver 1,000 guests from the spheres of business, the arts and politics attended the Gala at Chelsea Piers \u2013 Pier Sixty. The 2016 American Ireland Fund New York Dinner Gala was chaired by Eugene McQuade, Chairman of XL Group plc and William J. Mills, CEO North America of Citi.\nFor more information on The Ireland Funds and a listing of organizations that have received support, visit www.theirelandfunds.org and follow #AIFNYGala."}

{"idx": "34156", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: That newspapers have a short shelf life can be a humbling thought for a journalist. More comforting is the knowledge that as Americans toss them out, more than three-quarters are recycled - part of a growing trend in paper recycling in general.\nLast month, the American Forest and Paper Association reported that paper recycling reached a record high in the US in 2005. More than 51 percent of all paper products consumed was recovered, up considerably from 1990, when 33 percent was recycled.\nThe environment thanks Americans for that trend, because paper is the heavyweight of solid waste. As more people placed newspapers, junk mail, and cardboard cartons in recycling bins, they sent 4 million fewer tons of paper to landfills last year than they did in 1990 - even while consuming 15 percent more paper products.\nIn the 1990s, demand for recycled paper and paperboard lagged and the market suffered a glut, making paper pickup too expensive for many municipalities. But that's no longer the case, because of the insatiable economic appetite in China, which is gobbling up a fifth of the world's recovered paper. China is short on trees and recycling is less of an option in a country that sends so much of its paper abroad as packaging in exports.\nThe US paper industry also sees increased demand for recycled paper fiber coming from India, and is looking to further the US recovery rate.\nThat won't be possible unless Americans become more enthusiastic - and more efficient - paper recyclers. (They should also improve their overall recovery rate of solid municipal waste, which is only about 25 percent.) It was only a few years ago that New York City gave up all recycling because it was too expensive. But in 2004, rising landfill fees brought it back. That factor, combined with market demand for many types of recycled waste, should spur government and business to recover more, and to make recycling easier for the 85 percent of Americans with access to recycling.\nThat's the idea in Denver, a latecomer. Waste recovery in the mile-high city has boomed since it introduced \"single-stream\" recycling last summer. Consumers in some parts of the city, and in other savvy-minded US municipalities, don't have to sort plastics, glass, metal, and paper, but can toss everything into large curbside carts or commercial-sized bins at convenient locations. The sorting takes place off-site at an upgraded facility run by Waste Management.\nMeanwhile Philadelphia is experimenting with frequent-recycler awards to encourage consumers. In a program run by a start-up called RecycleBank, residents can earn spending coupons by the weight of their recycling, calculated from computer chips embedded in their bins.\nEnvironmental consciousness is at the heart of recycling, but better market incentives are needed to give that consciousness a needed push."}

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a series of blasts in Brussels that left dozens dead and many more wounded.\nAs voters cast ballots, the presidential candidates lashed out at each other's foreign policy prescriptions, showcasing sharp contrasts in confronting the threat of Islamic extremism.\nTrump, the Republican front-runner, charged that the United States has \"no choice\" but to adopt his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country to prevent the spread of terrorism. He described as \"eggheads\" those who respect international law's ban on torture, the use of which he argued would have prevented the day's attacks.\n\"We can be nice about it, and we can be politically correct about it, but we're being fools,\" Trump said in an interview on CNN. \"We're going to have to be very strong, or we're not going to have a country left.\"\nClinton and Trump's Republican rivals, meanwhile, questioned the GOP front-runner's temperament and readiness to serve as commander in chief, and condemned Trump's calls to diminish U.S. involvement with NATO.\n\"I see the challenge ahead as one where we're bringing the world together, where we're leading the world against these terrorist networks,\" Clinton said Tuesday at a union hall in Everett, Washington. \"Some of my opponents want to build walls and shut the world off. Well, you tell me, how high does the wall have to be to keep the Internet out?\"\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz seized on Trump's foreign policy inexperience while declaring that the U.S. is at war with the Islamic State group.\nTrump and Clinton both enjoyed overwhelming delegate leads heading into Tuesday's contests. Arizona and Utah featured elections for both parties, while Idaho Democrats also held presidential caucuses.\nDemocrat Bernie Sanders and Republicans Cruz and John Kasich hoped to reverse the sense of inevitability taking hold around both party front-runners. Anti-Trump Republicans are running out of time to prevent him from securing the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination.\nSanders condemned his GOP rivals' calls for stepped up surveillance of Muslims in the United States.\n\"That would be unconstitutional \u2014 it would be wrong,\" he told reporters during an appearance in Flagstaff, Arizona.\nThe underdogs in both parties had reason for optimism Tuesday.\nTrump appears to be in a stronger position in Arizona, which will award all of its 58 delegates to whichever candidate wins the most votes.\nKasich hopes to play spoiler in Utah, a state that prizes civility and religion.\nA week ago, the Ohio governor claimed a victory in his home state \u2014 his first and only win of the primary season. Kasich on Tuesday criticized his Republican opponents for targeting Muslims in their responses to the Brussels violence.\nHe told reporters in Minnesota he doesn't believe all Muslims in Minnesota or elsewhere are \"somehow intent on trying to destroy our families.\" He said, \"This is a time when you have to keep your cool.\""}

But I\u2019ll let that pass.\nThe bigger issue is that the concern of young people for the natural world, admirable though it is, would be a lot more convincing if they were all able to recognise it when they saw it.\nThe fact is that traditional outdoor pursuits, like frog spawning, playing conkers and picking blackberries in the autumn, are completely alien to a generation of young people, who have grown up seeing the world only through the prism of a phone screen.\nThis week, a Rotary Club in Doncaster has been trying to address this by making gifts to the 100 primary schools in its area of The Lost Words, a book that attempts to re-educate the young in the simple pleasures of nature. The headteacher at one of the schools told me that most of the estate kids in her classrooms had no idea about any of them.\nThe lost words to which the title refers are the 50 or so nature-related terms that have been expunged from the Oxford Junior Dictionary and replaced by 21st century expressions like broadband and chatroom.\nI don\u2019t have a problem with new words entering the lexicon. English is a living language. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have to impose a one-in, one-out rule.\nIt has taken \u2013 of course \u2013 something on a screen to alert today\u2019s children to the changing face of nature. Thanks to Sir David Attenborough\u2019s campaigning documentaries, they can see at second hand some of what their parents and grandparents experienced for themselves by digging around in gardens, ponds and at the edges of the school playing field.\nIndeed, Sir David has become so synonymous with natural history lessons that the headteacher to whom I spoke had declared a David Attenborough Day at her school. The pupils don\u2019t get a day off for that one.\nThis belief that nature is a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre yet not a tangible part of children\u2019s lives is an anomaly not unique to Doncaster, and fuelled in part by questionable decisions in education policy-making. Playing fields are being sold off by the hundred, according to a report this week. Some 215 have been lost in this decade alone, with schools using the proceeds to plug the holes in their budgets.\nAt the same time, disadvantaged children are being given free access to \u201ceducational apps\u201d that will \u201chelp them use their screen time constructively\u201d. Is that a step in right direction? It may help them learn to write, but if they experience so little outside their own four walls, what will they write about?\nIt is a conundrum that throws into stark relief the north-south divide within our own region: you can have the great outdoors or a school on your doorstep, but not both.\nThe balance could be restored by actively encouraging migration from overpopulated parts to the countryside. On a large scale, it would be neither practical nor welcome, yet baby steps in that direction are being taken, with some success, by initiatives such as Great Place, a Lottery and Arts Council-funded project to ferment thriving communities of young, creative types and their children within the Dales.

J.B. Pritzker made boosting it a central component of his campaign. The Senate last week approved a gradual hourly increase to $15, and the House is poised to send the legislation to Pritzker to sign before he presents his first budget plan on Feb. 20.\nIllinois will join Washington, D.C., and at least four other states with a $15-an-hour minimum by 2025, an 82 percent spike in current base pay. But it may not be the momentous impact on low-wage workers that some supporters expected.\n\u201cGiven the business opposition, you\u2019d think that the state was proposing to give away bags of money and shut down every burger joint along the border,\u201d Robert Bruno, a labor professor at the University of Illinois, said after reviewing the AP\u2019s numbers.\nBruno co-authored studies on the impact of minimum-wage increases in Illinois for the university\u2019s Project for Middle Class Renewal and the Illinois Economic Policy Institute. They found that increases reduce worker turnover, trimming employer costs and correlates with only a small cut in the number of hours employers can offer minimum-wage employees and a small increase in consumer prices.\n\u201cIncreasing the minimum wage is a reasonable and evidence-based way to help working families earn a livable income,\u201d Bruno said.\nDespite the delay and inflation\u2019s expected damage, advocates contend that the plan \u201cwill lift out of poverty\u201d many of the 1.4 million workers \u2014 nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s workforce \u2014 who would benefit from the bump.\n\u201cIt would be great if we could take them all the way up to $15 (immediately), but there are economic realities we took into account as we\u2019re doing it,\u201d Pritzker said last week when asked about the claim.\nThat\u2019s not to say the increase won\u2019t help.

In the wake of the major United Nations climate report, many scientists have pointed out the urgency of preserving forests, nature\u2019s finest carbon dioxide sinks. Yet forests aren\u2019t the only answer \u2014 we need all ecosystems on deck. And according to a new study, changing land management to increase carbon storage could offset a whopping 21 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe study, published on Wednesday in Science Advances, found that natural solutions to global warming could offset the amount of pollution equivalent to what\u2019s released from every car and truck on the road in the nation. Along with forests, coastal ecosystems, grasslands, and farmland all have the potential to sop up a significant portion of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases. The study, which involved 38 researchers, looked at 21 different natural measures that could prove essential in the unfolding climate catastrophe.\nFargione noted that natural solutions don\u2019t just trap carbon but come with co-benefits to human health and the ecosystem. For example, rotating cover crops (plants grown in the off-season to protect the soil), can store half a ton of CO2 per every acre. On top of that, cover crops can build soil health, hold onto nutrients, and reduce nutrient and sediment pollutions.\nAmong the 21 solutions, the study highlighted ten that could account for 90 percent of the mitigation potential. These included shifts in agricultural practices, such as improved nutrient management on farms, the use of biochar (a carbon-rich soil amendment) and cultivating crops between rows of trees (known as alley cropping). Also on the list: restoring the nearly one-third of U.S. marshes subject to freshwater inundation, which would reduce methane emissions, as well as preserve the natural carbon sinks found in grasslands and forests. Urban sprawl is the largest driver of forest loss in the United States, so better zoning and land management could also significantly prevent deforestation (while also making cities more livable).\nThe solutions, however, aren\u2019t one-size-fits-all and need to be tailored to each region. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell everybody they have to do exactly the same thing,\u201d said Alison Eagle, a scientist on the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s sustainable agriculture team. She pointed out that in places where there is a significant nutrient deficiency, fertilizer can help improve productivity while using less space \u2014 thereby preventing deforestation.\nWhile natural solutions seem to have great potential to mitigate climate change, some experts say they can\u2019t be the only approach. Katharine Mach, a senior research scientist at Stanford and a lead report author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasized that decarbonizing needs to come from many sources, ranging from fully biological to engineered. \u201c[It is] absolutely imperative that we not think of it as either, \u2018We\u2019ll decarbonize our energy services\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019ll tackle the land,\u2019\u201d she said."}

Should a sea otter habitat be associated with a polluter that is causing enormous harm to the aquatic wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico?\nThis is not an unusual dilemma. Charities, hospitals, universities and other non-profits occasionally face the ethical challenge of what to do when one of their donors becomes tainted.\nOne option is to return the donation and delete the honour bestowed on the benefactor. The day after David Radler pleaded guilty to committing fraud in the Hollinger case, Queen's University in Kingston announced that it would be returning his $1-million gift and deleting his name from a hallway in the business school. Israel's University of Haifa also returned a $75,000 donation that Mr. Radler had made to its business school.\nAnother strategy is to do nothing. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto continues to honour Conrad Black and his family for their donation. A hallway in the hospital still bears the \"Black Wing\" name.\nBP has been a generous supporter of cultural activities in the Los Angeles area. It has supported the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Walt Disney Concert Hall and a local public television station. Should these institutions return the donations and delete BP's name, or should they do nothing?\nIn its press release at the time, Queen's University said, \"Ethics and corporate social responsibility are a cornerstone of good business practice, and we take them very seriously at Queen's.\" Clear enough. But an environmental disaster - awful as it is - may not necessarily be incompatible with the goals of an art gallery or concert hall. They may legitimately opt to do nothing.\nBut, what about the Aquarium? On the surface, oil pollution that is killing the aquatic wildlife along the coast of Louisiana is inconsistent with a sea otter habitat designed to protect a threatened species. According to the Aquarium, \"California's sea otters are concentrated in a relatively small area, and a major oil spill off the central coast could wipe out the entire population.\" Furthermore, BP has a history of accidents, from an oil refinery explosion in Texas in 2005, to an Alaskan crude oil leak in 2006 in its Prudhoe Bay pipeline.\nSo, should the Aquarium delete BP's name?\nThe difference between the Radler donations and the BP donations is that David Radler admitted he intentionally committed a fraud that cheated the shareholders of Hollinger. From all the evidence currently available, it appears the BP disaster is a horrendous accident. BP did not intentionally set out to pollute the Gulf of Mexico. As such, the Aquarium has no ethical obligation to return the donation and delete BP's name from the sea otter habitat, even though they may now be under severe pressure to do so.\nWhat, then, are the lessons that can be learned from this incident?\nFirst, non-profits should carefully screen their donors. Mother Teresa apparently accepted donations from anyone, no matter how unsavoury the donor. Her contention was that the money went to a good cause, helping the poor and destitute in the slums of Calcutta. But few non-profits have the moral"}

CARIFORUM (CARICOM and the Dominican Republic) now exports about US$400 million worth of fish and seafood annually, according to the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM).\nBelize and Jamaica are two Caribbean seafood exporters already tapping into markets controlled by the European Union (EU) \u2014 a tough market to access because of stringent standards which require that countries have systems in place to ensure that their exports are not only safe for consumption but also free from harmful pests and pathogens.\nIn the case of Belize, which has traditionally exported shrimp to the EU, it is moving to export conch to that market for the first time, according to Endhir Sosa, Senior Food Safety Inspector, Belize.\n\u201cConfidence is what is key. It is what everybody seeks when it comes to the purchase and consumption of food products. SPS is one of those routes where you can establish that confidence in your product,\u201d Sosa said.\nThis has been the case for Belize: \u201cWhen BAHA [the Belize Agricultural Health Authority] first started in 2000, you could count the number of countries we were exporting to on your hand.

I mean, I'm happy, but I'm not thrilled or anything.\"\nThe former substitute teacher won the role of Tony's (Michael Stoyanov) wife, Shelly, over many other contenders. It's a part that the show's producers hope will enhance the story line.\n\"Blossom\" executive producer Judith Allison says, \"We had quite a search. We needed the character to not be the traditional sitcom girlfriend or wife.

There, the longtime recovering alcoholic goes on a bender. He wakes up with a hangover and a new wife.

Viewed in geographic terms, religion has a NEGATIVE correlation with happiness.\nLet\u2019s compare the top ten MOST religious states in the USA with the ten LEAST religious states in terms of happiness.\nIf religion is the key to happiness, then we would expect the states with the MOST religious populations to have the happiest populations as well, and we would expect the states with the LEAST religious populations to have the least happiest populations. A perfect positive correlation between religion and happiness would be if the number one most religious state also had the number one spot in happiness, and if the second most religious state was number two in terms of happiness, and so on. A perfect correlation would also mean that the LEAST religious state in the country would have the least happiest population, and the second LEAST religious state would have the second least happiest population, and so on.\nThere is NOT a perfect positive correlation between religion and happiness. In fact, the most religious states tend to be states with lower than average happiness, and the least religious states tend to be states with above average happiness. In terms of states, religion has a NEGATIVE correlation with happiness.\nNote that West Virginia is one of the top ten most religious states, and it also has the LEAST happy population in the USA (it ranks dead last).\nNote that two of the ten least religious states (Alaska and Hawaii) are the two states with the happiest populations in the USA (ranking number 1 and number 2, respectively).\nIn a 2011 paper that analyzed self-reports from hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, researchers found that the connection between religious faith and happiness was strongest among people living in difficult conditions\u2014fear, poverty, hunger.\nWhen we divide the world up by states or nations, the LEAST religious states or nations tend to have the happiest populations, and the MOST religious states or nations tend to have less happier populations. This geographic organization of data on religion and happiness indicates that religion is NOT the key to happiness, and it also casts doubt on the claim that religious people tend to be happier than non-religious people.\n2. Whether religion correlates with happiness depends on how one measures happiness.\nReligion correlates with happiness only when specific measures of happiness are used, particularly the Oxford Happiness Inventory. When other measures of happiness are used, the positive correlation between religion and happiness may disappear.\n3. Whether religion correlates with happiness depends on how one measures religion/religiousness.\nSurveys also ask people about their religious practices, such as how often they pray, how often they read or study scripture, how often they attend religious services, and surveys ask people about how they feel about religion (\u201cHow important is religion in your daily life?\u201d), and about their religious experiences (\u201cDo you feel close to God when you pray?\u201d).\nSo, religion and religiousness can be evaluated on the basis of different sorts of considerations: religious identification, religious"}

Equifax had data on 143 million clients stolen last year. Even the U.S. Internal Revenue Service admitted that 700,000 social security numbers and other information may have been stolen in 2015.\nCanada is not immune. Last year, WestJet suffered a security breach involving its rewards program members.\nUsually, breaches go unreported. According to a 2017 study by the Ponemon Institute \u2013 which conducts independent research on privacy, data protection and information security policy \u2013 the average cost of an intrusion today is US$3.62-million and the average time to resolve the damage of a malicious attack is 55 days. The question is how to protect against an attack. Clearly, there is a balance between accepted risk and the cost of doing business.\nThere are different types of attackers. Some just do it for fun with no particular objective in mind. So-called \u201cWhite Hats\u201d perform intrusion tests in order to highlight weaknesses, while \u201cBlack Hats\u201d are bad guys seeking profit or commercial advantage. Finally, \u201cOrganized Hackers\u201d are the most dangerous, because they possess sophisticated resources to help them perpetrate fraud.\nWhat attackers usually seek are user names and passwords.\nPotential attackers follow a user\u2019s social-media sites to gain insights into their personal profile, and lots of information is available. Pet names, product preferences and lifestyle behaviours can help intruders get answers to security questions.\nHow do you crack a password? It can be done with specialized software. Another method is by listening to unencrypted data transmission in unsecured networks (such as airports or coffee shops).\nDisguising oneself as a trusted visitor, such as a network printer, can be a successful gateway into a network. So, how does an organization protect itself?\nStart by fostering a culture of cybersecurity. This means employees should be well-educated about safety practices and should encourage one another to follow such practices.\nHaving secure passwords is paramount to security, and passwords are the easiest way for attackers to get in. The problem is we are human and have a limited capacity to recall passwords, and people can have several passwords.\nThe solution is to use a password vault, such as LastPass, which will generate a distinct password for each site that requires one and it will store that distinct password in a secure vault. All the user needs is one strong password to let them enter the vault.\nAnother good idea is having several e-mail addresses. That may be daunting, but separate e-mail addresses for work, home and banking will help you recover lost information.\nMany security providers offer innovative solutions to help organizations enhance their security. The trick is to determine the delicate balance between what it costs to operate a business and how much to spend on data protection.\nAlways evaluate the security technologies available and determine which one provides the most value to your cybersecurity defence. For any organization, big or small, creating a strong cybersecurity foundation requires investing in the basics, such as security intelligence. This means having a program that lets you continuously learn about new methods of attacker intrusion.\nThe final defence is really an audit, or \u201crisk assessment,\u201d to test the organization\u2019s system. It involves extreme pressure testing on all entry points to the system (i.e., performing tests to ensure that all attacks are blocked).\nIt is never enough to only test compliance with the organization\u2019s policies.

Shortly after, Carollo called for Tuesday\u2019s special meeting, which he described as a necessary legal step since the laws that govern the park require that any contract be approved by the board.\nThe vote went quickly, with little discussion save a few changes to the contract limiting when the festival can conduct sound checks and requiring that the festival increase its investment in off-duty police and firefighters to nearly $800,000. Rolling Loud will go on as scheduled, May 5-7.\nAfter the meeting, Carollo said the Trust needs to have a deeper discussion about the large downtown business and residential community that has built around the park over the last 15 years, and whether that should change the use of the park.\nThe park, located on the bay next to Bayside Marketplace, has hosted events for nearly 100 years and is currently host to an amphitheater booked through Live Nation.

Well, according to an anonymous MLB source, the season didn't have to turn out the way it did for the Phillies.\n\"Charlie Manuel wanted two free agents after that  season ended,\" the source said. \"Charlie wanted Josh Willingham to play left and Jonathan Broxton to set up in the eighth inning. Charlie's request fell on deaf ears. It's a shame since if Charlie gets those two players, it's a very different season for the Phillies.\"\nIf Willingham and Broxton signed with the Phillies, the odds are the team would have had a different record in July and Pence would have never been traded. Would Pence have won a World Series ring with the Phillies? Who knows. But the odds are that the Phillies would have made the playoffs with Pence, Willingham and Broxton.\nWillingham had a monster season for the cellar-dwelling Twins with 35 homers, 110 RBIs and a .890 OPS. His big right-handed bat would have been huge during the first half of the season with Ryan Howard and Chase Utley out. Willingham signed a three-year deal for $21 million. The Twins could trade Willingham. Should the Phillies be one of the suitors?\n\"I think so considering the outfield, free-agent class,\" the source said. \"It would be tough to give up some chips on the farm when you could have just gotten him as a free agent last year.\"\nAnd then there is Broxton, who was rock solid in the Reds bullpen with a 2.82 ERA. He could have helped salvage the season for the Phillies, who blew nine games with two outs in the eighth this season.

At issue is whether or not Rutgers' Kia Vaughn fouled Nicky Anosike before time expired.\nTelevision replays showed the game clock seemed to pause at two-tenths of a second for about 1.3 seconds before running to zero as Anosike came down with an offensive rebound and was grabbed from behind by Vaughn.\nOfficials replayed the video and ruled the foul came just before the buzzer. Anosike calmly stepped up and hit the two free throws to take the victory.\nThe Precision Time device, which keeps time for all NBA games and many at the college level, uses small microphones attached to the referees' whistles that communicate wirelessly to devices worn on the referees' belts which stop the game clock. When the device picks up sound from the whistle, the clock stops.\nThe official must hit a button on his belt pack to restart the clock.\nAt the same time, the official timekeeper manually controls the clock. Whichever signal is picked up first -- the sound of the referee's whistle, the click of the belt pack button or the pressing of the timekeeper's button -- officially controls the clock.\nCostabile said because the clock seemed to pause before reaching zero indicates to him that either an official or the timekeeper may have stopped the clock, anticipating Anosike would be fouled, and then restarted it when that wasn't immediately the case.\n\"That can take as much as 0.8 seconds to 1.5 seconds,\" he said. \"That's telling me people froze up.

With trade between Europe and Russia worth 10 times more than US trade with Russia, European Union leaders are treading a fine line between sanctions that will influence Moscow while not damaging their own economies \u2013 many of which are still emerging from the eurozone crisis.\nThe latest sanctions are more sweeping than previous ones, and target whole sections of the Russian economy \u2013 not just individuals and companies.\n\u2022 Restrictions on the export of hi-tech oil-production machinery, with a total ban on equipment destined for deep water, Arctic or shale production.\nWashington has also blocked three Russian state-owned banks from US capital markets, as part of a package of measures Barack Obama said would impose growing costs on Russia. But Hammond also acknowledged: \"It would be absurd to suggest that we can impose wide-ranging sanctions on the Russian economy without also having some impact on ourselves.\" Both sides will be watching closely to see which is hurting the most. Below are the industries targeted and the pain factor for each side on a scale of 1-5, with 5 the most painful.\nDenying Russian banks access to the moneylenders of New York, London and other western financial capitals could eventually tip the country's struggling economy into full-blown recession. The EU has banned banks and companies registered on its territory from buying or selling bonds issued by Russia's state-owned banks or their subsidiaries. The US has put Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, the Russian Agricultural Bank and the Bank of Moscow on its banned list. But Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, has not been included, raising fears that loopholes and exclusions may weaken the impact of the sanctions.\nUS banks have been less generous funders of Russia in the past: European banks had lent Russian institutions around $155bn (\u00a392bn) at the end of March, according to the most recent figures available from the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements.\nExcluding Russian state banks from international finance would not trigger instant collapse, but the measures are certain to increase capital flight, increase pressure on the rouble and put any investment plans into the deep freeze. So far, the Russian Central Bank has vowed to stand by its banks and take \"necessary, adequate measures\" to protect depositors and customers.\nThe City of London is often seen as the main loser from any attempt to freeze Russia out of the financial system but only 1% of its earnings come from Russia.

Also, hundreds of millions in fraud.\nBut will the dream of a device that can analyze multiple health factors from a small amount of blood be buried along with it?\nWhat Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was proposing, as outlined in the popular HBO documentary about her ill-fated, fraudulent company that aired this week, was scientifically impossible. She told the world she could run 200 tests on a fingerprick-worth of blood using a device she called the Edison, but The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley reveals she faked the impossible, putting patients' lives at risk.\nThe extent of the Theranos grift is so gargantuan, its effects are still rippling even after Holmes was first caught lying in 2015.\nThere are dozens of other companies working on similar, if less-sweeping projects, that involve re-thinking diagnostic blood testing. But the stench of Theranos' fraud is now getting on them all, and making it more difficult for legitimate projects to raise money from investors.\n\"The reputation was so bad that everybody would run the other direction if they thought you were doing something like what Theranos was doing.\"\n\"Understand that for the last four years, anyone that's been talking about point-of-care diagnostics in front of investors has had to say 'and we're not like Theranos,'\" Dr. Paul Yager, the former director of bioengineering at the University of Washington, said. \"The reputation was so bad that everybody would run the other direction if they thought you were doing something like what Theranos was doing.\"\nYager is an expert in \"microfluidics,\" which he describes as the \"field of research and engineering that involves itself with moving small volumes of liquid for any purpose, including medical diagnostics.\" Under grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institute of Health, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Yager has been developing portable tools to test small amounts of blood for diagnosing diseases to use particularly in the developing world.\nThe problem with Holmes' Edison wasn't necessarily the underlying idea of portable, low-impact, point-of-care testing. Using a small amount of blood to run diagnostics for one or more conditions is a reasonable idea, Yager said, within limits. Innovation in microfluidics is leading to progress in this field and a better understanding about what can be done with a small amount of blood. But oversized ambition and purposefully ignoring scientific and tech realities caused Theranos to fail \u2014 muddying the waters for everyone else.\n\"There are real home tests for a variety of conditions in the U.S. domestic market that are based on microfluidics,\" Yager said. \"But none of them is following the Elizabeth Holmes model at this point.

The documentary features multiple Theranos employees explaining how they tried to tell leadership the Edison wasn't working, but to no avail. Holmes raised $400 million and hooked a lucrative contract with Walgreens, rolling out blood draw centers in Arizona even though the Edison was inaccurately analyzing patients' blood.\nThe Edison's first and largest problem is that a fingerprick-worth of blood is insufficient for testing a variety of conditions.

The deterrence concept is straight-forward: persuade a potential adversary that the risks and costs of his proposed action far outweigh any gains that he might hope to achieve. To make deterrence credible, the United States built up powerful strategic, theater and tactical nuclear forces that could threaten any potential aggressor with the catastrophic risks and costs of a nuclear retaliatory strike against his homeland.\nDuring the Cold War, the primary focus of this deterrent was the Soviet Union. The Soviets built their own nuclear force targeting the United States, producing a situation of mutual deterrence, often referred to as \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d or MAD. Many argue that MAD worked and kept the United States and Soviet Union from an all-out war\u2014despite the intense political, economic and ideological competition between the two\u2014as the horrific prospect of nuclear conflict gave both strong incentives to avoid conflict. Others note that it was too often a close thing: crises, such as those over Cuba and Berlin, brought the two countries perilously close to nuclear war.\nAs the United States developed a post-war alliance system, the question of extended deterrence\u2014the ability of U.S. military forces, particularly nuclear forces, to deter attack on U.S. allies and thereby reassure them\u2014received greater attention. Extending deterrence in a credible way proved a more complicated proposition than deterring direct attack.

But how could the United States make credible the threat to use nuclear weapons against the Soviet homeland in response to a Soviet attack on U.S. allies in Europe? Or, as it was often put, how could an American president credibly persuade his Soviet counterpart that he was prepared to risk Chicago for Hamburg?"}

The band had recorded its self-titled debut LP two and a half years earlier, cobbling money together between a Kickstarter campaign and other sources, and it took that long to settle on \"a good label fit, a good management fit, the whole team,\" lead singer and guitar player Zach Williams says.\nIn the meantime, the three members had been working other jobs: Pipkin as a pastry chef (\"She makes a mean Whoopie Pie,\" Williams attests), Williams as a solo artist, and lead guitarist Brian Elmquist as a songwriter and Brooklyn diner server with \"the worst Yelp review of any waiter we know,\" according to his bandmates, thanks to his proclivity for cutting his jean shorts rather short and thereby showing an aggressive amount of thigh. \"The world wasn't ready yet,\" Elmquist laments.\nBy March 2013, the world beyond the Lone Bellow's Brooklyn community was more than ready to savor the band's distinctive brand of crossover Americana, which blends rousing gospel choruses, bluegrass-inspired finger picking, and electric guitar riffs to create a sound that falls somewhere between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the Staples Singers, and contemporary folk-rock acts like Houndmouth and Deer Tick.\nOne night at South by Southwest, the Lone Bellow played to a packed backyard crowd at the Newport Folk Festival showcase, a crowd that obliviously sipped cans of Lone Star in Blackheart's beer garden while the relatively unknown Lone Bellow set up and tuned. When the band's first three-part harmony soared over its sturdy wall of acoustic sound, heads instantly rotated toward the rundown lean-to that had been converted into a stage.\nThe band captivated the crowd for the duration of its set, even cultivating a group sing-along to the anthem \"Carried Away\". The experience of being in that crowd felt akin to attending an evangelist revival meeting: everyone was a convert by the end.\nFollowing their shows in Austin, the Lone Bellow realized they had just enough money and enough of a following to devote themselves full-time to music, no longer needing to ask their bosses for time off to \"go on a radio tour, or to go play Conan,\" Pipkin remembers. Dropping everything to promote the album \"was really scary\", according to Williams. \"It was like jumping off a cliff a little bit. But we believed in the work we were doing, and we had a lot of encouragement around us, and yeah, it was a beautiful thing.\"\nReleasing and promoting their first album was very much a homegrown, collaborative effort, as the band was lucky enough to live in a Brooklyn community of artists and musicians who were happy to lend their talents to the project. From designing posters to laying down instrumental tracks, the bands' friends helped make The Lone Bellow a reality. \"On the first record,\" Williams says"}

To her credit, Barra has dealt well with the crisis. But, preventing future tragedies only helps GM recover lost ground. Barra now needs to define a forward-looking leadership agenda. That agenda should include the biggest technological disruption that Barra will face in her tenure as CEO: driverless cars.\nGM is working on driverless cars but, like most automakers, it is taking an incremental approach aimed at semi-autonomous cars where a human driver is always ready and able to retake control. GM executives argue that fully autonomous, i.e., driverless, cars might someday be possible and become a competitive threat but that day is a long way off. GM, therefore, does not consider itself in a race with Google.\nWhile the imperative to beat Google is applicable to every major automaker, Barra and GM face a particularly stark moment of crisis and opportunity. Here are five reasons why Mary Barra should change gears and make beating Google (and every other contender) in driverless cars a CEO-level strategic imperative.\n1. Hedge the downside. As I previously wrote, there are five scenarios that automakers should fear if Google beats them to fully autonomous cars. One scenario is that Google amasses a significant lead in differentiating intellectual property (IP). Two scenarios deal with how Google might deploy that IP\u2014either as a dominant supplier or to power competitive offerings. Two other scenarios examine how traditional automakers might be precluded from new markets, such as driverless mobility for the young, elderly, handicapped and other non-drivers, and new business models, such as Uber-like driverless car services, that displace private car ownership. The best way to hedge against these downside scenarios is for GM to have its own serious contender in the race to build fully autonomous cars.\nGM already has many of the strategic assets required for this challenge. It has a wide range of relevant expertise, both internally and at research partners like CMU. GM has also been working for years on the EN-V, a small electric vehicle concept car that now incorporates autonomous driving technology. GM\u2019s strongest advantages over Google, of course, are the car building capabilities that will be critical in the transition from prototypes to production vehicles.\nEven if a non-incremental thrust does not ultimately produce a fully autonomous car, there would be immense learning benefits. By tackling the more challenging driverless problem, GM would gain greater insights and build capabilities in software, sensors, user interface, car integration and other key component technologies that should be relevant for semi-autonomous cars as well. It could enhance its own IP portfolio with key technologies that are likely to shape the industry for decades. This learning would also be important in helping GM deal with potential partners and suppliers.\n2. Buy an option on the upside. Ramping up efforts on driverless cars is not just about defense, it would also allow GM to go on offense\u2014and even potentially change the game. By accelerating the development of driverless cars, GM could put itself in a better position to take advantage of the potential business model innovation and inevitable creative destruction.\nDriverless cars could spark the biggest revolution in transportation since the Model T. They could revolutionize private and public transportation\u2014including car ownership and the nature of mobility. In the US alone, more than $2 trillion flows each year through car-related related economy, including parts, sales, financing, service, maintenance, insurance repairs, rentals, energy, etc. The worldwide revenue stream is many times that amount.\n"}

Sometimes, we actually want gridlock. So the way, for example, the American political system was set up with checks and balances, checks and balances is another word for gridlock. Any senator can block a bill. So, sometimes, we want gridlock in politics, sometimes, because it slows down too fast, too quick legislating. It basically can cool tempers. It can prevent tyranny of the majority. So, gridlocks sometimes can be useful in the political sense. Juries, in criminal juries, we require unanimity. Any individual can block the decision. And why do we do that? Because we really care more about protecting the rights of the innocent. So there are places in the economy and places in the legal system where we place, where gridlock can have some real value. So, instead of a tragedy of the commons, you might have what I call in the book a comedy of the anticommons. Sometimes, having people to be able to block each other is a good thing, but most of the time, for most resources, tragedies of the anticommons are wasteful and destructive.\nThe system of checks and balances in the American political system is an example of positive gridlock, says Michael Heller."}

But surely nothing can compare to the hysteria surrounding its latest tenant, the eighth installment of the Harry Potter saga, titled Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Nine years after the final novel\u2019s publication, J.K. Rowling\u2019s most beloved characters are back in a two-part play created by Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. Anticipation has been feverish around the world; tickets are as hard to catch as a Golden Snitch, and producer Sonia Friedman has compared the endeavor to opening a Star Wars movie in a single cinema. And yet there\u2019s been little advance word on the ground since previews opened. Rowling and her acolytes have successfully convinced early viewers to keep silent about the play\u2019s story. Call the auditorium a chamber of secrets.\nThe uncharitable might surmise that this was to cover up negative word of mouth. After all, the creative team faced the daunting challenge of honoring the expectations of fans who can measure their childhoods by the Harry Potter novels while also offering a fully rounded work of drama, instead of a theme park ride to be franchised around the world. But the truth is that they have succeeded on both fronts. This enchantment will turn even the most doubting Muggles into true believers.\nThe story picks up where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows left off. The middle-aged Harry and his wife Ginny are seeing their younger son Albus off from platform nine and three-quarters of King\u2019s Cross Station, alongside married couple Ron and Hermione and their daughter Rose. But all is not well. Harry\u2019s relationship with Albus is complicated. His son labors under the weight of his legacy and soon finds an unlikely soulmate in Scorpius Malfoy, himself struggling to shift a rumor that he is Lord Voldemort\u2019s son.\nThe duo become a trio of outsiders with the arrival of the punkish Delphi, niece of an aging Amos Diggory. Amos is still grieving for his son Cedric, who lost his life competing with Harry in the infamous Triwizard tournament portrayed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It\u2019s the elder Diggory\u2019s desire to rewrite history that sets in motion a chain of events that will spin the Wizarding World back into darkness.\nCynics have suggested the decision to split the play into two parts rather than one smacks of commercial exploitation, echoing the way the final book was broken in two on screen. But Cursed Child could only be told over the five hours that splitting it into two allows. It\u2019s a fiendishly complex narrative, and moves at a lick; the first two years of Albus\u2019s time at Hogwarts are told in the first fifteen minutes. Considering each of the books covers the course of a single year, this marks a radical change of approach.\nWhile many Potter fans might have preferred a new movie or a book, this is a story that feels made for the stage. Yes, it\u2019s packed with effects as characters cast spells, fly and even transform, achieved through old school stagecraft rather than digital trickery. But Thorne and Tiffany also conjure up moments of intimate drama; it\u2019s telling that the biggest gasp in Part One came not from a twist of the plot or a moment of magic but during a blazing argument between Harry and Albus where the father firmly crosses a line.

The team, who have spent thirteen years covering the flight path of the aircraft, may finally have an answer.\n\"Amelia's Electra had specific modifications done to it for her specific journey, and the fact some of those unique modifications appear to be verified in the wreckage that's been found, we really do believe its very likely this is the real thing\" said Jill Mayers, the team's public relations manager said to the Daily Mail.\nOne of the most prominent discoveries in the search for Earhart was a small piece of glass, believed to have come from the plane.\n\"We can report that we found a piece of glass, approximately 6 inches in diameter, that shares some consistencies with a landing light on the Lockheed Electra 10E.\"\nIt is the theory of Bill Snavely that during Earhart's fateful voyage, the pilot was forced to turn around after 12 hours flight when running low of fuel.\nThere have been many false alarms in the search for Amelia Earhart's plane, but as historian Doug Westfall announced Buka Island is the first site \"to have time, distance and fuel all right.\"\nThe researchers, who have been working with local Pacific Islanders to examine the site, say that the crash has been passed on in the oral history of Buka Island.\nThe Project Blue Angel team are committed, saying even if it turns out not to have been Earhart's plane \"we hope to find out who lost their lives in this crash and give their families closure.\"\nProject Blue Angel are running a crowdfunding project to turn their research and discoveries into a documentary film.\nThe project hopes to use the US$200,000 (NZ$293,000) to lead further dives to the site and raise awareness with their film about Earhart's life and their subsequent search for her remains.\nLast year a study pieced together the little discernible facts known about the loss of the pioneering aviator.\nAt the time it was a story of global significance.\nAfter her disappearance on July 2, 1937, 120 radio operators claimed to have picked up her final transmissions, including from SS New Zealand Star.

Seven years later I returned to the classroom and have been at it ever since. That first year was a tough one, though, and I'm disappointed in myself when I think that I almost gave up for good.\nI often look back at my first year teaching and wonder why I didn't sail right on to my second year. Truly, the students were almost my age. (I was reminded recently that my seniors from that year are now 53 years old; that provides a little perspective!) In addition, there were no support practices in place back then\u2014no mentor teachers, no beginning of the year orientations, no collaboration meetings for novice educators. We were placed in the classroom, handed a textbook, and told to \"go forth and teach.\" Also, no one spoke of \"teacher working conditions.\" The fact that I taught four different levels of English (different grade levels and ability levels) and worked with three different extracurricular groups was not unheard of back then.\nBut what if I'd had more \"grit?\" What if my twenty-two year old self had persevered?\nThere has been a great deal of discussion recently about grit relative to teacher retention and student achievement. As a high school and college student, I was definitely one who persevered. I was the passionate one, going after my dreams with vigor, refusing to allow obstacles to stand in my way. And later, after returning to teaching, I was that same tough, tenacious, tireless worker, willing to give my all for the profession I had chosen first, and then, chosen again.\nAlthough I understand it may appear that I lost my \"grit\" when I turned in my resignation that first year, I truly believe there were many other indicators that influenced my decision to leave teaching. First and foremost, I needed more support. When we expect a first-year teacher to perform like the 30-year veteran in the classroom next door, we set that teacher up for failure. As a profession, we also need to be aware that many of our novice teachers need more than assistance with classroom management and lesson planning; many are away from home and on their own for the first time. Isolation can knock the grittiest teachers to their knees.\nI believe those of us who choose teaching as a profession are pretty darn gritty from the get-go. We know teaching is hard, although rewarding, and we're up for it! But it takes more than grit to be successful, accomplished, and experienced.\nCindi Rigsbee is a National Board Certified Teacher currently working on educator recruitment and retention initiatives as a Regional Education Facilitator for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.

Now some Menlo Park residents are being asked to plan an estate for Granny, a centuries-old oak tree, and San Mateo County may come to the rescue.\nThe choice between digging a tunnel to save the heritage oak -- versus opting for the cheaper route of cutting it down -- hinges on who's willing to take responsibility for maintaining the tree in perpetuity.\nDuring a July 20 meeting between the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and a coalition of neighbors fighting to spare the tree, a new possibility emerged. According to county staff, Assistant County Manager David Holland wants to explore whether the county should take over Granny's care.\n\"It's not a made decision, obviously,\" said mediator Maya Perkins. An aide for Supervisor Rose Jacobs-Gibson, Perkins presented the idea on behalf of the assistant county manager, who was unable to attend the meeting. \"He sounded pretty confident it could be arranged.\"\nThe county could allow limited public access and possibly create a community garden for the 1,100-by-80-foot parcel, she said. Both the SFPUC and the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors would need to sign off on the deal.\nEarlier in July, the SFPUC asked a coalition of neighbors fighting to save Granny to promise they would handle maintenance, liability insurance, and public access should the commission decide to dig a $269,000 tunnel under the tree for a pipeline meant to carry water from the Hetch Hetchy as part of a $4.6 billion seismic improvement project.\nThe oak sits in the path of the pipeline, on a right-of-way owned by the SFPUC at 827 15th Ave. in North Fair Oaks. The commission initially planned to kill the tree in May on short notice, which riled Granny's neighbors.\nWhether the county can afford to take over the right-of-way remains unanswered. San Mateo County recently asked Menlo Park to acquire Flood Park as budget cuts landed the park on the shortlist for closure.\nMoney aside, the idea achieved a rare moment of harmony between the SFPUC and the coalition. Both sides agreed it was a fine idea -- in theory. \"We would need assurance that the county wouldn't back out,\" SFPUC Project Manager Joe Ortiz said.\nCharles Berkstrasser, whose home borders the easement, said county management was a more comfortable option. \"Nonprofit organizations are inherently unstable,\" he noted.\nThe coalition hopes to speak with Holland next week and present a summary proposal to the SFPUC by July 27, according to spokesperson Mary Ann Mullen.\nHolland was not immediately available for comment.\nOnce again we get too many involved in a simple situation. All that must be done in pound a cheap tunnel under that tree and be GONE. We don't need to take care of the tree forever or whatever else some demented IDIOT thinks up.\nPound the tunnel and if the tree lives, all good.

So, we are neither doves nor hawks, but owls and we are vigilant when others are resting\".\nWith one more year to go in his current three-year tenure that began on September 4, 2016, Patel is being seen by the RBI watchers as being firmly in the saddle on regulations of banks, the monetary policy framework and the all-important handling of the NPA situation, among various other tasks he has.\nOn so-called frictions between the RBI and the government, a senior banker said this relation has always been so and it was summed up perfectly by former RBI Governor D Subbarao when he narrated an incident involving his predecessor Y V Reddy who kept saying \"No, no, no, no, no, yes, no, no, no\" while talking to someone over phone.\nL"}

In the top 10 is our own Rosedale neighborhood, ranked No. 6 nationally.\nAccording to Redfin, this analysis confirms the old real estate strategy of buying the cheapest house on the best block. For homebuyers looking for those three key factors (affordability, highly rated schools, and walkability), Redfin suggests looking for the least expensive home in a neighborhood that has a mix of affordable and high-end homes. These types of mixed neighborhoods are three times more likely to be walkable and near highly rated schools than affordable communities.\nThree other Austin neighborhoods meet the desirable standards, including Zilker (No. 12), Bouldin Creek (No. 20), and Highland (No. 22). All four of the Austin neighborhoods analyzed in the report are relatively close to downtown; have great parks, shops, and other businesses residents can easily access by walking; and have strong schools nearby.\nThis common trend in Austin of desiring city living without compromising quality of life is also taking hold across the U.S.\n\"The taste of the American family is shifting from sprawling far out McMansions to close in homes near urban amenities,\" says Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson. \"Add affordable prices and highly ranked schools and you get homes every family wants but few can find. The upshot of our latest report is that these gems can be found in neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, where families across the income spectrum can live, work, and play together.\"\nHouston is the only other Texas city that has a neighborhood on the Redfin list: The Westmoreland/Montrose area ranks nationally at No. 13.

The harvested plants will be used by the GPO and its allied academic institutes to extract cannabis substrates to further medical research and produce affordable cannabis oil sublingual drops for patients.\nGPO managing director Withoon Danwiboon said the new indoor plantation is the first legal cannabis farm in Southeast Asia. It is equipped with advanced hi-tech closed-system aeroponics farming technology, as well as a high-security surveillance system.\nThe technology will ensure the resulting crop meets the high medical-grade standard required to manufacture medicine from the plants.\nWithoon said the GPO has invested Bt100 million in the project to construct the closed-system farming facility and to install the supporting system for a 100-square-metre indoor plantation.\n\u201cBecause we need a very high quality and organic cannabis for our research and development, we have to spend a lot to create a closed environment farming facility,\u201d he explained.\nPiyasakol cautioned that Thailand was far behind other countries and many transnational private pharmaceuticals companies in term of the medical cannabis innovation and technology.\nThe future of the country and many patients who require cannabis-based medicine for their treatment, are at a great risk of monopolisation of the market and would suffer from very costly drugs, he said.\nIn order to avoid being a victim of monopolisation, it was very important for the authorities and all related agencies to swiftly invest in medical cannabis research and development, he emphasised. The next five years are particularly vital for the nation to develop its own medical cannabis innovations and fill the technological gap in cannabis medicine, Piyasakol said.\nThe amended Narcotics Act decrees that only official agencies and their partners are allowed to grow cannabis for producing medicines in the first five years after legalisation. The law aims to prevent private companies from taking over the cannabis farming business in Thailand.\nThe agencies, which are allowed to legally farm cannabis for medical purposes, will have to comply with strict security rules and meet very high standards to ensure an organic crop that can be used to create medicine.\nThe strict regulations for register a cannabis farm has already caused complaints from traditional Thai practitioners and"}

The move allows Lahn the ability to provide for Floyd, which so far has included an SUV, a credit card and a trip to Disney World, according to the report.\nIs this the story of a family persevering or an exploitation of an NCAA loophole?\nIt's hard to judge what's in someone's heart, but even if the adoption is from the heart, it's clearly both.\nThe NCAA\u2014wisely\u2014told George that it addresses issues of adoption on a case-by-case basis. Considering the emotional attachment that theoretically could be present, that's the right approach.\nConsidering Lahn was disassociated by the University of South Carolina\u2014his alma mater\u2014for making impermissible inducements to recruits through the Student Athlete Mentoring Foundation, the skepticism surrounding the story is certainly justified.\nLahn certainly doesn't help himself by essentially admitting that he is drawn to elite athletes.\n\"None of my family members are good athletes, me included,\" Lahn said, \"so with my genes I would never have the opportunity to give birth to kids who play football or basketball in college at such a high level.\"\nThat, along with the fact that Lahn has provided impermissible benefits in the past and been disassociated from an SEC school as a result, raises red flags all over the place.\nHowever, the situation passes the smell test because it already has.\nLahn and Floyd were forthcoming with Florida's compliance office during the adoption process and after, when Lahn hosted a birthday party on a rented yacht for Floyd and several friends, some of whom are part of the Gator football program.\nQuestionable? Yes. You don't run party plans by the compliance department unless there's at least a little doubt.\nFlorida isn't going to jeopardize its season by playing a potentially ineligible player who already has been suspended by the NCAA unless it feels comfortable with the situation.\nBecause of that, we have to take Lahn and Floyd at their word unless there's a reason not to."}

Since Schmitz\u2019s account\u2014based mostly on discussions with Daisey\u2019s interpreter\u2014and This American Life\u2019s retraction of an episode contaning an abridged version of Daisey\u2019s monologue on the subject, several other China-based Westerners have expressed that they, too, had thought Daisey\u2019s story sounded fishy.\nIf many western reporters thought Daisey was making things up, and Schmitz was able to prove it, doesn\u2019t it follow that Apple must have known all along that Daisey was lying? For example, Apple should have known that there were no hexane-related injuries at any of Foxconn\u2019s Shenzhen facilities, contrary to Daisey\u2019s claim to have met injured workers there whose \u201chands shake uncontrollably.\u201d Given the knowledge that Daisey was damaging their brand with lies, why hasn\u2019t Apple sued him for slander?\nI suppose the answer is that Apple felt a slander suit would not serve its interests. Litigating Daisey\u2019s monologue would have brought out the same revelations we\u2019ve seen this week\u2014some of its content is true, some is made up, and some describes real events that Daisey heard about but did not witness. Such a mixed bag of findings would not have quieted objections to Apple\u2019s business practices in China, and would have raised the profile of the complaints.\nUnfortunately, this calculus reflects the fact that the public is likely to mis-analyze the merits of Apple\u2019s operations in China. There is a temptation to say that many of Daisey\u2019s lies were inconsequential: whether in Shenzhen or Suzhou, there were Foxconn workers who suffered hexane poisioning. (Correction: the Suzhou incident involved Wintek, another Apple contractor, not Foxconn.) This is essentially Daisey\u2019s defense\u2014that he took real stories and made them more vivid by telling them as though he had seen them in person.\nBut a key reason Daisey\u2019s account was effective is that it depicted a density of horror at Foxconn\u2019s Chinese plants. If Daisey could visit just one city for just six days and come out with as much vivid material as he did, imagine what is going on at Foxconn\u2019s facilities all over the country. Admitting that many of the conditions he discussed were not uniform and not necessarily common\u2014and not, so far as he could tell, present in Shenzhen\u2014would have made his critique much less damning.\nA lot of the anger at Daisey over the last couple of days has focused on how he has wronged the listeners who believed his story and the outlets that agreed to broadcast it, and those groups certainly should feel wronged. But we\u2019re almost glossing over Daisey\u2019s primary victims: Apple and Foxconn, the companies he has been maliciously lying about, and their shareholders. Slander is still wrong even when the entity you\u2019re lying about is a huge and wildly successful company, and it\u2019s not wrong principally because you might embarrass the network that broadcasts your slander.\nI think a slander suit against Daisey has probably gotten even less likely after this week\u2019s revelations. Daisey can\u2019t have much money to pay damages with, and the other valid reason to sue for slander\u2014to get someone to stop lying about"}

SEO is alive and well. All of your blog posts must come from keywords. You should stop wasting time with keywords.\nSEO gurus have been saying things that contradict each other over and over again. So, who's right?\nThe answer is, as it usually goes in these types of arguments, no one. But also no one is completely wrong. If you ask any of the people who defend either side of the argument, they will most likely tell you that they have results to prove their claims. The problem is the tendency to confuse causation with correlation when it comes to search engine ranking. So what should you do if you want your blog to rank well in the search engines in 2017?\nEverything changed a few years ago with Google's Hummingbird semantic search algorithm. Long gone are the days when all you needed to get your page to rank was to research some high traffic keywords, stuff them wherever you could, get some shady links and call it a day.\nEver since Google implemented this update, the way SEO was approached had to be changed. This semantic search algorithm is what gives Google that eerie ability to just know what you are looking for. To say it in a grossly oversimplified way, the search engine understands what you are looking for.\nWe see this when we search for a topic and the search results show what we wanted, but had none of the keywords that we entered in the search box. Which is the answer: keywords or topics? It turns out that you need both.\nThe key to making sense of all this SEO mess is to understand what Google actually wants. Google wants to help you find what you were looking for \u2013 only faster. This means that the content you create must be an interconnected series of topics that make sense for the reader. Additionally, it must also contain relevant keywords to the search topic.\nThe best way to think about it is from a user experience perspective. This is one of the main concerns of Google nowadays. So if you are in the process of creating your blogging strategy, you need to make sure that the topics you cover make sense for the person making the search. You also need to make sure your content contains the necessary keywords for the search engine to put it all together.\nAlso, keep in mind that keywords can't come at the expense of topics or the other way around. The keywords you choose to target should be logically connected with the topics you'll be covering on your blog.\nComplicated as it may sound, things are a lot easier now. Create quality content that humans will find helpful and make sure it has your target keywords in a way that makes sense. Remember always, content is still king.

Mourinho will reportedly get a pay-out of between 13.7 million and 16.5 million euros (\u00c2\u00a39.7m-12m; $14.9m-17.9m) -- a sum of little significance to Chelsea's billionaire owner, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\nBut Rossi said any new manager will also need cash on the table to change players and the cost of a planned new 60,000-seat stadium on the club's Stamford Bridge site has to be factored in.\n\"Every time you change a manager in the UK, you need to give him the power to change the squad,\" Rossi said. \"Probably in the next years financially they will have some concerns.\"\nThe expert said tensions in the dressing room were so bad that Abramovich faced a choice between sacking Mourinho or 11 players.\n\"The easy decision is to change Mourinho,\" he said. \"A player like Diego Costa has strong market value. Next year if Mourinho was still in the club, he would have been sold for nothing,\" he added.\nChelsea are unlikely to qualify for next season's Champions League, which will also have a significant impact on revenues, said Rossi.\nManchester United's revenues fell by 8.8 percent -- or 52 million euros -- between June 2014 and June 2015 because of their failure to qualify for the competition.\nChelsea, champions in May by an eight-point margin, have been sucked into a potential relegation battle after losing nine of their first 16 games. Wyn Grant, an expert in football business at Warwick University, central England, said Chelsea's poor performance this season had hit revenues.\n\"There are financial implications in that corporate sales were dipping. Also a lower place in the table means less revenue,\" he said. \"Boosting corporate hospitality income is a key part of the club's plans for the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge,\" he added.\nChelsea last month announced it had made a loss of \u00a323.1 million (31.7 million euros, $34.4 million) last season. The west London club also announced annual revenues of \u00a3314.3m, marginally down on the 2013-14 high of \u00c2\u00a3319.8m.

At its best, America is the idea that every human life has value and every human being has the unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These rights transcend the importance of specific symbols (like a flag) or rituals (like standing during the national anthem). Without this idea at its heart, America is just one more country in the gaggle of nations that make up the global community. That's why each NFL player who followed Colin Kaepernick's example and protested during the national anthem \u2014 whether it was because they shared his belief in racial justice, were appalled at Trump's attempt to bully protesting players into silence, or both \u2014 was acting in the spirit of the highest form of thoughtful, substantive patriotism.\nWhen future cultural historians look back at the 2017-2018 NFL season, this will be their verdict.\nBefore I proceed with my discussion about American Revolutionary soldiers and bald eagles, however, there is one flawed argument which must be dispensed with: A person is not a cop hater simply because he or she opposes the racist practices of many police officers. Logically speaking, it is possible to criticize individuals within a given institution, or even aspects of the institution itself, without opposing everyone in those institutions or everything they do and represent. While there are people on the ideological extremes who hate all police officers, or think we shouldn't have law enforcement personnel at all, there are also millions of people who recognize that cops perform a vital public service and are staffed by many men and women who deserve to be regarded as heroes.\nA mature mind can simultaneously recognize both this fact and the reality that the rampant racial discrimination experienced by minorities from law enforcement in this country is deeply wrong. Anyone who claims that a critic of police actions is automatically a cop hater isn't just creating a straw man argument, but is shutting down intellectually honest conversation on a vital subject. They are the ones who, when looking back at this period in our history, will need to do so with shame rather than pride.\nNow back to American Revolutionary soldiers and bald eagles.\nBut she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later \u2014 oftener soon than late \u2014 is apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows.\nAs Reynolds noted, this made it clear that the eagle \u2014 which was chosen as a reference to the Roman Empire and was admired for its militant and aggressive character \u2014 could represent America's best and worst traits.\n\"In other words: As a symbol of the government, you gotta watch out, because the government can protect you, but it can also hurt you,\" Reynolds said"}

Every single gamer.\"\nThose were words from Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich when updating investors on the company's Optane technology, which the chipmaker believes could ultimately replace SSDs and DRAM in PCs and servers.\nIntel is now shipping the first-generation Optane but is also working on next-generation technologies as looks to increase density in this new class of storage and memory.\nIntel says Optane is significantly denser and faster than SSDs and DRAM. It is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, co-developed with Micron.\nThe chipmaker looks at Optane as the Moore's Law of storage. With future generations, Intel wants to make the memory smaller, denser and cheaper, and that's driving the development of Optane.\nThat's good news for users. Initial Optane SSDs may be expensive, but prices will go down as the manufacturing cost-per-bit is driven down. Storage will be faster as Optane will bring data closer to the CPU.\nIntel has talked about some uses for Optane. Games will run faster with chapters pre-loaded in Optane SSDs. Optane could also be used for analytics and machine learning, which need to move data in and out of storage faster. Intel's ultimate goal with Optane is to unify memory and storage, but that goal could still be a long time out.\nMicron is also delivering its own brand of 3D Xpoint products under the QuantX brand. Last week Micron said it is also working on its future 3D Xpoint technologies.\nIntel's low-capacity Optane will be available for laptops in the second quarter. The company has already started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing.\nThe company has also qualified and shipped the first test Optane SSDs to data centers, Rob Crooke, senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, said during a speech Thursday at the company's investor day meeting.\nEnterprise SSDs are typically high in capacity. Memory and storage for enterprises based on 3D Xpoint will disrupt DRAM and SSDs in servers, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel.\nIntel's projections for Optane in 2017 are modest. Crooke characterized it more as an \"investment year,\" with money being poured into factories and research. The total 2017 revenue will be less than 5 percent of Intel's storage revenue.\nStorage and memory aren't major revenue generators for Intel, totaling just US$816 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total Intel revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, with a bulk coming from PC and server chip sales."}
{"idx": "34249", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: The rise of British chip design firm ARM is attracting attention, with analysts claiming that chip giant Intel is under increasing pressure to develop better low-power x86 equivalents to ARM's licensed offerings - and a recent acquisition by Intel suggests they're on the money.\nAn article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday highlighted ARM, which originally started as an off-shoot of Chris Curry's Acorn Computers and was responsible for the development of the original Acorn Risc Machine processor thanks to a design by engineer Sophie Wilson. The outfit has been lauded as a company that's 'changing the world' - and nobody's more aware of that than incumbent chip giant Intel.\nIntel produces the majority of processors for desktops, laptops, and servers - but, despite recent moves into new markets, is very much a bit player in the embedded and smartphone market. ARM, by contrast, hadn't made a desktop- or server-centric CPU design for years, instead concentrating on low-power mobile-friendly chip designs that account for most smartphones available on the market today - until it announced the Cortex-A15 'Eagle' design.\nIt's not just the chip design methodology that differentiates Intel and ARM, however. The latter doesn't actually produce any hardware, licensing chip designs to third parties like Nvidia, Samsung, and Qualcomm, who tweak the design and produce their own, custom hardware.\nThat's something which Intel has not traditionally offered. With Intel's method of doing things, if you want an Intel chip there's only one place to buy it: from Intel itself. If you want a customised Intel chip, you need to go begging cap-in-hand to Intel and hope they consider the prospective income worth the hassle of doing a custom manufacturing run.\nIt's a big difference in flexibility, but also in margins: while Intel's profit margin was a healthy 65 per cent last year, ARM's sits at around 94 per cent - and all without the risks of having inventory that can stale and fabrication plants to run.\nIt's not all about the margins, however. ARM's sale of chip design licences means that it doesn't command the same revenue as Intel. While its costs are lower, royalties of around 3p per chip built using its design mean that its revenue last year was around \u00a3391 million - which contrasts markedly with Intel's \u00a327 billion bumper year.\nDespite the big difference in size, Intel clearly thinks it has a thing or two to learn from ARM. As well as a commitment to produce low-power Atom-based Xeon chips for eco-friendly servers by 2012, the company has today announced the acquisition of system-on-chip specialist Silicon Hive in order to boost its SoC offerings.\nSystem-on-chip designs are design solutions that pack as much functionality as possible onto a single chip, integrating CPU, GPU, memory controller, audio, camera and video interfaces, and networking capabilities into a single piece of hardware. SoC designs like Nvidia's Tegra 2 or Samsung's Exynos range are where the majority of licensed ARM CPU designs end up - and it's a format which is incredibly popular in the embedded and mobile computing industry.\nWith the acquisition of Silicon Hive for an undisclosed sum, Intel is further boosting its expertise in this area - and bringing its mobile and embedded offering a step closer to that of ARM licensees.\nThat, of course, is where the two companies differ: while ARM leads the way in smartphone chip"}

The result is a delightfully freakish comedy about Phil, a neurotic extraterrestrial who falls to Earth in the fictional hick town of North Beaver Creek, Ont., and is (you guessed it) befriended by a talking beaver. And that's just the first act. From there, the movie starts getting really weird.\nBut weird can be good, especially when it's as bladder-squelchingly funny as this. In this dark Canadian comedy, Stefaniuk positions himself as a kind of indie Mike Myers -- a triple-threat auteur who directs, writes and stars in a film that screens like a trip around his own wickedly demented brain.\nAnd not only is Phil the Alien funny, he's also lovely to look at. Or his movie is, at any rate. Shot cheaply and blown up to 35 mm, the picture manages to capture the austere beauty of northern Ontario landscape through a handful of thoughtfully composed visual sequences. The seedy, claustrophobic interiors of taverns and trailers contrast with the vast, magnificent landscape outside. Impressive stuff from a first-time feature-film director.\nBut back to the wackiness. After landing in the woods and shape-shifting from alien to human form, Phil encounters Joey (Brad McGinnis), a rifle-toting urchin with a drinking problem. Joey takes him back to the cabin and tells his cowering ward to stay put. \"Sit down here,\" the kid instructs in a nasal hoser's honk. \"We're gonna wait for my Dad to get back and then he's gonna kill you.\"\nIn order to pass the time, Phil amuses Joey by moving objects around the room with telekinetic powers. Joey, in turn, teaches Phil how to get right pissed. Before long the two are slugging back Canadian Club like a couple of old barflies. But their party is rudely interrupted when Dad, looking like a chorus-line member in the musical version of Deliverance, returns to the cabin from his recent trip to the local brothel and promptly kicks Phil out. \"What did I tell you about inviting pedophiles in?\" the hillbilly hollers at his son. \"Every night can't be New Year's Eve, you know!\"\nAnd so begins Phil's bizarre visit to Earth -- one that will have him singing in an experimental rock band, finding Jesus and ducking the network of evil secret agents who are out murder him. \"How come?\" you might ask, or \"What the heck is going on?\" My best advice to you is: Don't bother. Phil the Alien can't be properly enjoyed with close consideration. Rather, it invites you to sit back, pour yourself an imaginary glass of cheap rye and laugh as the narrative inanities roll in, each one more ludicrous than the next.

From Dave Slinger\u2019s leading man with barely a moment out of the audience\u2019s focus to the tiniest cameos, the actors displayed the focus and expertise we have come to expect from Peterborough Mask Theatre. The impressive cast of thirteen moved from one cleverly lit area to another, aided by a well-chosen soundtrack in an abstract hospital setting cleverly constructed and accessorised by John Crisp, Catherine Myland, Amanda Bryant whilst skillfully overseen by Production Manager, Diane Fox.\nThe talented Dave Slinger carried the bulk of the dialogue forcefully and wittily in a play that I would characterize as one of interrupted serial monologues, but he was very effectively supported by Carolyn English, Suzanne Tuck and Becky Owen-Fisher\u2019s contrasting doctors and the gripping litigation of Philip Hill, Helena Jones and Verina Henchy.\nI particularly liked the truthful, natural performances of Jan Wright and Joanna Scott as sister and nurse respectively and those of Armins Morozs, Matt Smith, Cheryl Livingstone and Bernie Johnston which caught the natural rhythms of speech and a realistic physicality in a stubbornly static play which made the audience face up to what it would mean to be in Ken\u2019s place.\nOverall, this was a play worth reviving and one that continues to make us think about the life decisions all of us might have to make.

It\u2019s just as tragic no matter how they are lost.\nAs parents, we live with the constant fear that something terrible could happen to our children. We have heart palpitations when our 16-year-olds drive off alone behind the wheel for the first time \u2014 and for the 88th time. My mom still makes me call when I fly to let her know the plane didn\u2019t crash \u2026 and I\u2019m 46! I try not to let her know I\u2019m flying anywhere until I\u2019ve come home, denying her the motherly duty of worrying.\nBut teenagers don\u2019t live with that constant fear in the back of their minds that something terrible can happen. They are hit with the double-whammy of extreme pain and complete shock.\nWhen my son recalled the last time he saw his friend the afternoon she lost her life, he said he did some silly dance in the hallway of school just to get a reaction out of her. It worked. She laughed and smiled. The last time he saw her face, she was smiling \u2014 and she was smiling because of him.\nThere is no good way to lose anyone, be they a family member or a friend. But some ways are worse than others. Anyone who recalls their last words spoken to someone as being done in anger or hate knows what I mean.\nImagine if we treated everyone \u2014 especially our friends and families \u2014 as if you were not going to see them tomorrow or ever again. You never know when that might actually be the case.\nAnd there are worse things to haunt you than a friend\u2019s smiling face."}

Veronique Greenwood meets a man with an intriguing new method, involving chemistry, computer models and a cooker shaped like a Dalek.\nIt was in Memphis, Tennessee, that Kit Parker first began to think about teaching a class on American barbecue at Harvard. The engineering professor was wandering through a barbecue competition, studying the smokers where entrants had marinated their meat in smoke for hours on end. And he noticed something distinctly odd. \u201cThey were the most godawful contraptions you've ever seen.\u201d The junkyard of cobbled-together smoking chambers, of all shapes and sizes and materials, told Parker something important. No one really knew how to build a perfect one yet.\nBarbecue, of course, is a word that has two uses in our modern vernacular: a verb meaning to slap some meat on the grill and slather it with sauce, and a noun referring to slow-smoked meat, a staple of southern US states including Tennessee and Texas, where Parker grew up. Aficionados of the latter develop a practical knowledge of the complicated series of chemical reactions that produce the melt-in-your-mouth texture, the crusty exterior, or bark, and the particular flavours of barbecue. This spring semester, Parker, a teaching assistant, and 16 engineering students learned them as well, as a part of a quest to build a scientifically optimised smoker.\nThe first stage of smoking brisket, a thick cut from the chest of a cow and the Harvard team's chosen target, must proceed at a relatively low temperature. You load the smoker's bottom with charcoal and wood and lay the meat on a platform above it. Then you let the meat heat up, over the course of several hours, to above 100F (37C). It's important that it takes a while to reach that point, because just below 105F, an enzyme called calpain reaches peak productivity, as does one called cathepsin just below 123F. These enzymes' business is to cut up a fibrous protein in the meat called collagen, which is the main component of connective tissue.\nAs the temperature continues to climb, the enzymes are destroyed, and the heat triggers other reactions in the meat itself, including some involving a protein called myoglobin. When there is plenty of oxygen around, myoglobin is pink. When there's not, it turns grey or tan. According to the encyclopedic and engaging AmazingRibs.com, this is why meat that's been sitting around under plastic in the store turns grey \u2013 it will turn pink again if you let it breathe.\nWhen you're smoking meat, two gasses in the smoke, nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide, interact with myoglobin on the meat's surface. While the rest of myoglobin degrades in the heat and turns grey, this time permanently, the myoglobin around the meat's edges hangs onto its pink colour, generating a prized, thin, rosy ring, called the smoke ring, around the brisket. And all the while, as the hours pass \u2013 10, 11, 12 hours \u2013 the action of the smoke on the meat helps create a chewy coat of flavourful compounds on the outside.\nSo the Harvard team was not looking at a simple prospect.

{"idx": "34263", "prompt": "Continue the following text: C++ is a general purpose programming language that has been around for 20 years and is well established throughout the IT industry.\nWhen the Java language was released in 1995 many commentators saw it as the natural successor to C++, to the irritation not only of C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup, but also of James Gosling, the father of Java.\nIn the event, C++ has carved out niches for itself in web development and open source computing, while retaining its strongholds in finance, telecoms and embedded computing.\nBorland and Sun have released new C++ tools in the past couple of years, and C/C++ support has been added to the IBM-backed Eclipse platform.\nLike its predecessor C, C++ was developed at AT&T's Bell Labs. The first commercial release was in 1985. Stroustrup's idea was to create a \"better C\", which retained almost all of C as a subset and supported C styles of programming.\nAll the major platform and software suppliers supported the new language quickly, and it was made an ISO standard in the late 1990s.\nLike C, C++ supports \"low-level\" programming, but also object-oriented programming, modular development and code re-use.\nC++ is highly portable, concise to write, and compatible with pre-C99 C.\nStroustrup said, \"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot. C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.\"\nStroustrup has some detailed advice on learning C++ on his website (see Training box). For example, he turned on its head the question of whether you should learn C first. He said, \"The C subset of C++ is easier for novices to learn and use than C itself. To use C well, you need to know tricks and techniques that are not anywhere near as important or common in C++ as they are in C.\"\nAccording to Stroustrup, you can learn the basics of C++ in a week or two. However, he said, \"Most experienced programmers I have talked with quote half a year to one and a half years for becoming really comfortable with C++ and the key data abstraction and object-oriented techniques it supports.\"\nThat assumes that they learn on the job and stay productive - usually by programming in a \"less adventurous'' style of C++ during that period.\nAs well as its established role in systems programming and telecoms, C++ is used in interactive television and mobile computing, and it is in demand for investment banking, derivatives and other City and finance applications.\nWhat systems does it run on?\nPortable and supplier-independent, C++ is used at every scale of computing, from handheld devices and embedded processors to mainframes. It is embraced across the board from Microsoft to the wilder fringes of the open source community.\nThe Boost website provides free, peer-reviewed portable C++ libraries, proposed for inclusion in the next C++ standard.\nC++ developers with Unix and SQL skills earn from \u00a325,000, rising to \u00a340,000+ with experience. Salaries are much higher in digital television and City jobs.\nC++ training is available from most commercial training organisations, but further education colleges and other public sector educators provide cheaper alternatives. There are many websites devoted to C++, and many free tutorials. You can find a good set of links and tutorials on the Cambridge University Engineering Department website.\nBjarne Stroustrup's website contains advice on learning C++ and plenty of useful links."}

But as the face of democracy in Hong Kong, the Umbrella Movement was seen as a direct threat to Beijing.\nJust days prior to receiving their prison sentence, the Eastern Magistrates Court issued a sentence of community service and suspension for one year to Wong, Law, and Chow. After the prosecution appealed, they were given a more heavy-handed sentence.\nMost significantly, the six and eight month prison terms bar them from running for the Legislative Council for five years and has the effect of politically silencing these democracy advocates.\nJoshua Wong, Nathan Law, Alex Chow, and other Umbrella Movement protesters are pro-democracy champions worthy of admiration, not criminals deserving jail time. The political prosecutions and resentencing of these young people is shameful and further evidence that Hong Kong\u2019s cherished autonomy is precipitously eroding. Beijing\u2019s heavy hand is on display for all to see as they attempt to crush the next generation of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and undermine the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 arrangement. U.S. policy must reflect these realities, which is why I am pressing for swift Senate passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.\nThe sentencing of these three young men may signal a substantial step-back in the independence of Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary.\nIt comes on the heels of a number of significant warning signs, including in November 2016, when the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee issued an interpretation of Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law that made advocates for democracy or independence guilty of violating the Basic Law.\nDecisions interpreted by the Committee have the effect of shaping Hong Kong law because they set judicial precedents that judges employ throughout the Hong Kong judicial system.\nWhile China is not supposed to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary, this interpretation of Basic Law has essentially the same effect.\nChina and Hong Kong\u2019s relationship is predicated on a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model, which grants Hong Kong the authority to pursue capitalist policies and retain some degree of autonomy on political issues.\nThe special autonomous region has historically prided itself on having an independent judiciary, which is supposed to be outside the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s control. In fact, the World Economic Forum ranks the independence and effectiveness of Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary above the U.S. judicial system.\nAnson Chan, former chief secretary of Hong Kong, fears that if the world does not act to defend the autonomy of Hong Kong, the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy will exist in name only.\nBut this is hardly the first time that China has trampled on the freedom of Hong Kong citizens. This year, China abducted and imprisoned a number of Hong Kong publishers.\nThere were also signs during the Umbrella Revolution that autonomy was receding, including when Chinese riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets to quell protests, and when Wong and"}

According to TV Over Mind, the teasers for the upcoming episode show that Team Arrow will be learning about Oliver\u2019s son, William, and will be figuring out ways to safely get him back.

{"idx": "34274", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Curating art used to be a straightforward enough, if onerous, occupation. Typically, curators thoroughly versed in art history would use their research skills putting together what they saw as the best art works of a particular movement or historical period. For figures such as David Sylvester, curating wasn't really regarded as a major profession - more of a side show in the ongoing business of being an art authority. Things, however, have changed drastically since then. University courses in curating are springing up. And where once museums looked to the art historians of places such as the Courtauld Institute for the next generation of art supremos, they are now turning to something like the Royal College of Art's curating course, fast becoming the inside track for tomorrow's leading curators and museum directors. In turn, today's curators and museum directors have ditched anonymity.\n'The curator of contemporary art is now concerned with the whole physical and intellectual experience of an exhibition,' explains Teresa Gleadowe, head of the RCA's curating course. Simply doing bucket-loads of art historical research is not enough. In the ground-breaking 1972 exhibition Documenta 5, Harald Szeemann - perhaps the first major freelance curator - dumped aesthetic categories and instead arranged the art through themes like 'Idea' and 'Individual Mythologies'.\nGleadowe argues that there's a huge difference between today's curators and those art historians of the past. 'Curators are now required to engage with new art as it emerges and find a critical context for the reception of that work,' she says. In reality, those critical contexts tend to act almost as curatorial trends - for instance at the moment there is a definite turn away from 90s irony to either some sort of return to socially committed art or art about everyday situations. And the broadening of the art world from a European-North American axis to a global scale means most contemporary curators now spend huge amounts of time flitting to and from art festivals around the world to keep up with what's going on - as well as to unearth buried talent.\nThrough the 80s and 90s curating evolved rapidly. In 90s Britain, there was a shift away from institutions - Damien Hirst and Carl Freedman famously took matters into their own hands with the Freeze and Modern Medicine exhibitions that set young British art rolling. Curators started putting shows on in domestic spaces, and combining art with non-art objects. In Berlin, Daniel Pflumm got the whole 90s Mitte art scene going by exhibiting works in his nightclub, Elektro.\nIn some ways curators became the counterpart to dealers: where the latter would shift artworks, the former would make works credible by putting them in exhibitions. If a work caught the eye of the right curator and got included in a big show it did wonders for its price and the standing of the artist. Inevitably the institutions have caught up, employing the new breed of contemporary curator to become museum directors and effect change from within. What's certain is that the days of paintings organised into neat chronological rows are well and truly over.\nIt's clear that James Lingwood loves the city. Standing on a roof above Artangel's Clerkenwell offices, at the mercy of the photographer, he is still able to enthuse about the metropolis stretching around him, despite clearly being close to frozen.\nMost of Artangel's best-known projects have used the city as a stage - notably Rachel"}

The County of Orange, the airport\u2019s owner and operator, says the airport\u2019s general aviation facilities are aging and need to be updated to comply with current Federal Aviation Administration standards. This seems reasonable, and the Newport Beach City Council unanimously voted to support just that \u2014 the updating of JWA\u2019s general aviation facilities to current FAA standards.\nIt would reduce the airport\u2019s storage capacity for light general aviation (the smaller and quieter aircraft such as single- and twin-engine planes) to make room for storing more corporate and private jets. It also contains new accommodations for security, customs and immigration to make JWA more appealing for private jet passengers, including international travelers.\nThis would certainly encourage more private jet utilization of JWA. Further and equally concerning, statements in the plan\u2019s draft environmental impact report (EIR) imply that the county is considering expanding commercial operations, such as regularly scheduled commercial charters, into an area of JWA that now supports light general aviation.\nThe City of Newport Beach, its Aviation Committee and several of our city\u2019s aviation-focused community groups reviewed the draft EIR for the expansion program, and we all came to the same, clear conclusion. The proposed project and two of the alternatives, especially the alternative preferred by JWA staff, will negatively impact the quality of life in communities surrounding the airport.\nIf JWA\u2019s recommended project alternative is approved, expect more. More corporate and private jets. More general aviation jets based at the airport. More travelers utilizing JWA to enter or depart the U.S. More jet arrivals and departures over our community and all the communities surrounding the airport. And more noise and pollution for those living and working under the JWA arrival and departure corridors.\nIn addition to the noise and air quality impacts, we have serious concerns about allowing security screening and customs and immigration services at a general aviation terminal. These functions would be managed by the privately held companies that serve the general aviation community rather than in the main terminal, under the purview of JWA\u2019s professional staff. The program must not sacrifice safety, security and accountability for the convenience of a select group of airport users.\nThe Board of Supervisors will be asked to certify the draft EIR and approve the program on April 23. If you have concerns about this project, now is the time to tell the Airport Commission (it meets Wednesday ) and the Board of Supervisors. Go to ocgov.com/gov/bos/opinion for information.

It was a moment when Roberto Mancini had only one piece of advice to his stunned Manchester City players. \u201cGo home and have a drink,\u201d Mancini told them.\nSo much of sport is decided by fine margins, from a tight offside call here, to a great touch there.

Nani\u2019s touch and finish were similarly exceptional but City should have been more alert to the danger.\nMancini\u2019s side deservedly equalised, Edin Dzeko\u2019s shot diverting in off Silva, but there is a defiance to United that means they never give up lightly. Rooney\u2019s overhead kick sensationally captured that determination.\n\u201cIt was a special feeling for the United fans because they deserved that from me,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cI\u2019ve not had the best of seasons and know how big this game"}

What would it take to retain teachers or re-engage teachers who left the profession?\nThis week, Envision Utah will convene 21 education stakeholders \u2014 who include legislative leaders, the president of the Utah Education Association, the state superintendent, and top business and technology leaders \u2014 to seek answers to those questions and develop possible solutions.\n\"We're hoping the discussion will lead to some real guidance on what ought to happen,\" said Robert Grow, Envision Utah's chief executive officer, during a meeting of the Deseret News and KSL editorial boards Monday.\nResearch and polling conducted by Envision Utah, a nonprofit regional planning agency, points to one key factor: teacher compensation.\nCompared to other careers that also require a bachelor's degree, Utah teacher salaries rank near or at the bottom. Unlike other professions where earnings increase significantly over time, the growth trajectory for teacher salaries is relatively flat.\nThe list includes financial managers, engineers, accountants, construction managers and other careers that require a bachelor's degree and have a relatively direct path from a college major to a career in the same field.\n\"To make teacher salaries more comparable and competitive \u2026 would take a 40-55 percent increase in starting salaries and a 38-68 percent increase in median salaries,\" according to Envision Utah documents.\nWhile Envision Utah polling shows a growing number of Utahns say they are willing to increase funding for education, the unanswered question is how.\n\"I don't know the outcome of this. This is not easy. This is hard. This may be the most difficult thing Envision Utah has ever tried to facilitate as a discussion,\" said Grow.\nThe \"how much\" seems a little more clear cut.\nAccording to the Living Wage Calculator created by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers, a household of two parents and three children with one working adult would need an annual salary of nearly $60,000 to have a living wage based on typical expenses in Utah.\n\"Median teacher salaries are $5,800 short of that mark,\" Envision Utah documents state. It would take roughly $200 million ongoing to bring up salaries and benefits to that level.\nMoreover, with just a bachelor's degree, teachers in 17 of Utah's 41 school districts will never make the living wage for their county. With a master's degree, it takes seven to 24 years for teachers to earn enough to support a five-person family in the county where they work, the documents state.\nOne thing is certain: The demand for teachers outstrips supply. Utah's traditional teacher preparation programs produced 1,780 new teachers in 2016. That same year, 3,452 educators left the profession, leaving a deficit of 1,672.\nAn Envision Utah survey of 4,000 college students showed that 44 percent considered education as a career, but more than a third said they didn't choose teaching because of the pay.\nStudents with GPAs of 3.5 and above and those who scored 30 or higher on the ACT said they would teach if salaries were higher, there were more career growth options, and more scholarships and financial aid.\nMany people in Envision Utah's stakeholder group have been talking to one another about these challenges for years. Others will be new to the conversation, Grow said.\n\"All of these people approach this question in good faith, with strong feeling and a hope"}
{"idx": "34310", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: On September 7, 1982, Howard Schultz began working at the first Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market. At the time, he was the company's marketing officer. A business trip to Milan and Verona convinced him that a coffee shop had to sell more than whole bean and ground coffee to really be successful. Since his bosses wouldn't do it, he launched his own company, Il Giornale. In 1987, he bought his former bosses out, and became the CEO of Starbucks Coffee Company.\nToday, there are 16,000 stores around the world.\nEvery business starts small. For those coffee shops trying to compete with Starbucks, we've compiled a list of things you can imitate.\n\"From the moment a customer walks through the door, we want to get them through in 3 minutes,\" a longtime Starbucks manager tells us. \"Or 3-5 minutes if it's busy.\"\nStarbucks has these and other drinks down to a science, while many coffee shops fake it.\nAt Starbucks a cappuccino is a shot of espresso plus half steamed milk and half foam. A latte is a shot of espresso plus steamed milk with a thin layer of foam.\nWhen making a cappuccino, baristas steam milk for 6-8 seconds. Latte milk is steamed for only 3-5 seconds. Baristas also monitor temperature when steaming milk, serving drinks at an average of 165 degrees Fahrenheit and never above a scalding 180.\nTo become a certified barista, candidates must pour a perfect cappuccino, which is evaluated either with an electronic scale or using a measuring cup.\nBaristas manage four batches of coffee at one time, rotating each at least every 15 minutes and never allowing one to sit longer than 30 minutes. They do this even during off hours, throwing away coffee rather than serve anything old.\nThey also follow a timed regime for iced coffee, iced tea and pastries to ensure that everything tastes fresh.\nBaristas manage complex orders with the innovative Starbucks shorthand, or Beverage ID Code, which is written in marker on every cup.\nFor example, a Double Chocolate Chip Light Frappuccino is DCCFL.\nMost stores have upgraded to the Swiss-made Mastrena, designed to make \"the highest-quality, consistent shot of espresso that will be second to none\"\nThe Mastrena makes it easy to pull a precise espresso shot. It's also shorter, allowing baristas to interact with customers.\nBetter espresso machines exist, but they are rare and won't be found at any major chains.\nWhen Schultz tasted the Clover at a small cafe in New York he immediately declared it \"the best cup of brewed coffee I have ever tasted.\"\nStarbucks bought the company that makes Clover in 2008 and started introducing the dream machine at select stores around the country.\nBaristas who work at least 20 hours/week are eligible for health insurance. This could have something to do with the famously cheery demeanor of \"partners\"\nOf course this isn't cheap. In 2009 health care cost the company a heavy $250 million, Schultz told Seattle Times."}

Top Gun, The Rock and Armageddon are just a few of the smash hits he's had his name on.\nHowever, a large chunk of Bruckheimer's filmography consists of crowd-pleasing franchises, the kind of blockbuster entertainment that audiences will come back for again and again. His latest film \u2013 director Gore Verbinski's take on The Lone Ranger (check out the new trailer) - aims to attract the same audience and potentially launch a franchise of its own.\nBruckheimer showed up at CinemaCon recently to promote The Lone Ranger and gave Collider a bit of an update on the latest batch of action-heavy sequels he has in development.\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides \u2013 the fourth entry in the Johnny Depp-fronted Disney franchise \u2013 may have received the weakest critical reception of the series, but a worldwide box office gross over $1 billion means that the (currently) untitled Pirates of the Caribbean 5 is still moving along.\nLast we heard, Jeff Nathanson (Rush Hour, Catch Me If You Can) was revising the script by longtime Pirates scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and according to Bruckheimer, that work continues on. Disney has already staked out a summer 2015 release for the film. So it's quite likely that we'll be hearing further details sooner rather than later. At the very least, expect a big announcement at the studio's D23 Expo in August.\nThe same goes for National Treasure 3, another project that Bruckheimer has in the pipeline. That film \u2013 which will follow the 2007 adventure National Treasure: Book of Secrets \u2013 was to be written by Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro (the writing team behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time). Bruckheimer simply said that \"a team of writers\" are currently working on that script, which makes it sound likely that another writer (or writers) is revising Bernard and Miro's draft, though it remains unclear at this point.\n\"You got to talk to Sony Pictures. We'd love to have you talk to them and tell them it's a good thing to do. Please write them letters.\"\nThe most recent update on the project mentioned that star Martin Lawrence and director Michael Bay had continued to discuss the project, but their busy schedules made it a tricky proposition. Likely, the bigger problem lies with securing star Will Smith (who still isn't attached to the planned Independence Day sequels). It's doubtful that Sony would sign off on the project without one-half of the franchise's leading men, and besides, Bay is keeping busy with Pain & Gain and the upcoming Transformers 4.\nBruckheimer went on to say that Pirates 5 is not only a \"priority\" for the studio, but also for him personally. With the above projects, it's easy to see why. The previous Bad Boys film came out a full decade ago, and Smith is an even hotter commodity than he was back then (the same can be said of Bay), and the National Treasure franchise has laid dormant for long enough that most of today's children have probably forgotten about it. Meanwhile, Captain Jack Sparrow continues to be one of the most iconic characters in today's market.\nAre you excited that Pirates 5 is moving forward? And would you watch a new National Treasure or Bad Boys film"}

However, with shares of the video processing chip company up more than 70% since last quarter's solid beat, perhaps it should come as no surprise to see Ambarella stock down modestly in after-hours trading as of this writing. Even so, Ambarella is rightly pleased with its results.\nQuarterly revenue declined 22.6% year over year, to $65.1 million, and translated to a 37.7% year-over-year decline in adjusted net income, to $18.5 million, or $0.54 per share. Ambarella's per-share earnings were aided in part by the repurchase of 405,089 shares of common stock during the quarter for $20.2 million, or roughly $49.80 per share. Meanwhile, Ambarella's adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points year over year, to 67.1%, which was also well above guidance for adjusted gross margin between 60.5% and 63.5%.\nThose declines admittedly don't sound encouraging. But keep in mind Ambarella's top line came in at the high end of guidance, which called for revenue between $60 million and $66 million, and gross margin was only expected to be between 60.5% and 63.5%. What's more -- and while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts' consensus estimates predicted significantly lower adjusted earnings of $0.38 per share on revenue of $64.3 million.\nOur results reflect strong execution across the business despite several hurdles in the quarter as discussed on our last earnings call. Solid product development and customer support continued to result in new design win momentum in all our markets, led by new projects in drone, home monitoring, virtual reality and wearable applications. We believe the continued investment in the development of advanced technologies in video capture and computer vision will help to expand our market opportunities.\nRecall during last quarter's call -- and as I noted in my earnings preview earlier this week -- Ambarella management warned investors revenue would decline due to a combination of headwinds in the wearable camera space, and supply shortages of Sony image sensors related to the April earthquake in Kumamoto, Japan.\nSure enough, during the subsequent conference call, Ambarella CFO George Laplante confirmed revenue in the wearables market was flat from last quarter and declined significantly on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to declines in revenue from GoPro. In addition, Laplante stated the impact of the Sony sensor shortage resulted in an estimated loss or delay in revenue of between $2 million and $4 million for the quarter.\nThat said, it's encouraging to know in the meantime that Ambarella continues to make progress with new design wins across all markets. Of course, more than anything this is a continuation of past quarters' design win momentum. But it should bode well for Ambarella's prospects to sustain its impending return to profitable year-over-year growth, especially if the wearable camera market rebounds in the second half as management has previously suggested.\nFor the (current) fiscal third-quarter 2017, Ambarella expects revenue between $95 million and $99 million, mark"}

Zoom in to the 100mm equivalent, however, and the maximum aperture drops down to f/4.9 - this might keep it aligned with the similar-priced competitors on the market, but it's not a patch of its bigger brother X10 model, for example.\nThis more-limited aperture range means the XF1 is forced into using the higher ISO settings when zooming in, particularly in low-light conditions.\nA common moan that both the X10 and X-S1 raised was the presence of \"white orbs\" where specular highlights \"blow out\" into white, circular forms. As the XF1 has the same sensor it is open to the very same issue, although processing appears to quash the worst of it. But it is still present in some scenes.\nThe XF1's lens does produce attractive starbursts from light sources, as seen below in this ISO 100 long-exposure at night, though smaller light sources show some presence of disc-like \"blow outs\". It's not a big issue for all shots, but be cautious when it comes to shooting into direct light sources.\nAll in all the \u00a3379 price tag sits below the likes of the Canon PowerShot S110 by some \u00a350, which does make the XF1 a very attractive prospect.

Few, if any, senators challenged Lynch\u2019s qualifications, but her legal endorsement of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration triggered a wave of Republican opposition.\nMoreover, the lengthy delay between her nomination and eventual 56-43 confirmation vote \u2014 a delay prompted by a Senate-created drama over a human-trafficking bill \u2014 stoked allegations from Democrats, particularly black lawmakers in the House, that the historic lag had racial overtones. Lynch was nominated by Obama in November.\nStill, the final margin of her confirmation vote was wider than expected. For a few weeks, only five Republicans had said they would support her. Two more declared their support right before the vote, and 10 GOP senators ended up casting their ballots in her favor, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nOnce she is sworn in, Lynch will replace Eric Holder, who has led the Justice Department since the beginning of Obama\u2019s first term and developed a toxic relationship with congressional Republicans \u2014 with the GOP-led House even holding him in contempt in June 2012. Holder had pledged to stay in his job until his successor was confirmed, which took longer than most had imagined.\nThe GOP-led Senate cleared Lynch\u2019s nomination through a procedural vote, 66-34, late Thursday morning. Under new rules pushed through unilaterally by Senate Democrats in November 2013, she needed only a simple majority, rather than 60 votes, to clear a filibuster. The comfortable margin on the procedural vote was a way for Republicans not to validate the Democrats\u2019 controversial rules change \u2014 which the GOP vehemently opposed.\nStill, forcing the Lynch nomination to cloture breaks new ground: All previous attorney general nominees have gone straight to a confirmation vote, according to the Senate Historical Office. In fact, her wait was the longest since the Reagan administration, when it took 13 months for Ed Meese to be confirmed \u2014 primarily because of ethical questions surrounding his nomination.\nSenate Democrats bear some blame for the delay in the Lynch\u2019s confirmation process. They could have worked on her confirmation during their final weeks of Senate control after losing the majority, but instead chose to push through judicial nominees \u2014 who have lifetime appointments.\nAside from McConnell and Portman, the Senate Republicans who supported Lynch were: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Mark Kirk of Illinois.\nSome recent speculation had centered on Cochran as a potential vote, in part because he owed his victory over a conservative challenger last June to black voters in Mississippi who backed Cochran in the state\u2019s open primary. And McConnell, the top Senate Republican, kept his cards close to the vest for weeks on whether he would support Lynch.\n\u201cI am hopeful that Ms. Lynch will use her lengthy professional experience and skills to provide the new"}

But the FDA says warfarin dosages should be assigned based on well-established international measurement standards under a doctor's care, and that if patients modify their own dosages based on the results of 23andMe's tests, they could put themselves at risk of serious illness, injury, or even death.\nThe FDA says it has tried to work with 23andMe to make sure its products comply with appropriate regulations, \"including more than 14 face-to-face and teleconference meetings, hundreds of email exchanges, and dozens of written communications,\" but to no avail.\n\"Instead,\" the FDA's letter says, \"we have become aware that you have initiated new marketing campaigns, including television commercials that, together with an increasing list of indications, show that you plan to expand the PGS's uses and consumer base without obtaining marketing authorization from FDA.\"\nThe FDA has now given 23andMe just 15 days to address all of the concerns outlined in its letter \u2013 or to explain how much longer than that its corrective measures will take \u2013 after which time it has threatened to initiate a regulatory action against the company.\nWhen asked for comment on the matter, 23andMe told The Register that it had received the FDA's letter."}

Scott Walker made his re-election run official, Matt Flynn issued a pre-emptive strike, comparing the two-term Republican unfavorably to another two-term Wisconsin governor, Democrat Jim Doyle.\n\"Scott Walker\u2019s time is up,\" was how Flynn, a Democrat running in the 2018 race for governor, began his Nov. 4, 2017 news release. \"Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle.\"\nWalker, who has been governor since 2011, has used a number of economic statistics to argue that things are better than they were under Doyle, who served from 2003 through 2010.\nSo, let\u2019s see how the claim from Flynn, a lawyer and former chairman of the state Democratic Party, stands up.\nUnder Walker, are average wages lower in Wisconsin than they were under Doyle?\nThe claim alludes to Walker bearing some responsibility, but doesn\u2019t directly blame him. And governors play an important but limited role in wages.\nTo back Flynn\u2019s claim, his campaign cited two sets of statistics, both adjusted for inflation.\n1. Under Walker in 2016, the median hourly wage was $17.43 -- 5 cents lower than in 2009 under Doyle, \"before the full effects of the Great Recession set in.\"\nThe figures are from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Occupational Employment Statistics, which are estimates based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors in Wisconsin.\nBut Doyle served another full year. The figure for 2010 was $17.37 -- 6 cents lower than in 2016 under Walker. More importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warns against using this particular set of data to make comparisons over time. So, we\u2019re discounting this point.\n2. The median hourly wage eclipsed $18 in 2003, 2005 and 2010 under Doyle -- but through 2016, had not reached that level under Walker. The figure in 2010, Doyle\u2019s last full year in office, was $18.10, higher than the latest inflation-adjusted figure for Walker, $17.96 in 2016.\nThat\u2019s according to a 2017 report by COWS, formerly known as the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The report cites statistics produced by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The Washington, D.C.-based institute says it used Current Population Survey data, produced jointly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, that are good for comparisons over time.\nSo, the second statistic tends to support Flynn\u2019s claim -- although both statistics he cites are for median wages, rather than average.\nWhile average is the term Flynn used, many people use that word even when referring to median. Some economists recommend using the median, since it is a midpoint -- half of people earned wages below that point and half were above. In contrast, the average can be greatly influenced by extremes; for example, it will be pulled higher if there are"}
{"idx": "34326", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Located under the authority of the Department of the Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) serves as a land and air \u201cforce in readiness.\u201d Since the late 19th century, Marines have been used by the U.S. government to execute foreign policy objectives and protect American interests overseas. USMC forces have been at the center of major wars and key military operations, garnering them a reputation as an elite fighting force.\nLike the Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps can trace its origins to before the United States was founded. On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution creating two battalions of Marines for service as landing forces with the newly established fleet. Serving on land and at sea, Continental Marines conducted several military operations during the Revolutionary War, including their first amphibious raid into the Bahamas in March 1776. The first commissioned officer in the Continental Marines was Samuel Nicholas, who served as the senior Marine officer throughout the American Revolution and is considered to be the first Marine Commandant.\nWhen the Treaty of Paris was signed in April 1783, the Revolutionary War came to a close. Fearing that a standing military might prove a threat to the new United States government, the Army, Navy, and Marines were disbanded. Lawmakers began to reconsider this decision not long afterward, as the lack of any military force on the high seas left American shipping vulnerable to seizure by pirates and European powers warring with one another. In 1798 the Marines were re-established as a standing military force and have remained so ever since.\nDuring the turn of the late 1700s/early 1800s, Marines saw action in the quasi-war with France, landed in Santo Domingo and took part in multiple operations against the Barbary pirates in North Africa. It was this latter campaign upon which a legendary phrase of the Marine Corps anthem was based, the \u201cShores of Tripoli.\u201d Marines also took part in numerous operations during the War of 1812, including the Battle of New Orleans.\nAlthough the United States was still a long ways from becoming a world power, the early 19th century saw the first attempts by the U.S. to protect its overseas interests. These attempts involved using the Marines as projections of power because of their original duty as combat soldiers aboard U.S. naval vessels. In the decades following the War of 1812, Marines were used to protect American interests in the Caribbean, the Falkland Islands, Sumatra, off the coast of West Africa and at home in operations against the Seminole Indians in Florida.\nDuring the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), Marines seized enemy seaports along the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast of Mexico. A battalion of Marines fought with Army General Winfield Scott\u2019s army at Pueblo and fought all the way to Mexico City, referred to as the \u201cHalls of Montezuma\u201d in the USMC anthem.\nMilitary actions of the Civil War were mostly fought by the Army. However, Marines did participate in a few battles, including Bull Run. Most actions came as part of efforts by Union naval forces to blockade Confederate ports. Marines participated in missions at Cape Hatteras, New Orleans, Charleston, and Fort Fisher.\nIt would be almost 40 years before the Marines participated in another war. But that conflict, the Spanish-American War (1898), proved momentous for the Corps. The sinking of the"}

Structurally, the Elementary and Secondary Education Department (ESED) of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is adhering to globally accepted standards of public education. Coordination between all stakeholders has made ESED akin to a national success story.\nHowever, we cannot separate elements of development from social norms. Cultural influences shape our social roles over centuries and our current behaviours are just a response developed over time. Disciplining a child during education is the foremost concern and corporal punishment is a violation of the child\u2019s basic right. Yet, it continues unfettered, particularly in rural and semi-urbanised communities.\nTeachers have applied threats as a tool of class control to make the environment more education-friendly. Parents sometimes agree that a teacher may use force. This has caused the ban on corporal punishment to fail colossally.\nFollowing incidents of corporal punishments reveals one common thread. For the abusive teacher it was sort of a routine to use force when angry. The abusive teacher always seemed stressed prior to the incident. What made the headlines was always so extreme that it crossed the line. The degree of social acceptance of corporal punishment in schools we have is threatening. This is why despite banning corporal punishment the practice persists.\nPolicy effectiveness goes way beyond rule making. ESED has gone the extra mile in reforming the public education experience. With the goal to bring it on a par with the best systems in the world, they have successfully engaged all stakeholders. They have adopted latest monitoring methods and processes, have addressed each problem in its individuality, and have reformed the entire collective of public education in the province.\nThe K-P government had previously banned corporal punishment under the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2010. However, implementing this ban seemed problematic. ESED now ensures a no-tolerance policy on corporal punishment in schools.\nIt has addressed the issue of corporal punishment on three different fronts. A participatory engagement between teachers and parents in the form of Parent-Teacher Councils (PTCs) allows room for discourse on dissipating the existing practice of corporal punishment in class. An independent monitoring unit collecting data on education indicators all over the province now monitors teacher performance and behaviour. Data on the use of force is necessary to take action. Teachers now have to go through mandatory trainings as a part of their induction process.\nThe Independent Monitoring Unit is collecting data from schools all across the province since 2014. The introduction of Online Action Management System has proven effective in reducing absenteeism and bad behaviour among teachers. Collecting data on teacher behaviour in class through regular feedback allows identification of risk at a much earlier stage.\nWhen we expect a shift in role from the teachers, we are obligated to support them through the change in processes and classroom environment. The teaching community in no way is made up of inhumane child-beating monsters. They work hard to achieve their professional goals. The cane philosophy helps them maintain the decorum of class, which is essential for a fruitful learning experience. When we restrict them from something, we have to help them with alternatives.\nCompulsory trainings during the induction process are designed to build the capacity of teachers in alternative forms of discipline. They must be equipped with the right pedagogical skills. Uprooting traditionally engraved practices in the education sector will not be an easy task. However, this"}

The building is so small you can hear hushed conversations in the bleachers.\nBut to Trinity High star David Johnson, none of that really matters.\n\"As long as there's 10 people on the court and two baskets, I'm there,\" Johnson said on Wednesday night after his travel team's loss in its Adidas Summer Championships opener.\nCompared to the previous games at the school, Johnson's contest actually drew a nice crowd. That's because the 6-foot-5 Louisville native, a top-100 prospect in the 2019 class, was going toe-to-toe with Class of 2020 prospect Kyree Walker, a top-15 recruit in his class who has already committed to play at Arizona State.\nBeyond the handful of fellow players lingering on the sidelines, there were a dozen or so college coaches sitting courtside. Many of them were West Coast coaches there to watch the prospects on Walker's team, a California-based squad with seven Division I prospects on its roster.\nJohnson wanted to show he could play with them. And while his team lost, with Walker's group pulling away in the second half, Johnson finished with 15 points from 6-of-13 shooting, with two steals, one rebound and what should've been at least three assists on missed layups.\nHe displayed a powerful left-handed drive that keeps defenders on his hip and the ability to score in traffic as well as from distance. Those are products of Johnson's more confident approach this offseason.\n\"I'm trying to make a name for myself,\" Johnson said. \"People already know who I am, but I'm trying to pick it up a little more. ... I feel like I still need to get stronger. I've gotten a lot stronger since the spring, but everyone's basically caught up.\"\nEven though Johnson withdrew his pledge to play for Louisville last fall after the FBI's investigation into college hoops ensnared the program, many recruiting analysts still consider Johnson a slam dunk to sign with the Cards.\nThe All-State guard has visited Louisville's campus and the KFC Yum Center on multiple occasions over the past year, including a stop in June. And after Rick Pitino and then David Padgett's staffs left, Louisville was still in the driver's seat because the Cards hired Chris Mack, who was the primary recruiter for Johnson while Mack was still at Xavier.\nMack and Louisville assistant coach Luke Murray call and text message \"every day,\" Johnson said.

Remote access to data center functions, including server and network operations, are now routine in many facilities. Anyone using a cloud service to manage environments is doing it remotely.\nBut the ability to remotely manage critical power systems at data centers using megabytes of power -- and to also back those systems up with massive generators -- still makes some people uncomfortable. They see the capability as a potential security risk.\nEmerson Network Power has taken consumer-like capabilities, touch screens and support for multiple devices and made it part of its Asco Powerquest, a power monitoring, control and reporting system.\nWhat were once hardwired connections in a control panel have now been made digital with a touchscreen. The system, on display at a recent Afcom data center conference in Las Vegas, offers a system overview, with primary colors used to indicate the system status.\nThese power systems can be turned on and off over the Internet, a capability being driven, in part, by changes in the National Electrical Code. Those changes require generator testing for industries that provide critical services, said Bhavesh Patel, the director of marketing for the Asco line.\nThe users of these systems often conduct generator tests off hours, and have generation systems scattered in multiple facilities, said Patel.\n\"The hospital industry needed this because they don't have the people to conduct those tests overnight or on the weekend, which is the most preferred time,\" said Patel.\nEven so, Philip Berman, who heads the data center practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers and is a former CIO, isn't comfortable with remote management over the Internet. \"I err on the side of reducing risk,\" he said. \"I would much rather have a pair of smart hands on the ground.\"\nYves Carriere, a data center manager for a facility he didn't want named, was blunt: \"If you can remotely shut it down, that means that somebody can hack into your system.\"\nNeither Carriere nor Berman ruled out the use of remote management, but said they would need convincing of its security.\nPatel cited things like the ATM infrastructure, which already runs off the Internet, and even remote surgery as evidence that a high level of trust can be created for even the most critical systems.\nPatel pointed to the use of 128-bit encryption, and said a user's device has to have software installed on it as the first level of authentication.\nRemote monitoring of critical systems, however, is an easy sell.\nKeith Chapman, manager of network architecture and security at Stewart & Stevenson, which makes oil and gas field equipment, runs a small data center -- and remote control of critical power systems isn't something he needs. But being able to monitor operations is a different story.\nTwo years ago, his data center got a tool that can remotely notify him when its generator turns on, or if battery or fuel supplies are low. He can even check fuel levels. The messages are sent via email and it's made a big difference in operations, said Chapman.\nPreviously, the building security guard would call during off-hours to tell him the building generator was running. Until that monitoring system was put in place, \"I couldn't tell,\" said Chapman."}

Endowed with abundant spiritual gifts - and proud of them - the believers were largely failures. Factions, carnality, immaturity, immorality, ignorance and selfishness were charges laid at their door by the Apostle Paul.\nCorinth was the onIy local church addressed by Paul as being \"carnal\" and immature \"babes in Christ\" (3:1-4). So pathetic the fellowship, its appraisal was: \"Your church services do more harm than good\" (11:17). Thus, a church rich in wealth, numbers, popularity and spiritual gifts can go hand-in-hand with an abysmal spiritual condition.\nAs a corrective for the Christians - and much needed today - Paul declares the divine standard of character and conduct. Holy Spirit fullness (control) is demonstrated in lives by Agape love. All giving to the poor, all sacrifice, even martyrdom - if not motivated by agape - ends up being meaningless (13:1-3).\nThis \"more excellent way\" - superior to other spiritual gifts - is described in chapter 13, verses 4-7: \"Love endures long and is kind, love is not jealous, love is not for display, it is not conceited or unmannerly, it is neither self-seeking nor irritable, nor does it take account of a suffered wrong.\n\"It takes no pleasure in injustice, but it sides happily with the truth.

The essence of agape is selflessness, a repudiation of self-interest, self-importance and the humanistic religion of self-esteem. This is the life of Christ - our Pattern.\nAgape is patient and kind. Regardless of how I am treated or mistreated, ignored or criticized - I repay with kindness. No matter how much I am provoked, how undeserving others may be - I am not resentful, and I do not retaliate. I speak to the Lord about it.\nLove does not envy, and it does not brag. I do not begrudge the success, credit or possessions of anyone else, even though I feel more deserving of them. I am willing to take the back seat and be unacknowledged. I do not exaggerate and foster an inflated impression of myself.\nLove is not proud, and it is not inconsiderate.

Increasingly, Nuance has sought to make many different tasks easier, whether it's transcribing doctors' notes into electronic medical records or having automobile entertainment systems understand commands from drivers. Coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Nuance investors were prepared for slight declines in revenue and earnings per share, but the company managed to score a slight sales gain on big gains in new bookings.\nLet's take a closer look at Nuance Communications to see how it did and what it sees ahead for its business in 2017 and beyond.\nNuance's fiscal first-quarter results were relatively close to what most of those following the stock had expected. Adjusted revenue climbed by less than 1% to $496 million, but that was still better than the consensus forecast for a decline to $490 million. On a GAAP basis, Nuance's net loss nearly doubled from year-ago levels, but after accounting for various extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $0.35 per share matched up exactly with what most investors were looking to see.\nTaking a closer look at Nuance's numbers, the figure that stands out the most was the 23% growth in net new bookings, which hit $380.3 million. Nuance attributed the increase to healthcare and mobile, and it specifically called out the Dragon Medical One platform and integrated clinical documentation solutions as driving the growth.\nFrom a segment perspective, the enterprise segment was the key driver of revenue growth, posting a 15% rise in organic sales for the segment. However, the rest of the company didn't share that success. The smaller imaging business had the worst results, seeing organic sales fall 15%. The key healthcare segment saw organic revenue decline 6% from year-ago levels, and the mobile division suffered a 5% drop.\nSegment profits showed similar patterns. Enterprise was the only division to post growth in its segment bottom line, while minimal declines in profitability for healthcare and mobile paled in comparison to a one-third plunge in the imaging segment's adjusted profit.\nNuance has worked hard to boost recurring revenue, and its slow growth continued during the quarter. Recurring revenue made up 73% of adjusted sales during the quarter, up six percentage points from the fiscal first quarter of 2016. By contrast, perpetual product and licensing revenue saw its decrease accelerate, falling by nearly a third from the year-ago quarter.\nCFO Dan Tempesta was straightforward in his description of the company's success. \"Nuance delivered strong performance against our guidance in the first quarter,\" Tempesta said, \"as we continued our execution and momentum across the business.\" The CFO pointed to \"solid results\" in bookings, sales, profit, and cash flow as signs of the progress that Nuance has made.\nNuance now thinks that it should be able to start seeing more impressive revenue gains. In Tempesta's words, \"Last quarter's groundwork and a robust outlook for the second quarter place the company on track for our FY17 non-GAAP guidance with a return to organic revenue growth and continued strong cost discipline and profitability.\"\nIn particular, Nuance reiterated its guidance for the full 2017 fiscal year.

And do you think that Jan Lokpal Bill is the best way to fight corruption in India?\nNo, I think there is no doubt that all of us want to do things to eliminate corruption in our society and I fully sympathise with that motive and the frustration that people feel about corruption.\nBut I think if you really want to do it, it has to be done in a much more holistic and strategic manner. Because there is a part of corruption that is big ticket corruption, there is a part of it that is retail corruption, and what we are finding in the Aadhar project, the UIDAI project, is that we have basically given people an identity so that they are not denied something because they don't have an ID.\nWe have to give them services in the villages so they can get their money automatically. We have to make sure that their PDS is portable so that they can go to any ration shop.\nThese are basic, fundamental things which will help in making sure that the people have a much more hassle-free relationship with the State. And so I think if you are going to do something about corruption, we have to do it in a much broader manner, where this Bill just becomes one of many things.\nNo, I am not saying that we don't need a Lokpal Bill.\nI am just saying that a Bill where you create a whole police infrastructure that will eliminate corruption without looking at the whole broad set of issues and fundamentally changing the way we deliver the public services -- in a way that is much more convenient and hassle-free for the common man -- is I think focusing on a very small part of the overall problem.\nSo I am very much for removing corruption, but I think the statement that this is the only way to do it to the exclusion of all other things is... I mean, I find that very very impractical.\nSo you are basically saying that the way to fight is through service delivery, to streamline service delivery, not bring back what many are calling an 'inspector raj'.\nYes, I mean, I am not saying that we don't need a Lokpal Bill. That is for the Parliament to decide -- what should be the frame of that bill.\nI am just saying that for millions of people corruption is at the point of interaction.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa.\nGrassley has spent years working to build a coalition around the bill and is pushing for a year-end vote. Grassley says more than two-thirds of the Senate supports it. But McConnell is refusing to bring the legislation forward in a standoff that\u2019s dividing the Republican majority and putting President Donald Trump on the spot.\nFor the 85-year-old chairman of the Judiciary Committee, this is not the way Senate is supposed to operate. Grassley was expecting some deference from McConnell after delivering on Trump\u2019s judicial nominees \u2014 including two now on the Supreme Court. Trump backs the criminal justice bill, too, but McConnell says it\u2019s divisive. His reluctance to take up Grassley\u2019s priority shows the limits of the Senate\u2019s old-fashioned customs in an era of heightened partisan politics.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so irritating about this is, first of all, he and I have been hand-in-glove working to get the judiciary vacancies filled,\u201d Grassley told Iowa reporters.\n\u201cI think I ought to have some consideration for delivering on tough Supreme Court nominees, and a lot of tough circuit court nominees and maybe even once in a while you get a tough district court nominee,\u201d Grassley went on.\nOn Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., intervened, talking directly to Trump about attaching the criminal justice legislation to the must-pass year-end spending bill, which is already tangled in a separate fight over funds for the border wall with Mexico.\nTrump has called senators about the bill and spoke briefly about it Friday at an event on safe neighborhoods in Kansas City.\nThe bill is a project of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, and would be the biggest sentencing overhaul in decades. It would reduce mandatory prison terms for certain drug crimes and give judges in some cases more discretion on punishments. It would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It also includes provisions to encourage education and workforce training in prisons.\nRoughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\nWhile Kushner has been meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Trump is also hearing from allies who are against the legislation.

Replacement parts and fuel either have to be air-dropped or driven through dangerous territory. So the US military plans to make remote operating bases and camps self-sufficient, able to generate their own energy and even print their own gadgets.\nAdvances in radio, GPS and surveillance equipment have changed how the US military deploys its troops, says Bob Charette of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Office. Instead of being bunched in large groups that slowly march across enemy territory, soldiers are now strategically scattered in independent camps that span an entire war zone. These can range from operating bases with a few hundred soldiers to lookout posts of less than a dozen.\nSuch isolated bases are \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d, says Pete Newell, who heads the US army\u2019s Rapid Equipping Force (REF). But they often have difficulty getting equipment. It can take months to receive parts that need to be shipped from the US.\nTo speed up the process, REF has put together three mobile laboratories in 6-metre-long shipping containers. Each lab comes with tools such as plasma cutters and jigsaws, a 3D printer that prints in plastic or metal and a scientist and engineer to run them. The labs, which cost about &dollar;2.8 million, can be picked up by helicopter and set down just about anywhere.\nThe first lab was shipped to Afghanistan in July, and a second will be deployed next month. So far, they have allowed soldiers to fix technical problems on the spot, Newell says. \u201cEvery 10th guy has a great idea.\u201d For instance, the 54 \u00b0C heat in Afghanistan was playing havoc with the batteries in a ground-penetrating radar system used to search for mines, so soldiers used the 3D printer to make a shielding case to protect them. It worked so well that everyone wanted one, Newell says, so the team emailed the design back to the US, where it could be mass-produced and distributed among other combat units.\nSoldiers have also used the labs to design hooks for defusing explosive devices, and parts to repair robots. Printing weapons is not on the agenda, Newell says, although fixing them might be. He also envisions printing more complex objects, like batteries and solar panels, which has been shown to be technically feasible (Advanced Materials, doi.org/cm4r85).\nSherry Lassiter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s FabLab says that the labs could be helpful for rebuilding an area after a natural disaster as necessities such as drug delivery devices or antennas for Wi-Fi communication could be prototyped and printed quickly and easily. But she and Nadya Peek, also of FabLab, worry that for long-term disaster relief missions that can stretch to months or even years, resupplying the raw materials needed to run the labs might prove costly. \u201cThe military tends to do things very expensively,\u201d says Peek.\nFrom the military\u2019s point of view, however, the price of the labs is outweighed by the ability to give combat units an extra degree of self-sufficiency while lowering the number of risky resupply missions that must be carried out.\nSoldiers now carry 4900 per cent more weight in the form of batteries than they did during the Vietnam war, says Bob Charette of the US Marines.

'We've even had divorced couples, where one spouse doesn't want the other to know where they are moving,' Katalan's partner, Laura McHolm, is quoted by the LA Times as saying.\nThe company thus sends out decoy trucks, starts moves at 2 am and employs other stealth tactics to prevent snoops, and/or the paparazzi, from finding out where their client is moving to.\nThe LA Times points out that in Southern California, home of the rich, the famous and the beautiful, gossip has greater value than gold; juicy celebrity stories can be traded to an ever-hungry media for all the money you can demand.\nThe non-disclosure agreements serve another purpose -- once you sign them, you cannot even talk of any hanky-panky that you might spot in course of your duties. The LA Times points out that when Broadcom co-founder and former chief executive Henry T Nicholas III was last week sued by an assistant who alleged drug use and debauchery at Nicholas' Newport Beach home, the billionaire hit back by pointing out that the assistant was bounded by confidentiality agreements, and thus could not talk of what had been witnessed.\nThe problem is two-fold: the beautiful people in the region prefer sprawling estates; the larger your home and grounds, the higher you rate on the social index. The problem though is such expansive estates offer much cover for gossips to hide in, and snoop.\nThe other, related, problem is technology. 'Any plumber or gardener can use a cellphone camera to film a husband and wife fighting, or a child having a tantrum, or a client getting out of a shower, and then download it anonymously to YouTube,' the LA Times quotes California attorney Paul Nicholas Boylan, a specialist in NDAs, as saying.\nIn the book, Hansen recounts the less than savory anecdotes pertaining to stars like Debra Winger and Danny de Vito, and power couple Michael and Judy Ovitz, for whom she had worked through the late 1980s and '90s.\nNDAs are not, however, foolproof -- as celebrity couple Victoria and David Beckham found out to their cost a couple of years back.\nThe Beckhams' former nanny Abbie Gibson signed multiple NDAs, but then spoke at length to News of the World about David's alleged infidelities and the problems in the Beckham marriage, for a fee of 125,000 pounds.\nThe Beckham"}

This taut, masterly portrait of Bellevue Hospital operates much as that fabled institution has since its founding, in 1736: the entire history of New York seems to pass through. The hospital was on the front line of numerous battles that defined both the city and modern medicine: the waves of immigration in the nineteenth century; the fight against Tammany Hall for stricter public-health standards; the AIDS epidemic; the homeless crisis of the nineteen-eighties. Bellevue, often overwhelmed and underfunded, never failed to accept a challenge. But perhaps its biggest fight is one that continues today: navigating a health-care landscape in which commitment to public care isn\u2019t secure.\nNaming Thy Name, by Elaine Scarry (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). This study of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets suggests that the beautiful young man addressed in the first hundred and twenty-six of them may have been a poet named Henry Constable. Scarry unfolds intertextual references in the two men\u2019s works and notes that the letters of Constable\u2019s name are sometimes embedded in Shakespeare\u2019s lines (as in Sonnet 18: \u201cSo LONg as mEn CAn BReaTHe, or EYes caN see\u201d). But she doesn\u2019t insist strenuously on her thesis: the book is less a work of scholarly debate-resolving than a tantalizing exercise in literary puzzle-making. The sonnets, likely written around 1600, weren\u2019t published until 1609\u2014when Constable was in prison, and needed cheering up.\nThe Strays, by Emily Bitto (Twelve). This d\u00e9but novel revolves around a sprawling, bohemian household in Melbourne during the nineteen-thirties. Three sisters live in semi-neglect with their elegant mother, a father who is a famous painter with a penchant for defecating in the garden, and a trio of up-and-coming artists who are his acolytes. The narrator, Lily, forms an intense friendship with one of the daughters, Eva, and, in middle age, recalls the unravelling of this quasi-commune. There\u2019s a sense of foreboding that never quite seems justified, even after we learn what happened, but the book is full of lush, mesmerizing detail and keen insight into the easy intimacy between young girls which disappears with adulthood.\nThis article appears in the print edition of the January 23, 2017, issue."}

You don't look weird. You can pick this up and throw it in your car, take it to work, take it on the train.\"\nThe IO Hawk device can travel up to six miles (10 kilometers) per hour. With its balancing gyroscopes that stabilize it, almost anyone can learn to use it in just a few minutes, said Soibatian.\nIn a similar vein, Chinese-based firm Inmotion highlighted a $2,500 personal transportation device that has sold in the thousands in China.\n\"It's set up for fun and for personal transportation,\" said spokesman David Fisher, who demonstrated the vehicle on the CES show floor.\n\"It travels up to nine miles per hour so you can really fly through parking lots and hallways.\"\nWeighing in at 35 pounds, the Inmotion device can be used both indoors and outdoors and has a range of some 15 miles. It has handlebars reminiscent of the Segway, but they can be removed to carry the vehicle or place it in a car.\nAnother lightweight transporter, the Hovertrax by US startup Solowheel, is designed for indoor use in places like shopping malls and large workplaces.\nThe company also has a single-wheeled version for outdoor use which requires a bit more training.\n\"A lot of people are interested in green transportation,\" said spokeswoman Joalene Jolivette, who demonstrated the Hovertrax, saying it is \"easy to use.

{"idx": "34372", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Government agencies across government have been using some form of biometric identification for years. Whether determining if a suspect has a criminal record, positively identifying someone before they enter the country, or simply validating identity to enter a government building, biometrics provides valuable and viable means of identification.\nBiometrics, generally fingerprint or iris scanning, have become a critical tool in the effort to accurately authenticate and identify people. Biometrics are particularly effective, especially when used with another form of authentication\u2014either something you know (such as a password) or something you have (like a token or card). Today, biometric technology is widely used for everything from law enforcement and border control to contractor identity.\nThere's clearly a role for biometrics in safeguarding mobile devices for government use. Government employees could use the technology to easily authenticate themselves to their phones or tablets. Biometrics could also help identify citizens, both for purposes of security and to provide access to government services.\nMobile devices are already uniquely suited to be equipped with biometric identification and authentication capabilities. They already have input sensors, including microphones, cameras and touchscreens, all of which are idea for biometric applications.\n\"There is so much potential for mobile biometrics in government,\" says Josh Dixon, Manager for B2B Emerging Products at Samsung. \"It puts identification and authentication into a small, efficient, and relatively inexpensive format that\u2019s already available today.\"\nOutside the government realm, millions of people in dozens of industries take advantage of these capabilities. According to Biometrics Research Group (BRG), more than 650 million people today use biometrics on mobile devices. BRG predicts 2 billion users will use biometric smartphones by 2020.\nDespite the clear benefits, the U.S. government has not yet developed a standard it considers secure enough or scalable enough to manage biometrics on mobile devices. That means the federal government still doesn\u2019t accept fingerprint recognition as an authorized authentication mechanism for mobile devices. NIST, the federal government\u2019s standards body, is making progress though. Various reports indicate it expects to have a standard developed within a year or two.\nOnce that standard is issued, agencies will be ready to incorporate commercial mobile biometrics solutions into their workflows. These standards will also pave the way for other forms of biometric identification like voice and facial recognition. NIST expects these to become more prevalent.\nVoice biometrics capture and measure the sound, pattern and rhythm of a person's voice, which is as unique to a person as a fingerprint. Voiceprints are useless to hackers because they are represented as a string of characters and numbers.\nFacial recognition technology is a little different. It uses a device\u2019s digital camera or video to record data about the shape of a face and its distinctive features, storing all of it\u2014including measurements like the depth of eye sockets and width of the nose\u2014as a faceprint. It then matches those features against similar measurements stored in a database. Some facial recognition technology uses 3D images instead of 2D, which improves accuracy.\nOnce NIST works out its interoperability, security and scalability issues, Dixon believes fingerprint and iris scanning on mobile devices could become commonplace in government. This could happen within a few years. It may take a few years longer for voiceprints and facial recognition to gain similar momentum."}

Modi visited Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa.\nIndian officials refute the impression that India and China are competing for influence in Africa; both countries have followed different trajectories in their Africa engagement, they say. China has focused on large infrastructure projects while India has concentrated on education, training, medicine and other sectors, which have direct benefit for the people. In Rwanda, Modi presented 200 cows to Rwandans under the Girinka programme initiated by President Paul Kagame to provide a cow to every poor Rwandan family to help increase their income.\nThe last time the two leaders had back-to-back visits to one country was in November 2014 when Fiji Islands hosted Modi and Xi on successive days after they attended the G20 meeting in Brisbane, Australia. In Suva, Modi announced the setting up of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC), which has held two meetings of their top leaders.\nAfrica is an important element of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ambitious programme to connect China to different regions of the world through building new roads, railways and ports.

Economic ties were initial focus of the ties but later diversified to developing closer political and strategic relations. China has been Africa\u2019s largest trading partner since 2009 when it edged the US from that position, and is also one of the main aid donors for many African countries. Africa is China\u2019s second largest source of crude oil.

{"idx": "34391", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: I was recently told that there are veteran spouse education benefits to help military spouses go back to school. I do owe my previous university money and my husband's contact should be ending in a month or so. I know the GI Bill is an option, but that's something I'd like my husband to use in the future if he decides he would like to go back to school. Is it too late to receive help? If not, where and who do I go to for assistance?\nI don't have a lot of good news for you. While there are programs out there for military spouses and education, they come with some restrictions.\nThe program most commonly referenced for military spouses is the My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) program. A part of the Defense Department's Spouse Education and Career Opportunities (SECO) program, it helps spouses get licenses, certificates, certifications and some Associate's Degrees. It's meant to help spouses get jobs in portable career fields.\nTo use it, spouses must be married to a service member on active duty who is and E-1 to E-5, W-1 to W-1 or O-1 to O-2. They have to start and finish their work while their spouse is on active duty. Those married to National Guard and Reservists can use MyCAA, but they have to do it while they are activated. Since your husband is getting out soon and this is not a veteran spouse education benefits program, you likely won\u2019t qualify.\nAnother resource is the National Military Family Association's spouse scholarship program. This program is not rank-specific, and any spouse who possesses a valid military ID can apply, according to NMFA officials. But in your case, again, unless your spouse is retiring and you will maintain a dependent ID, your transitioning status will likely leave you ineligible.\nEven transferring the post-9/11 GI Bill may not be an option for you right now. While it can be among the veteran spouse education benefits, unless he already transferred it or is not eligible for an additional service obligation, moving a GI Bill to a spouse or dependent typically requires a contract extension.\nIf your husband is getting out as the result of a service-connected disability, you might be eligible for Survivor and Dependent Education Assistance through the Department of Veterans Affairs, but the requirements are fairly stringent.\nOne possibility for you could be looking to your local state for any help they may offer. But, again, much of that is for spouses of those on active duty.\nI know that's a lot of bad news. I believe traditional financial aid options are likely your most promising route as most of the military spouse specific programs are designed for spouses of active duty, guard or reserve service members and don\u2019t include veteran spouse education benefits.\nGood luck with your educational endeavors."}

Wi-Fi is still Wi-Fi, so you don\u2019t need to worry that your smartphone, or media streamer, or home security camera will connect to your wireless router, regardless of brand. But if you buy a Linksys Velop router today, for example, you can buy only Linksys Velop access points if you want to expand your network to cover more areas of your home later.\nEasyMesh promises to bring to mesh networks the same interoperability assurances that conventional routers have long offered. If Linksys decides to make its Velop product line EasyMesh compatible, and Netgear does the same, for example, you\u2019ll be able to use Netgear\u2019s Orbi Outdoor access point with a Linksys Velop router. That\u2019s important, because to date, Netgear is the only manufacturer offering an outdoor mesh access point\u2014but it only works with Netgear\u2019s Orbi-series routers.\nWi-Fi EasyMesh has two basic components: Agents that monitor and report network and client performance to a Controller operating on one device in the network. The Controller manages network traffic, assigning clients to access points to maximum network performance and efficiency.\nIf one access point gets overloaded, or a client device moves from one location to another where a different access point will be able to service it faster or more efficiently, the controller will seamlessly move that client to another AP. EasyMesh supports both wired and wireless data backhaul, and backhaul can be either shared or dedicated, in which one Wi-Fi link is used solely for that purpose (both the Linksys Velop and the Netgear Orbi mesh routers support the latter).\nRobinson also said that EasyMesh is implemented in software, \u201c\u2026so there should be no need for new hardware.\u201d But he added that it is up to each vendor to decide about adding EasyMesh to existing products."}

The goal is to help wheelchair users, those mainly with spinal cord and lower-extremity disorders, stand and walk again.\nThe technology has been in the planning stages for the last five years, according Kolbeinn Bjornsson, vice president of business development at Berkeley Bionics.\n\"This is not a dream anymore; it is happening,\" he said.\nMorton, 36, was one of a handful of Good Shepherd patients testing out the innovative rehabilitation tool Friday in a trial run before Berkeley Bionics officially launches the equipment, valued at just under $150,000. Good Shepherd is one of about 10 national hospitals and rehabilitation facilities partnering with Berkeley to bring the technology to their facilities.\nMorton had tried regular leg braces following the 2009 crash, but the braces would cause her to lean forward and the boot felt like a \"corset,\" she said while straightening her upper body as she walked with assistance from physical therapists at Good Shepherd.\nBerkley Bionics says its eLEGS lower-body robotic system allows those who are paralyzed to stand up and walk on their own, with help from on-board sensors and computer processors that observe gestures in the user's body to know how and when to move the robotic limbs.\nPatients use crutches to help them move at speeds up to 2 miles per hour. The system is battery-powered and can last up to six hours per charge.\n\"Millions of paraplegics around the world could one day rely on eLEGS instead of wheelchairs for mobility,\" a news release from the California company says.\nFor the first time since the crash, Morton said she was able to walk in a way that felt more natural than using traditional leg braces.\nThe device straps over a patient's clothing and helps flex the knee, translating into one of the most natural human gaits available in any exoskeleton, according to Bjornsson.

Chefs like Mr. Tucker disprove this with dishes like the one he created last Thanksgiving: a rich mix of chestnuts, sage and corn bread roasted in squash and mounded with an apple-cider spiced ragout. There were also stuffed baby pumpkins and a roulade of wild mushrooms with seitan (wheat gluten) wrapped in pastry. The pastry was layered with yuba, a tofu product that has a crisp texture when roasted.\nMollie Katzen, the author of many vegetarian cookbooks, crowds her Thanksgiving table with vegetable dishes.

Her friend Caryn Sheckler had ideas for fillings. The result of their teamwork was a pie with a high golden crown enclosing a savory mixture of sweet brussels sprouts, spinach, feta cheese and roasted red peppers.\n''It's a pleasure to make,'' Ms. Jordan said, ''because the colors of the filling -- green, white and red -- are so gorgeous. and it smells absolutely wonderful.''

That makes it worth considering, but may keep it off your short list, depending on your priorities.\nThe Ricoh Aficio CL1000N's price ($700 street) puts it in the \"personal\" category for color lasers, but you wouldn't know that to look at it. At 15.2 by 18.9 by 16.5 inches (HWD), it's a little large to share a desk with, and at 61 pounds, you might want some help moving it around.\nAlong with its size, however, it offers some hefty features. The four-pass color engine claims a 31-page-per-minute (ppm) speed for monochrome and 8 ppm for color; the base price includes a network port and both PCL and PostScript drivers (as well as Ricoh's proprietary RPCS driver).Options include a duplexer ($500 list) and a paper tray ($350) that raises input capacity from 250 to 780 sheets. Setup is straightforward, including a QuickInstall option for installing drivers and for automatically handling network setup.\nWhere it falls short of other printers is with text quality and running costs. You can't easily compare claims from different manufacturers, because there's no definitive standard for determining cost per page. But Ricoh's claimed costs are high enough to be worth mentioning, at 2.8 cents per monochrome page and 14 cents per color page.

The uppers are constructed on fabric making machines, reconfigured for heavier duty material needed for a shoe. The machine stitches the upper to a precise shape, leaving no waste -- a significant departure from typical shoe production, which results in mounds of scrap.\nPrimeknit appears to feature the same environmental benefits, though a news release from Adidas on Thursday emphasized the shoe's appearance.\nNike officials believed Flyknit's potential impact during an Olympic year could rival the consumer embrace for the Lunarlon soles introduced during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

Meeting his 12-year-old star, Neel Sethi, at the Beverly Hilton, Favreau presents him with a Bill Murray-voiced singing and talking toy bear Baloo.\nAfter all, Sethi is the one live performer in an intricate, computer-animated jungle world in this version of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s famed 1894 stories. The story of an orphaned boy raised by animals in the jungles of India became a hugely popular 1967 Disney animated film.\nWith the new Disney film's success squarely on Sethi's young shoulders, he needs a furry Baloo toy who sings and says phrases like \"You can do it!\"\nSethi was an unlikely candidate for the Mowgli role, which involved an international search of 2,000 wannabes. Then a 10-year-old Indian-American growing up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Sethi comes from a family of dentists and still has dreams of following in the family business. He heard about the Jungle Book audition through a dance teacher who encouraged him to go.\n\"I had never really thought about it before \u2014 I had done nothing, really,\" Sethi says. \"But I auditioned, and they really liked me.\"\nAn audition tape of him playing fake tennis and baseball, key to acting against imaginary co-stars, captured Favreau\u2019s attention. And Sethi resembled the animated Mowgli, with American relatability and strong ties to India.\nSethi vowed in his video to do his own stunts.\nAfter sealing the deal with a family trip to L.A., Sethi embarked on a nine-month filming adventure, which started with recording alongside the elusive Murray. After Favreau campaigned hard to get him to voice the free-spirited Baloo, Murray agreed to do voice work on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Disney handed over its private jet for Sethi and Favreau to head right out.\n\"Everyone thinks when you're famous, you get a private jet. That was so cool,\" says Sethi, looking at Favreau. \"Was that your jet?\"\nThe bonding time was key for the actors voicing Mowgli and father figure Baloo. Favreau and Sethi hung out at Murray's house, where the star taught Sethi how to throw a football spiral. (\"It's a lot easier to throw now, and it goes a lot farther,\" Sethi says.) They enjoyed laughter-filled meals featuring Murray's favorite lobster rolls, and they recorded voice work, including a version of the classic song The Bare Necessities, at Carly Simon's nearby studio.\nKingsley spent two days voicing the paternal panther Bagheera with Sethi and was impressed.\n\"I can tell you that he is the star,\" Kingsley says. \"He\u2019s got a huge soul.

It also stands to reason that as water becomes scarce its price would rise forcing both a curtailing of demand and innovations in supply.

These wiseacres are quite oblivious to their next-door neighbour with six times the population yet growing at twice Pakistan\u2019s rate for the last quarter of a century and now spoken of as an emerging global power. Nor have they ever reflected on the fact that Pakistan\u2019s population was halved when it \u2018lost\u2019 Bangladesh but its economic growth failed to take off like a rocket from the unintended \u2018benefit\u2019. The population babble serves only as a convenient smokescreen to camouflage a history of atrocious self-serving governance.\nThree-fourths of the earth\u2019s surface is covered with water and so its price can never rise above that of desalinated water plus the cost of transporting it to wherever it is needed. And there is no reason that water cannot be transported over long distances. If an oil pipeline can run from Tajikistan all the way to India via Afghanistan and Pakistan, surely so can a water pipeline from Gwadar to Lahore. Of course, the water would be more expensive than it is now but it would be nowhere near the price of gold. The price would even decline over time with the increasing use of solar energy. Once again, many cities already use desalinated water. In fact there was once a plan for DHA Karachi to set up its own plant but like most schemes in Pakistan that too was most likely the victim of a scam.\nThe bottom line is that we would be much better off focusing on concrete issues \u2014 like ensuring that the water presently supplied is clean \u2014 instead of hand-waving about vague and poorly thought through spectres of sustainability. It is undoubtedly true that cities in South Asia are poorly managed and can do with a great deal of improvement but poor management is nowhere the same thing as unsustainability.\nBut what intrigues me much more"}

He was not a businessman of \u201cthe first level\u201d at the time, and he had lied about his qualifications. Or so claimed his onetime mentor, Boris Berezovsky, testifying in a London court Thursday.\nThis was Day Four of the grand slugging match between two of Russia\u2019s best-known billionaires, and the gloves came off when 65-year-old Berezovsky took the stand for the first time in the Commercial Court to give evidence in a richly colorful trial that\u2019s expected to last at least three months.\nBerezovsky, now in exile in Britain, is claiming that in 2001 he was forced to sell a 21.5 percent holding in the Russian oil giant Sibneft, a company he helped to create with Abramovich in the country\u2019s privatization bonanza of the mid-\u201990s, for far less than its true value, pocketing just $1.2 billion.\nHe\u2019s now seeking $6 billion in damages, alleging that Abramovich \u201cintimidated\u201d him into the sale by telling him the shares would otherwise be seized by the Russian goverment, headed by his old enemy, then-President Vladimir Putin. In reply, Abramovich, 44\u2014and now best known in Britain as the owner of Chelsea Football Club\u2014said he was never a Sibneft shareholder.\nSitting across the courtroom, Abramovich listened to a Russian translation of proceedings through headphones. Berezovsky, cutting a confident figure in an open-neck shirt and blue suit, spoke in English although he asked to be given the text of some crucial documents in their original Russian.\nWhat emerged under cross-examination was a picture of his own ascent to a position of power under Yeltsin, who had effectively authorized the privatization of Sibneft. Berezovsky acknowledged that he was the first businessman to join the president\u2019s exclusive tennis club and that he had befriended Yeltsin\u2019s son-in-law and daughter.\nOn the other hand, he denied any improper use of his influence. He was \u201cdefinitely against\u201d corruption and never offered a bribe. \u201cMy way is not to make presssure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy way is to persuade\u2014and why it is important to do [something].\u201d His principal aim in control of the loss-making broadcaster ORT in 1995 was not to make money but to help defeat the Communists in the 1996 elections, he said.\nAnd he denied any suggestion that he had \u201cfixed\u201d the shares-for-loans auction of Sibneft in 1995 even though he had ensured that his own company had emerged as the sole bidder.\nBut under questioning, Berezovsky was forced to admit some apparent contradictions between his evidence and previous statements. He appeared to concede his influence over Yeltsin\u2019s decision-making even though the same claim had featured in a libel action that he brought against Forbes magazine in 1997 that was settled in 2003."}

{"idx": "34434", "prompt": "Continue the following text: A new proposal rolled out by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday could make the city an easier place to build affordable apartments and homes for lower-income residents.\nAmong the policy changes is a proposal to raise the city\u2019s $25,000-per-unit spending cap on affordable housing loans. That alone will help developers bring more units to market faster, said David Wellington, director of acquisitions and development for St. Paul-based Wellington Management. Wellington was present at a Monday press conference at which Frey detailed the affordable housing profile.\nBuilding new homes is at the heart of the plan, which also includes rental subsidies, renter protections and a property tax discount to encourage the preservation of naturally occurring affordable housing. But much of the policy is aimed at getting more affordable homes on the market.\nAn affordable housing task force that wrote the policy is recommending Minneapolis budget $50 million in 2019 for its Affordable Housing Trust Fund Program. A portion would go toward housing development in the city. If approved, the amount is about four times the record allocation of $10.5 million, Frey said, although a final budget request has yet to be determined.\nMinneapolis lost about 10,000 affordable housing units after the 2008 recession, Frey said, as incomes in the city failed to keep pace with rising rents. The city needs to start rebuilding that inventory, Frey at Monday\u2019s event, which was held at the Blue Line Flats in the city\u2019s Corcoran neighborhood. The 135-unit complex, at 2340 E. 32nd St., is 300 feet from the Lake Street Midtown Station on the Blue Line light rail transit route.\nMore money will help, he said. \u201cWe know that will take more funding and I intend to make a historic investment in our affordable housing fund,\u201d Frey said.\nThe announcement comes after months of public meetings and work by an affordable housing task force to come up with what Frey called an \u201caggressive and ambitious\u201d proposal.\nIn addition to the increased funding, Frey said he wants to \u201cdouble or triple\u201d the number of vacant city-owned lots made available annually for housing construction. The city currently makes about 30 lots available per year, he said. The city has more than 400 lots in its inventory, according to Frey\u2019s office.\nThe increase in the affordable loan cap, in particular, would allow the city to give developers more money toward affordable units, which Frey said would encourage housing projects affordable to families earning as little as 30 percent of the area median income of $94,300 for a family of four. The affordable housing task force has not yet determined what the new loan cap should be.\nMost affordable units are built for people earning 50 percent to 60 percent of the area median income, he said.\nThe additional funding could bring more units to market faster, said Wellington, whose company has developed about 50 units of affordable housing annually for each of the past five years, he said. Frey\u2019s proposal could help triple that number to 150 units.\nResources for the new affordable housing policy proposal would be \u201cbroad-based,\u201d Frey said, explaining that money would come from the general fund, existing pools of money in the city, and from state and federal sources.\nAlthough much of the proposal centers on rental housing, it is also designed to boost home ownership in the city, said Peter McLaughlin, a Hennepin County commissioner and a co-chair of the affordable housing taskforce.\n"}

I had worked with my lab mate, Wayne, for months to design, fabricate and assemble a beautiful stainless steel wind tunnel for combustion studies in Room 104F of the Aeronautical Laboratory B. This building was later torn down to make room for the Grainger Engineering Library.\n\u201cThat night, we ran our first combustion experiment. We sat behind thick safety glass in a control room we helped design, looked at each other and smiled, then activated the igniter.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that methane had accumulated in the exhaust stack outside the building and hot exhaust from the tunnel triggered an explosion. Boom.\n\u201cThe explosion seemed to shake the walls and we felt it in our chests. It tore open a steel access plate on the side of the stack and a blast wave hit the windows from the outside. This caused the lab windows to shatter and blow inward \u2014 into the room. Wayne and I looked at each other, no longer smiling, and initiated the safety shutdown process we had practiced.\n\u201cShortly thereafter, firemen knocked on our control room door and I opened it to see three firemen in full gear, two of them holding axes. The metal doors of the lab were locked and they wanted into the lab. We stood between the firemen and the door to our lab, protecting the lab with our bodies.\n\u201cThey were angry, we were adamant. We were protecting our precious optics and lasers and the tunnel on which we had worked nights and weekends for months. Our theses, our research depended on that wind tunnel.

The precise extent of the Kremlin\u2019s intervention in the 2016 presidential election remains disputed, but few would deny that its foreign policy has more influence on domestic American affairs than ever before, or that understanding that policy is an urgent priority.\nAngela E. Stent has written \u201cPutin\u2019s World\u201d to meet that need. Stent is a director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies and a professor at Georgetown University, and she has sought to put President Vladimir Putin\u2019s difficulties with Western countries into perspective. Her subtitle \u2014 \u201cRussia Against the West and With the Rest\u201d \u2014 reflects the fact that many nations do not share the Americans\u2019 distaste for Russia\u2019s approach.\nThe book is divided into sections analyzing Russia\u2019s relations with its major partners and adversaries \u2014 Germany, NATO, the former Soviet countries, China, Japan, the various Middle East regimes and the United States \u2014 all within a broader framing that examines Russian foreign policy from imperial times up to now. Stent\u2019s key concept is that Russian policy has been consistent for centuries.\nThere is a very interesting discussion to be had about the differences between the United States\u2019 and Russian approaches to foreign policy in various parts of the world, particularly insofar as they highlight the shortcomings of each. As Stent points out, there are surprisingly few stakeholders in the bilateral relationship, since trade between the two nuclear superpowers is low. This means that the personal ties between the rulers of the Kremlin and the officials in the White House are unusually significant, for good or ill. President Barack Obama sent an outspoken supporter of democratic transformation to Moscow as ambassador, something it\u2019s hard to imagine any president doing with China or Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Putin regularly taunts Washington in a way he doesn\u2019t with more economically significant partners.\nThe story Stent relates about the contrast between the American and Russian approaches to the Middle East is particularly telling. Washington has been consistently hampered by the contradictions between its values and its interests \u2014 to the great confusion of Egypt, Syria, Libya and almost everywhere else \u2014 whereas Putin\u2019s Russia has been able to maintain friendships from Israel to Iran.\nSadly, however, the book\u2019s usefulness is marred by maddening small errors. It is forgivable, perhaps, to claim that Vladimir the Great converted Russia to Christianity in 988, although Russia didn\u2019t exist then and he was the ruler of Kiev. It is also acceptable, if annoying, to refer to Britain and England as if they are interchangeable. But it is simply wrong to state that the Brexit referendum took place in 2015 or that all of Gazprom\u2019s gas exports passed to Europe through Ukraine. She says that the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych had a golden toilet (and cites an online photo gallery to support the claim), but I have never seen such a toilet during my own visits to his palace, nor does the photo gallery support the claim that there is one. Although the sections about China and the Middle East break fresh ground, at least for this reader, such inaccuracies make it hard to know how much faith to place in these less familiar sections.\nStill, that is not the primary problem with Stent\u2019s book. The picture she draws of the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy is consistent, but she never delves into the domestic motivations behind it. We have much description of what Putin is doing \u2014 propping up the Syrian regime, targeting former"}

{"idx": "34449", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Could these stocks become private companies?\nIn a way, many investors dream about owning a tiny slice of private companies. Whether it\u2019s the Airbnb or Uber\u2019s of the world or the earlier versions of now-public companies. You know, companies like Facebook (NYSE:FB) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) that went public with low values relative to today\u2019s prices.\nEven the old buy-and-hold on the IPO would have treated investors nicely at this point.\nBut what if these companies were to go private again after being public for a while? Public to private companies do exist. We\u2019ve seen it before, most notably with Dell and founder Michael Dell. The conversion comes up as CEO Elon Musk now talks about taking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) private.\nThere are less regulations and scrutiny for private companies, while more potential reward for those who get in on the deal. In Tesla\u2019s case, there are still plenty of question marks.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at several public stocks that could or should consider becoming private companies.\nShould Tesla go public to private? Bulls and bears may both have their issues with the move. Bears feel that Musk\u2019s announcement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was illegal (it\u2019s not, provided it\u2019s true) and bulls believe there is far more upside than $420 per share, Musk\u2019s proposed purchase price.\nIn any regard, the move would make sense for Tesla as a company. For one, it gets it out of the public spotlight. Gone are the quarterly reports and SEC filings, and the deafening march of short-sellers. With almost one-third of the float sold short, Tesla is surely a contested name.\nWhy else should it go private? It\u2019s got a 5% holder in Tencent, a 3% to 5% holder in the Saudi Wealth Fund and a 20% holder in Musk. That\u2019s anywhere from 28% to 30% of the company\u2019s stock, with the Saudi Wealth Fund currently in discussion to buy more in a privatization deal.\nDon\u2019t forget, Musk\u2019s other company also has Fidelity and Google as investors in his SpaceX company as well. Not to mention Tesla is based in Silicon Valley, where there is no shortage of venture capitalist and investor dollars to be had.\nTesla should also be GAAP profitable and cash flow positive in Q3 and Q4, while finally churning out close to 20,000 Model 3s per month. A $420 buyout price may equate to an ~$80 billion enterprise value, but it would also lock in Tesla\u2019s stock price above a critical convertible bond price of roughly $360, maturing in February 2019. There\u2019s another maturation in 2021 at the same price.\nSo all in all, it would make plenty of sense for Tesla to do the move, provided that it can.\nAnother company with a large co-founder is Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Larry Ellison is the former CEO of Oracle and still owns a whopping stake in the company. As it stands, he owns almost 1.2 billion shares in ORCL or almost 30% of the company.\nOracle is no slouch when it comes to cloud and other enterprise applications. However, its valuation would have you thinking otherwise. ORCL stock"}

Are those instructions concrete or can freelancers include more?\nWe welcome freelancers to submit the number of clips that show the breadth and depth of their abilities. But we screen freelancers submissions closely before admitting anyone and including lots of extra clips may slow down that process.\nAre you mostly looking for active freelancers and journalists or would you be open to former journalists who may have been laid off from newsrooms in the past?\nWe are open to all kinds of journalists. Long-time professionals and promising students have all applied. We welcome anyone with professional clips to consider applying \u2014 if they think their reporting, writing, photography, videography, etc. \u2026 is up to The Post\u2019s standards.\nWould bloggers make the cut?\nWe don\u2019t differentiate bloggers from other kinds of journalists.

This time there would be no tears, no disappointment.\nFelix, 26, ended eight years of Olympic frustration Wednesday night with a decisive victory over one of the deepest women\u2019s 200 fields ever assembled.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u2019s been a long time coming,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Felix said.\nIndeed the 21.88-second victory by Felix, a three-time World champion in the 200, was fueled by her frustration and disappointment over silver-medal finishes to Jamaica\u2019s Veronica Campbell-Brown at two previous Olympics.\nWith her victory, Felix became the first American woman to win an Olympic sprint title since Gail Devers took the 1996 100-meter gold medal. She also snapped Jamaica\u2019s string of four consecutive Olympic sprint final victories going back to the 2004 200 final.\nJamaica\u2019s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the winner of a pair of Olympic 100 titles during that stretch, was second to Felix in 22.09. Team USA\u2019s Carmelita Jeter, the 100 silver medalist last Saturday, took the bronze in 22.14 to become the first U.S. woman to medal in both sprints since Florence Griffith Joyner won the 1988 100 and 200 gold medals.

The X-Pro1 and the more recent X-E1 sell for over $1,000 with a lens, which has kept interchangebale lens X-Trans cameras out of the hands of photographers on a budget.\nThe new X-M1 aims to change that. It's priced at a reasonable $699.95 as a body only, and a kit with a new XC 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 OIS lens is only $100 more. The camera packs a 16-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with the X-Trans design. This sensor type uses a color filter with a six-by-six array of red, green, and blue pixels. It produces a more natural, organic look when compared to traditional Bayer sensors, which use a four-by-four design. The design omits a low-pass filter, which has become more common in higher-end digital cameras, but the more complicated color filter pattern of the X-Trans design greatly reduces the chances of moir\u00e9 artifacts appearing in your photos, as they sometimes do in Bayer designs with no low pass filter.\nThe X-M1 is powered by the EXR Processor II imaging engine. It relies entirely on contrast detection for autofocus, and Fuji expects its focus speed to be a bit slower than the X-E1, which has phase and contrast detection, but faster than the X-Pro1, which relies on contrast detection as well, but uses an older image processing engine. Fuji states that the camera can start and capture a photo in about half a second, that its shutter lag is less than a tenth of a second, and that it can shoot continuously at 5.6 frames per second for up to 30 frames.\nThe body measures 2.6 by 4.6 by 1.5 inches and weighs about 11.6 ounces. There's no built-in EVF, nor is there an option to add one. Instead you'll use the rear, 3-inch LCD to frame and review shots. It features a 920k-dot resolution and a tilting design. There's a hot shoe for an external flash, as well as a pop-up flash with a guide number of 7'.\nThe X-M1 is the first X camera to feature built-in Wi-Fi. You'll be able to transfer photos to your iOS or Android device via a free app. Up to 30 photos can be transferred at a clip. It doesn't look like the camera has the ability to email or post photos directly to the Web, so you'll need to use your phone or tablet as a go-between.\nImages can be captured from ISO 100 all the way through 25600, in Raw or JPG format. You can set JPG output to emulate many popular Fujifilm emulsions, including Velvia, Astia, and Provia, and you can also convert Raw images to JPG in camera.

The denial follows a crackdown on US government agencies using the company's software.\nThe claims follow a series of previously unpublished emails sent in 2009 between company founder Eugene Kaspersky and colleagues. They mention a secret project \"per a big request on the Lubyanka side.\" That's a reference to the headquarters of the FSB, the Russian security agency that's the modern-day equivalent of the KGB.\nIn principle the project was to work on defensive software for the FSB, protecting it from distributed denial of service attacks, in which troublemakers use a network of computers (often hijacked by malware) to flood a website or server with bogus data requests to knock it offline.\nThe US General Services Administration announced this week that it has removed Kaspersky Labs from its list of approved vendors for IT services such as antivirus protection. Government agencies can still buy and use Kaspersky products, but won't be able to do so through a standard GSA contract, meaning it will become more time-consuming and bureaucratic to do so.\nA Kaspersky Labs statement says the emails were misinterpreted and that it is being used as a pawn in political games between the US and Russia. It insisted that \"The company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyber-espionage efforts.\"\nDo you use or have you used Kaspersky security products? Does its Russian ownership concern you given ongoing political and cybersecurity tensions? Is the US right to reduce the usage of Kaspersky software among government agencies?\nWhether or not Kaspersky is guilty of spying - one must wonder why the US is specifically pointing fingers at them for wrongdoing. In other words, there is likely much more evidence to the case than what is indicated in the story. At any rate, I can bet that this is going to have a hugely negative impact on their subscriptions.\nI have never used Kaspersky products because I assumed they WERE part of a Russian Spy Agency.\nI have been using Kaspersky for quite a few years. I found that after they downloaded something to their software on my computer towards the end of last year that the hard drive is constantly running and my browser keeps freezing. I have to keep shutting down the browser constantly to use it. I also had to restore my computer to a date in June last night because I couldn't use my administrator permissions. I set it to run a scans only on the weekend but it run's it every day. I would have thought it would have found some kind of virus or something on the computer since I found changes I didn't make and wouldn't let me fix. I plan to uninstall Kaspersky tonight because I don't trust them anymore.\nI have no worries about \"Kaspersky\" as I'm not in the USA, so I'm not worth recording.\nReally, think about the damage ANY trusted software could do if so inclined. Instant, choreographed updates could affect millions in an instant. More so if that software was the gatekeeper.\nIt's interesting the US is concerned another country might use assets at their disposal to affect another country by playing dirty. Isn't that the norm? And directly from all the playbooks?\n\"However, US politicians argued there's too much risk that the Russian government might try to persuade the company to help it either disrupt or compromise US networks.\"\nKinda like the US Gov was pressuring Apple to unlock devices?

If I had to eat one food for the rest of my life, I wouldn't choose because I love food,\" Aliyah wrote.\nA few days later, Danette Gorman hand-delivered Aliyah's letter to a Syrian child living in a refugee camp in Lebanon.\nAliyah's letter is one of nearly 500 that have been written by about 450 students in the Hudson City School District to the Syrian children living in Ketermaya Refugee Camp. The exchanged letters are part of a pen pal program that Gorman and Bridget Smith, literacy specialist at the school district, started together in June 2017.\n\"Danette approached me in the spring of last year and asked if I thought the students I work with would be interested in writing to the Syrian refugees,\" Smith said. \"Their story is so heartbreaking, but I knew this would be such an important experience for the Syrian children and the kids in Hudson to be aware of the Syrian war.\"\nGorman, who is the co-founder of a visual communication company called Global Apparel Network, learned about the refugee camp by chance when she stumbled upon the documentary \"Ketermaya\" at a film festival one year ago.\n\"This hit me like, I need to go this place, and somehow I am involved with these kids,\" she said. \"It was very profound with no logic at all.\"\nGorman connected with the filmmaker, Lucas Jedrzejak, and found herself on a plane to Lebanon one month later to visit the camp that seemed to be beckoning her.\n\"The conditions are terrible. There's trash everywhere, the sanitation is terrible, they don't have clean drinking water, they share port-a-potties, they don't have enough food,\" Gorman said. \"I felt very moved by the spirit of the community and the children that live in this settlement, and almost instantly we brought school supplies and gifts and delivered those to the children.\"\nThings snowballed from there. Gorman learned that English is a key skill children needed to learn for education and their futures, so she immediately thought of establishing a pen pal program.\n\"When they were forced to flee Syria, they were also forced to give up education,\" Smith said. \"They always talk about how much they love their school in Syria.\"\nGorman and Smith hoped that letters written by kids their own age would make it easier for the Syrian children to connect to, engage with and learn the language.

Restaurants and bars in New York, for instance, have taken to buying so-called lures that increase the number of Pok\u00e9mon available for capture, driving player footfall to their doors.\nJapanese players will now have to wait until at least Thursday to play the game, as developer Niantic prepares server capacity.

The company says it should be able to better handle the expected deluge of Japanese players after weeks of issues for Australian, US and European players, who have seen the game repeatedly taken offline.\nThe delay of the Japanese launch caused Nintendo\u2019s share price, which had soared on the back of Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s popularity through its link to the Pok\u00e9mon intellectual property as the sole publisher until now, to dip more than 10% in morning trading in Japan.\nMeanwhile, the Pok\u00e9mon Go craze has become so big that even Homer Simpson is playing it, despite barely being able to work a smartphone."}

His palette would calm down in winter but meanwhile he must hurry to catch the rhythm of nature \u2013 sunflowers faded quickly, so did blossoms on the fruit trees, and the grape harvest.\nIn 15 months in Arles, Van Gogh completed a quarter of his painted oeuvre: 200 works in which the scorched countryside provoked to his overheated mind landscapes \u2013 frenzied, expressionist, convulsed with emotion \u2013 such as had never been painted before. And then he was dead at 37, having sold just one picture. Theo was an art dealer but his efforts failed to kick-start a market for his brother\u2019s works, which in the 1890s could still be picked up for two francs from the backstreet shop of P\u00e8re Tanguy, where Van Gogh had bought paint and stored his canvases.\npronounceable Van Gogh because \u201cif it should happen that my pictures found their way to France or England, then the name would certainly be murdered\u201d. But no one in the 1890s could have imagined the trajectory of global fame, along with the myth of the painter as tormented, sacrificial genius, that built up around Van Gogh more than around any other single artist throughout the 20th century. Today that celebrity is blinding: like the Mona Lisa or Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d, Van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers and wheatfields are so iconic that, even if we get near them at a big museum, we hardly experience them as paintings.\nHow did early collectors look at them? The second joy of this show is to allow us to read Van Gogh with the slow, steady eyes of the pioneer British buyers who came to him untrammelled by dollar signs and against the tide of taste.

In his briefing after the White House\u2019s admission that two hostages \u2013 one American, one Italian \u2013 were killed in a U.S. \u201coperation,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest struggled mightily to avoid the word \u201cwar\u201d to describe exactly what the U.S.is up to. Finally he gave in and stated that under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, the nation is \u201cat war\u201d with al Qaeda.\nWhy do the words matter? Because the inevitability of civilian casualties, even in the most justified of wars, is accepted both in international law and in the ethics of war. Civilian casualties are never good. They are a tragedy, a terrible cost that must be avoided whenever possible. But in wars, they happen.\nAs the philosopher Michael Walzer has pointed out, in the fluidity of minute-to-minute wartime decisions, it\u2019s not possible to act with the sort of precision that might be called for in the classroom. Targeting noncombatants is forbidden. Nevertheless, they always suffer horribly in war.\nThat\u2019s a conversation we need. Although the frequency of drone attacks has tapered off lately, they have been the Obama administration\u2019s principal anti-terror weapon. During Obama\u2019s first year in office alone, the U.S. conducted more drone strikes than in the entire eight years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Given military budget constraints, Obama\u2019s successor will likely operate a similar policy. So the time to thrash out the ethics is now."}

For instance solarisation is ideal if you plan to develop a vegetable garden on an area of wild ground that is currently covered with a dense mass of annual and perennial weeds, and with many fallen but ungerminated seeds on and in the soil at the moment. As outlined below the method is inexpensive, not labour intensive and relatively fast during the hottest months of the year. Having selected a well located area of the garden mark it out with posts or rocks and then buy a sheet of clear heavy grade plastic, the shape of the area to be cleared of weeds but a little larger. Then dig a 15 centimetre deep trench around the intended veggie plot. When this is done water the area and then immediately cover the damp weed covered soil with the plastic, placing rocks on the plastic sheeting to prevent it being blown away. Then push the edges of the plastic into the trench and bury them. The area of soil will now be sealed and wind will not be able to get under the sheet of plastic. Now watch and wait as existing weeds wither, die and turn to dust and any seeds germinate and soon die. During the hottest months of June to September everything should be totally burnt and turned to dust in six to eight weeks. Naturally during the winter an extra month or two will be necessary. By starting to use solarisation in the next few weeks you will have with a weed-free area by the end of August.\nPrevious articleAre expenses too high?"}

The claim found at the bottom of this latest article describes the Campaign as seeking \u201cto enact and enforce sensible gun laws, regulations and public policies\u201d and I have long failed to see how that goal is not accomplished here. We have two coffee houses, Peet\u2019s Coffee and Starbucks, each with a different policy about customers carrying guns. Now, it seems sensible to me that those customers who feel that Peet\u2019s no-gun policy creates a safer environment would buy their coffee there, those who felt that Starbucks had the right idea would buy their coffee there, and everyone who didn\u2019t care either way would probably go to whichever was closer. This not only seems sensible to me, but it seems just: private property owners have the right to restrict what is allowed on their premises.\nMoreover, I find Starbucks differentiating between what customers and employees are allowed to do reasonable. Employees are allowed to take orders, customers are not. Customers are allowed to leave whenever they please, employees must wait for the end of their shift. The idea that the privileges and responsibilities of customers and employees are different is rather obvious.\nI would understand Brady asking Starbucks to change, and even telling everyone who would listen to avoid their locations until there is a policy change, but once the policy has been decided, why keep discussing it and pressuring? It seems to me that the argument \u201cthey would also be complying with the law if they did what we say\u201d flies right in the face of a property owner\u2019s rights.\nThe question becomes, if the law leaves the decision up to Starbucks, and there is a reasonable alternative, why push so hard? The answer Brady has consistently come back with is other customers and employees are in danger because of the guns. Despite the obvious point that those other customers and employees must not feel strongly about the issue, or they would be down the road at Peet\u2019s, the question now becomes what about the guns is causing the danger?\nThis may sound like an elementary question quickly answered \u201csomeone could get shot,\u201d but if that is the sum total of the danger, then Brady should be pushing for a ban on all guns. We allow these people to keep the guns in their home, where they are obviously still capable of shooting. How is Starbucks different from the owner\u2019s home?\nA Starbucks location probably has more people, but then the question is no longer about complying with an existing law, it is about writing a new one that prohibits guns from locations that are frequented by more than a certain number of people per day. A Starbucks location also puts a gun owner in contact with more strangers than would be in the average home, yet once again we\u2019re no longer talking about an existing law, but one that prohibits a gun owner from meeting new people.\nSo, I pose the question: in terms of safety to those in close proximity, what practical difference is there between a gun in the holster at home, and a gun in the holster at Starbucks? In both locations the gun could be accidentally or intentionally fired causing injury or death. In both locations a property owner has made a decision about what is allowed on their privately owned property.\nThis is where it gets really interesting. Remember that statement about Brady wanting sensible laws? They have a law on the books, one that allows informed people to make decisions about their own safety. So why aren\u2019t they satisfied with a business that they admit is complying with the law? The only conclusion I can draw is that Brady does not feel that a law"}

Or who the perpetrator \u2014 or perpetrators \u2014 will be. But if recent past is prologue, we sadly have not seen the last terrorist attack on American soil.\nSince the shooting in Chattanooga, Tenn., that killed five service members in July 2015, an American community has been targeted roughly every few months by terrorists in some way inspired by the Islamic State or al-Qaeda. Five months after Chattanooga, 14 were murdered in San Bernardino, Calif. Six months later, 49 were massacred in Orlando. Three months after that, a knife-wielding assailant at a Minnesota mall wounded nine, and a bomber in New York City and New Jersey wounded more than 30. It\u2019s now been five months since an attacker rammed his car into a crowd at Ohio State and began slashing victims, wounding 11.\nWith the next tragedy, however, there will be a profound difference. For the first time in our history, the president who addresses the nation after a terrorist attack will be an unabashed opportunist who embraces all the rhetorical tools and tricks of the master manipulator that he is. It will be a demagogue\u2019s dream and a uniquely dangerous moment for our democracy.\nDemagogues rarely disguise their intentions; they boast of them. So, too, with President Trump. A review of his statements after the domestic attacks of the past two years \u2014 as well as attacks overseas \u2014 should put us on our guard. As citizens, we\u2019ll need to steel ourselves for the inevitable moment when our president tries to play to our collective fears.\nCulpability, in Trump\u2019s view, will extend far beyond the perpetrator.

If Trump continues to engage in this demagoguery after the next attack, hate crimes against Muslim Americans will likely surge again \u2014 and responsibility for that violence will rest in no small part with the president himself.\nTrump may claim credit for having foreseen the attack, as he did after Orlando, when he tweeted, \u201cAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Another danger is that he\u2019ll be so eager to point to any incident as justification for his own policies that he\u2019ll rush to label an incident as terrorism before law enforcement even has the facts. \u201cIt looks like another terrorist attack,\u201d he said of last week"}

A year ago, I wrote FSR\u2019s weekly reviews of Season 2. I\u2019ve read all the graphic novels. I\u2019ve seen every episode multiple times. I\u2019m a little bit of an expert. And my relationship with the show is a bit strange.\nThis is because I love some parts of it. Last summer it was my comfort viewing. I\u2019d put on an episode, especially from Season 1, and all my cares would melt away. I wheedled and nagged my friends and family, trying to convince anyone to watch it.\nBut this wheedling came with a caveat: the pacing is a little odd.\nAnd that\u2019s something I\u2019ve had a hard time getting past, even with this show that I love. The characters have a tendency to get bogged down, not seeming to know where to go. Despite being based on a series of books that are largely road trip based, the action tends to take place in a fixed location: in Season 1, Annville, in Season 2, a crappy apartment in New Orleans. The dragging, sometimes aimless movement has always been the show\u2019s weakest link.\nAnd I\u2019m sorry to say, not a whole lot has changed with Season 3.\nThere are so many things to like about Preacher. The show has a weird, semi-magical lore, and it\u2019s always fun to see just how much is accepted as true. Vampires exist, but they\u2019re rare. Angels are rarer, and while Heaven and Hell are probably real, organized religion gets a lot of the same skepticism it does in our universe. Souls and voodoo are very real, as we\u2019ve seen in the second season, and we will see much more this time around.\nIt\u2019s an exciting world to visit, where the bounds of reality stretch and reshape to contain each new weirdness, and none of the characters bat an eye. And it\u2019s very willing to get weird. Some main characters include Jesus\u2019 inbred descendant, God in a latex dog suit, and Adolf Hitler himself, and I know that a few more horrific additions are on the way. The show is fully embracing its depravity, even launching a promotional campaign imploring viewers not to watch if they\u2019re easily offended, confused, disturbed, etc.\nAnd that\u2019s all well and good. I love to be offended and confused and disturbed. There\u2019s only one problem with the new season: it\u2019s a little bit boring. Or at least the first three episodes that have been released to critics are.\nThat perennial difficulty with moving the action forward has come back, and it\u2019s all the more heartbreaking because last year\u2019s finale seemed to be moving away from it.\nI loved the Season 2 finale, in no small part because so many things finally happened. Cassidy finally killed Denis. Tulip finally confronted Featherstone. Jesse and Cassidy finally fought. Tulip died, for crying out loud. And the gang finally got out of that New Orleans apartment. Walls were broken down, and lines were crossed. We got punched in the gut, and we were finally on the move again. It felt good.\nBut this new season is just staying put in a different place.

Israeli officials say they use so-called \"administrative detention\" to guard against immediate threats to the country's security.\nAdnan, a member of the militant group Islamic Jihad, has continued his hunger strike longer than any Palestinian detainee before him. His doctors warned this week that the 33-year-old might die soon.\n\"We are hoping ... the Supreme Court hears this case urgently,\" said Mahmoud Hassan, one of Adnan's lawyers. \"He could die before the court hearing happens.\"\nThe court has not set a date for the hearing. Hassan said in previous cases, the high court at times reduced the sentence of administrative detainees on appeal, but that it rarely ordered them freed outright.\nThe hunger strike has already turned Adnan into a Palestinian hero, with thousands protesting in support of the once obscure bearded baker. Islamic Jihad has vowed revenge if Adnan dies, possibly by firing rockets into Israel from Gaza.\nHe is being kept under guard in a northern Israeli hospital, and Israeli officials are monitoring his condition.\nHe is taking liquid infusions of salts, glucose and minerals, said the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights on Wednesday, citing his doctor. The group is overseeing his medical care.\nAlthough he is still lucid, Adnan has shed some 66 pounds (30 kilograms), his hair is falling out, his muscles have atrophied and he is in immediate danger of death, said the group's doctor.\nAdnan is serving four months in administrative detention. Israeli military judges can imprison defendants for up to six months at a time, with the possibility of renewing the detention order repeatedly. Defendants and their lawyers are not shown the alleged evidence against them. An Israeli military judge rejected an earlier appeal by Adnan last week, saying he had reviewed the evidence and found the sentence to be fair.\nIsraeli military officials generally use administrative detention to hold Palestinians who they believe are an imminent risk to the country's security. Defenders of the system say that if the evidence against the accused was made public, it would expose how Israeli intelligence-gathering networks operate in the Palestinian Territories. They say the process is under full judicial review by Israel's military and the Supreme Court.\nHe began his hunger strike on Dec. 18, a day after he was seized from his home in the northern West Bank town of Arabeh.\nAdnan told his lawyers that he was beaten and humiliated during arrest and interrogation.\nIsraeli police spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby and a military official said the rockets landed in an open area, causing no damage.\nA years-old understanding between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers have halted much of the rocket fire from the tiny territory.

Perry, a Sweet Briar College professor who has written extensively about the court, said she was taken aback by Obama's frank criticism and Alito's response.\n\"I did think it was an unfortunate display for both branches,\" she said. \"I'll leave the individuals aside.\"\nBut that is difficult to do. If it were up to Obama, Alito would not have even been on the court. As a senator, Obama led the fight against President George W. Bush's second nominee to the bench.\nAlito was an accomplished jurist, Obama said at the time, \"but when you look at his record -- when it comes to his understanding of the Constitution, I have found that in almost every case, he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless; on behalf of a strong government or corporation against upholding American's individual rights.\"\nAlito was confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42. He has since expressed unhappiness with the confirmation process.\nHe was a notable no-show when President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden accepted Chief Justice John G. Roberts's invitation to pay a courtesy call on the court. Alito was the only member of the court not to attend the afternoon event, even though he had been at the court in the morning. He has not explained why he was absent.\nOn the bench, Alito is a serious and often unsmiling presence -- profiles done during his nomination describe him as perfectly suited for the sometimes solitary life of an appellate judge. As a member of a camera-averse court, it is unlikely he was thinking Wednesday night that his reaction was being captured.\nThe legal blogosphere was filled with scholars who supported Alito and his position in the majority of the 5 to 4 decision, and criticized the president as out of line.\n\"It was rude, an act of intimidation of one branch of government by another,\" said Randy E. Barnett, a professor at Georgetown Law Center. They charged that Obama mischaracterized the decision and was looking for a way around a constitutional ruling based on the First Amendment.\nBut Jack Balkin, a law professor at Yale, said the president's speech is a charge to Congress to do the things he considers vital to the nation. \"The important thing to me is that the president thinks the Citizens United decision is important enough that he would include it,\" Balkin said.\nOn his blog, Balkin said if Barnett thought that devoting one paragraph of his speech to the Supreme Court was shocking, FDR's criticism of the court \"would probably make his head explode.\"\nRoosevelt was trying to change what he perceived as a recalcitrant court. But a database search shows other presidents around his time were specific in their references to court decisions. Presidents Dwight D.

We don't account for the greatest variable: human nature.\nGlossier is a skincare and makeup brand that has developed a cult-like following. This new brand kept popping up in my social media feed over and over and over. I even have friends who vouch for the brand vehemently. I knew chances were high that, at some point, I would buy a product, but I didn't want to give in to the marketing craze -- yes, I'm aware of the irony. How different could their products really be from those of their competitors?\nStill, the brand appealed to me. It felt like they were speaking to me and my friends in all of their advertising. I read articles about the owner and empathized with her. I stalked the brand's social media and read every article I encountered about the founder, the brand and the people who work for the brand. The blog content was actually a deciding factor for me. I was neutral on the makeup tips shared, but I did care about the people profiled -- young women who remind me of myself, trying to carve out a place in this world as they work hard to build the careers they dreamed of.\nFor me, that content made Glossier not just a makeup brand or company, but a community of people finding themselves and embracing their passion. There is a movement to the brand that appealed to me -- a rebellious spirit that I appreciated. It didn't make me feel like I needed makeup, and that, ironically, is precisely why I wound up purchasing their products.\nIn this story, I bounced all over the phases of the customer journey. I probably started out further down the funnel, very close to the purchase intent phase, but then pulled back and moved into discovery. Before making the purchase, I wanted to learn about the people behind the products and what the brand stands for to determine if it was a brand I wanted to support. I wanted to know that I was getting more for my money than just makeup. My path to purchase was anything but linear. And that's the reality of the customer journey: No phase is more important than the next.\nI have worked with a lot of brands that focus on the tail-end of the customer journey, the point at which someone will actually make a purchase. Too often, they neglect the more inspirational and aspirational phase -- the one that helps consumers build affinity and loyalty to the brand in the first place. This makes any conversions a matter of convenience, and that is dangerous. Why? Because there will always be another brand that one-ups yours on convenience.\nFanm Djanm is a brand I adore. The founder is from Haiti, an island girl just like me. I watched her build her brand on social media over the last couple of years and followed along as her life and business evolved. In some ways, I feel like we've grown up together. Her primary product is head wraps. While I know I can get that anywhere, I only buy them from her. Because even though her brand has grown beyond her as an individual, her customers feel loyal to her and to the community she has nourished.\nAccording to research, emotionally engaged customers are more likely to re-purchase, less likely to shop around and less sensitive to price than those who aren't emotionally engaged. And creating an emotional connection that delivers returns is much harder to accomplish if you're only focused on one stage of the customer journey. My experience is a prime example.\nWhen I first stumbled upon the brand, I was intrigued but did not feel compelled to make a"}

More than 500,000 homeowners in Chicago and Cook County were underwater in the first quarter, according to real estate research firm CoreLogic.\nUnder their powers of eminent domain, called \"compulsory purchase\" in other countries, local authorities would buy up privately held mortgages that are underwater, reduce the amount owed, and transfer the mortgage to a new entity. Mortgage Resolution Partners, acting as consultants and go-betweens for municipalities, would get a $4,500 fee per transaction.\nOnly homeowners who are up to date on their payments would be eligible, and the plan would not apply to government-backed mortgages held by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which account for 60 percent of U.S. home loans.\nReal estate and private investor groups have responded with alarm. The American Securitization Forum, a lobbying organization in New York, sent out an alert to members last week informing them of the moves in Berkeley and Chicago.\nA legal memo written for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said the plan \"suffers from multiple legal and procedural defects, including defects arising under the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution.\" Others have said the private lenders would avoid doing business in municipalities using eminent domain.\nThat drew the ire of Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said in a statement last week that \"special interest groups need to back off.\"\nNewsom, who was initially skeptical, said in an interview, \"Something big like this has to happen, or we'll have another 10 years of millions of homeowners being underwater.\n\"It's still the biggest drag on the California economy - and the nation's - and we've just been nibbling around the edges. I'm very supportive of the idea, although I understand the concerns and the friction. This will be new to many people.\"\nSo far, little has been heard from other state officials or lawmakers. \"I don't think many politicians are going to touch this one,\" said a Sacramento source.\nMeanwhile, San Bernardino County is pushing ahead.

The former Manchester United striker had one long-range shot held by Hennessey before Morgan blocked a close-range shot from the same player following Robben\u2019s run and cross.\nSadly, Robben has not lost his annoying tendency to fall over too easily and Ricketts was booked following one typical tumble.\nTwo minutes later, Robinson\u2019s poor header allowed Robben to surge away. He held off Chris Gunter before rolling the ball past an exposed Hennessey.\nWales sent on teenager Jack Collison for Robinson at the break, with the Dutch making three changes.\nAnd they instantly increased the pace with Robben, van Nistelrooy and Dirk Kuyt all going close before the hosts scored their second in the 54th-minute.\nJoe Ledley was penalised for a foul on Rafael van der Vaart and even the giant Hennessey at full stretch could not keep out Sneijder\u2019s free-kick.\nWales sent on Ched Evans and Craig Bellamy for David Edwards and Freddy Eastwood.

But sometimes, especially when it comes to health matters, it can be a problem.\nStill, research shows too much information isn\u2019t necessarily bad for patients who listen to instructions or suggestions from their health-care practitioners.\nUniversity of Illinois researchers studied the issue and concluded the answer lies in the goal of a specific health objective on the part of health-care practitioners.\nOne school of thought among health care providers is to give health information in small doses of two or three recommendations at once. Others argue that it\u2019s best to give patients the entirety of their options, so as to not skip out on something that may prove useful. The Illinois study, published in Clinical Psychological Science, asserts that it depends on the nature of the recommendations.\nAccording to the researchers, presenting a large amount of information would be appropriate if the goal would be for people to remember a large amount of potentially interchangeable behaviors, but if the goal is for people to remember a complete set of important recommendations, then the best strategy should be to present relatively few recommendations.\nDolores Albarracin, professor of psychology, graduate student Jack McDonald, and colleagues at other universities studied the behavior of some 459 people to shine light on this topic that challenges health providers.\nThe researchers, who also included Patrick McDonald at the University of Buffalo and Colleen Hughes at Indiana University-Bloomington (both are former members of Albarracin\u2019s research group), came to their conclusion by analyzing the results of experiments in which participants were presented with a list of brief health recommendations (ranging in number from two to 20, with each recommendation being about 33 words long). They were then asked to recall as many recommendations as they could.\nParticipants were also asked open-ended questions about their intentions to follow the recommendations. Even though more recommendations meant that participants recalled a lower proportion of the total, they recalled and intended to follow more recommendations.\n\u201cWhen multiple health recommendations are necessary, knowing the influence of the number of recommendations on recall and intended compliance is critical,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nThis information can prove useful in many health fields. For example, psychotherapists who want to change the behavior of their patients in specific ways could assign homework that addresses one behavior. Other health professionals might give recommendations in small bursts (perhaps via text messaging) to help maximize the proportion of recalled recommendations while minimizing the costs to a patient."}

Well, for my money, it is down to a lack of atmosphere, intensity and obvious game plan; a combination of factors.\nAttendance figures have steadily dropped. So too have the noise levels.\nThe setting is very pleasant, the facilities plush, and the welcome far from hostile.\nApart from a pitch that players have been known to describe as \u2018hard\u2019 underfoot, there is nothing at the Keepmoat to make life difficult for visiting teams.\nIt\u2019s a nice day out, especially for League One teams who don\u2019t boast similar facilities, and this can lead to teams raising their game against Rovers, a so-called \u2018big fish\u2019 in the third tier.\nWhat success Rovers have had at home under Paul Dickov has been based on a high tempo, high energy approach.\nThe best example came at the start of last season, when a high quality Blackburn team were not allowed to breathe for 90 minutes and Doncaster\u2019s relentless closing down completely strangled the visitors.\nThat intensity has gone missing and, when the squad is thin on numbers like it is now, it is difficult for the same small group of players to replicate performances like the Blackburn one week in, week out.\nThat said, Rovers have no excuse for not formulating a solid game-plan at home, but their approach is not obvious to the naked eye.\nDickov wants his team to \u2018get on the front foot\u2019 from the first whistle and take the game by the scruff of the neck.

A hundred Republicans in the House had voted the same way Wednesday, a day after the party's third straight loss of a long-held GOP seat to Democrats in special elections.\nThe three House districts, in Illinois, Louisiana and Mississippi, include rural farm areas.\n\"I think the fact that they've lost three House seats in a row, people are thinking, 'Gee, do I really want to stand with the president? It looks like this ship's going down,\"' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.\nBoth the House and Senate also overwhelmingly voted to temporarily halt daily shipments of 70,000 barrels of oil to the nation's emergency reserve held in underground salt domes along the Gulf coast -- a move Democrats have been seeking for the past year to increase supplies available for consumers. The Senate sent that measure to the president Wednesday night without a single GOP objection.\nIn the farm bill, rising food costs put political pressure on lawmakers to boost money for food stamps and other nutrition programs. The bill's fate appeared bleak until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi intervened and forced farm-state negotiators to divert money from farm subsidies to food programs.\nThat brought the support of not only urban Democrats but also Republicans from all areas of the country, many of whom are growing more nervous about their re-election prospects in November.\nPelosi said before the House vote that she was not satisfied that the bill does enough to reduce subsidies, but \"if there is one reason for you to vote for this bill, it would be because of the nutrition piece of it.\"\nOn the oil reserve vote, Democrats also easily won as key Republicans lent support.\nRepublican presidential candidate John McCain recently joined Democrats on the issue, as did Sen.

Their opinion was certainly not a complete smackdown of Arizona's law. Instead, it left some things pretty ambiguous.\nThe provision that was upheld by all eight ruling justices - commonly called the \"show me your papers\" provision - allows local law enforcement, when performing other state law enforcement functions, to check on the immigration status of those people they stop for another reason. That part was upheld because the justices said it was complementing existing federal policy. That's as long as police weren\u2019t singling people out specifically for racial reasons. The court essentially said that if police stop someone properly, or are involved in a domestic dispute, it was perfectly proper to at least check an immigration status and then consult with federal officials.\nBut in upholding that provision, the court was very careful to say that depending on how this is implemented, it could very well be overturned one day. The overall lawsuit brought against the law is a facial challenge, which means it was being opposed and believed to be unconstitutional before it went into effect. What the court is saying when it comes to the \"show me your papers provision\" is that the justices are going to uphold it for now, allow Arizona to implement it and depending on how they enforce it, deal with it later.\nIf in the future a challenge is brought claiming that people are being detained for an extended time or racial profiling is occurring, it could be challenged in the state and federal courts again, now that it can actually be implemented as a law. The justices have essentially said they will give Arizona the benefit of the doubt that they will enforce this in a way that meets a constitutional muster test.\nIt\u2019s a signal to other states that if they are going to have similar provisions, they too have to be careful.\nBoth sides can claim victory in this case, maybe not legally, but from a political point of view. The Supreme Court has in a way given both sides rightful reasons to claim they have won.\nMany states will be encouraged by upholding a key provision dealing with \"show me your papers\" and that may be an impetus for states to go ahead and move forward with their legislation. After all, by upholding that, it says that states do have some kind of role in the matter, they just have to avoid overstepping federal authority.\nFor the Obama administration and opponents of the Arizona law, they will be able to say that almost all of that state law was thrown out by the Supreme Court and federal authority remains supreme.\nIt is really more about political rhetoric and both sides saving face.\nThe justices know the law is nuanced. They don\u2019t want to try to dictate from the bench or tell states or the government how to do their business. They\u2019ve given the benefit of the doubt to all sides to work this out.\nSometimes that frustrates people because they want the clear and unequivocal answer from the Supreme Court, but the justices try to do that sparingly. When they can do as little as possible and still satisfy the U.S. Constitution, that is usually what they will try to do. They're very sensitive to being seen as legislating from the bench and really like to only step in and make sweeping opinions when an issue has gone too far. In this case, they've laid down the framework for both sides to work toward forming a practical and political standpoint.\n4.

Randy Mahr, deputy director of the Defense Department's Joint Strike Fighter program, didn't specify a date or ship for the upcoming evaluations. But he spoke confidently of the planned milestone for the F-35C, the Navy variant designed for taking off from and landing on carriers.\n\"It's going to be the year of the F-35C,\" he said during a briefing at the Navy League's Sea-Air-Space conference on Monday in National Harbor, Md.\nMahr acknowledged hardware and software problems that have plagued the three versions of the aircraft being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., from a tailhook that didn't catch the arresting cable to a bulkhead that cracks to logistics software that improperly grounded jets. In February, the program office discovered that an engine fan blade \"came apart\" into pieces, he said.\nBut the issues have either been resolved or are in the process of being fixed and won't threaten the Marine Corps' plans to begin in July 2015 operational flights of the F-35B, Mahr said. That version is designed for short takeoffs and vertical landings, meaning it can fly like a plane and land like a helicopter.\nCorps leaders last week hinted to lawmakers that the aircraft may not meet that date.\n\"We are tentatively behind schedule,\" Gen. John Paxton, the assistant commandant, told lawmakers during an April 2 hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Seapower. \"The IOC is forecasted for July 2015,\" Paxton added, referring to the date for initial operational capability. \"We have every expectation that could be delayed by several months. It will continue to be conditions based.\"\nLt. Gen. Kenneth Glueck, who heads up the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, also said at the hearing that the Corps would not declare IOC until the software is developed to meet the requirements of the service.\nThe Government Accountability Office, known as the investigative arm of Congress, in a March 24 report cited an assessment made by the Pentagon's own director of operational test and evaluation that software problems could delay delivery of the aircraft's most advanced technology by 13 months.\nWhen asked specifically about F-35B operational flights, Mahr said, \"the Marines have not expressed any concerns at all about the IOC in 2015.\"\nThe F-35B operational flights will rely on a less robust version of software, known as 2B, designed to provide basic close-air support and fire such weapons as the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile, or AMRAAM, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM.

{"idx": "34572", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: PARK CITY -- (U.S. Dramatic Competition) Benavides Born is very typical of Sundance competition movies and then again it's not. In such films over the years, high-school girls, especially ethnic girls, have strived to succeed in sports (Girlfight), in their desire for higher education (Real Women Have Curves) and in any number of other conflicts with family, boyfriends and teachers. Amy Wendel's Benavides Bornseems headed down that familiar path only to open up into a much more complex and penetrating look at a small Mexican-American community near the Mexican border.\nSuch films pick up awards more easily than they do theatrical distribution. But with a marketing campaign targeted to young women and the Latino market along with specialty film enthusiasts, Benavides Borncould bring in modest coin in a domestic release following festival play-dates.\nBenavides is a small South Texas town whose mostly Latino residents are typically fourth or fifth generation Americans so English is the preferred language. Jobs and higher education are hard to come by for young people so many wind up recruited into the military, like the brother of the film's female protagonist, who is stationed in Afghanistan.\nLuz Garcia (Corina Calderon in an auspicious debut as a leading actress) thinks she sees an unlikely avenue to a scholarship to the University of Texas in Austin -- power lifting. Despite a slight build, she is on her school's power lifting team and headed for state championships, where she might win that scholarship. The only catch is she has to win outright. Finishing second gets her nowhere.\nSo the stage seems to be set for a Rocky-esque, feel-good movie about a young girl power lifting her way into higher education and, not incidentally, getting the hell out of Benavides. However, Wendel and her co-writer, producer and husband Daniel Meisel have a broader agenda.\nThere are the usual subplots involving the heroine's military brother, close-knit family and a boyfriend, Ray (Jeremy Ray Valdez). Each delves into issues and community situations that give a viewer an intimate understanding of the challenges faced by those who are Benavides born. In Luz's determination to escape the town's stultifying environment, she makes a few poor choices and the opportunity to advance through an unusual sport for a girl seemingly vanishes.\nLuz's first impulses are self-destructive. Anger blinds her to other avenues of escape. She is still a young woman and not always clear about where her best interests lie. Her story eventually touches on issues ranging from illegal doping in sports to illegal immigration along the border.\nIn their feature debuts, Wendel and Meisel strike just the right balance in mixing personal drama with sociological observations about these Texas towns. Their film, shot entirely in Super 16mm, takes place at actual power lifting events and in the schools, oil rigs and a juvenile detention facility in the Benavides area.\nWendel and Meisel are outsiders who based their story on considerable research and interviews within this community. Instead of making a documentary though, they managed to find a strong dramatic vehicle to convey what they learned about the lives of this American community and the issues confronting its citizens. Not to mention giving a talented young actress the gift of a very showy role."}

{"idx": "34574", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: How Do I Figure the Fair Market Value of a Home?\nFair market value describes the price that a reasonable buyer would pay for a home.\nFiguring fair market value for a home can make or break any prospective real estate transaction. With an accurate estimate of fair market value, you may proceed to make informed decisions on whether to buy, sell or rent out property. Calculating fair market value for a home begins with the analysis of prevailing economic trends. From there, you will learn to identify and apply prices for comparable real estate.\nGauge the strength of the domestic economy. In recession, the Bureau of Labor Statistics may report unemployment rates near 10 percent. At that point, you can expect weak housing demand and prices. Alternatively, annual U.S. gross domestic product growth over 3 percent is a sign of a strong economy and real estate market.\nIdentify the federal funds rate as a benchmark, or comparison standard, for mortgage interest rates. Banks make overnight loans to each other at the federal funds rate, so each bank can meet its Federal Reserve requirements. For mortgage offerings, banks demand a premium to the federal funds rate, in order to compensate themselves for taking on increased risks.\nObserve Federal Reserve monetary policy through the federal funds rate. In recession, the Fed lowers interest rates to encourage people to take out mortgages and buy homes. This policy should eventually translate into higher fair market values for homes. Alternatively, the Fed drives rates higher to slow down home price appreciation when inflation is a concern.\nDescribe the home of interest according to its location, type and size. Homes may be classified as condominium, townhouse or single-family properties. Size is a matter of square footage and number of rooms. Lastly, define location by city, neighborhood and ZIP code.\nTake inventory of the home\u2019s specific features. These amenities may include one kitchen island, two whirlpool spa tubs and hardwood floors. A detailed description of home features will help you to analyze comps with more accuracy.\nStudy your local newspaper and perform online searches to research recent prices for comparable real estate. For best results, comparable homes should be within 1 square mile of each other. Apply prices for comparable properties to the home you're interested in.\nLocal business conditions may diverge from the domestic economy. For example, the Bay Area has a large concentration of technology firms that could be doing well when the rest of the country is in recession. Bay Area property values would then remain stable. Analyze the S&P/Case-Shiller housing index for a breakdown of home prices, according to region and metropolitan area.\nAt closing time, fair market estimates may never materialize. For example, your job might require you to transfer from Berkeley, Calif., to San Diego. At that point, you are more likely to accept a low offer for your Berkeley home to quickly finance a down payment on a new Southern California condominium.\nBofah, Kofi. \"How Do I Figure the Fair Market Value of a Home?\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/figure-fair-market-value-home-8901.html.

It still draws sellout crowds to the Richard Rogers Theatre in New York as well to touring productions.\nA recent lawsuit brought by a blind theatergoer against the producers of the hit musical Hamilton has highlighted Broadway&apos;s spotty track record of serving audiences with disabilities.\nHamilton opened almost a year and a half ago, but it&apos;s still the hottest ticket on Broadway. Mark Lasser of Denve, who is blind, wanted to take his wife to the show and get audio description services to help him enjoy a performance. That means he hoped to get a headset and hear the stage action being described in real time, during the show. But he discovered that Hamilton doesn&apos;t offer this particular service.\n\"I think what this suit brings to light is that you have a hidden population out there that is not gaining the full access to Broadway,\" says attorney Scott Dinin, who is representing Lasser in the class-action suit against the show&apos;s producers and theater owner.\n\"Sometimes you need a lawsuit like this to bring this to the public&apos;s attention,\" Dinin says.\nBroadway has taken great strides in the decades since the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, was passed in 1990. Last year, a new website called Theatre Access NYC launched \u2014 a collaboration between the Broadway League, which represents producers and theater owners, and the Theatre Development Fund, a nonprofit that offers discount tickets and services to theatergoers with disabilities.\nLisa Carling, TDF&apos;s director of accessibility programs, says the goal of the website is to provide one stop where people with disabilities can find accessible performances.\nA quick glance shows that most Broadway theaters are wheelchair accessible and offer open captioning and hearing assistance devices; there are also occasional special performances for people on the autism spectrum. But only four long-running musicals, including The Lion King and The Book of Mormon, offer audio description.\nAudio description has been around since the 1980s, says Mark Annunziato, vice president for operations and engineering at Sound Associates, a company that rents audio and video equipment to Broadway shows and develops audio description services.\nIn the past, groups of blind and low-vision customers attended special performances with a live interpreter. Since Broadway shows now use computers to trigger light, set and sound cues, automated audio description can be set up to work with those systems and offered at every performance, with minimal cost \u2014 especially when Broadway musicals have budgets between $5 million and $25 million.\n\"The base system varies, but it usually ranges in and around $20,000,\" Annunziato says. \"So that would be the automation system, the computer system and the wireless broadcast system to all the devices.\"\nThen add $5,000 more to write, record and sync a script, and a monthly maintenance fee. When you&apos;re talking about a hit show, the cost of setting up an audio description system more than pays for itself, says Howard Sherman, of the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts.\n\"Certainly once a show sets up a sustained run \u2014 and when we look at musicals that run five, 10, 15, 20 years \u2014 it really is a very small price to pay for opening up a show to a much, much wider audience,\" Sherman says.\nThat&apos;s really what Dinin, Lasser&apos;s attorney, is trying to say with this legal action.

Since you can't find a copy on Amazon this year, I thought I'd post about it. It was published in 2001 and was a joint effort between HarperFestival (an imprint of HarperCollins) and Hanna Andersson, the clothing retailer. (I used my married name, not my pen name.) I was commissioned to write the book as a work-for-hire, which means there's no royalty -- the writer gets a flat fee and that's that, no matter how well the book sells. Most books involving licensed characters or merchandise tie-ins are work-for-hire projects. I don't do work-for-hire anymore, but it was a good way to hone my craft when I was young and hungry. It was also a good way to pay scary medical bills when we were self-employed and under-insured.\nI'm fond of the Hanna book, although it was a bear to write. Like every other work-for-hire I've done, there were too many editors involved, each of them contradicting the others. There was a Harper senior editor, a Harper junior editor, the Harper merch director, and an editor who worked for the packager (a kind of middleman publishing company that put together the deal between Harper and Hanna Andersson). I was hired by the Harper folks to write \"a picture book about a little Swedish girl named Hanna who moves to America and is homesick, and it's Christmas. Oh, and also we'd like there to be a tomten in it.\"\nThey already had sketches of Hanna and the tomten, adorably and whimsically drawn by artist Melissa Iwai. From there, it was all up to me...sort of. I came up with the storyline, which had to be approved by all the aforementioned folks and then someone at Hanna Andersson. I wrote a draft, which got bumped back and forth a zillion times as every editor weighed in with remarks.\nLike this: In the first draft, I described the tomten's hat as \"red as a rowanberry.\" One of the editors bounced it back with a strike-through.\n\"Change to, 'his hat was bright red,'\" read the note in the margin. \"American readers won't know what rowanberries are.\"\nSigh. I argued that \"bright red\" was flat and boring. Okay, I wasn't that blunt, but that was the gist. I pointed out that we'd be better off cutting the whole sentence, since the artwork would clearly show that the tomten's hat was red.\nNope, said the editor, go with \"his hat was bright red.\" So I did, growling at the screen. That's just dumb writing. When you're reading a book to your kids, you don't want to get stuck dragging through pedestrian sentences like \"his hat was bright red.\" Bleh.\nAnd then the next person up the line -- the merch director, whom I'd worked with before and who happens to be a first-rate editor -- read the manuscript. She sent it back with her comments. There was a note by \"his hat was bright red.\"\n\"Flat. Can you punch up?\"\nI changed it to \"red as a hollyberry,\" and that's the line that made it into the book. I still think rowanberry was better.\nAnyway, I loved the story and am fond of my slightly grumpy Hanna and her grumpier tom"}

Collection of Vladimir and Vera Torchilin.\nAfter the Bolsheviks seized control of Russia in 1917, one of the many ways they changed the empire was converting a former imperial porcelain factory in St. Petersburg \u2014 then Leningrad \u2014 into a propaganda plant. They ordered the factory\u2019s artists to start designing Communist Party porcelain.\n\u201cThe task for these artists was to proselytize the masses, to propagandize the masses, to \u2018agitate,\u2019 as they called it, the masses,\u201d said Anna Winestein, a specialist on Russia's visual art and theater history. She\u2019s curated an exhibition in Massachusetts about Jewish artists of the Russian and Soviet empires at the Museum of Russian Icons.\n\"Hail the Red Army, 1918-1923.\" Propaganda porcelain plate after design by Mikhail Adamovich, 1884-1947. Circa 1923. Collection of Vladimir and Vera Torchilin.\nOne porcelain plate designed by the Jewish artist Mikhail Adamovich shows a Red Army soldier stomping on signs with the names of White Army generals. Adamovich designed it in 1923 to commemorate five years since the beginning of the Russian Civil War, which the Red Army won.\nEven though the Bolsheviks nationalized the factory in part to make porcelain cheaper for Russians, Winestein said, this sort of mass-produced commemorative plate was something most Russians still couldn\u2019t afford \u2014 and those who could, didn\u2019t buy a dinner set to eat off of.\nDesigning propaganda porcelain was a way for Adamovich to make a living, Winestein said, after years of struggling to survive and express himself as a Jewish artist in the Russian Empire.\nEl Lissitzky. Abstract compositions. 1930s. Watercolor on paper. Collection of Vladimir and Vera Torchilin.\nBefore the revolution of 1917, Winestein said, the vast majority of Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement, a region in the western part of the empire. Only artists from highly educated, well-off families could live outside the settlement, she said, and even then, the Imperial Academy of Arts allowed few Jews in.\n\u201cThey were excluded from the whole infrastructure of the art world,\u201d Winestein said.\nAfter the Bolsheviks took control and did away with Czarist-era anti-Semitic laws, life for Jewish artists living in the early Soviet Union got a little easier, according to Winestein. Even before the revolution, the abstract artist El Lissitzky was developing Suprematism, an art movement, defined by basic geometric forms and limited palette.\n\u201cBut what [the revolution] did is give him a platform to bring this to much greater visibility because it sort of turned the art-world hierarchies upside down,\u201d Winestein said.

Created in response to societal and social upheavals, this exhibition wields a power that feels ripped out of today's headlines, and the circumstances -- war, political and social oppression, et al. -- that force people to leave their homes. Though some of the upheavals that sparked much of this art are decades old, they are threads in the fabric of today's realities.\nThe exhibition fills the Brad Cushman Gallery with works by artists from Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Tibet, China and India. Van Cleve, a California resident, traveled throughout Southeast Asia; the art she bought reflects what the artists witnessed and experienced. They were displaced physically and psychologically from home and culture; their responses reflect fear, grief, defiance, courage and hope. Some risked their lives to paint their truth.\nNowhere is all this clearer than in the work of several Cambodian artists, whose art is informed by the Khmer Rouge genocide in the mid- to late-1970s that killed an estimated 1 million to 3 million people.\nAmy Lee Sanford was born in Phnom Penh in 1972. A story published by the Trans-Asia Photography Review stated that her father sent her to the United States at age 2; he disappeared shortly after the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975.\nFull Circle, a digital print, is an overhead view with Sanford in the center, surrounded by a circle of clay pots she made from the soil of her father's home village. In Phnom Penh just before her 40th birthday in 2012, she spent six days dropping and shattering each pot, then reassembling it with glue and string.

This includes abetting deadly air strikes that claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and the almost total destruction of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s third largest city, and Raqqa in Syria.\nConscious of the widespread opposition to the Mideast war, the Trudeau government in February 2016 recalibrated the mission, ordering the withdrawal of fighter jets and the deployment of additional Special Forces troops and command personnel. Deployed to northern Iraq in what was ostensibly a \u201ctraining\u201d mission, the Special Forces troops provided frontline advice and support to Kurdish peshmerga forces in operations close to Mosul during the ruinous onslaught on that city.\nThe Liberals subsequently expanded Canada\u2019s military involvement in Iraq as part of a stepped up Canadian role in NATO that has seen the CAF take the lead role in a new \u201cforward deployed\u201d NATO battalion in Latvia, on Russia\u2019s border. At NATO\u2019s 2018 annual summit, Canada agreed to take command of a new NATO mission to train Iraqi troops fighting for the central government in Baghdad for one year. This has now been extended until the end of March 2021.\nThe Ukraine mission, which is being promoted by the government and media as the defence of \u201cdemocracy\u201d against \u201cRussian aggression,\u201d is to be extended for a further three years, at a cost of an additional $105 million.\nCanadian troops were first deployed to Ukraine, with the aim of training Ukrainian Army and National Guard forces to wage war in the east against pro-Russian separatists, by the previous Tory government following the 2014 Western-orchestrated, fascist-led coup in Kiev and Russia\u2019s subsequent annexation of Crimea.\nLike the Middle East deployment, Trudeau\u2019s Liberals picked up seamlessly from where Harper\u2019s Conservatives left off, extending the Ukrainian training mission when it came up for renewal in 2016 and providing full-throated support for NATO\u2019s belligerent moves against Russia.\nIn highly-provocative comments made during a 2016 visit to Ukraine, Trudeau said the 200 CAF personnel deployed there are preparing its soldiers to \u201cliberate\u201d Ukrainian \u201cterritory\u201d\u2014a clear reference to Russian-controlled Crimea and other predominantly Russian-speaking areas in eastern Ukraine that have revolted against Kiev\u2019s ultra-nationalist government.\nBehind all of the rhetoric about a \u201c"}

But their inaction negated get-out-the-vote efforts of groups like the March for Our Lives organization.\nBroward County, of all places.\nBroward suffered more laggard, no-account, couldn\u2019t-be-bothered, sorry-but-I-had-to-stay-home-and-play-Grand-Theft-Auto, no-vote voters than any other joint in Florida. Except for the state\u2019s other mighty bastion of progressive politics, Miami-Dade County.\nSome 42.6 percent of Broward voters were no shows. In what progressives billed as the most important mid-term election in memory, an opportunity to repudiate the mendacity and bigotry and sexism and reactionary politics of the Trump regime, 503,000 voters from the most progressive county in Florida couldn\u2019t be bothered.\nOnly Miami-Dade managed a more dismal showing. In a county where 53.8 percent of the population is foreign born, after a campaign season turned rancid by the denigration of immigrants, 618,000 Miami-Dade registered voters still decided they had more pressing issues than attending to their civic obligations.\nThe election turnout in Miami-Dade was depressing. In Broward, it was downright disgraceful.\nElection day was exactly 100 days shy of the one-year anniversary of the Parkland slaughter. It was the gun violence horror right here in Broward County, we were assured, that would finally motivate the youth vote. This election would bring a day of reckoning, when a mighty army of young voters showed Florida politicians what happens when they kowtow to the NRA.\nElection Day came just 11 days after an unhinged Trump supporter, Cesar Sayoc, apparently in the throes of the hatefulness afoot this political season, was arrested right here in Broward County, outside an auto parts store in Plantation, and charged with mailing bombs to CNN and prominent Democrats across the country. You\u2019d think discovering that the would-be bomber was a local boy might have awakened our indolent voters from their collective lethargy. But no.\nBroward and Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties all reported turnouts that lagged behind the statewide turnout of 62.1 percent. Juxtapose the teeny-tiny winning statewide margins (unless a recount reverses the outcomes) of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis against the 60 percent-plus margins in favor of Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum in South Florida. (Gillum led by 68 percent in Broward.) Just a turnout hereabouts equal to the middling state average would have turned this election.\nDidn\u2019t happen. But I\u2019ll tell you who did show up. Almost 78 percent of Sumter County voters, led by The Villages retirement community, 125,000 folks with plenty of leisure time to hop into their tricked-out golf carts, cruise down to their polling places and renew their allegiance to the party of Donald Trump.

The research, conducted by several universities, including Babson College in Massachusetts, was released Wednesday.\nIn recent years, entrepreneurship increasingly has been recognized as critical to economic development around the world, especially among poorer nations. Female entrepreneurs, in particular, can contribute substantially to economic growth and help reduce poverty, according to widely followed data from the World Economic Forum.\nEncompassing 40 percent of the global workforce, women are earning more professional degrees, seizing start-up opportunities and learning networking skills to sustain their small businesses beyond the initial launch phase. Now the expansive report \u2014 covering 83 economies \u2014 adds to that growing body of research and has found more women starting businesses and triggering community impact through job creation.\n\"We've seen women starting out cleaning houses in the neighborhood, then eventually expanding to cleaning office buildings, then hiring 100 people,\" said Donna Kelley, one of the lead authors of the report. The cleaning business, in turn, can trigger the need for accountants and other professionals, widening the impact of that single business in a region. \"In places like Africa and emerging economies, there can be huge opportunities,\" said Kelley, an entrepreneurship professor at Babson College.\nThe report found improvements in female entrepreneurship rates and reduced gender gaps in 61 of the 83 economies studied over two years.\nFor the 61 economies during the same period, total early-stage entrepreneurship activity rates (ranging from ventures just launched to those operating under three years) rose by 7 percent since 2012.\n\"Women matter to economic development \u2014 they invest in their communities, educate their children, and pay back the benefits they receive by helping others,\" according to the report.\nNot surprisingly, women entrepreneurs participate heavily in consumer-facing sectors and ventures like cleaning operations or running a local beauty salon or restaurant. But looking ahead, researchers say women entrepreneurs may play a more crucial role in offering local business solutions to global sustainability issues like secure sources of water, food and clothing. \"There are huge opportunities in a lot of these countries,\" Kelley said.\nBoosted by education, female entrepreneurs are also achieving higher innovation levels. Women entrepreneurs in nearly half of the economies in the report have equal or higher innovation levels than men entrepreneurs, the researchers said.\nAs one example, entrepreneur Valerie Grant capitalized on her advanced degrees and experience in geospatial sciences to create GeoTechVision, the only female-owned-and-operated geographic information systems company in the Caribbean region. Her mother was self-employed and her father was a businessman. \"I was strongly influenced by my mother when deciding to go the entrepreneurship route,\" Grant told the researchers.\n\"I think this report changes the stereotype of who women business owners are and what they do,\" said co-author Patricia Greene, professor and chair of entrepreneurial studies at Babson. \"We have a perception, especially in emerging economies, that these are all subsistence-level businesses. Instead, they are all kinds of businesses started by women, growing in different ways.\"\nConversations about the role and reach of women entrepreneurs globally continues Thursday in New York City.\nBusiness"}

We have offered recommendations to the parties to a construction contract in terms of safeguarding their position.\nCourt practice over recent years shows that claims to recover a penalty have become one of the most commonly applied judicial methods for protecting rights under a construction contract.\nAs a rule, customers' claims to recover a penalty are tied to the failure to meet deadlines for work to be performed (for specific stages to be started or finished), for security to be provided for obligations under contracts, or for source accounting documentation to be handed over. Contractors' claims in the main relate to late payment for the work that has been done (including a delay in making advance payments that the contract provides for).\nOften, claims to recover a penalty are examined as counterclaims and, in the majority of cases, customers' claims to recover a penalty are counterclaims that follow on from contractors seeking to recover amounts owed for work that has been done (the Resolutions of the Federal Commercial Court (FCC) for the Moscow Circuit dated 13 Dec. 13, 2013 in case No. \u041056-77462/2012, of the FCC for the Moscow Circuit dated Dec. 4, 2013 in case No. \u041040-115415/12-151-884, of the Eighth Commercial Appeal Court dated April 15, 2013 in case No. \u041070-9096/2012, and the First Commercial Appeal Court dated Nov. 2, 2010 in case No. \u041043-6583/2010).\nAn analysis of the case law that has evolved points to the conclusion that courts are more willing to apply a penalty as a measure of liability when the parties to a construction contract fail to perform or do not properly perform their obligations (Ruling No. VAS-18861/13 of the Russian Supreme Commercial Court (SCC) dated Dec. 25, 2013; Resolutions of the FCC for the Northwest Circuit dated Jan. 16, 2014 in case No. \u041056-8391/2013, the FCC for the Moscow Circuit dated Oct. 29, 2013 in case No. \u041040-131084/12-14-1189, and FCC for the Moscow Circuit dated Oct. 29, 2012 in case No. \u041040-6345/12-52-57).\nIn addition, it should be noted that the courts have started to be guided by the principle of freedom of contract to a much lesser degree (if the parties agreed a particular procedure for calculating whether a penalty was charged and the amount of the penalty, then how much the penalty is should be calculated according to the agreed procedure and amount). Now the courts are fairly active in using article 333 of the Russian Civil Code as grounds for reducing the amount of the penalty.\nIn determining the amount of a penalty that should be recovered, the courts are guided in particular by the clarifications contained Resolution No. 81 of the Plenum of the SCC 'On certain issues of applying article 333 of the Russian Civil Code' (the \"Plenum's Resolution No. 81\"), SCC's Information Letter No. 51 dated Jan. 24, 2000 '"}

Baron was talking about a new form of politics that\u2019s been taking hold, a kind that brings into question the prospects of these hopeful future journos, a kind that threatens democracy as we know it.\nAs Donald Trump makes another one of the countless absurd claims he\u2019s made during his campaign (this time, following what happened in Florida last weekend, we\u2019re to believe Barack Obama supports ISIS), on the other side of the Atlantic potential future Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to stoke voter immigration fears. Now, his campaign is assuring fellow Britons that a vote to Remain in the European Union will see Turkish migrants flooding across the border.\nNeither of these claims are true. It should go without saying that the president of the United States takes no pleasure in a man massacring 49 of his fellow Americans in Orlando, while the chances of Turkey ever joining the EU are slim to non-existent. All the same, these two politicians are popular \u2013 immensely so \u2013 because they\u2019ve discovered they can reach the top simply by inventing their own versions of the truth. For various reasons, not only are they getting away with cooking up their own \"facts,\" but Trump and Johnson are as a result of their fabrications gaining new supporters all the time. He didn\u2019t use the term in his Temple speech, but there\u2019s a name for what Marty Baron was talking about: post-truth politics.\nThe danger today is that the most unscrupulous of politicians, figures with a real contempt for the electorate, are the ones most likely to exploit voters in the post-truth era. Enter Donald Trump and the Leave campaign. Trump and Leave, headed up by Boris Johnson, are but products of this new system, pushing bigger and bigger fibs and always finding there are zero repercussions for deceiving the electorate \u2013 not when the media and the voters fail to sufficiently hold them to account.\nThe information age hasn\u2019t yet liberated us quite like it could have done. We live today in a world where all the facts we could ever need or want are readily available to us in seconds flat, at the clack of a few keys. In the age of the internet every single one of us can personally hold our politicians to account, cutting out the media middle man by acting as our own fact-finders. It\u2019s increasingly clear, however, that many of us aren\u2019t necessarily interested in facts.\nChris Cillizza at The Independent argues that there has been a \u201cdeath of the belief in fact\u201d for a number of reasons. There are two major factors: 1) we increasingly self-sort ourselves into like-minded communities (whether physically or online, or both), and 2) despite all our choice, we insist on visiting sites and watching shows that affirm views we already hold. According to Cillizza, this results in a \u201csiloing effect\u201d in which one can \u201cgo through each day as a well(-ish)-informed person without ever hearing a sliver of news that contradicts what you already believe.\u201d Would so many continue to support Trump if they just looked out their own window for an hour, and discovered he was lying through his teeth on an almost daily basis? Most likely not.\nStill, we aren\u2019t solely the ones at fault. Back in February, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, citing Trump as \u201cdamn good\u201d for business, was quoted as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to say, but bring it on, Donald.

This similarity would help ensure that no member of the integrated area becomes a drag on the others and that each member is able to contribute to the economic and social upliftment of all. On this basis, there could be an argument that Haiti should have been dissuaded from signing-up to the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) until its economy had been upgraded to a symmetrical relationship with other CARICOM countries.\nFor instance, the European Union (EU) has not allowed every nation that has knocked on its door to join. The interested countries have to satisfy what is called the \u2018Copenhagen criteria\u2019 which includes compliance with 35 policy fields.\nWhatever the cautions that exist in economic integration theory and are applied in other economic integration areas, such as the EU, they appear not to have been applied to Haiti\u2019s admission to the CSME arrangements. Therefore, Haitian nationals have the right to stay in a CARICOM country for six months, and to rights of establishment.\nThis position was strengthened when the new Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, announced at the recent CARICOM Heads of Government in Jamaica that her Cabinet has agreed to remove the visa requirements for Haiti. \u201cIn our view, it breaches the fundamental tenets that bind us under the revised Treaty of Chaguaramas,\u201d she said.\nActing on the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Haitian government removed fuel subsidies as part of a broader agreement in which more direct assistance would be provided to Haiti. Increases of up to 50 per cent in the cost of fuels ignited protests throughout the country in which dozens of businesses were looted and several people killed as demonstrators clashed with police. Protestors also called on President Jovenel Mo\u00efse to fire the prime minister and cabinet; others demanded that Mo\u00efse himself should go.\nWhile the Haitian government reversed the removal of the subsidies in the wake of the violence, the problem is far from over. Haiti urgently needs the financing that the IMF can provide. The country is facing double-digit inflation, a depreciating currency and slow growth. It also has a budget deficit of more than US$150 million, and more than 60 per cent of its people live below the poverty line. To access the IMF money, the H"}

Together with returning lawmakers, they will be looking at answering the question of how to tackle the threat of climate change while strengthening the U.S. economy.\nWe can\u2019t understate the challenge ahead. Just last November, the Trump administration released the 4th National Climate Assessment, a report from 13 federal agencies that said our climate is changing faster than ever before in modern civilization, with impacts projected to intensify. It was yet another brutal warning, bringing renewed attention to the urgency of reducing carbon pollution.\nWe also confirmed recently that we\u2019re far from being on track to reducing emissions. In January, another report said carbon dioxide emissions in the United States actually increased by 3.4 percent in 2018. We\u2019re trending in the wrong direction.\nBut what feels like a problem is really a remarkable opportunity. And it starts with saving energy. Today, energy waste is all around us \u2013 old-fashioned light bulbs releasing most of their energy as heat, not light; poorly-insulated buildings letting the heated or air-conditioned air right out into nature; or old or inefficient appliances using many times the electricity as new ones to accomplish the same task.\nRight now, we have proven, cost-effective solutions and technologies to significantly reduce wasted energy while also boosting the economy. And on the carbon front, according to the International Energy Agency, improving energy efficiency alone could account for more than 40 percent of the emissions reductions needed to meet global carbon emissions targets. And the kicker is that every time we\u2019re saving energy we\u2019re also saving consumers, businesses, or taxpayers money while stimulating job growth.\nFirst, Congress should ensure that our tax policies are incentivizing efficient energy use. For decades, the government has encouraged nearly every mainstream form of energy generation with tax incentives. Why aren\u2019t we using this critical policy tool to also encourage less energy use?\nWhat about incentivizing homeowners to make efficiency improvements, or encouraging developers to build high-efficiency buildings? We had incentives to do just this, but Congress let them lapse. They should be updated and reinstated promptly. A tax credit encouraging consumers to buy electric vehicles should also be updated to ensure the growth of electric vehicle markets, driving down the costs of vehicle production and accelerating their benefits for consumers and society.\nSecond, Congress and the administration should work together to update our aging infrastructure \u2013 and do it in a way that incorporates innovation in energy efficiency. We should make sure our public facilities \u2013 think airports, water treatment centers, military facilities and other public buildings \u2013 are built to use less energy. This won\u2019t just cut down on needless pollution but will reduce government spending on operations costs for decades to come. And while we\u2019re breaking ground on roads and bridges, we should modernize our freight and transit systems and deepen our network of electric vehicle charging stations.\nLastly, Congress should invest in federal programs for energy efficiency R&D, home weatherization, setting energy standards for appliances, and initiatives that help manufacturers and institutions save money through efficiency improvements. These efforts are a bargain because they stimulate far more economic activity and savings than they cost.\nThe U.S. has come a long way in using energy more efficiently in recent decades, but we have a long way to go. For lawmakers looking for bipartisan solutions to address climate change, there\u2019s a bounty of opportunity. Now\u2019s the time to seize it.\nHartke is president of Alliance to Save Energy."}

Anderson Real Estate.\n\"It's transformative for the village,\" Silverton Village Manager Tom Carroll said.\nThe development, dubbed Ag47 after the periodic table name for silver, is composed of two construction phases. The first, currently underway, includes 204 apartments housed in three buildings. The second phase will be one 60,000-square-foot building designed for retail and office space.\nThe site appealed to developers for multiple reasons, including its proximity to I-71 and Kenwood Towne Centre. While the nearby mall offers plenty of retail amenities, there aren't a lot of new multi-family developments or offices in the area.\n\"There's kind of lack of competition,\" said Brian Copfer, president of Cincinnati sales and development for Miller-Valentine.\nConstruction is underway on the first phase of Ag47, near the intersection of Montgomery and Stewart roads in Silverton.\nThe location of the development is a boon for the village as well.\n\"It's kind of the gateway into Silverton,\" said J.R. Anderson, director of development for Jeffrey R. Anderson Real Estate .\nThe roughly 1-mile municipality was originally established as a village in 1904. It became a city in 1961, when census data from the prior year showed the population exceeded 5,000. The city reverted to a village designation after 2010 census data indicated the population had dropped to 4,788.\nVillage officials hope to see Silverton achieve city status again, but the potential to simply increase the population is a win.\n\"The point isn't so much whether you're a city or village,\" Carroll said. \"The point is we will have reversed 50 years of population loss with this development.\"\nThe Residences at Ag47 are expected to be complete around spring 2019. Construction on the commercial building will begin once developers have enough space pre-leased.\n\"That's not so much a date as it is a milestone,\" Carroll said.\nAg47 is named for the symbol and atomic number of silver. Developers also incorporated an ancient symbol for silver into the development's logo.\nAlthough developers aren't rushing to begin the second phase, they hope to start construction around spring of next year.\n\"Our goal is to reach the pre-leasing threshold needed by the end of the year,\" Copfer said.\nRepresentatives for the developers are in discussions with potential business tenants.\n\"We want to get the right tenant mix for that building,\" Copfer said.\nThe plans for the building include 40,000 square feet of class A office space and 20,000 square feet devoted to retail.

The company hasn\u2019t issued any public statement about the financing, and chief financial officer James Herrmann wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment on the deal.\nTolera is seeking to develop genetically engineered antibody drugs that counteract the effects of autoimmunity, in which the body\u2019s own immune system goes haywire and starts attacking healthy tissue like a virus. The company was founded in January 2007 to build on research from the University of Kentucky and the Cleveland Clinic. Tolera said it raised $8 million in its initial round of financing in June 2008 from Triathlon Medical Ventures, the Southwest Michigan First Life Science Fund, and Grand Rapids, MI-based Hopen Therapeutics.\nSince then, the company has moved its lead product candidate, TOL101, through the first phase of clinical trials in about 100 patients, and is preparing for a more rigorous stage of study to demonstrate whether it can actually help patients. The Tolera technology is supposed to home in specifically on certain T-cells of the immune system which go awry in patients with Type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis, and which can cause patients to reject transplanted tissue during surgery. The vision is to make these immune-altering drugs so selective that they can tamp down the excessive inflammation of these conditions, without triggering a dangerous immune reaction against the drug, while maintaining strong enough immune defenses so that patients don\u2019t become vulnerable to infections.\nThe regulatory filing doesn\u2019t say who invested in this most recent financing for Tolera, although it does say five investors participated.

The shootings, in which 10 people were killed and three others injured, cast a spotlight on nascent efforts within the law enforcement community to work together across jurisdictional lines. Many of the efforts initially were propelled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nNow that the sniper suspects have been moved into the criminal justice domain, law enforcement agencies from the federal to local levels are reviewing what worked and what didn't during the intense investigation. And they are laying plans for improving future cooperative efforts.\nThe FBI is working on upgrades to the Rapid Start system that would eliminate the need for physical disk delivery and improve coordination among law enforcement agencies, a senior systems official for the bureau said.\nBut in the sniper case, as in previous cases such as the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma and the investigation of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Rapid Start was not up to the task, sources said.\nThe FBI is planning to eliminate that problem through its upgrades. The first, dubbed Icon for information coordination, will provide 'more of an FBI look and feel to Rapid Start,' said Tom Hansen, chief of the bureau's Rapid Deployment Logistics Unit in Stafford, Va.\nA subsequent upgrade, Icon Plus, will synchronize Rapid Start's Microsoft Access database across a WAN to give state and local agencies access to continuous updates of lead information. Rapid Start currently uses a client-server architecture and can be linked across a LAN.\nIf Icon Plus had been available for the sniper case, law enforcement officials would not have had to field five versions of Rapid Start in the Washington region. Officials deployed Rapid Start systems in Richmond, Fredricksburg, Prince William County and Fairfax County, Va., and in Montgomery County, Md., Hansen said.\nAt times, law enforcement officials updated the local Rapid Start systems by downloading data from the Access database to a disk and physically transferring it to remote Rapid Start locations, Hansen said.\n'In the sniper case, a couple of venues were able to transfer the database using the LEO [Law Enforcement Online] network, and refresh it twice a day,' Hansen said. 'There were a couple of venues that could not utilize LEO in that manner so we copied the database on a disk and hand-carried it to those locations.'

Does free software development lead to proprietary, or is it the other way round?\"\nThe Microsoft executive was replying to a question from a member of the audience, which seemed to be made up mostly of open-source advocates. The audience member noted that Microsoft had ported Office to Apple Computer's Macintosh, to tap into the Mac desktop market, and asked why would it not to the same for the Linux desktop.\nLinux desktop software is rapidly gaining on the Apple operating system's small share of the market. Analysts disagree over how the market for operating systems on desktops and laptops is carved up, but agree that Microsoft's share is above 90 percent. Linux has been reported to have a market share of upwards of 3 percent, and there has been speculation that Apple's market share could reach 5 percent in 2005, on the back of the success of the iPod music player.\nEric Raymond, a prominent figure in the open-source community, told ZDNet UK recently that a release of Office for Linux isn't even that desirable, since alternatives such as StarOffice and OpenOffice.org are already available.\n\"The important move would be to document all (Microsoft's) file formats and communications protocols, make the documentation publicly available, and make a binding promise not to sue or harass people who write open-source software to interoperate,\" Raymond said.\nMatt Asay, the director for Linux Business Office at Novell, also taking part in the panel on Wednesday, said that Microsoft would never put its Windows desktop position at risk by building Office for Linux. However, he said that the open-source community should stop focusing what Microsoft or hardware vendors are doing around Linux and let the market decide its fate.\n\"We need to get over our fixation with Microsoft.

{"idx": "34632", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: 2 What Causes a Creaking & Popping Noise in Hardwood Floors?\nSqueaky floors are almost always caused by nails that missed the floor joists when the installer was installing the floor. Occasionally boards or even floor underlay will warp slightly as well. When someone walks on unstable boards, the loose nail or the edges of the boards will slide up and down against each other, resulting in the squeaking noise. The only proper way to fix squeaks is to nail the offending squeaky board down securely to the floor joists.\nFind the location of the squeak by walking on the floor until it squeaks. Note the location. Walk downstairs and position yourself under the squeak.\nTap on the ceiling with a hammer to locate the floor joist if it is not visible, depending on what type of construction your home has. As you are tapping on the ceiling, listen for a dull \"thud\" when your hammer hits the bottom of the joist. It will be distinctively different from the hollow sound when you tap on open space.\nMeasure the location of the joist to the wall or to the nearest fixture that you can identify when you walk back upstairs. Write down the measurement.\nWalk back upstairs and use the measurement to locate the joist under the squeak. Place a spiral nail on the carpet above the joist. Use a hammer to drive it straight down through the carpet. It will not harm the carpet.\nWalk on the floor and check for squeaks. If it still squeaks, hammer more nails into the joist until it stops.\nIf your upstairs floors are hardwood, you will be able to see where the squeaky board is from the top. Drill pilot holes through the hardwood only, using a drill or rotary tool, then drive in nails as needed until the squeaking is eliminated. Putty the holes with a putty stick. You can also use a battery-powered stud finder to locate the floor joist if you want. But the tapping method is just as accurate.\nIf your floor is tile -- which is rare upstairs -- you will have to peel it back, hammer a nail into the joist and then put the tile back down. But if you can live with the squeak, just forget the whole thing. You can do more damage than it's worth.\nShaddy, Wade. \"How to Fix a Squeaky Upstairs Floor.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/fix-squeaky-upstairs-floor-98795.html. 19 December 2018.\nWhat Can Be Done About Uneven Laminate Locking Floors?"}

Hayman served eight months of an 18- to 24-month sentence for attempting to steal clothes from a Detroit-area store.\nSan Diego police say Hayman identified herself as Jamie Lewis and produced government documents with the name. Officers, however, remained suspicious because of inconsistencies in her story and her resemblance to an old Michigan mug shot they were holding.\n\"Her eyes gave her away,\" San Diego police Lt. Kevin Mayer said. \"The eyes in the picture matched the eyes of this woman.\"\nShe acknowledged being Hayman after police took her in, Mayer said.\nIt wasn&apos;t immediately clear how long Hayman had been in San Diego. But neighbors at her well-kept, nondescript apartment complex blocks from Balboa Park said she lived in the building for almost seven years.\nHer 32-year-old son was visiting when police arrived, and officers said he appeared stunned by their questions.\n\"This seemed very much a surprise to him,\" Mayer said.\nNeighbors say the woman they know as Jamie Lewis kept to herself, not speaking of her past.\nHayman is being held in a San Diego County jail awaiting extradition to Michigan and is scheduled to appear in court Thursday.\nMichigan authorities want her returned to the state to complete her sentence for attempted larceny. She also could face a separate criminal charge for the escape.\nLt. Charles Levens of the Michigan Corrections Department who was stuck at his desk and sent the fingerprint cards to the FBI said many police agencies had fingerprints that matched Hayman&apos;s but under different names. He gave the information to one of his investigators, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego.\n\"I said, &apos;Tim, you&apos;re going to get your girl here,&apos;\" Levens said. \"There are two ways to get off our list: a death certificate or a (live) body.

Mayer declined to give further details about the case, including whether Hayman had prior arrests or contact with police in California.\nTheresa Padilla said she lived next door to Hayman for more than six years and described her as a \"quiet loner, but basically a nice person.\"\nPadilla said Hayman spent most of her time indoors except when she walked her Chihuahua, Monty, who was old and had to be put down less than a year ago.\nHayman had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one son visited often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Padilla said. \"Her"}

That in itself raised questions around the world about online mind-poisoning that can lead to a very dangerous new chapter in international domestic violence.\nIn an act of utter bravery, two New Zealand police officers put their lives on the line in taking down the armed culprit after a chase. Although the individual was placed in custody, ending the most brutal crime in that nation\u2019s history, the emotional pain is still being felt around the world.\nMany world leaders weighed in on what had happened with condemnation of mass killings by extremist groups, and of individuals who feel people outside of their twisted ideology have no right to exist.\nMany expressed concerns that leaders need to be very careful with words they use when commenting on various situations. United States president Donald Trump drew considerable criticism after claiming such acts are caused by a small number of people with serious problems. That was seen by many as a reluctance openly to condemn extremist groups, a posture many recalled he took when openly racist groups marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in violent clashes with police and the death of one person.\nThe real point here is that leaders of any democratic country should be seen and heard to defend decent principles without concern about their political image, even it means losing support of those who cling to outdated concepts that skin colour and religious affiliation are grounds for rejection in open society.\nThere are many good, peaceful citizens in every country, but every country will have in the shadows people who have hidden motives about who is entitled to freedom as citizens.\nA frightening aspect to this came to light when it was revealed that there were people around the world, including some New Zealanders, who were cheering as the gunman committed mass murder to promote vicious extremist ideology that is rejected by most of the world.\nMost of us are familiar with vaccines used against a wide range of diseases, including polio, measles, chickenpox and other serious ailments. In many cases, early inoculation helps to guard against health-threatening viruses.\nWhen it comes to the disease of hatred, which comes in many forms, it would seem that an early inoculation of love, compassion and tolerance could be effective in reducing the number people who have no desire for others to live in peace and harmony.\nA real challenge for the world today is how to cope with a fast-moving pace of negative cyberspace material, which could poison a young mind before being taught the values of love, compassion and tolerance.\nThe tragedy in New Zealand sparked condemnation from millions from every corner of the planet and a clamour to reject all forms of hatred.

Users get their phones with no down payments or fees, and pay for them on a monthly basis (payments range from $15 to $50 depending on the device).\nThe new plan drew comparisons to T-Mobile's \"Jump\" plan, which lets customers upgrade their devices twice per year. That plan works by having customers make a down payment for their phone (normally $100), pay their device's monthly payment (normally $20 or $25) and pay an extra $10 per month for the upgrade plan.\n\"What AT&T announced isn't a strategy; it's a reaction to our Un-carrier moves,\" T-Mobile said in a statement.\nT-Mobile went on to criticize AT&T's plans and said its own plan was superior (a claim AT&T, of course, refutes), but the move is notable simply because in the monkey-see, monkey-do world of tech, rivals rarely call each other out when one imitates someone else's new feature.\nFacebook, for example, is one of the biggest culprits.

It's too much for many seniors, especially when you factor in memory issues, arthritis, failing eyesight and hearing.\nIf you or a relative is having trouble paying bills and managing life's paperwork, hiring a daily money manager or a bill paying service might help maintain independence -- and protect nest eggs too.\nDaily money managers are part of an emerging profession, says Mindy Luebke, the Chicago president of the American Association of Daily Money Managers. Money managers are not exclusively for seniors. Wealthy individuals have used them for generations. But over the past 10 years some have tailored their services to helping seniors at home with money management and the associated paperwork and mail.\n\"This service is very much in demand, as the younger generation does not always live in the same area as their parents,\" says Amie Hyman, owner of Heartfelt Solutions for Seniors, Inc., in Willow Springs. Hyman is a licensed social worker who began doing money management professionally five years ago. She realized the need after moving her mother to Illinois from California. \" She needed everything done for her,\" Hyman says. \"I spent hours and hours.\"\nLike Hyman's mother, many older people just can't do this anymore, she says. \"It becomes overwhelming when the junk mail, doctor bills, and Medicare statements start to pile up. They can forget to pay a bill, or they are late and incur fees,\" Hyman says. \"Once I have the proper permissions, I can set up automatic withdrawals and monitor the transactions, write checks, manage the bank deposits, transfer funds from one account to another, negotiate on their behalf with creditors, and deal with their medical insurance company.\"\n\"Some people simply do not know where their money is going anymore,\" Hyman adds. \"A DMM can prepare a budget with them.\" This allows the senior to maintain control, with help.\nUnfortunately, fraud and scams are a big problem with the elderly and their money. Having a professional looking over the senior's shoulder (and into their checkbook) can prevent catastrophic loss.\n\"I once had a client who was an inch away from sending her checking account number to a foreign entity,\" Hyman says. \"I can also spot red flags, such as numerous ATM withdrawals when the person is homebound. A caregiver or a family member is often the abuser,\" she adds.\nFor those who don't yet need at-home scrutiny of their mail, but would still like the convenience of having their bills paid automatically, a company like The Fiscal Concierge might be a good fit.

Only about 5 percent of the student population at the top-ranked university is black, and the December 2013 issue of the school's information guide notes that while undergraduate enrollment has increased by about 15 percent since 2003, the racial and ethnic makeup has stayed relatively the same.\nIn September of last year it was discovered that black enrollment at the school's Ann Arbor campus had dropped 30 percent, sparking renewed focus on the state's 2006 voter-backed ban on affirmative action. The Supreme Court is scheduled to make a decision about whether to uphold or nix the ban in June in the case Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.\nWhen Kimbrough\u2014who has a 3.6 GPA and an ACT score of 23 at University Preparatory Academy in Detroit\u2014applied to the university's early-action program, her admission was deferred at first, and then she was rejected. Her scores are considered below average at the University of Michigan, whose Class of 2013 had an average 3.85 GPA and 29 ACT score.\nStill, Kimbrough says she has a full r\u00e9sum\u00e9, with extracurricular activities that include participation in her high school's celebrated debate team and being president of U Prep's National Honor Society chapter, as well as nonprofit work, HuffPost notes.\n\"It frustrates me when I'm actually trying to do something, bring this over to the university and show them that, \"Yes, you can still come from this kind of area with one parent at that home and not a lot of money coming in every year, but you can still be somebody,' \" Kimbrough says.\nUnsurprisingly, Kimbrough's campaign has earned her opponents, most notably Jennifer Gratz, the person who started the debate over affirmative action in Michigan in 1995, when she was wait-listed at the university. Back then Gratz, who is white, said that less-accomplished minority students were admitted to the university. She took her case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and was victorious in 2003, when the court came out with a landmark ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger, banning the university from applying affirmative action to undergraduate applicants.\n\"Ms. Kimbrough has publicly demanded that the university should discriminate against other applicants in order to accommodate her demand for preferential treatment based on her skin color,\" Gratz, who now leads an anti-affirmative action organization, XIV Foundation, said in a statement. \"Her very public position contrast"}

In an instant, as the other dancers were pulling out more hats, the creased old garden backdrop that has done service since City Center days was rolled down. Then Sleeping Beauty entered, skipping rope, and the show went on. On that weekend, there was more Balanchine activity in the city than there would have been on any other weekend of the year.

The stir of dancers in and around Lincoln Center was intense. And their emotion united them, perhaps, as never before. Wherever one looked, there seemed to be dancers meeting and em- bracing wordlessly. At the J uilliard Theatre, the students who would be dancing on Saturday evening began dress rehearsals at ten o'clock that morning. They rehearsed two Balanchine ballets they had probably never seen-\"Valse Fantaisie\" and \"Western Symphony.\" Many of them had never even seen Balanchine, ex- cept from a distance, having grown up at the school in the years when he was following a curtailed schedule under close medical supervision. Like the rest of Balanchine's organization, the stu- dents had lived with bad news of Mr. B. almost daily since last November, when he entered Roosevelt Hospital. Now, on the fatal Saturday, they worked with their teachers as if it were any other day, and the rehearsal went smoothly. The only voice to be raised was Robert Irving's, repeatedly admonishing the student orchestra not to watch the stage. That night, at eight o'clock, the performance went on after Kirstein, flanked by Jerome Robbins, Peter Martins, and John Taras, made another brief speech from the stage, thanking the audience for \"this school and your support of it.\" Kirstein continued, \"We know that this night George is probably teaching the angels to tendu. The angels, who don't need to rehearse.\" Kirstein also spoke to the Saturday- night audience a block away at the State Theatre, and he would appear onstage at the school performance on Monday night, reassuring the audi- ence each time of the con- tinuity of the Balanchine tradition and, each time, wearing in his lapel the silver lyre pin designed by Balanchine for the Tchai- kovsky Festival.

The growth was fueled by earlier and longer patient use of the drug for multiple myeloma, and introduction of the medicine in new regions.\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells - a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies - that affects the bone marrow. The cancer eventually interferes with production of normal blood cells. The National Cancer Institute estimated that 21,700 people in the United States will be diagnosed with myeloma in 2012.\nSales of Abraxane, a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, fell 6 percent to $106 million. Celgene said the decline was partly due to a surge in U.S. demand for the drug in 2011 as a result of shortages of standard chemotherapy agent paclitaxel.\nCelgene, which had been criticized for paying $2.9 billion in 2010 for Abraxis Bioscience in order to obtain Abraxane, is testing the drug in other types of cancer.\nU.S. regulators recently approved use of Abraxane as a first-line treatment of the most common form of lung cancer. The drug also has been successful against metastatic melanoma in a late-stage trial whose full results will be disclosed next month.\nSales of Vidaza, used to treat a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, rose 1"}

{"idx": "34654", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: This week, Germany has been convulsed with rioting in the eastern city of Chemnitz, where right-wing protesters have clashed with police for days. The murder of a German man on Sunday, reportedly by two Middle Eastern migrants, birthed angry protests that have devolved into violence, with attacks on foreigners by right-wing mobs. The police have been unable to quash the street melee, leading to troubling questions for the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, whose open door to migrants three summers ago set the stage for political turmoil in the European Union\u2019s predominant country.\nAngry right wingers flashing the banned Hitler salute for the cameras rattled Germany\u2019s chattering class, which seems mystified by anger at Merkel and her policies. However, it\u2019s no surprise that this unpleasantness exploded in Saxony, the German state where the renascent far right has the deepest roots. Chemnitz, called Karl-Marx-Stadt when this was East Germany, like much of Saxony, has proved an ideal breeding ground for hardline nationalism and nativism, thanks to socio-economic stagnation. Chancellor Merkel\u2019s harsh criticism of the rioters is unlikely to change many minds in Chemnitz, where dislike of the current government runs deep.\nRight-wing hooligans from across Germany descended on Chemnitz to partake in the violent protests, and although the police have made progress in regaining the streets, the city remains in turmoil today. Tensions over migrants that have roiled German politics for the last three years, nearly causing the collapse of Merkel\u2019s fragile coalition, have now exploded in open violence. Like the recent murder of a Jewish girl by a migrant, the Chemnitz fracas raises awkward questions about the true state of German politics and society.\nWe also need to ask what\u2019s really going on here. There can be no denying that the renaissance of Germany\u2019s nationalist right is real, as demonstrated by the rise of the Alternative for Germany or AfD, which this month charted its highest poll numbers ever, as Merkel\u2019s shaky government struggles to deal with the migrant issue. Birthed five years ago on anti-EU sentiments, the AfD has successfully rebranded in opposition to Merkel\u2019s open-door policy on immigration. The possibility that the AfD could become a power player in Berlin, dismissed as fantasy until recently, now seems increasingly plausible.\nWhile Germany\u2019s right-wing surge is genuine, it bears noting that the Kremlin has aided the AfD\u2019s rise. Russian state media regularly pushes lurid stories about migrant crime in Germany, to the benefit of the far right, embellishing such accounts and even inventing them out of whole cloth for political effect, while the AfD\u2019s cozy relationship with Russia is no secret. Russian financial support for the party has included flying some of its leaders to Moscow on a private jet paid for by the Kremlin. In return, the AfD praises President Vladimir Putin and displays a regard for Moscow\u2019s perspective that is strong even for Germany, where Russlandversteher (\u201cRussia-understanders\u201d) are found on all points of the political spectrum.\nRussian intelligence has connections to right-wing hooligans in several European countries, Germany included. As I reported two years ago, there are detectable connections between Kremlin military intelligence, known as GRU, and football hooligans in Western Europe.

Since then, Turkish government officials largely speaking under the cover of anonymity have insisted that Saudi security forces waiting in ambush inside tortured and murdered him in revenge for speaking freely about their autocratic rulers.\nThe moments of his \u201cinterrogation, torture and killing were audio recorded and sent to both his phone and to iCloud,\u201d the pro-government, privately owned newspaper paper reported.

It cannot be unlocked using a dead person\u2019s finger, as it is possible to do with an iPhone, without access to a paired device. Days ago, Reuters also reported that while Apple Watches can transmit data like GPS locations and heart rate, it\u2019s unclear what kind of model Khashoggi owned. Only the high-end models have LTE connectivity, meaning that he would have otherwise had to be connected to the phone via BlueTooth, which has limited range.\nReports have indicated Khashoggi only had realized how much danger he was in relatively recently, though he appeared to have been wary of entering the embassy alone.\nCNN intelligence analyst Robert Baer told host Anderson Cooper that he doubted the watch in question would have been in Bluetooth range of the phone and that Khashoggi would have needed to plan a recording in advance. He suggested that Turkish officials may indeed have a recording, but are lying about how they obtained it to avoid acknowledging they have compromised the consulate\u2019s security.\nSaudi officials have remained adamant that Khashoggi left the embassy a free man and only went missing afterwards.\nHowever, the journalist wrote numerous columns critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the designated heir to King Salman and de facto head of the country\u2019s day-to-day government (including its military and security forces).

At the same time, bin Salman has been trying to woo interest from major firms like Amazon, Tesla, and Lockheed Martin, with a particular focus on sectors like next-gen energy production and storage, chemicals, plastics, data centers, and high-tech military gear. In part to lure these investors, the kingdom has played up reforms like the end of a ban on women drivers (even as it conducted an absolutely horrific military intervention in Yemen and launched an ever-intensifying campaign to root out dissent).\nOn Saturday morning, Trump promised in a 60 Minutes interview a \u201csevere punishment"}

And you certainly can\u2019t smell things you\u2019re sucking through a straw.\nSuddenly, plastic straw bans have hit a fever pitch.\nInitially cast aside by cities like Seattle, the seemingly innocent plastic straw is now rivaling the plastic bag as public environmental enemy number one as businesses from hipster hole-in-the-wall cafes all the way up to Starbucks adopt anti-plastic straw policies to deter customers who might otherwise strangle sea animals in the ocean as they sip and slurp.\nStarbucks has company on the anti-plastic straw bus: Hotelier Marriott has joined. Alaska Air has signed up. In a sign of world wide momentum, McDonalds UK has pledged to get rid of them.\nWhile the devastating aspects of the plastic straw on our environment have been dissected at length, one thing that many people haven't realized quite yet is how the very taste of our food could fundamentally change if plastic straws disappear.\nThat's because the plastic straw is a straight, ineffective bullet to the taste buds that has arguably made food taste worse and less nuanced. That\u2019s, at least, according to Charles Spence, a \u201cgastrophysicist\u201d and author of Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating famously known for his study on how the sound of crunchiness affects our perception of taste.\nThis is especially unfortunate in the case of a freshly ground cup of coffee, given that it is one of the most universally liked smells. Much of the same problem occurs whenever we drink directly from a bottle or can (uncouth as it may be!). Once again, it is the orthonasal olfactory hit that is mostly missing from the experience. We can either sniff the contents or we can drink them, but there is simply no way that we can do both at the same time, no matter how hard we try. And drinking through a straw\u2014well, that is even worse!\nThe more food sensations you can muster, the better. Stronger aroma, more texture\u2014it all helps your brain to decide when it has had enough. In one of my favorite studies illustrating this point, people consumed far more calories when drinking apple juice as compared to apple puree, and when eating pureed apple as compared to apples. Exactly the same food in all three cases; all that differs are the textural cues the brain receives about how much it has consumed (and how much chewing is needed). This is much the same reason why you should never use a straw to drink. It eliminates all the orthonasal olfactory cues that are normally such a large part of the enjoyment. Be sure to inhale the aroma of your food frequently; after all, this is where the majority of the pleasure resides.\nStraws, it seems, muck up how orthonasal olfaction works\u2014and deteriorate our tastebuds\u2019 ability to taste flavors.\nThat was proven in a 2005 paper published in JAMA, which studied 18 patients who reported loss of their smell sense without reporting a loss of taste. That's key, because, as Spence points out repeatedly in his book, smell and taste are inextricably intertwined in how we experience food.\nWhat the JAMA paper discovered, however, is that while you can still taste food without smelling it (as is the case when using a plastic straw), that taste is fundamentally different from when a person is able to smell and taste food. The fact that the taste is different is key: It's not that s"}

Those words must be posted in every executive suite, cubicle wall and bathroom mirror at Goldman Sachs, because the financial giant managed to report record profits for second quarter 2009, notwithstanding the deepest recession in 70 years. But they should be breaking records, considering all the help they've gotten from the U.S. taxpayer. We should all post a copy of the earnings release on our refrigerators.\nGoldman really is a great firm. I have never owned the stock, sadly, except through index funds. When I worked on Wall Street, many years ago, I tried to get a job there, but managed only a courtesy interview through friends.\nI believe that Goldman was the first financial firm to earn a billion dollars in one quarter, somewhere in the middle 1990s. Since that time they have pulled away from the pack of US brokerage firms.\nAnd today they report record earnings for second quarter 2009 of $3.4 billion (before the dividends they paid on the CPP preferred stock under the TARP program). But still, several of their divisions set revenue records, because customers have been shifting their business to Goldman, partly the result of big competitors going under. It also helps that the markets are still somewhat shaky, making the trading businesses inherently more profitable.\nHowever, their 2Q 2009 earnings release notes that by the measure of \"value at risk\" (VAR), the company's risk levels expanded to record levels as well.\nGoldman received $13 billion, in payment for swaps agreements, from the $180 billion bailout of AIG - those payments that had to be made to keep the system intact, and keep the counterparties from going under.\nThe firm also borrowed $21 billion under FDIC guarantees. No word in the earnings release on the status of that.\nGoldman agreed to the unusual buy-backs last September to obviate the need for the two officers to sell stock on the open market, the company said in March. \"Stock sales would easily have covered their requirements but, given the turbulent market conditions, we and they were concerned that such sales would be misconstrued by the market as indicating a lack of confidence in Goldman Sachs.\"\nSo these two wanted to raise cash, and were ready and able to sell their stock, but Goldman was worried about what impression we might draw from the facts.\nI'm sure Goldman made its record profit fair and square. No questions on that; they are the top firm these days. But it's very important that you, the taxpayer, and Goldman Sachs, and other financial firms, too, acknowledge and understand just how valuable the TARP rescue package and the other breaks were in keeping them all afloat."}

{"idx": "34671", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: For all its dramatic flaws, \"Zodiac\" deserves praise for not choosing the easy route. The story of the unsolved series of murders that paralyzed the Bay Area in the late '60s and early '70s, \"Zodiac\" doesn't sensationalize or glamorize real-life events -- in fact, it barely fictionalizes or even dramatizes them. The film takes place mainly in the fluorescent workaday world of the journalists and cops who tried to crack the case, and its virtues, like its failings, are those of authenticity. It offers neither the illusion of a complete resolution, nor -- and this is a big problem -- the structural organization that comes from a storyteller's knowing how it all ends, what it all means and what needs to be shown.\nFor Bay Area viewers, this is also a local story, and director David Fincher is conscientious about getting those particulars right. Two brief shots of the Ferry Building show the old Embarcadero Freeway still intact, and the filmmakers apparently know exactly when (and how) the Transamerica Pyramid was constructed. Bay Area locations, such as Original Joe's, turn up in all their 1970s splendor, and at least one actor (Mark Ruffalo) goes so far as to replicate the vocal mannerisms of a man known mainly by friends and family. I was in grammar school during the years depicted, but the old-time newspaper men shown in the San Francisco Chronicle newsroom seem right -- with their white shirts, tough guy faces and rolled-up sleeves.\nIt's probably safe to say that the more you know the details of the Zodiac case, the more you'll appreciate the movie -- its adherence to the historic record, its period atmosphere. Yet in the end, these are the virtues of a documentary, and as drama, there's something strangely flat and enervating about the picture. At times, \"Zodiac\" has a grim, smeary look to it, almost as if someone took an oily rag and wiped it across the lens, and the story is equally murky and without focus. In recounting the failed investigation, the filmmakers never quite locate the pulse of the movie.\nThree actors take turns in the spotlight, as the film shifts its emphasis over the course of its 158-minute running time. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, the reporter who covered the story for San Francisco's greatest newspaper. Ruffalo plays David Toschi, the detective heading the investigation. And Jake Gyllenhaal is Robert Graysmith, the Chronicle cartoonist who became obsessed with the case and later wrote the book upon which the movie is based. If there's a running thread, it's in the movie's suggestion that each man becomes, in some way, burned-out or driven mad by the pursuit. Actually, that approach could have provided an organizing principle for the narrative, except that the movie can only suggest it tepidly -- probably because it's not really true.\n\"Zodiac\" is best appreciated as a showcase for fine acting, especially that of Downey, as the witty, hard-drinking, drug-taking Avery. It's a portrait of a man in the grip of an addiction, someone funny and clever but full of pessimism and self-loathing, someone who seems to see through everything, including himself, and knows he's riding the elevator of life all the way to the basement.

To be fair, most of the delay is in launching Netscape Navigator, which is a far cry from peppy. The security element of this launch time causes only a 4 or 5-second delay. Once up and running, however, the lag was nearly unnoticeable. We expected that downloading Web pages to slow flash memory rather than to the fast hard drive would dent performance, but this simply wasn't the case.\nSo how does the StealthSurfer work? It stores all your cookies, history, and downloaded cache files on the flash drive itself, meaning there's no record of your Web surfing on the computer. If you're searching for an engagement ring for a loved one, or even holiday presents for tech-savvy kids, this just might be the ticket. An analysis of your network activity would reveal your surfing habits, however, so you may not want to try this at work.\nIn addition to the secure browsing, the StealthSurfer gives you a secure, encrypted place to store files. The drive is formatted into two partitions, one visible only after entering your password. The recently released StealthSurfer 2.0 improves on the earlier USB 1.1 version in several ways, including an important file format change. The cluster size on the first flash drive was 16K, meaning the minimum file size was 16K. In other words, every 1K cookie or 2K Web site logo you browsed past was saved on the flash drive as a 16K file, rapidly eating through its capacity. In the new StealthSurfer, cluster size is a mere 2K, meaning you'll use the drive's capacity much more effectively. The giant Netscape package alone still ate through nearly 38MB of our flash drive, however. You'll need at least a 128MB device to have any offline storage. And, of course, if you forget the password, a reset will delete all data on the StealthSurfer."}

While the word \"reboot\" was mentioned, there are still many questions about the new project. Will the film be a reboot or another story in the same world? Will Harrison Ford be involved? Who will be writing the script? When can we expect it to go into production? How did Scott become involved? Fortunately some of those questions have been answered by Alcon Entertainment producer Andrew Kosove, whom the Los Angeles Times got in contact with after the news broke.\nStarting with an explanation of the project's origins, Kosove said that while they did have some possible other options, they're main goal was to get Scott on board. While in the process of securing the rights a few months ago, the company contacted Scott Free, the studio started by Ridley and Tony Scott, for a sit-down meeting. During the discussion, the executives talked with the director about making a new film that wouldn't just look like all the other films that copied the original's style and decided \"it should stand as separately as possible.\" Scott then agreed to take it on.\nAs for hiring a writer, Kosove says that's the next step. In a process that could take months, Scott and the producers will sit down with candidates to choose the right person for the job. Because of this, it's going to take a few years for the project to actually get into production. Kosove estimated that it will take 18 months to \"hire a writer, get a script in working order under Scott's guidance, cast the film and move into production.\" This puts a start date somewhere in the year 2013, meaning that the movie won't be released until at least 2014 (Scott may use that development time to work on another project).\nFor those hoping that the movie would see Harrison Ford return as Rick Deckard , it might be best if you let that dream die. While Scott may have different ideas, Kosove said, \"If you're asking me will this movie have anything to do with Harrison Ford, the answer is no. This is a total reinvention, and in my mind that means doing everything fresh, including casting.\"\nKeeping in mind what happened to the Alien prequel, it will be interesting to see how this project moves through development. Needless to say I won't be shocked this time when it's announced that the Blade Runner reboot has been turned into an original film called Atlas."}

That's why, even though I may see \"Welcome, Greg!\" at the top of the page, I'm also presented with \"If you're not Greg, click here.\"\nAt first glance, that may not seem like such a big deal, but it may well represent the defining issue of online commerce.\nThe next phase of the Net will go well beyond custom portals to something far more sophisticated and infinitely more helpful. Imagine a calendar service interacting with a map service so that your car can give you directions to your next appointment without being asked; it could even interact with a traffic service to help you avoid delays due to road construction or stalled vehicles.\nTo make this vision of \"smart\" Web services a reality, however, service providers need an efficient way to identify people and bill them small amounts.\nConsider Internet searches, which are free but notoriously off the mark. Would you be willing to pay a fee for a higher quality of search? Perhaps. But how much? Specialists routinely pay hundreds of dollars a month for access to specialized databases, but a harried consumer might only be willing to pay 25 cents a search for more accurate results on \"early music of Appalachia\" or \"origins of bone china.\"\nOr consider music downloads: How much would you pay for a single song or a single listening? Right now, there's no universally accepted online equivalent to pocket change--what you use when you want to buy a newspaper or a hundred other small items that add up to big business. With a fine-grained billing system, such micro-payments could open up whole new markets online.\nIf we go back to my example of the calendar, map and traffic services all working together, then it's easy to see that each needs to be compensated, and people will likely want a choice between a flat monthly rate or a small per-use fee. That's pretty much the way the telecommunications industry works today.\nCarriers across the country--indeed, around the world--seamlessly transfer callers between their various networks and, through peering agreements, share profits equitably. Given the volume of calls, both wired and wireless (which adds roaming to the mix), this can be an exceedingly complex undertaking, but the carriers have it down to a system--a veritable service grid in which consumers and service providers all benefit.\nNo comparable billing system exists on the Net. No standard way to simply connect and be billed for services the way cell phone users are automatically billed for roaming or long-distance service. No peering and settlement systems to ensure that each service provider collects its due.\nUntil we get this right, the next wave of Internet business will be severely handicapped, held back by inconvenience, incompatibility and mistrust. It's only natural, I suppose, that the leading Internet service providers, with their millions of paying subscribers, were among the first to see the problem and try to address it.\nHowever, while their intentions may be good--making it easy for subscribers to purchase goods and services without having to continually re-enter credit information--they have no incentive to create a neutral, open billing system that treats all merchants fairly.\nThe natural tendency will be for Internet service providers to give preferential treatment to their"}

Its so-so QuickTime movie capabilities also stand in for the C-770 Ultra Zoom's robust MPEG-4 clips, and there are minor differences in the control layout.\nBut you still get a versatile, 10X optical zoom with the C-765 Ultra Zoom. It comes up a bit short on the wide end at 38mm (35mm camera equivalent), but it gives you a lot of telephoto power with with a 380mm (equivalent) focal length. You can scope out your scene on a 1.8-inch LCD or through the bright electronic viewfinder (EVF). The EVF makes composing images easy, even in bright light and especially when shooting close-ups down to 2.8 inches (in macro mode) or 0.5 inch (in super macro mode).\nWhile the Olympus's 11 scene modes and flexible automatic-exposure options will appeal to snapshooters, enthusiasts will really appreciate the ability to fine-tune their shots with shutter- and aperture-priority modes, manual exposure (from 1/1,000 second to 15 seconds; f/2.8 to f/8), and manual focus. If you're looking for the best possible image quality, you can save photos in TIFF mode.\nThe easy-to-use controls include a shutter release and a concentric zoom lever that you can operate with one finger. They also include a knurled mode wheel and a four-way control pad that navigates menus and sets shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation, and manual focus. Five other multifunction buttons adjust settings that include exposure lock, self-timer, and flash mode as well as a user-customizable function. Other buttons pop up the built-in flash, switch between the EVF and the rear LCD, adjust the viewfinder diopter, activate the quick-review function, and power the camera on or off.\nYou can set light sensitivity either automatically or manually from ISO 64 to ISO 400. Metering options include eight-point multisegment, spot, and center-weighted. When darkness falls, a beefy flash unit illuminates your scene from about 1 to 15 feet at the wide-angle setting and from 4 to 17 feet in telephoto mode at ISO 100.\nThe C-765 Ultra Zoom beat the performance of its more expensive cousin in a couple of areas but fell down in others.

Almost exactly a year ago Criterion released Ray\u2019s classic (and my favorite of his films) Bigger Than Life on DVD. Here, in a review, Rob Ribera commented, \u201cthe film remains a delirious fever dream of longing, entrapment, angst and addiction.\u201d Such words seem to characterize the life Patrick McGilligan aptly details throughout his biography, Nicholas Ray: The Glorious Failure of an American Director. But where Ray\u2019s film is layered with hallucinatory yet precise beauty, and his life is littered with bizarre relationships and confused characters, McGilligan\u2019s prose is geared towards tracing a certain clear narrative with simple language. The research is deep and the author\u2019s focus on Ray\u2019s life before his rise to fame and after the success of his opus Rebel Without a Cause (1955) provides a new lens on his career.\nRay\u2019s life is not the story of unused potential. His story is not a Greek tragedy. He is no Oedipus. This is a tale of a definitely modern life filled with all of the contradictions, complexities and challenges that come with having a desire to be both political and popular and all the while remain artistic. It was the challenge of one who as McGilligan describes was \u201can eternal delinquent\u201d constantly seeking a home and a community, all the while desiring to stand alone (276). Ray\u2019s rise was long and arduous and his downfall, which was never so much a downfall as an inability to push forward a stunted career, owed as much to his addictions as it did a lifetime of bizarre relationships with important people. Like a man who could never swim but could stay afloat, Ray seemed to tread along throughout his life trying very hard, and yet not giving quite the effort needed.\nRay presents one of the most interesting filmmakers in highlighting film studies\u2019 fluctuating relationship to auteurism. Put forth by the critics such as Francois Truffaut in France and pushed further by Andrew Sarris in America, \u201cla politique des Auteurs\u201d suggested even in the factory that was the studio system, even amidst the collaboration of set designers, assistant directors, actors and coffee runners, an individual vision created by the director could emerge\u2014if they were talented enough. As comprehensive and fascinating monographs continue to be written on specific directors by creative authors, film studies continue to cry out against itself \u201cthat\u2019s auteurist!\u201d From Godard\u2019s now oft-cited claim in his review of Bitter Victory that \u201cNicholas Ray is the cinema\u201d any view of Ray carries with it the entire baggage of auteurism and the consequent rift between academics (who seem to shudder at the term) and film critics. There is something sincere in critics embracing auteurism, even if in many instances the director only provides limited insight into a film\u2019s unfolding. McGilligan\u2019s own struggle represents film studies ever-precarious understanding of itself where there is a desire to both hold on and grow from auteurism and yet also to break and shatter what seems like a relic from a past era of criticism that was fervent and purposefully polemical.\nThis ongoing struggle is reproduced in McGilligan\u2019s rendering of Ray.

Known as the official kickoff to the legislative session, the 55-minute speech \u2014 his longest ever during his annual address to lawmaker \u2014 focused on the hard lessons he's learned throughout the three terms in Idaho's highest elected position.\n\"With the benefit of experience earned through the patience and confidence of Idaho voters, today I have a more nuanced view of the proper role of government,\" Otter said. \"I have always understood its limitations and its flaws. But now I also know its possibilities, when responsibly led, for helping individual citizens realize their full potential. None of us can afford to dismiss the latter because we are hamstrung by the former.\"\nOtter pointed to his dedication to improving Idaho education, replenishing the state's reserves and attracting job growth as some of his top achievements.\nCome December, Otter will end more than four decades of being an elected official. Noting the looming change, Otter's budget even includes a line item for $15,000 to help cover governor-elect transition costs.\nYet, despite his term approach an end, Otter still laid out a long list of goals for the upcoming 2018 session.\nOverall, the governor is proposing a 6.62 percent increase from last year's budget. This would bring the state budget to $3.66 billion in fiscal year 2019, which starts in July and goes until the end of June 2019.\nAs constitutionally required, the majority of the budget proposed by Otter would be spent on education.

Butch Otter rolled out a major tax-cut proposal Monday in his 12th and final State of the State message to a joint session of the Legislature.\nOtter proposed a three-pronged approach, centered around conforming Idaho\u2019s state income tax code to the new federal tax bill. The state Tax Commission estimates that if Idaho simply conforms its laws to the new federal bill, the state actually would collect $97.4 million more in state income taxes next year. That\u2019s because the doubling of the standard deduction would cause a $340.5 million decrease to Idaho\u2019s general fund, but the removal of the personal exemptions, which taxpayers now get for themselves and each of their dependents, would mean an increase in state tax collections of nearly $412 million. Other changes would add and subtract, finally ending up with the bottom line of plus-$97.4 million.\nIdaho\u2019s state income tax is based on the federal system - the state uses federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for state income tax return calculations.

Although it was the VCs who triggered the growth of the sector in the first place, there was a lull in funding pattern as VCs became more cautious with their investments. The mad rush in the BPO sector did not help as VCs played the wait and watch game for emergence of winners. Finally a few invested and even exited like ChrysCapital in Spectramind and TransWork.\nAs money trickled in, some BPO companies had to wind operations waiting for the funds that never happened. Things started looking up in July 2003 which saw a number of investments with Westbridge Capital leading a $ five million financing in Indecomm Global Services. Bangalore based 24\u00d77 managed to rake in $22 million fund from Sequoia Capital, while Satyam Computers BPO initiative Nipuna raised $20 million from Intel.

Exit could be through a strategic sale or public offering.\nAccording to Gulpreet Kohli of ChrysCapital, although BPO sector may be divided into pure-play, those foraying from IT services and niche players, there is no way of saying which category of players would do well in BPO.

You can't sink your teeth into it. It's a sound bite. It's very of this age, because that's what people want.\"\nOf course, serval outlets picked up the quote, which led White to issue a statement Wednesday (December 5) afternoon that took the media to task for its \"tabloidesque drama baiting,\" and said that his quotes were taken out of context.\n\"I never said anything about her music, or questioned the authenticity of her songs in any way. I was in a conversation about the drawbacks of image for the sake of image, and that it is popular nowadays to not question an image in front of you, but only to label it as 'cool' or 'weird' quickly and dispose of it,\" the statement read in part. \"I don't like my comments about Lady Gaga's presentation being changed into some sort of negative critique of her music. If you're going to try to cause drama, at least get the quotes right. I think journalists should also be held accountable for what they say. Especially publications like the NME who put whatever words they feel like between two quotation marks and play it off as a quote. \"\nIn the headline of their story, the NME inserted the words \"Lady Gaga's music\" into White's quote, a practice he said prevents musicians from giving meaningful quotes to publications, for fear that they might be misued.\n\"I ... think that kind of tabloid drama encourages artists to not express their opinions in the press, and instead give polite soundbites that don't stimulate thought about creativity and the consumption of art in its many guises,\" White wrote. \"Peace to Lady Gaga and I fully congratulate and compliment her on her championing of gay rights issues and the momentum it's given to help create change.\"\nOf course, one thing that White didn't back away from was his take on the age in which we live (which is ironic given the flap over his quotes): Turns out, White isn't much of a fan of it, condemning celebrity culture, reality television and the instant-gratification (and lack of substance) of sites like Twitter in the Esquire interview.\n\"The goal of modern celebrity is to make yourself into the lowest common denominator: 'Hey, I'm a guy just like you.

First there\u2019s the support for \u201ccutout\u201d displays, better known as The Notch. One of Android P\u2019s premier features will be proper support for cameras that jut into the screen, so apps, videos, and status bars can display properly.\nThat was to be expected. After Essential Phone kicked off the notched aesthetic (even before the iPhone X landed), more than a few Android phones have jumped on the bandwagon, and it\u2019s clear that many new phones will adopt the look going forward.\nThis screenshot from a Google blog post shows a new navigation bar, with a pill-shaped home button and no recents button. The pic has since been cropped to remove the navigation bar.\nBut a new rumor takes the iPhone X influence even further. In a since-edited screenshot in blog post about DNS security improvements in Android P, Google posted an image of what seems to be a navigation bar rather than a button at the bottom of a Pixel screen, with a back arrow next to an elongated strip similar to Apple\u2019s home indicator. There isn\u2019t much to go on beyond that, but Stephen Hall at 9to5Google confirms that Google is indeed developing a new iPhone X-style gesture-based navigation bar design complete with a new pill-shaped button and refined layout that dumps the long-standing square \u201crecents\u201d button for a swipe-up gesture.\nThis move is decidedly less expected. When Apple added its virtual navigation bar as part of the iPhone X\u2019s iOS makeover, it was because it lost the home button, which had been affixed to the space below the screen since the beginning. A new navigation method was necessary since the old one was gone, and Apple clearly put a lot of thought into developing a system that was new yet familiar.\nBut most Android phones lost their home buttons years ago, relying instead on a virtual array of three buttons\u2014back, home, and recents\u2014that created a sense of unity across all Android phones. Even handsets with a physical home button were still flanked by back and recent keys. It was one of the few constants in Android, and I always assumed Google didn\u2019t mess with it because introducing a new method would make things too difficult for its handset partners. The Nexus and Pixel phones simply followed suit.\nI never had an problem with Android\u2019s navigation, but after using the iPhone X, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a better way. Apple\u2019s gesture-based navigation is simple, intuitive, and delightful, and it makes Android phones seem stale by comparison. Implementing a similar method with the Pixel 3 will make certainly Google\u2019s phone easier to navigate and feel more modern, but I can\u2019t help but wonder why Google is implement this change now rather than a year ago when the Pixel launched. And the only answer I can come up with is that Google has simply lost the ability to innovate.\nIf you look at the last few Android releases, you\u2019ll find few, if any unique features.

But the agency could not identify the source despite using fingerprints and DNA analysis. At the time, Charkaoui was under a national security certificate as a suspected al-Qaida sleeper agent.\nSurveillance of the reporter was to be limited to a \u201cspecific period of time.\u201d The document also suggests that there was a \u201cpurpose and a motivation\u201d to the leak that warranted investigation.\nIt made no mention of the Bellavance surveillance.\nFederal Court ordered disclosure of the records because of the similarities to the Abdelrazik leak in August 2011, which the Mounties say they are still investigating. Abdelrazik\u2019s lawyers will ask the court this month to force the RCMP to turn over their file, saying it\u2019s crucial to his civil lawsuit over the leak.\n\u201cThe RCMP\u2019s investigation file is the only source of information directly relevant to issues at the heart of the present action, including who was responsible for the leak, what responsibilities and duties their position(s) entailed, and what safeguards were in place to prevent such a leak,\u201d Abdelrazik\u2019s motion states.\nThe Mounties, however, argue disclosure of their \u201cProject Statue\u201d file could jeopardize their probe into who gave the secret documents to at least two newspapers, a leak CSIS says damaged national security.\n\u201cInvestigations of this nature are usually long and tedious. Due to the complexity of this case, it is impossible to estimate when this investigation will be concluded,\u201d RCMP Insp. Randal Walsh says in an affidavit.\nAbdelrazik, 53, a Sudanese-born Canadian, became widely known when Ottawa refused for six years to help him get back to Canada from Sudan, where he was imprisoned and, he says, tortured. Federal Court ruled in 2009 that Canadian anti-terrorism agents had played a role in his detention.\nIn early August 2011, La Presse ran a front-page story based on a pair of sensitive documents CSIS had prepared for Transport Canada in 2004. They disclosed Abdelrazik had apparently been in on a conversation with the Moroccan-born Charkaoui about hijacking and blowing up an Air France plane from Montreal to Paris.\nThe documents surfaced as the UN was considering whether to take Abdelrazik off its terrorist list.\nWithin days of the La Presse story, CSIS began an internal probe into whether its agents had leaked the documents, records show. The agency tentatively concluded blame fell on someone in the Privy Council Office, the bureaucracy that supports the prime minister"}

Now Kurion says the efforts are working, and cesium levels in the water have dropped by more than 40 percent.\nThree-year-old Kurion makes a cleanup material (they call it ion specific media) that soaks up radioactive cesium and iodine in contaminated water and contains the waste by shrinking it down to a small-enough size, then turning it into glass, a process called vitrification. The company is backed by investors Lux Capital and Firelake Capital, and is the only American company and startup company to work on the Japanese cleanup efforts.\nVitrification is the standard way to cleanup cesium and iodine in nuclear-contaminated water, but Kurion says it makes that process cheaper, faster and more efficient. Often, the standard vitrification process requires the contaminated materials to be moved to a centralized plant, but Kurion\u2019s process brings the technology to the contaminated materials.\nKurion isn\u2019t cleaning the some 90 million gallons of contaminated water on its own. Japanese conglomerates Hitachi and Toshiba, and French nuclear provider AREVA, are also helping to clean the some 90 million gallons. The water was pumped into the turbine buildings at the power plant and wasn\u2019t only contaminated by nuclear materials, but also filled with debris, oil and salt (from seawater).\nThe group has been working in a haste to clean the massive amount of water. Kurion\u2019s CEO John Raymont told me in an interview back in June that the rainy season just started in Japan, and if the contaminated water overflowed, it could damage the area\u2019s environment even more. There\u2019s also the concern that more earthquakes could occur in the area, which could also cause the water to overflow. Raymont told me that the startup delivered the cleanup material and technology to Japanese utility TEPCO in five weeks, which is a fraction of the time he says it took to start cleaning water at the Three Mile Island accident.\nNuclear waste management is a problem that hasn\u2019t seen a whole lot of innovation over the past few decades.

{"idx": "34709", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Thirteen years ago, a shock wave hit the House of Representatives. Three autocratic committee chairmen were ousted by the majority Democrats, partly at the insistence of a self-styled group of reformers who were swept into Congress on the coattails of the Watergate scandal. ``It was the end of the old-fashioned seniority system,'' recalls House Judiciary Committee chairman Peter Rodino (D) of New Jersey. It was also the beginning of a new political reality in the House, one where once unassailable chairmen were forced to consider the wishes of even the lowliest freshmen.\nToday, a more subtle change in committee leadership is in the offing, but one that will influence the House for years to come.\nIt is a generational changing of the guard. The uppermost tiers of the House hierarchy are coming within reach of the very cadre of younger lawmakers who helped launch the revolt against last decade's sitting chairmen. These prospective leaders promise to be more partisan than their predecessors, more aggressive in seizing opportunities to wield legislative power, and more adept at mastering the media-wise politics of the post-Vietnam era.\nIn fact, some of those transitions have already taken place, hinting at the impact of changes still to come. In 1985, Rep. Les Aspin, then a seventh-term Democrat from Wisconsin, leaped over the heads of five more-senior members of the Armed Services Committee to depose the sitting chairman, the late Rep. Melvin Price (D) of Illinois.\nBefore Representative Aspin assumed his post, the Armed Services Committee had been considered a safe haven for the Pentagon; it was comprised mostly of conservative champions of military programs who were loath to criticize the Reagan administration's defense buildup. But the panel has been reshaped under Aspin's leadership - its historic pro-Pentagon tilt squelched with the addition of younger, more liberal lawmakers.\nMeanwhile, Aspin has joined with the Democratic leadership to craft a party defense policy. In recent years, the committee's defense spending bills have served as vehicles for leadership-sponsored arms control proposals opposed by the administration. ``It's really a different place since Les took over,'' says Rep. Dave McCurdy (D) of Oklahoma.\nThere have been similar changes in the House's Democratic leadership. Rep. Tony Coelho, a fifth-term Democrat from California, won election last year to the third-ranking slot in the House leadership hierarchy. As majority whip, Representative Coelho has teamed with House Speaker Jim Wright (D) of Texas in refining a hardball political style that usually guarantees Democratic victories and infuriates the House's Republican minority.\nWright and Representative Coelho's take-charge approach appeals to younger members eager to put their agenda to work. ``We want to win, it's that simple,'' says Coelho.\nThat sort of aggressiveness has been picked up by some senior House members who are preparing to assume the reins of committees. When Representative Rodino retires next year, he will cede his post to another senior lawmaker, Rep. Jack Brooks (D) of Texas. But their styles could hardly differ more dramatically.\nRodino built a reputation as a cautious legislator who used his power more often to obstruct conservative social initiatives than to advance an active agenda of his own. Representative Brooks, on the other hand, took over the backwater Government Operations Committee in 1975 and transformed it into an aggressive instrument of oversight and investigation.\nBoth served in"}

Seventy percent of Prologis' 45-million-square-foot development pipeline is outside the country, in places were e-commerce is growing at a faster clip.\nBecause if you believe in e-commerce, you believe in Prologis. While internet shopping has devastated demand for traditional retail spaces, it has had the opposite effect on industrial real estate.

Consuming too much zinc can cause some unpleasant side effects for men. However, larger doses of zinc from supplements may provide some benefits for men with certain medical conditions, but only under medical supervision.\nThe RDA for men is 11 milligrams of zinc each day, and most men meet this requirement without using zinc supplements. According to MedlinePlus, men in North America generally consume about 13 milligrams of zinc daily. Zinc-rich foods include lean red meat, dark meat chicken, seafood, milk, yogurt, cheese and nuts.\nGetting too little zinc in your diet may result in a deficiency, which can cause hair loss, impaired immune function, poor would healing and impotence in men, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements. Low zinc levels in men are linked to low sperm and male infertility, according to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports in March 2016. Due to the high number of elderly people who are deficient in zinc, Oregon State University suggests elderly men take a daily zinc supplement containing the zinc RDA, or 11 milligrams of zinc, daily.\nTaking large daily doses of zinc, for a short-term period of time, may be of benefit for men with certain health conditions. According to MayoClinic.com, taking 4.5 to 24 milligrams of zinc in lozenge form every 1 to 2 hours may help reduce symptoms of the common cold. Other high dosages of zinc used in research studies include 12 to 150 milligrams per day to improve immune function in elderly men, 66 milligrams of zinc to increase sperm counts in subfertile men and 220 milligrams of zinc daily for sexual dysfunction in men, reports MayoClinic.com. However, don\u2019t take these high doses of zinc unless supervised by a medical professional, and avoid taking them longer than your doctor recommends.\nAlthough zinc supplements may help restore zinc levels in men with a zinc deficiency and help prevent a deficiency in elderly men when consumed in recommended amounts, MedlinePlus suggests that routine daily use of zinc supplements is generally not recommended. The maximum safe daily intake for zinc is 40 milligrams per day for men, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements. Side effects from too much zinc include headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. MedlinePlus reports that taking very high doses of 10 to 30 grams, or 10,000 to 30,000 milligrams, of zinc can be fatal.\nColeman,, Erin. \"Can a Man Benefit From Large Daily Doses of Zinc?\" Healthy Eating | SF Gate, http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/can-man-benefit-large-daily-doses-zinc-8314.html. 12 December 2018."}

Cost-per-watt numbers may catch headlines, but efficiency is equally as important. And the dynamic between the two isn't explained well by companies who want to disclose enough information that investors can understand them -- while withholding enough so that competitors can't gain an edge.\nSo that leaves us to try to parse through the mumbo-jumbo to try to explain who has a competitive edge and the reason why.\nWe've established that cost per watt and efficiency are two of the three most important words in solar, along with bankability. If we start with efficiency we can break the companies into three categories. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is the least efficient with 11.6% efficient panels. I have lumped Chinese manufacturers in one category at 14.7% efficient because we know there is very little efficiency differentiation between them. And SunPower (Nasdaq: SPWRA) leads the pack with 19.5% efficient panels.\nCost per watt is relatively simple for the manufacturers who provide this number explicitly. I am using Trina Solar's (NYSE: TSL) $1.16 per watt cost for Chinese manufacturers because this is the lowest published number. First Solar and Sunpower come in at $0.75 and $1.71 respectively.\nBalance of system costs is a little more complicated and requires a few assumptions by anyone making a model. I've assumed that First Solar's balance of system cost per watt is $1.50, and others are adjusted based of efficiency (with 10% of BOS costs fixed). Efficiency is a good adjustment because land would be a significant portion of BOS costs and can be used to approximate other costs.\nAfter that I make the assumption that a development costs $3.50 (based on published data), back out margins and double-check that they are reasonable, based on company financial data (they are). And that gives us the chart below, which should be in the right ballpark.\nThe margin would have to be shared between panel manufacturers and developers, but they're in line with what you would expect from each company. First Solar has the highest margin followed by Chinese manufacturers and SunPower.\nNow that we understand the basics we can see how these dynamics might change in the future. Costs are falling for most manufacturers but at different rates. That will change the competitive landscape going forward.\nIn recent quarters Chinese manufacturers like Trina Solar, JA Solar (Nasdaq: JASO) and Suntech Power (NYSE: STP) have found it harder to cut costs. Silicon prices are no longer falling at the rapid pace they did through 2009, and manufacturers have found it harder to cut other costs. Meanwhile First Solar has steadily cut costs by increasing efficiency and improving technology. Below you can see how cost per watt has changed over the last year and Trina Solar trails both First Solar and Sunpower in cutting costs.\nOver the next year the biggest change may happen at SunPower where the company is planning to cut cost per watt from $1.71 to $1.48 in 2011. That 13.5% drop in costs should help improve margins and put SunPower in a better competitive position. And if SunPower's plan to cut costs to $1 per watt by 2014 comes true it will put more pressure on manufacturers like Yingli Solar (NYSE"}
{"idx": "34722", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: In the 1990s, the world witnessed the forging of a unique entente between Turkey, a predominantly Muslim secular democracy, and the Jewish state of Israel. A range of shared interests brought the two states into alignment, reinforced by joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and high-level diplomatic visits. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, one of the Turkish architects of the relationship, former deputy chief of staff \u00c7evik Bir, listed the advantages to Turkey and Israel in fields ranging from deterrence to diplomacy. He urged the United States to invest still more in the relationship, which could \"develop as the pillar of a wider security architecture for the Middle East, with the objective of keeping theocratic extremism and martial despotism in check.\"\nBut in the spring of 2003, when the United States moved to eliminate Saddam Hussein, Israel and Turkey stood on opposite sides of the debate over the war. Turkish public opinion ran strongly against the war, and Ankara's new Islamist-oriented government denied U.S. forces access to Turkish territory. In contrast, Israeli public opinion strongly supported the removal of Saddam by force, and the Israeli government coordinated its wartime moves closely with Washington.\nIn the immediate aftermath of Saddam's fall, Ankara and Jerusalem sought to reaffirm their commitment to their relationship despite this sharp divergence. Israeli president Moshe Katsav, during a July 2003 visit to Ankara, was feted in a burst of publicity. The Turkish foreign ministry was also quick to invite and receive Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom. But this could not obscure the question marks left by the fact that Turkey and Israel had been poles apart over a key strategic issue in the Middle East.\nMutual interests have driven the entente between Turkey and Israel. Nevertheless, the interests of the two countries are not identical, and in a number of areas they diverge. There has been a tendency on both sides to ignore these divergences, perhaps out of a sense of enthusiasm for the entente's potential. But as the United States discovered in the spring, a failure to appreciate differing interests can lead to unanticipated disagreements down the road. All of Turkey's bilateral relationships deserve more critical scrutiny than before, perhaps none more so than Turkey's relations with Israel.\nIn this article, the indisputable strengths of the Turkish-Israeli relationship are taken for granted. Turkey and Israel are democracies; they have a shared interest in regional stability; and they are oriented toward the West. They are the most economically productive and militarily powerful states in the Middle East. The political, economic, and strategic compatibilities between the two states make them natural partners in an unpredictable region. The strengths of the entente have been analyzed in numerous official statements, press articles, and academic studies.\nThis essay is an attempt to enumerate some of its weaknesses.

The other was the United States national climate assessment report, which found that climate change could shrink the US economy and kill thousands by the end of the century.\nThe third factor influencing public opinion could be the media coverage of such reports, Leiserowitz said.\nThe new report has some limitations, including that the findings are based on self-reported data in surveys.\nOverall, the new report and past reports help take the pulse on where"}
{"idx": "34726", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: It has still been possible, late this summer, to catch Jeb Bush on a good day. At these times, his stiffness subsides and the dimensions of his empathy become apparent. His interest in policy seems deeper and his grasp of it more intuitive than that of the rest of the Republican contenders for president. His comparative centrism seems not just tactical but felt. And it seems like those $120 million in campaign contributions did not just accrue to him by the accident of his family name but also because he actually represented a possibility: that conservatism might offer not just a logic for screechy opposition to the country\u2019s basic social direction, but a way of moving with it.\nI happened to catch one of these good Bush days a week ago Wednesday, at an education-reform forum outside of Manchester, in which Bush and five of the other GOP candidates for president spent 40 minutes each telling war stories about their battles with the teachers unions and pontificating about the liberations that technology and market competition would bring to schools. Not a very hard topic and not a very tough crowd.\nBut Bush was simply better than the rest \u2014 better than Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal; better than the two other moderates he, improbably, is trailing in New Hampshire, John Kasich and Carly Fiorina; and better than Scott Walker, once and perhaps still his main competition for the nomination. Walker was genial where Bush was tense, underbriefed where Bush tended to bushwhack straight for the densest policy brush. Walker more or less waved his hands at the atmospherics of the summit: all of the worried education talk about the future of the American middle class and the testing prowess of fourth graders in Singapore. All this stress about achievement seemed a little overblown, Walker said. He wanted to push community college, to encourage sixth and seventh graders not just to dream of becoming doctors and lawyers but also \u201cwelders and IT technicians.\u201d \u201cThere are great careers there,\u201d he pointed out; increasingly, he said, the well-paying jobs were technical ones. Walker\u2019s politics of combat is in service of a sublime social placidity, a kind of case against hopes and dreams: America, you just do you.\nBush took almost exactly the opposite line, a paternalistic horror that standards had so badly lapsed. Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush share roughly the same politics but almost exactly the same mien. Jeb Bush has none of his brother\u2019s louche ease. Instead, he has Romney\u2019s urgency and agitation, his occasional entitled cruelty, his inability to construct a public mask that is any different or better than the public one, his dispositional desire to measure up. When Campbell Brown (the host of the education summit) asked Bush to name a teacher who had inspired him and whose work helped shape his view of education, he named his sophomore-year Spanish teacher at Andover, a man from Spain named Angel Rubio, who insisted the tenth graders read Borges and Cervantes even as they struggled with the basic grammar. From this Bush came to understand, he told Brown, that what society owed everyone within it was high expectations. He told Brown, too, about his revulsion, as a candidate for governor, at seeing a high-school senior in an Orlando suburb prepping for the test he needed to pass to graduate and struggling with a question that asked how long a baseball game lasted if it started at 3 p.m. and ended at 4:30.

Trump has been the funhouse mirror version of a candidate, but the lights are about to be shut down on this carnival and we\u2019re a little queasy from the ride.\nThroughout his bombastic campaign, Trump has routinely offered reminders that he is woefully unfit to hold this office.\nThough Clinton\u2019s critics have occasionally mined sexist reasons to shove her aside, there have also been profound reasons for voters to challenge her past conduct, including the latest revelations about her dubious handling of classified emails. Despite this, she is more than merely the lesser of two evils; more than the president voters will be forced to settle for. She has the experience and potential to hold our highest office with distinction. Americans should embrace her possibilities.\nTake a moment to consider the last century of presidents and ponder which ones had job training comparable to that of Clinton. She knows the Oval Office from the inside as first lady, congressional chambers as senator, and leaders of the world as secretary of state.\nYoung women deserve to live in an America where a woman serves as president. Young men deserve it too.\nAt times, Clinton has been her own opponent, reckless with classified emails; and less than transparent in her approach to dealing with colleagues, the public and media. These missteps will not be easily overlooked as she is scrutinized during her administration. She needs to become less insulated, and should sever her ties to the Clinton Foundation during her term.\nHer resiliency in the face of Trump\u2019s repugnant taunts revealed the mettle she will surely need to summon as she is held to higher standards than previous commanders in chief.\nWhat Clinton lacks in charisma she makes up for as a policy wonk. This should make her a better president than a candidate.\nShe has plans to help seniors and the impoverished with medical expenses; students with debt; parents with child care costs; small business with taxes; and our planet with progressive environmental policies. She strives to craft a humane version of immigration reform and reasonable gun safety laws. She may be too traditional a policymaker during a time when the people of American are starving for change, but she has demonstrated an ability to work with rivals to mend breaches.\nWe hope her years at Yale Law School and as a senator just over the state line forged a sensitivity to Connecticut\u2019s needs. She also has a strong working relationship with U.S. Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, who was her law school classmate.\nElecting our first woman president is a pivotal next step in America\u2019s evolution as a country with ideals that have still not been fully realized after 240 years.

The movement, which was for decades the most powerful opposition party in Egypt, is now facing tremendous challenges and struggles not only to survive, but also to maintain its unity and coherence.\nThe unprecedented repression and elimination policy of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's regime against the movement has tremendously affected its influence and public image. However, the most significant impact is on the movement's internal organisation and integration. The Brotherhood has been largely paralysed and lost much of its organisational and mobilising capabilities.\nHistorically, a moderate level of repression would play in favour of the Brotherhood, which utilises it to maintain solidarity and loyalty of its members.\nThe mihna (adversity) narrative, that is: the collective sentiment of victimisation and suffering under regime repression helped the Brotherhood to draw support from society and enabled the leadership to control the rank-and-file and sideline dissident voices.\nHowever, this narrative failed to achieve its mission after the removal of the Brotherhood from power in July 2013. In fact, it led to opposite effect,s as young members are increasingly feeling disenchanted with the movement's old leadership.\nSince the coup of 2013, the Brotherhood has seen myriad organisational, political and ideological divisions. Sisi's repression has divided the movement and created significant differences among members over several issues, ranging from the position towards the regime to its political, ideological and religious views.\nThese divisions have shaped the Brotherhood's strategy and tactics on how to respond to Sisi's repression. Organisationally, with many of its senior members in prison and exile, the Brotherhood is facing a crisis of leadership. The gap between the older and younger leaders is increasing and affecting the movement's strategy.\nThe current crisis within the Brotherhood is likely to continue and escalate given the current circumstances. The critical question now is not whether the movement will break apart or not but rather when.\nOver the past three years, the Brotherhood has been divided into two camps: the old and conservative leaders versus the young and revolutionary members. The latter have gained influence over the movement because of their tendency to confront the regime.\nIn February 2014, a few months after the Brotherhood was designated as a terrorist organisation, the movement witnessed an intense power struggle and divisions over who should lead the movement and which strategy it should follow to respond to regime repression.\nThe new and relatively young leadership formed a committee called \"The High Administrative Committee\" and was led by Mohamed Kamal, a former member of Brotherhood's Guidance Bureau who was assassinated by security forces last October.\nThe new committee claimed leadership over the movement against veteran leaders such as Mahmoud Ezzat, the acting General Guide of the Brotherhood, who is believed to be hiding in Egypt, Mahmoud Hussein, the secretary-general of the movement, and Ibrahim Munir, who was appointed Deputy of the General Guide and has been in London since the late 1980s.\nIn December, the High Administrative Committee was dissolved and the formation of a new Guidance Bureau declared, which was rejected by the old leadership.\nAlso, for the first time in its history, the Brotherhood is divided between internal and external leadership. Senior members who fled to Turkey after the coup have formed a new office called the External Office to run and supervise the Brotherhood's members and activities overseas.\nExiled members of the Brotherhood are also divided between the old and new leadership.

The chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, made it abundantly clear that City were expecting to win multiple honors. This year, next year, and so on. \"The target now is to win every competition we play in,\" said al-Mubarak. \"That is the target, quite simply. It\u2019\u0080\u0099s a high ambition but we have the organization and the squad to get us there\u2026I am saying it with confidence.\"\nOne week ago, City were basking in the glow of the first honor of the season, one they expected to be the first of many. Quadruple talk seemed a little ambitious \u2013 admittedly, the Champions League was a long shot on the back of a frustrating 0-2 first-leg deficit against Barcelona \u2013 but the FA Cup and Premier League both looked totally achievable.\nOne week later, they are digesting an unfathomable result. It barely seemed possible for City to be outmanouvred at home by Wigan, who play their football a devision below them. It was a shuddering blow to be exposed again to a supposedly freak result against the opponent who beat them in the FA Cup final last season.\nIt also puts a new complexion on the week ahead. Where City have been trying to convince themselves that there was no reason they could not inflict a powerhouse result on Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday, now they are under extra pressure. The prospect of slipping out of two competitions in four days sits uncomfortably at a club who so directly in pre-season outlined their ambition to win everything.\nAnd in the background, observing City\u2019\u0080\u0099s body language for signs of weakness, is Jose Mourinho. It is easy to imagine he was cackling like a cartoon villain as he waited for the referee\u2019\u0080\u0099s final whistle to confirm City could not rescue themselves against Wigan. Pellegrini\u2019s side need to make up nine points in the Premier League to catch up with Chelsea. They have the games to do so, but the fixture list looks challenging. They have some complicated assignments away from home: a derby against Manchester United, then Arsenal, then Liverpool, in the run-up to Easter.\nOf course, City still have a fine chance of reclaiming the Premier League trophy, and with Barcelona also stuttering, bouncing back at Camp Nou is not completely out of the question. There will be two wounded animals in the Champions League ring on Wednesday. Tata Martino\u2019\u0080\u0099s lament after losing to Valladolid was pretty comprehensive: \"We completely failed in generating play,\" he said. \"We lacked what makes us Barca: good elaboration in our build-up, finding spaces, breaking through on the wings and having depth.\"\nThis situation is a fascinating test of Pellegrini\u2019\u0080\u0099s mettle. Although he has gained considerable credit and popularity for the refinements he has brought to City\u2019\u0080\u0099s game in a season when he has had to get used to English football, the owners have made it clear they will assess their managers on trophies. For all of Pellegrini\u2019\u0080\u0099s qualities, there is a notable trophy shortage since he came to Europe.\nThis is his tenth season since leaving South American football, and he arrived at City with just the one InterT"}

It helped the company pull in a recent contract with AB Paterson College in Queensland for 1100 Windows 8 devices.

His medical group in Iowa has always scored better than most in the quality reports that Medicare has provided doctors in recent years, he said.\nBut when the government launched a new payment system that will soon apply to all physicians who accept Medicare, Kitchell's McFarland Clinic in Ames didn't win a bonus. In fact, there are few winners: Out of 1,010 large physician groups that the government evaluated, just 14 are getting payment increases this year, according to Medicare. Losers also are scarce. Only 11 groups will be getting reductions for low quality or high spending.\n\"We performed well, but not enough for the bonus,\" said Kitchell, a neurologist. \"My sense of disappointment here is really significant. Why even bother?\"\nWithin three years, the Obama administration wants quality of care to be considered in allocating $9 of every $10 Medicare pays directly to providers to treat the elderly and disabled. One part of that effort is well underway: revising hospital payments based on excess readmissions, patient satisfaction and other quality measures. Expanding this approach to physicians is touchier, as many are suspicious of the government judging them and reluctant to share performance metrics that Medicare requests.\n\"Without having any indication that this is improving patient care, they just keep piling on additional requirements,\" said Mark Donnell, an anesthesiologist in Silver City, N.M. Donnell said he only reports a third of the quality measures he is expected to. \"So much of what's done in medicine is only done to meet the requirements,\" he said.\nThe new financial incentive for doctors, called a physician value-based payment modifier, allows the federal government to boost or lower the amount it reimburses doctors based on how they score on quality measures and how much their patients cost Medicare. How doctors rate this year will determine payments for more than 900,000 physicians by 2017.\nMedicare is easing doctors into the program, applying it this year only to medical groups with at least 100 health professionals, including doctors, nurses, speech-language pathologists and occupational therapists. Next year, the program expands Medicare to groups of 10 or more health professionals. In 2017, all remaining doctors who take Medicare \u2014 along with about 360,000 other health professionals \u2014 will be included. By early in the next decade, 9% of the payments Medicare makes to doctors and other professionals would be at risk under a bill that the House of Representatives passed in March.\nThe quality metrics used to judge doctors vary by specialty. One test looks at how consistently doctors keep an accurate list of all the drugs patients were taking. Others track the rate of complications after cataract surgery, say, or whether patients received recommended treatments for particular cancers.\nThere are more than 250 quality measures. Groups and doctors must report a selection \u2014 generally nine, which they choose \u2014 or else be automatically penalized. This year, 319 large medical groups are having their reimbursements reduced by 1% because they did not meet Medicare's reporting standards.\nPhysicians who do report their quality data fear the measures are sometimes misguided, usually a hassle, and may encourage doctors to avoid poorer and sicker patients, who tend to have more trouble controlling asthma or staying on antidepressants, for instance.\nLeanne Chrisman-Khawam,"}

Possibly whole crew dead \u2026 I die.\"\nThis was supposedly the final chilling SOS message from on board the Dutch vessel the SS Ourang Medan, which mysteriously went missing in 1948 while sailing the Strait of Malacca during clear weather and calm seas.\nWhen the crew from the nearby Silver Star ship answered the distress call and boarded the stricken vessel, they were reportedly greeted with a nightmare. The entire ship was littered with corpses \u2014 including a dog \u2014 with terrified expressions frozen on their faces.\nEyeballs bulged from their sockets, mouths were wide open as if in the midst of screams, and arms were outstretched as if they had been reaching for something. Oddly, the bodies showed no signs of any injuries.\nThe boat was to be towed into port but a fire broke out, leading to an explosion that sunk it.\nHowever, there's a twist to this story: To this day nobody has found a shred of evidence the boat had even existed, and it has become one of the most controversial maritime legends in history.\nJust what happened to the ship \u2014 if there really was one \u2014 remains a mystery. While some historians argue the incident never happened due to the fact there were no logs on the Silver Star detailing the rescue attempt, conspiracy theorists believe several countries worked together to cover it up.\nBesides, why didn't the coast guard report what had happened until May 1954?\nOthers theorise noxious gas bubbled up from fissures in the seabed and engulfed the boat, while some even blamed the supernatural.\nAn eyebrow-raising \"top secret\" CIA document about the incident, which wasn't released to the public until 2013, pondered whether it may have involved \"something from the unknown\".\nThe letter was penned by C.H. Marck Jr, assistant to the Director of the CIA Allen Dulles, in 1959 and addressed to an unknown recipient.\n\"I feel sure that the SS Ourang Medan holds the answer to many of these aeroplane accidents and unsolved mysteries of the sea,\" he wrote.\nMarck then made reference to \"fiery spheres\" of destruction before concluding: \"The enchanting sea, what terrifying 'secret' does it hold? I feel sure that the SS Ourang Medan also holds the answer to this 'secret'.\"\nUltimately, there are many unanswered questions that remain about the ship, and it seems unlikely we will ever know what really happened.\nThe scene of the \"ghost ship\" horror is just as fascinating and sinister as the legend itself.

It makes it tougher. These are all very tough calls.\"\nBowman had already collected an RBI in the most painful way possible -- getting hit by a pitch -- before hustling to reach in the ninth. He stole second base and reached third when the throw went into the outfield and moments later scored the decisive run on a sacrifice fly by Austin Call.\nCall was also released Tuesday night.\n\"We tell these guys, 'Make it so we can't ignore you,'\" Pinto said after the game. \"(Corey) Dempster is a good example. He's found his way on base every game. That's hard to ignore.\"\nDempster reached base four times in Tuesday's game.\nAnother player who has been impossible to ignore in the exhibition portion of the season is rookie second baseman Cletis Avery, who had another run-scoring hit Tuesday.\n\"He's been pretty strong since he got here,\" Pinto said. \"We had worked him out in a tryout back in the fall and really liked him then.

Kelly McDonald, an English major at the University of Utah, agrees.\nThe answer to this question, however, depends on how you feel about books or reading in general. Those who enjoy the experience of watching a movie or who lean toward the visual, will have similar visceral and emotional reactions to the events played out on a screen.\nThese individuals read books for the characterization \u2014 or just more characters, in some cases \u2014 and a slower or more drawn out development of themes, because the medium is more relaxed about how long it takes to tell the story. For example, the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series is seven books, each several hundred pages long. The length of this series and the number of pages in each book gives J.K. Rowling the time to flesh out the Wizarding World and offer a fairly large role to the poltergeist, Peeves. The movies are \u2014 roughly \u2014 two and a half hours each, however. In order to portray all the plot points relevant to the central plot of the series as a whole, Peeves had to be taken out of the movies along with the well-loved character Winky.\nBecause movies have the ability to show and not tell, we\u2019re able to better visualize the worlds talked about in books and understand non-verbal aspects of relationships between characters, the world and the plot.\nSeeing is believing when it comes to books and movies, but only your personal preferences will determine if the book really was better."}

Most troubling about Thursday in the Farmers Insurance Open was he spoke only a week ago of feeling \"great\" physically, and this was only his second event of the year.\nHe blamed this one on the weather, which caused his \"glutes\" to shut off.\nWoods walked off the course after 11 holes on the North Course at Torrey Pines, citing tightness in his lower back from standing around for more than an hour in the cool Pacific air during a fog delay in the morning. He never looked comfortable, and Billy Horschel noticed it right away. Woods was reaching for his back at the turn. Horschel tried to help by picking up the tee for Woods on their 10th hole and the ball from the cup when Woods made birdie.\n\"I was ready to go,\" Woods said. \"I had a good warmup session the first time around. Then we stood out here and I got cold, and everything started deactivating again. And it's frustrating that I just can't stay activated. That's just kind of the way it is.\"\nWoods now has gone 12 straight PGA Tour events without a top 10, dating to his runner-up finish in The Barclays in 2013 when back pain dropped him to his knees. This was his first round since a career-high 82 last week in the Phoenix Open to tie for last with a club pro and miss the cut by 12 shots.\n\"It's tough to see a guy I look up to, a guy I consider a friend, to have issues with spasms,\" Horschel said. \"It's tough to see him go, but he was in quite a bit of pain.\"\nNicholas Thompson had an 8-under 64 on the North Course and had a one-shot lead over Michael Thompson when play was suspended by darkness. Brooks Koepka, coming off his victory in the Phoenix Open, had a 66 on the North. The best score on the tougher South Course belonged to Jhonnatan Vegas, who shot 67.\nDustin Johnson, playing for the first time since his six-month leave for \"personal challenges,\" holed out for eagle on No. 4 on the South Course as his lone highlight.

Many other critics complained that you don\u2019t need to learn to build an engine in order to drive a car.\nThis time around Slate\u2019s Matthew Yglesias complained that far too many people in the U.S. don\u2019t know how to read English, and that spreading actual literacy should be a higher priority than spreading code literacy.\nI\u2019m still on the side of pushing code literacy to as many people as possible. If everyone in the country were likely to spend a significant portion of their waking hours using faucets, and Congress was likely to debate bills that had great ramifications for the future of faucet users, then I probably would say that everyone should at least learn the basics of plumbing. And I agree with Douglas Rushkoff, author of Program or be Programmed, that not knowing how to code is more analogous to not only not being able to drive, but being blind folded while you ride. And while we don\u2019t teach all of our high schoolers how to build engines, we do generally teach them the basics of physics and internal combustion as freshman. Likewise, we can\u2019t expect to teach everyone enough programming to build Facebook, but we can make sure as many people as possible have a general idea of how it was built.\nBut I think we can all agree that learning programming shouldn\u2019t detract from other educational objectives, like reading, writing and math. Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t have to. In fact, it can be combined with other skills.\nMathematics is the most obvious subject to combine with computer programming. Conrad Wolfram \u2014 Stephen Wolfram\u2019s brother \u2014 is one of the most radical proponents. His organization, Computerbasedmath.org, calls for students to stop doing rote memorization of steps and focus instead on using computers to explore the concepts that underpin those steps.\n\u201cWhy get students emulating what computers do so much better (computing) rather than concentrate on imaginative thinking, analysis and problem-solving that students ought to be able to do so much better even than today\u2019s computers?\u201d he wrote in a blog post announcing a partnership with Estonia to rewrite the country statistics and probability coursework. But you don\u2019t need to go that far to add a few programming exercises to an algebra or geometry course.\nMeanwhile, economics is an elective at most high schools, but it\u2019s probably something more students should learn and it\u2019s another subject that could incorporate some programming lessons. There are already books on programming for college level biology and physics courses, and they could be adapted to fit high school level courses as well.\nBut it\u2019s not just math and science that can be combined with programming. A class that used SuperCollider or PureData to teach music theory could be a fun and interactive way to learn both programming and music.

In retrospect, could the bacteria lurking at the bottom of your grocery bags put your health at risk?\nSamantha Stine of Vinton has been using the same set of bags for almost four months now, and she's never once thought about washing them.\n\"I have a total of five bags,\" said Stine. \"There's no odor from them, so I would say they're clean.\"\nTo find out for sure, WMBF News' sister station KPLC collected a total of nine bags from area shoppers and took them to the McNeese biology lab to have them swabbed for bacteria.\nOut of the nine bags, three of them had more than three microorganisms forming from the bacteria in the bags.\nWe also tested a brand new bag, that came out with no bacteria - meaning the bacteria had formed from the groceries.\n\"It may have been from what was put in the bag, or it may be that the bag was just older and microorganisms from the air settled into there. It's kind of hard to say,\" said Dr. Jay Comeaux, asst. professor of microbiology at McNeese State University.\nAlthough Comeaux said the bacteria is rather mild this run time around, next time it could be a different story.\n\"There is the potential that there could be microtobial contamination from the bags to our foods, \" said Comeaux \"And we just have to keep a very close eye on that to make sure that it doesn't happen.\"\nTo keep a close eye on it, it's often a good idea to designate a certain bag for each type of food, and if you must bag different foods together, be sure to wrap your meats and veggies with a separate plastic bag to avoid any cross contamination.\nStine's bags were some of the cleanest in the study. And what was her secret?\n\"I don't really have a secret,\" said Stine. \"All I can say is that they are clean because I pay attention to if there's any spills in them or something.\"\nTammy Hassenpflug is another shopper whose bags we swabbed.\nHer bags came out with some colonies of bacteria, but still they were relatively clean.\nHassenpflug said she washes her bags frequently and she also uses something else to keep them clean.\n\"I keep this antibacterial thing in my car to spray in my bags each time I reuse them,\" said Hassenpflug. \"I think you've just got to use some common sense and you shouldn't have any issues.\"\nSome other tips for keeping your bags clean is to always hang them and let them after you wash them to let them dry to keep bacteria from growing in them.\nIn conclusion they're a great thing to use, just remember to take the right precautions."}

All three are outspoken critics of Obama's $787 billion plan to jolt the economy through investment in education, health care and transportation, and have said they are likely to reject some of the stimulus funding.\nJindal and Sanford are considered likely presidential candidates in 2012, but have demurred when asked about their future endeavors.\nOn the other side were the coastal moderates, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have embraced Obama's stimulus plan as an important, if imperfect, means of bringing their states out of the grip of recession.\nSchwarzenegger, a native of Austria, is precluded by law from running for president, but Crist is thought to be a serious prospect.\nIn the middle is another likely 2012 contender, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who has criticized the stimulus bill but nonetheless plans to accept the money for hisstate. Pawlenty, whom John McCain nearly chose as his running mate last year, speaks openly of the need for the GOP to modernize and attract more minorities and women while putting a conservative stamp on issues like health care and alternative energy.\nObama hosted the governors at the White House on Sunday night in his administration's first formal dinner. He said all governors, despite party affiliation, need to work with Washington to repair the economy.\nNot present at the governor's meeting was Alaska's Sarah Palin, arguably the Republican party's biggest star. Palin, who joined McCain on the GOP ticket last year, is viewed as a top prospect for 2012 -- but that doesn't mean other governors are standing by in the meantime.\nSanford, 48, the stimulus bill's most ardent opponent among governors, acknowledged Sunday that there \"may not be much of a national appetite right now\" for his strict anti-spending philosophy.\nIn an interview, he said it was all part of his commitment to bedrock conservative values, which he believes are the key to a Republican resurgence.\n\"There's one school of thought that says the way you grow out of the wilderness is by expanding the tent, appeal to Hispanics, to women, use technology.

In 2018, the Garden State established the Clean Energy Act, enabled a community solar program, and under Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s leadership rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).\nWhile these initiatives are important, New Jersey\u2019s clean energy revolution will be complete only when we ensure that all New Jerseyans \u2013 including lower income and disadvantaged populations \u2013 benefit as well. So, policymakers, how can we ensure that New Jersey\u2019s lower income communities benefit from this emerging clean energy economy? One simple way is through robust and dedicated funding for lower income rooftop and community solar projects.\nWhy is this important? As everyone who lives here knows, New Jersey is expensive, and we shoulder one of the nation\u2019s highest electricity rates. Nationally, low-income households spend 8.2 percent of their income on utility bills \u2013 a proportion nearly three times higher than that facing wealthier households. And 10 percent of New Jersey households fall below the poverty line. These residents get hit by a double whammy \u2013 both a high cost of living and the high cost of electricity. We can design residential and community solar programs that ensure access for lower income residents and change the calculus to make a meaningful difference in their lives.\nThey wanted to go green, but didn't want to lay out $58K for a traditional conversion. The solution cost nothing.\nNow is the time to make sure this happens. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is considering a new solar incentive program with roll-out plans for 2020. While targeted incentives are vital for healthy solar industry growth, the current efforts lack a direct focus on lower income residents who struggle under the greatest burden. Examples, like the one in Connecticut, show how funding carve-outs for lower income residents can be game-changing. There, lower income families access solar leasing options, saving them at times over $1,500 a year when paired with energy efficiency upgrades.\nOther states, like Massachusetts and Illinois, provide direct financial support for lower income solar projects or a higher incentive value for projects serving lower income residents, to make energy affordable for all while greening the environment. We can do the same here in New Jersey.\nOne potential new source of funds for this is the RGGI program. We must start by recognizing a few facts: New Jersey\u2019s lower income residents suffer disproportionate exposure to carbon, sulfur, and mercury pollution that come from burning fossil fuels. They cause heart disease, asthma attacks, respiratory diseases and even cancer. Taxpayer and family costs for these are enormous. Agencies slated to receive RGGI funds can target lower income communities for clean energy projects - and the health and economic benefits they deliver.\nDirect grants or loans or rebates for installing rooftop solar or participating in community solar projects make economic, not just moral sense. This aligns with Governor Murphy\u2019s Executive Order 23, directing state agencies to target and assist communities disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental hazards and climate change.\nThis targeted clean energy will also increase economic activity and job creation, reduce harmful emissions, and lower energy and health cost burdens for those who bear them the most \u2013 our neighbors struggling to make ends meet.\nFor too long, lower income communities have been left out of the state\u2019s clean energy economy, but we can change that. Clean energy should be within everyone\u2019s reach. Focused and dedicated investment can meet our shared goal of a green Garden State for all.\nMarty Johnson is founder and CEO of Isles, Inc., an urban sustainable development organization.

Does that make any sense?\n[V]irtually all immigrants to the U.S. come from countries where per capita carbon emissions are far lower than the U.S. level. By way of comparison, the average American was responsible for 17 metric tons of carbon emissions in 2011. Per capita carbon emissions in neighboring Mexico that same year were a mere 3.9, and the rate for India was an even lower 1.7, or one-tenth of the U.S. level. When an Indian moves to the United States, she earns a much higher income, and her productivity is likely to go up as well.\nOne could argue that this is of no concern, as what really matters most is that moving to the United States will allow this Indian immigrant to better her life, regardless of the consequences for the climate. This view strikes me as reasonable enough. But of course something like this view would also tell us that there is nothing objectionable about India making greater use of its coal resources to raise the standard of living for the billion or so Indians who won\u2019t or can\u2019t make that same journey themselves.\nEven if the U.S. were to halve its per capita carbon emissions from 2011 levels, we\u2019d still be emitting far more carbon per capita than, say, the British. So what matters more \u2014 the climate crisis or the (supposed) moral imperative of greater international labor mobility? If you take the climate crisis seriously, I\u2019m afraid you might have to conclude that the United States should immediately close its borders, to prevent foreigners from being seduced into our gas-guzzling ways.\n[L]ess-skilled immigration is associated with quite substantial increases in 90/10 and 90/50 income inequality (that is, it appears to increase the gap between the 90th and 10th income percentiles as well as the 90th and the 50th), according to a recent study by the social scientists Ping Xu, James C. Garand, and Ling Zhu.\nOne could square this particular circle by disavowing any interest in domestic economic inequality, and instead focusing solely on global economic inequality. Yet such a focus would lead to an entirely different set of policy priorities, as it is not at all clear why a government focused on reducing global economic inequality would devote vast sums of taxpayer dollars to, say, Medicaid instead of channeling these resources towards low-cost, high-impact interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and other impoverished regions.\nI don\u2019t see any Democratic politicians advocating such an international reorientation of priorities.\n1) They know that the purported threat of global warming is absurdly over-hyped, but think the scare is a good pretext to seize control over more of the American economy.\n2) They know that income and wealth inequality, to the extent they are considered excessive, cannot be remedied by any plausible government policies, and in fact are made \u201cworse\u201d by their own policies. But they think the issue nevertheless can garner votes for Democrats.\n3) They know that increased low-skill immigration will contribute to income"}

The respondents comprised of senior executives responsible for talent decision making within their respective organisations, ranging from CHRO\u2019s, CEO\u2019s, HR Directors to Heads of HR functions such as learning and development, recruitment, organisational development and performance management.\n\u201cThis is our third year surveying our talent leader community and it\u2019s clear that the rate of change has accelerated considerably over that period as the workforce is being impacted by augmentation and the continued tightening of the labour market.\u201d As the talent crisis deepens, employers are increasingly widening their supply chain of talent to include contingent workers and investing in technology to ensure productivity\u201d. With 67 per cent of employers investing in automation to improve company performance, it\u2019s expected that 34 per cent will redeploy talent as a result this year.\nAs the talent landscape changes, organisational structures have become more agile and are more reliant on collaboration amongst a digital, transient workforce, with 69 per cent of employers expecting employees to spend more time on collaboration, work based social media and messaging platforms in the coming year. In contrast respondants replied that only 49 per cent of leadership are seen to facilitate true collaboration. Creating a collaborative culture, requires investment in rich connectivity that allows immediate and active engagement amongst increasingly dispersed teams, to perform.\nWhen asked to rank priorities for the year ahead, attracting and retaining talent came out on top, challenges that have remained consistent as crucial over the last three years. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that recruitment and retention remain key priorities, forcing employers to look overseas and to contingent labour pools to meet demand.\u201d There is growing pressure on costs with 75 per cent of employees expecting a pay rise in 2019 and employers stating that 61 per cent are likely to receive and average of 9 per cent increase this year. \u201cThis level of wage inflation is unsustainable and is slowly eroding our labour competitiveness, driving employers to seek efficiencies through technology and to expand on-demand labour such as freelancers and gig workers.\u201d Interestingly employers still rely on traditional CVs ahead of social profiles as a preferred method to assess talent when recruiting. Confidence amongst employers remain high, even in light of economic uncertainties, with 64 per cent of employers expecting no impact on 2019 headcount in a no-deal Brexit scenario and 23 per cent of respondents anticipating an increase.\nThe traditional CV is seen as the most impactful way to assess new hires, followed by competency interview and cultural fit. Social profiles ranks as the seventh most impactful of 12 listed.\nNiamh O'Beirne: \"the move towards a non-traditional future workforce can be challenging\"\nThe ever-intensifying war for talent is beginning to tighten its grip on organisations in Ireland. With the Irish economy heading towards full employment, attraction and retention are now the top priorities not just of HR leaders, but across the C-Suite. Employers are reacting by implementing innovative initiatives that boost their competitiveness, helping copper-fasten their existing talent pool, and increasing their ability to attract new people through their doors.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that scarcity of supply of talent is driving salaries upwards, but we are also seeing a real drive towards alternative and innovative solutions to filling the talent gap, including increased use of contingent labour and investment in automation.\nThe move towards a non-traditional future workforce can be challenging.

{"idx": "34797", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: What Is the Difference Between Gross Profit and Sales Revenue?\nA company's sales revenue (also referred to as \"net sales\") is the income that it receives from the sale of goods or services. For example, if a company charges $300 for a TV and sells 1000 TVs, its sales revenue is $300,000.\nOn the other hand, gross profit is the income that a company makes from its sales after the cost of the goods and operating expenses have been subtracted. This includes expenses that depend on the company's sales \u2013 such as materials, labor costs, equipment, sales commissions, and depreciation that results from production -- all variable costs. It does not include fixed expenses such as rent, insurance, administrative costs, and other expenses that don't directly depend on sales.\nUsing the above data, in order to calculate the gross profit we need to subtract the cost of goods sold as well as the depreciation and amortization expenses.\nBy calculating a company's gross profit, you can use the information to calculate the gross profit margin, which is equal to the gross profit divided by the revenue. This is a good way to determine how efficiently a company is producing its products compared to the rest of its industry, and to its own historical performance.\nSo, in the case of our Apple example, the gross profit margin would be equal to $70.5 billion divided by $182.8 billion, or 38.6%.\nBe careful not to confuse gross profit with operating profit, which is a better indicator of the overall profitability of a company. In addition to accounting for the cost of goods, operating profit subtracts the company's operating expenses and expenses associated with developing new products. When evaluating the profitability of a business, bear in mind that it is entirely possible for a company to produce strong gross profits, but to still operate at a loss because of high fixed expenses."}

With only a few hand-cut trails, boats were the primary mode of transportation for the first residents. The earliest tourists sailed to Palm Beach for winter fishing and hunting long before Henry Flagler brought the railroad.\nMy great-grandfather George Potter had a double-masted schooner. My grandfather owned one of Johnny Rybovich\u2019s first sport fishing cruiser conversions. The boat my father and his partners owned was in charter service. They occasionally used it themselves and wrote the losses off their income taxes \u2014 hence the tongue-in-cheek ritual about poor people making boat payments.\nBoating of this caliber is still very much a part of Palm Beach culture, but it has ceased being a run-of-the-mill pastime. A waterfront home, deepwater dock and state-of-the-art sport fisherman can only be aspired to by people who view millions as a negligible expense.\nFortunately, for the yacht brokers at the upcoming boat show, Palm Beach has its fair share of such residents. Still, if it were just a matter of selling a few yachts, I doubt if we would even have the event.\nThe boat show attracts large crowds for other reasons. Most attendees have fun just walking around looking at the exceptionally designed and painstakingly constructed watercraft thinking, \u201cSomeday, when I win the lottery \u2026\u201d Even landlubbers are seduced by the romance of the sea.\nI\u2019ve done several cartoons about the Palm Beach International Boat Show over the years. Some were about how it snarls traffic on roadways and bridges by occupying Flagler Drive for three weeks. But more often, my boat show cartoons have been about the fantasy of shucking the petty annoyances of humdrum landlubber existence for the boating life.\nOf course, reality does not match the fantasy. Life on the water is more complicated than on land. I spent too much time repairing dry rot, oiling teak and refurbishing my dad\u2019s boat to have any desire for one of my own. Nevertheless, the lure of those gleaming hulls is not easily resisted. For most of us, a visit to the boat show is a great Walter Mitty day."}
{"idx": "34802", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Tobacco is a major preventable cause of death and disease globally. It is a threat to development, environment, society and economy. Many countries have strengthened their tobacco control legislation, guided by the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).\nThe tobacco industry\u2019s influence has been a major roadblock, subverting the implementation of public health policies across the world including India. The industry\u2019s tactics involve sophisticated strategies, including litigation, interfering in policy development, circumventing law, discrediting science and constructing a positive social image through corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Tobacco control policies in India have witnessed these influences for every strong policy measure notified and enforced ever since the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) was enforced in 2004. Despite these challenges, India has emerged as a global tobacco control leader, with the third largest graphic warning labels in the world and recent evidence of a 17% relative reduction in tobacco use prevalence in the country.\nSeveral litigations have been filed by the industry allies against the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) challenging COTPA and its notified rules.\nWhile the industry loses most of these lawsuits that challenge government\u2019s tobacco control measures, more than 100 cases are still pending in various courts in the country. The intent of these litigations is to delay enforcement of strong tobacco control measures. A recent review of internal documents of Philip Morris from 2014 mentions \u201cRoadblocks are as important as solutions\u201d. In India, the tobacco industry and its allies challenged issues, ranging from prohibition of smoking in public places to larger health warnings and the advertising ban \u2013 the most recent challenge being the hosting of the WHO Conference of Parties (COP7) in India.\nInformation received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act revealed that the tobacco industry repeatedly sent representations to the health ministry to withdraw the notification mandating large-sized pictorial health warnings (PHW) on tobacco product packages in 2014. Subsequently, a parliamentary committee on subordinate legislation debated and delayed this notification for almost two years. Public health experts deposed before this committee to present scientific evidence on the causal association between tobacco and cancer. Despite these interferences and litigations from the tobacco industry, MOHFW enforced 85% pictorial warning on tobacco packages from April 1, 2016. Media also investigated the issue of conflict of interest in case of some members of the committee. India currently does not have any specific law on implementing Article 5.3 of FCTC, which states that parties to the WHO FCTC in setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control shall act to protect these polices from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry, in accordance with national law. Draft guidelines to implement Article 5.3 exist at the centre and is being reviewed in various government departments. Some states like Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab and Mizoram have already progressed and adopted the guidelines on Article 5.3.\nThe COP7 meeting in India witnessed 500 members of farmers association, protesting outside the conference venue and financing an outdoor advertising campaign, demanding their recognition and participation in COP7 as important stakeholders. The Federation of All India Farmers Association (FAIFA) is now actively filing PILs to challenge the government and is becoming an intervener in existing litigations.\nAgainst these odds, India\u2019s National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP), which emphasises on effective enforcement of COTPA, "}

{"idx": "34812", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Last December 7th, Aztec High School experienced a horrible and tragic event when a young man who had attended our school more than five years earlier walked on our campus and took the lives of Casey Jordan Marquez and Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Fernandez. The active shooter event lasted a little more than seven minutes; the shooter took his own life seconds before the police arrived on scene. Our heroic local police department responded to our call for help within four minutes and emergency responders from all corners of San Juan County, N.M., assisted with the subsequent release of lockdown, campus evacuation, and reunification with families.\nIn the subsequent year, our local sheriff\u2019s department and the FBI have conducted investigations looking at the crime from numerous angles. From these investigations, and from our shared perspective, the leaders in our district have learned much about what carried us through that day.\nFor instance, we know that the shooter planned a far worse death count. Casey and Paco innocently surprised the gunman as he was preparing to carry out his plan; those first shots alerted staff to secure classrooms and signal a campuswide lockdown. Following lockdown training and radio communication prevented the gunman\u2019s attempt to enter two classrooms.\nIn short, our staff was heroic. And while our fidelity to protocol was not perfect, training and communication saved lives that day. Even an imperfect recall of training is better than not having trained at all. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll ever look at even the most routine safety training with a lax perspective again.\nAs I write this essay, our student leadership, staff, and I are in the middle of planning how the school will structure the one-year anniversary of our tragedy. We will never forget the precious lives lost that day or the heroic response from our community. As a whole, the kids have been resilient and inspiring in the way they have begun to use their collective voice to call for unity and mutual support as a way through our ongoing recovery. From a principal\u2019s personal perspective, I have far more advice to share on what has gotten me through the past 12 months of community rebuilding than I would ever be able to say about that day a year ago.\nI have learned that after a tragedy, a principal needs to be prepared to deal with a wide variety of opinions and perspectives on how the school should respond and change in the wake of what has happened.\nHow does one lead a school when strong voices and weak voices in the community all need to be heard long before a plan is put into place? How does one deal with the reality that some decisions are not going to be left to the site leadership alone? How does a leader deal with his or her own self-doubt while seeking to listen to and empower others who are just as traumatized by events? Three very personal lessons come to mind that I can share with my professional peers.\nLesson one: Remember that you\u2019re not in it alone. Delegating power and releasing control are traits that principals often should nurture. The daily perspectives we deal with are already numerous and most principals I\u2019ve met are pretty good at leading as coalition-builders. After a school tragedy, it is natural that the building principal is someone that people want to check in with about big decisions on the school\u2019s response. Make sure to regularly connect with others in your sphere of influence and chain of command to hear crucial perspectives for when your input is requested or your leadership needed.\nLesson two: Work to keep the kids front and center. Support a clear structure for listening to the kids\u2019 wants and needs as decisions are being made, and be prepared to incorporate student voices that feel left out. Just like the adults in"}

Both of these will enable players to progress further, unlock new cards, and get better. In the end making this highly addicting game more enjoyable. With that in mind here we\u2019ll be going over some tips to level up faster in Clash Royale.\nI see a lot of questions about how to level up, how to get Epic or legendary cards, or even how to reach higher arenas. Sadly there are different answers for all of those. That said, leveling up will help gamers achieve all of the above.\nOver the last year Clash Royale has continued to be one of the most popular mobile games on the planet. It\u2019s played by millions, gets updated monthly, and has a lot to offer. And while spending real money is the easiest way to get better, it isn\u2019t the only way.\nWhether you don\u2019t have enough time to play a few hours a day, or can\u2019t afford to buy tons of cards or special offers, we have you covered. Obviously the main aspect of the game is to unlock all of the cards or troops, then level them up in order to win battles.\nHowever, in order to get to the Jungle Arena or Hog Mountain you need to level up. Most need to be really good, buy cards from the shop, or continue to progress before they unlock Hog Mountain and reach 3,000 trophies. Which for those that don\u2019t know, is a key point in the game. This is where Legendary cards are unlocked and available to buy in the shop. These are the tips you need to know in order to level up fast in Clash Royale.\nWhen it comes to leveling up and progressing in Clash Royale everything rotates around two things. Well, mainly experience, but also gold. Players need to save gold to upgrade cards, donate often, and continue to earn experience points. Eventually you\u2019ll become a level 10, 11 and beyond.\nThese are the main ways to get more experience points.\nJoin a Clan: First things first, join a clan so you can donate cards and receive donations. This will ensure you level up faster. The bigger the clan, the better.\nFree Chests: Pay extremely close attention to the free chests, and sign-in to collect them at least twice a day. Even if you can\u2019t play daily, fire up the game just for the free chests. One appears every four hours, and it can hold two at a time. Once in the morning for two, and again at night for two more. These chests give you gems, gold and cards. The more cards and gold for upgrades, the more experience points.\nAchievements and Clan Chests: There are a few achievements that can be earned in Clash Royale, all of which reward you with gold, gems or experience points. At the end of the day anything that gets you gold will help players level up faster. Clan chests have huge rewards if high enough, and will make progression speed up drastically.\nBattle Battle Battle: The easiest way to earn tons of gold daily and more cards for leveling up, is to battle. Do as many as you can per day, and always have chests in your cycle being unlocked.\nIn the most recent March Clash Royale update the developers added challenges and Clan battle chests to your daily Crown Chest achievement. So now every battle counts. If you don\u2019t want to lose trophies in multiplayer do challenges to continue earning gold and leveling up.\nAnother few tips can be found in this helpful video that explains playing"}

That's about 20 more than the duo of Philip Rivers and Keenan Allen, who also happened to be a popular pick because of the pricing \u2013 more so for Rivers. When you add in the fact that Willie Snead (cheaper/savings receiver) outdid Antonio Brown, you have a great week for the high priced option. Even without the Snead-Brown difference, there still would have been a big gap.\nOn FanDuel, we saw a boost but not only was it one-third the improvement of DraftKings, on a percentage basis, it was less than half as good (7.5% to 16.9%). Nevertheless, just as with DraftKings, the high priced quarterback team performed better thanks mainly to Ryan and Julio. The difference in improvement wasn't as big though with only about an 11 point gap versus over 20 for DK. The savings at the receiver replacement wasn't as big either with Steve Smith coming close to Brandon Marshall. Overall, it was a better day but still not exceptionally impactful.\nDraftKings got a boost in Week 9 and is up to 92.68 more points and 11.59 per game. The standard deviation is 21.9 per week with it all equaling a 7.7 percent improvement in average scores. With FanDuel, we've only scored 29.12 more total, which is just 3.64 per week. The standard deviation is 10.31 over there with a mere 3.0 percent increase in average scores.\nA 7.7 percent boost is mildly significant, so we're trending towards high priced quarterbacks being a worthwhile strategy on DraftKings.

As a result, the FDA mandated a \u201cblack box\u201d warning about Avandia\u2019s risks, the Veterans Administration removed the drug from its formulary, and the advocacy group Public Citizen petitioned to ban it.\nHowever, just three weeks after the Cleveland Clinic report\u2019s release, GlaxoSmithKline researchers reported midterm results from their massive randomized trial of Avandia\u2019s effects on heart health, known as the RECORD study. \u201cThere was no evidence of any increase in death from either cardiovascular causes or all causes,\u201d they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The final results confirming Avandia\u2019s safety were published in the Lancet last year. Shortly afterward, GSK asked the FDA to remove much of the prior \u201cblack box\u201d warning, though the FDA ultimately refused.\nBut all along, several FDA officials had viewed GSK\u2019s data less charitably. Last month, a 135-page agency memo discovered almost a dozen patients whose cardiac complications were omitted\u2014possibly by honest mistakes, perhaps not\u2014from the study results by company-paid researchers. As a result, FDA investigator Thomas Marciniak concluded, the RECORD trial \u201ccannot provide any reassurances\u201d about Avandia. Furthermore, FDA researchers scanned tens of thousands of Medicare Part D claims data from 2006-09 and found that Avandia users have more strokes, heart attacks, and deaths than users of Actos, a competing drug.\nThere are a few notable points here. First, the FDA\u2019s investigations of Avandia\u2019s possible risks appear deep, scientifically rigorous, and dogged. (See their complete reports here.) Second, the data around Avandia are so mind-bendingly complex and open to interpretation that the American Heart Association called for more studies while the American Diabetes Association advised against taking Avandia. Even given the new GSK disclosures, the FDA\u2019s Avandia panel sent a very mixed message yesterday, since roughly the same proportion of the 33 members voted to ban the drug outright as voted to continue its sales without any major new restrictions.\nThis leads us to the real danger of the Avandia affair. In our efforts to better police clinical research, we may inadvertently create more and more clinical trials asking largely pointless questions.\nFew people talk about the broader problem with the Avandia studies: The goal in diabetes care is to normalize blood-sugar levels, which theoretically prevents kidney and retinal damage (so-called \u201cmicrovascular\u201d damage) and also stops heart attacks and strokes (so-called \u201cmacrovascular\u201d damage). But treating high sugar levels doesn\u2019t really seem to help prevent heart attacks.\nIn the late 1990s, British studies using generic metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin to lower blood-sugar levels showed no significant reductions in heart attacks and cardiac deaths among Type 2 diabetics. In 2008, the ACCORD trial showed that"}

It was set abroad somewhere, they had been caught with drugs I think, were being held in jail while they were facing the death penalty, and just about the entire piece was shot in the cell where they were being held.\nSo basically it was them talking to each other, a guard, and the people who visited them. Which may sound a little dull, but obviously the stakes were high: would they face the death penalty? Could they get off?\nEventually it became clear that the answers were a) yes and b) no, respectively, so there was much drama with diplomats, appeals, worried relatives and more.\nAs avenues closed one of them in particular got more and more panic-stricken.

He was 21. Browne\u2019s death inspired one of The Beatles\u2019 most popular songs, A Day in the Life. It was Browne who, in John Lennon\u2019s visceral prose, \u201cblew his mind out in a car\u201d.\nBrowne is a well-known figure, and not just because of being the subject of a Beatles song.

She was born the youngest of two sisters in Surrey, and was modelling in London by her teenage years. She was catapulted into the Chelsea village, where everyone knew everyone, and the car crash with Browne happened when she was just 18.\nAllegedly, the chivalrous Browne swerved the car so that he would take the impact and Potier would survive. She was shocked but unscathed. Her next boyfriend was The Rolling Stones\u2019 Brian Jones, and she moved into his house in Sussex where he drowned in his swimming pool.\nAfter Jones\u2019 death, Potier got together with Robert Ho, a student at the London School of Business.

When Sarah was just two years old, the couple died in a car crash while on holiday in Portugal.\nScanned photograph of Robert Ho and Suki Potier.

Ten states have asked to make this change, and the administration has given the greenlight to the first\u2014Kentucky.\nWhat will the requirement mean for older adults, younger people with disabilities, or their family caregivers? In general, older Medicaid recipients (starting between the ages of 50 and 65, depending on the state) would be exempt from the work requirement\u2014as would children under 19 and pregnant women. Thus, an 85 year old widow with dementia will not have to get a job in order to keep her nursing home benefits.\nBut after that, it gets murky. The new guidelines, issued by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) give states broad flexibility in how they\u2019d impose these new requirements.\n\u201cWe look forward to working with states interested in testing innovative approaches to promote work and other community engagement, including approaches that make participation a condition of eligibility or coverage, among working-age, non-pregnant adult Medicaid beneficiaries who qualify for Medicaid on a basis other than a disability\u2026.States are in the best position to determine which approaches are most likely to succeed\u2026.Exemptions may include, but are not limited to age, disability, responsibility for a dependent, participation in a drug addiction or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation program, or another state-specified reason.\nThis language is extremely broad. For example, what is a disability? Many people are too sick to work but have not met the formal definition of disabled. The Trump Administration would leave their Medicaid eligibility up to the states. The Kentucky program uses different language. It requires those who are \u201cable-bodied\u201d to work and exempts those who are \u201cmedically frail.\u201d But what do those terms mean?\nWhen it comes to caregivers, it gets even more complicated. Imagine, for example, an adult daughter who spends so much time caring for her aging parents that she loses her job. That\u2019s not unusual: One-quarter of family caregivers say they spend 40 hours a week helping relatives. As a result, the daughter herself becomes a Medicaid beneficiary.\nThe administration guidance says that Medicaid recipients are exempt from the work requirement if they are caring for a \u201cdependent.\u201d But that may not mean what you think.\nFor some purposes, Medicaid uses the same definition of dependent as the Internal Revenue Service. According to the tax law, the rules for child dependents are pretty straightforward. Children qualify if they are under age 19, students under age 24, or if they are \u201cpermanently or totally disabled.\u201d They must also live with their caregiver for at least half the year.\nIt is different\u2014and more complicated-- for older adults. They are subject to a seven-part test to qualify as a non-child dependent. For example, only certain relatives--such as parents, spouses, or siblings--are eligible. They can\u2019t have more than about $4,000 in annual income and half their total support must come from the person who claims them as a dependent. In effect, that means that many people receiving Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or who are themselves on Medicaid may not meet the definition of a dependent.\nThe result: Even though that daughter may be spending 40 hours a week caring for her parents, they may not count"}

But they really, really don't like being told that.\nThe journal Frontiers in Psychology has formally retracted a 2013 paper after climate deniers accused it of being defamatory. The paper, led by professor Stephan Lewandowsky, the chair of cognitive psychology at the University of Bristol, was a follow-up to an earlier study published by the authors in the journal Psychological Science, which found that people who subscribe to conspiracy theories -- who believe, for example, NASA faked the moon landing -- are also more likely to be climate deniers.\nClimate deniers were furious with Lewandowsky's conclusions, and responded with -- you guessed it -- more conspiracy theories. Their reaction was enough that Lewandosky was able to compile their conspiracy theories about the conspiracy theory paper into a whole new paper exploring \"the possible role of conspiracist ideation in the rejection of science\u201d-- which was published in the Frontiers of Psychology.\nIn the light of a small number of complaints received following publication of the original research article cited above, Frontiers carried out a detailed investigation of the academic, ethical and legal aspects of the work. This investigation did not identify any issues with the academic and ethical aspects of the study. It did, however, determine that the legal context is insufficiently clear and therefore Frontiers wishes to retract the published article. The authors understand this decision, while they stand by their article and regret the limitations on academic freedom which can be caused by legal factors.\nRichard Dawkins rightly noted some time ago that scientists in the U.K. were operating in \"an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty\" under the libel laws.

Noticing the need to make energy usage more affordable and efficient, paired with a passion to improve the planet, one entrepreneur launched a company aimed at transforming the way we use energy.\nFounded in 2009 by Vic Shao, Green Charge Networks designs and installs commercial energy storage systems. Their mission is to empower businesses, municipalities, and schools of all scales to use energy more efficiently, by limiting carbon emissions and minimizing costs through servicing energy storage. Energy storage is designed to help avoid drawing energy from the grid during peak hours, instead charging itself during regular hours when energy is cheaper. By using energy storage as a method to balance peak power demands, power efficiency increases. This subsequently reduces demand charges, reduces capital expenditures for service upgrades, and improves the planet by decreasing the usage of power plants.\nGreen Charge was the first to market with an ROI-driven energy storage product. Now, the company stands as the largest provider of commercial energy storage in the country, boasting a growing portfolio of 48 MWh of battery storage projects deployed or under construction across more than 150 sites. In addition to expanding their reach, the startup has successfully helped customers across the United States cut the cost of their electric bills by up to 30%.\nTo date, Green Charge has raised over $56 million in two rounds of funding. In May, Green Charge was acquired by global energy power Engie, an industry-leading battery storage company. Leveraging an innovative suite of patented software algorithms and smart data, Green Charge deploys, owns, operates, and optimizes battery systems across both private and public sectors.\nIn 2015, the company won the coveted Energy Storage North America Innovation Award for for their 20MWh California Schools and Utility Trust program. This was the second consecutive year Green Charge received the award.\nI spoke with Green Charge CEO and Founder Vic Shao about the vision behind his company, the future of energy storage and his plans to preserve the planet while saving millions of dollars in the process.\nWith debates about climate change increasing and clean energy being a hot topic -- What specific void or opportunity did you discover that prompted the idea behind Green Charge?\nVic Shao: Energy storage is not a new idea - the Department of Energy (DOE) has been experimenting with it for decades. But it's always large, grid-scale, installed on the utility side of the meter. This has never grown out of the lab stage after decades of toying around. The problem is that utilities and governments simply don't have the capital to deploy at scale. The opportunity, and the main idea behind Green Charge, is that energy storage requires collaboration on both sides of the meter. And why would the private sector customer want anything to do with storage? Because it has a business case - there's a known ROI to an energy storage project. The trigger for customer benefits is the idea of reducing demand charges. But, fundamentally, storage is a technology that increases the efficiency of the distribution grid, and if we can build it at scale, then everyone benefits - from ratepayers to the utilities.\nBeyond saving money and better managing energy use \u2014 What"}

But such injuries don\u2019t only happen in warfare, they happen to civilians too. Think car crashes, a slip and fall, two football players colliding helmet to helmet.\nWhile most people know the results of a traumatic brain injury \u2014 ranging from a simple headache to long-term problems with memory and thinking, depending on the severity \u2014 few are aware that such an injury can also increase one\u2019s risk later in life for Parkinson\u2019s disease, the neurodegenerative disorder that affects roughly 1 percent to 2 percent of the population over the age of 65.\nNow scientists at UCLA have found the mechanism for this elevated, long-term risk of Parkinson\u2019s: the loss of a specific type of neuron.\nIn a pre-clinical study, the researchers found that a moderate traumatic brain injury in rats caused a 15 percent loss in the brain cells known as nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons shortly after the trauma, and that this loss continued to progress to a 30 percent loss 26 weeks after the initial injury.\nThe loss of these particular neurons can result in the cardinal motor symptoms observed in Parkinson\u2019s patients, including akinesia (problems with movement), postural tremor and rigidity. Further, when combined with a second known risk factor for Parkinson\u2019s, the pesticide paraquat, the loss of dopaminergic neurons doubled to 30 percent much faster.\nThe study, which appears in the current online edition of the journal Neurotrauma, was conducted by first author Che Hutson, a former UCLA graduate student, and senior author Dr. Marie-Francoise Chesselet, a UCLA professor of neurology, along with colleagues.\nWhile traumatic brain injury was known to be a risk factor for Parkinson\u2019s, no one knew why. Nor was it known whether traumatic brain injury acts synergistically with pesticides such as paraquat, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, which is known to be toxic to human beings and animals and has been linked to the development of Parkinson\u2019s.\nNigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are involved in the production of dopamine, which plays an important role in the regulation of movement, among other things. The current study demonstrated that while a traumatic brain injury does not cause Parkinson\u2019s, it can make individuals more susceptible to the disorder, Chesselet said.\nThe research looked at both the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury and the acute, or short-term, effects, combined with an exposure to low doses of paraquat. In the acute study, rats receiving moderate traumatic brain injury alone experienced a 15 percent loss of dopaminergic neurons. The addition of paraquat increased the effect, causing a 30 percent loss of neurons.\nIn the long-term study, which did not include the addition of paraquat, the rat\u2019s brains showed a 30 percent loss of dopaminergic neurons 26 weeks after the injury. This suggests that in the long term, traumatic brain injury alone is sufficient to induce a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.\n\u201cThese are the first data revealing that in a model of experimental traumatic brain injury, not only do nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate,"}

Photo Credit: Newsday/J. Conrad Williams Jr.\nSome Suffolk County shoppers were outraged when a 5-cent fee on single-use plastic and paper bags went into effect in January 2018 but officials said the law is working as intended.\nNot only were 1.1 billion fewer plastic bags used in the county last year, but the number of bags found polluting shorelines fell steeply compared with 2017, according to a report on the law\u2019s progress that was released Thursday.\n\u201cSo just think about that and what a difference it makes,\u201d Legis. William Spencer (D-Centerport), who sponsored the bill, said Thursday.\nSpencer and other government officials, environmental advocates, and retail and education representatives attended a news conference at the legislature building in Hauppauge to present the report.\nOn Jan. 1, 2018, the county law began requiring supermarkets, pharmacies, clothing stores and other retailers to charge customers 5 cents for each single-use plastic or paper bag they use to carry purchases. The law aims to boost reusable bag use and reduce the number of single-use plastic bags polluting waterways.\nLast year at stores in Suffolk, utilization of single-use plastic bags was down 81.7 percent and single-use paper bags was down 78.8 percent compared with 2017, according to the report, which cited data from the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, a trade group that represents the grocery industry.\nIn addition, teams from the 5 & 5 Education and Effectiveness Working Group, which was created by the Suffolk Legislature to study the impact of the law, were stationed outside stores to analyze bag use before and after the law went into effect.\nObserving customers in November and December 2017 and in the two-month period in 2018, the teams found that use of reusable bags or no bags increased from 27.8 percent to 60.1 percent, according to the report.\nThe report also showed that, between 2017 and 2018, there was a 42 percent decrease, to 1,552, in plastic bags that cleanup volunteers found littering Suffolk shorelines.\nThe bag-fee legislation mandates that the county\u2019s Department of Health Services prepare an annual recycling report by March 1 on the legislation\u2019s progress, including information on any cost savings for the county from reductions in contaminated waterways and on the benefits of waste and litter reduction.\nData on the cost savings associated with the law, however, was not in the report Thursday.

{"idx": "34872", "prompt": "Expand more of the idea of: When astronomers announced the discovery of UB313, the so-called tenth planet, a little more than a year ago, they had a hunch it might be bigger than Pluto because of its brightness. But despite several attempts to observe more closely the mysterious object orbiting the sun at a distance of more than 14 billion kilometers, accurate estimates of its size remained elusive. Now German astronomers working in Spain have determined that UB313 has a diameter of roughly 3,000 kilometers--roughly 700 kilometers larger than Pluto's.\nFrank Bertoldi of the University of Bonn in Germany and his colleagues used the IRAM 30-meter telescope in the Sierra Nevada mountains of southern Spain to observe UB313 in the infrared range. Because visual brightness alone is not an accurate indicator of size--it could result from the body's surface being either actually large or mirrorlike--the researchers made observations in wavelengths longer than those of visible light. Outside the range of visible light, the scientists could measure the amount of light the object absorbs and then radiates back as heat. By combining the infrared and visible measurements, they could then determine the object's size and its overall reflectivity, or albedo. Based on observations made over nine nights in August 2005, the team reports, UB313 appears to have a diameter of between 3,094 and 2,859 kilometers. Even the smallest size in that range would make the candidate planet's diameter more than 500 kilometers larger than Pluto's.\nThese calculations rely on several assumptions, however, such as UB313 lacking an atmosphere that would either reflect more light or trap more heat even though Pluto has such a covering. The astronomers estimate that the planet reflects roughly the same amount of light as Pluto, perhaps thanks to an icy methane surface. Their research appears in today's issue of Nature.\nThe finding adds impetus to the debate surrounding what constitutes a planet. The International Astronomical Union is currently working on a definition based on minimum size so as to keep Pluto a planet, but this could open the possibility of even more planets in the outer reaches of the solar system. After all, UB313 is one of more than 1,000 objects discovered beyond the orbit of Neptune since 1992. In an accompanying commentary, Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution of Washington suggests it might be time for a new term for such trans-Neptunian objects, much like \"asteroid\" was coined to refer to the many inner solar system objects discovered in the mid-19th century. If it is size that matters, however, it will be difficult to keep UB313 out of the exclusive planetary club. Says Bertoldi: \"Since UB313 is decidedly larger than Pluto, it is now increasingly hard to justify calling Pluto a planet if UB313 is not also given this status.\""}

When a man feels it for you, realizes his life is so much better because of you, and doesn't want to lose you, he'll suddenly go from being a commitment-phobe to the marrying kind.\" Why Do Men Get Married?\nHolly is not alone in her frustration. We're sure you know of a few women who have waited around for that sparkly diamond and the big wedding. And they waited. And waited some more. And then after they'd finally had it, when they finally said enough is enough and moved on, he is suddenly into marriage\u2014with another woman.\nSo ladies, the moral of the story is that if he wants to marry you, he will. It's just that simple. Excuses are excuses. If you want to marry him and he's says he isn't ready to get married or he doesn't want to get married, he is not worth any more of your precious time. Don't end up like Holly, watching the guy you spent the better part of a decade with put a ring on someone else's finger. Get rid of him now, and find the guy who does want to spend the rest of his life with you."}

ISIS staged a parade with its new weapons and then deployed them to capture the strategic Mosul Dam from outgunned Kurdish defenders. The U.S. began conducting air strikes and rearming the Kurds to even the score against its own weaponry. As a result, even more weapons have been added to the conflict, and local arms bazaars have reportedly seen an influx of supply.\nIt is past time that we consider whether we should build in a way to remotely disable such dangerous tools in an emergency. Other technologies, including smartphones, already incorporate this kind of capability. The theft of iPhones plummeted this year after Apple introduced a remote \u201ckill switch,\u201d which a phone\u2019s owner can use to make sure no one else can use his or her lost or stolen phone. If this feature is worth putting in consumer devices, why not embed it in devices that can be so devastatingly repurposed\u2014including against their rightful owners, as at the Mosul Dam?\nAn immediate worry is that a kill switch might not work when it is supposed to. An even bigger concern is that it might work when it is not supposed to\u2014for example, if it is hacked by an enemy. There is a reason tank operators start their vehicles with a switch requiring no ignition key or code\u2014it is too easy to misplace or become separated from keys on a battlefield, even at the cost of unauthorized access.\nBut ignition keys represent the best technology of 1949. Today there are many more possibilities. At least one foreign policy analyst has suggested incorporating GPS limitations into Stinger surface-to-air missiles to assist the Free Syrian Army in its defenses against air attack while ensuring that the missiles are useless outside that theater of conflict. More simply, any device with onboard electronics, such as a Stinger or a modern tank, could have a timed expiration; the device could operate after the expiration date only if it receives a coded \u201crenew\u201d signal from any of a number of overhead satellites. The renewal would take effect as a matter of course\u2014unless, say, the weapons were stolen. This fail-safe mechanism could be built using basic and well-tested digital signature-and-authentication technologies. One example is the permissive action link devices by which American nuclear weapons are secured so that they can be activated only when specific codes are shared. Another involves the protocols by which military drones are operated remotely and yet increasingly safeguarded against digital hijacking.\nThe simplest way to use a kill switch would be to place it in the hands of the weapons\u2019 original recipients. With a kill switch, the current Iraqi government could disable the bristling trophies of ISIS\u2019s post-Mosul parade, or the embattled Libyan government could secure jetliners from taking off on terrorist missions from the overrun airport in Tripoli. A more radical use of a kill switch would be to leave it in the hands of the weapons-providing government. This would turn weaponry into a service rather than a product. Many arms purchasers would no doubt turn elsewhere, but others might find the U.S. to be the only willing source. Some arms deals, including deals between the U.S. and Israel, have already been subject to agreed-on limitations. A kill switch would represent a more powerful enforcement mechanism.\nFor those"}

{"idx": "34879", "prompt": "Continue the following text: Pioneer's DVR-A08XL represents the manufacturer's eighth generation of DVD burner technology, and like its predecessors, it's a solid drive with an excellent supplied software package if you purchase the full retail version of the drive. In fact, if we were to criticise the A08XL, it would only be to say that it's so remarkably similar to the A07 drive that preceded it -- and if you have that drive, the key factors that might want to make you upgrade would be the introduction of dual layer (+R DL media) burning and 16x single layer burning support.\nLike the A07XL, the A08XL adopts a minimalist approach to its physical design. It does feature Pioneer's distinctive honeycomb chassis design, but once you've installed that into a PC or external enclosure, you won't be able to see that anyway. The front panel design offers a nice large eject button, a very small activity light, and that's all. Pioneer sells the drive in beige and black faceplate variants. Installation is the same as with any IDE drive -- if you're unsure how to install an IDE drive, this guide takes you step by step through what you need to know.\nThe big improvements that the A08XL makes over its predecessors is in burning speed and capability. For a start, it's capable of burning to dual layer DVD+R media; at this stage actually getting media to burn is still something of a challenge, and it's not clear whether this generation of drives will be firmware upgradeable to support future dual layer formats -- although it's likely they won't.\nSingle layer burning speed is also up -- to 16x with -/+R media, although the write speed for rewriteable media remains at 4x. CD writing speeds also get a bump upwards, to 32x from a previous 24x maximum. As with previous models, the A08XL features a liquid crystal tilt compensator to (theoretically) compensate for disc irregularities, as well as features designed to lower the drive noise. One nice trick that the A08XL can pull off is to run full burn speeds on -/+R media on discs that are actually rated lower -- so you can burn at 16x on 8x-rated media. Depending on the quality of your media, that might not be the best idea, but it's nice to have the capability.\nOn the software side, Pioneer continues to bundle a whole heap of Ulead utilities with its burners -- Ulead DVD MovieFactory 3.5 SE Suite, Video Studio 8 SE and DVD Workshop 2 SE as well as Nero 6 Suite. If you're just starting out with DVD burning it's a great suite of products to get, although enthusiasts and professionals probably won't even give the bundled applications a second look.\nIn our tests, the Pioneer DVD A08XL managed to burn a full 8.5GB Dual Layer disc in 24:22; that's almost exactly in line with what we'd expect for a drive with these specifications. With single layer media our results were slightly more mixed -- with one test burn the drive took much longer than its Nero-estimated 3:30, taking 7:37, although we suspect that was more to do with a dodgy disc and the drive attempting to correct potential errors on the fly."}

The Dark Tower movie finally got made, despite the general sense of disappointment, Mr. Mercedes is currently airing and, perhaps most importantly, the IT movie we've all been waiting for finally hits theaters next week. Point being, Stephen King is a big deal right now. And lucky for him, he is about to get the rights back to a lot of his most popular works.\nAs discovered by Zerner Law, Stephen King filed to terminate the transfer of his licenses for the movies, The Dead Zone, Cujo, Children of the Corn, Firestarter, Creepshow and Cat's Eye. The notices were filed on August 31, 2016, which means that he will have the rights to all of those titles back as of September 1, 2018. That means, King is now in control of these titles moving forward as of that date next year. As Zener Law explains, some big new deals could be made in the future as a result.\n\"In other words, after September 1, 2018, if a studio wanted to make a sequel or remake of any of these movies, they would have to go back to Stephen King and make a new deal.\"\nThere are elements of this that get a little tricky, but the short of it is, if any studio wanted to make a new Children of the Corn movie, for example, after September 1, 2018, they would have to make a deal with Stephen King directly. Considering that his properties could be a hot ticket item by next year in Hollywood, this could lead to some big deals and remakes of some of his most popular works. Who wouldn't want to see a modern, well-made Children of the Corn movie?\nThe complicated part of this has to do with international rights. The termination only applies to U.S. rights. That means that if one of the current rightsholders wanted to remake Cujo, for example, and release it outside of the U.S., they absolutely could. However, considering how big the U.S. market is, especially for something like a Stephen King adaptation, that seems a little unlikely, but not impossible.\nA couple of these titles currently have remakes in development. If they don't get filming within the next year, they aren't going to get made at all. Unless they strike a new deal with Stephen King, that is. Akiva Goldsman is currently working on a Firestarter remake, which was first adapted by director Mark L. Lester and released in 1984. There was also a 2002 miniseries titled Rekindled released in 2002.\nThere is also an adaptation of Cujo underway, going under the name C.U.J.O., which stands for \"Canine Unit Joint Operations.\" The script is reportedly complete and Lang Elliott is set to direct with DJ Perry set to star, at least when it was last reported. The original Cujo was released in 1983 and remains a favorite among many Stephen King fans. Considering the tight deadline these projects are under, it is unlikely they are going to get done in time. King is now in control of the destiny of these projects moving forward and that could result in some exciting developments."}

{"idx": "34892", "prompt": "Write your opinion about: Who would have thought that currency markets could be responsible for half of the move in oil prices.\nLow oil prices have hit shale drilling hard, and you may be surprised to find what's driving them lower. Image source: LINN Energy.\nOil prices have surged to near $60 per barrel for WTI crude oil in recent weeks and it would appear that the days of cheap oil and gasoline are over.\nMost people would point to shale oil or OPEC as the recent driver of oil prices, but there's a hidden hand in the market that may have more influence than you think.\nThe world of currency trading has been a big driver of not only oil's decline, but also its recovery in prices. Unlike most of the products we buy on a daily basis, oil is priced in a global market. If supply increases from Saudi Arabia it has consequences in Oklahoma and if demand increases in China it will impact prices in New York.\nWhat this global market dynamic does is bring currencies into the fold in ways that we don't usually see on a daily basis. Sure, a company's earnings might go up and down in any given quarter depending on how the dollar is moving, but the price of a gallon of milk or a tube of toothpaste doesn't usually change much whether the dollar is strong or weak. Oil is different.\nWhen the dollar gets stronger it means products can be bought for less currency compared to the rest of the world. In energy, it means each dollar can buy more oil than it could before, so a stronger dollar should mean lower oil prices.\nYou can see in the chart below that the drop in oil prices happened to coincide with a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. When the dollar stopped rising and actually fell in recent months oil reacted by moving higher.\nI'm not suggesting that all of the movement in oil over the past year has been due to the dollar, but according to the AMEX Dollar Index the dollar is about 20.1% stronger than it was a year ago. Oil is down 41.5% over the same time frame and a strong dollar helped to drive the drop in oil prices.\nThis isn't the first time this has happened either. The last time the dollar dropped significantly from 2002 to 2005 it coincided with a sharp rise in oil prices (the opposite of what we're seeing today).\nThe dollar doesn't drive all changes in the price of oil, but it's an underappreciated component to the market.\nOPEC has gotten a lot of the attention of those seeing oil prices tumble (including from me) and its a part of the picture. But the cartel is a cog in a much larger oil market and currency trading has arguably played a bigger role in the drop in oil prices than OPEC's decision to keep production flat.\nIronically, currency changes have hurt U.S. oil producers, who are producing oil that appears to be more expensive around the world than say oil produced in Russia, where the ruble has dropped in 2015. That's why you're seeing U.S. producers shut down drilling and countries like Russia are actually increasing oil supply.\nSometimes forces that you wouldn't even consider drive prices for the things we use everyday. In the case of oil, the strong dollar may have a bigger impact on what you pay at the pump than you think and it is having a big affect on where oil production is growing and where it's slowing down."}

For instance, finding a new car insurance provider might free as much as a hundred dollars a month, Perez said.\nUse financial tools like Mint.com to help you create a budget that sticks.\nMint will organize all your accounts in one place, calculate your average spending in any given category, and help you set goals. Alerts will remind you when to pay bills and warn you if you're going over your budget.\nBroken vow: I will pay down my credit card debt.\nWhat went wrong: You just couldn't avoid the temptation of pulling that plastic out of your wallet. Instead of cutting your debt, your balance got even bigger.\nGet money smart: \"Plastic equals temptation,\" said Gail Cunningham, vice president of membership and public relations at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\nCunningham recommends removing all but one low-interest credit card from your wallet, then take out a piece of paper and create four columns. List every card you owe money on, the amount, APR, and the dollar amount of the interest you pay each month just to service that debt.\n\"That last column should be an eye-opener,\" Cunningham said. \"Think what you could be doing if you got to keep the money that is now going into the creditor's pocket. Saving? Investing? That should be a real incentive to paying down the debt.\"\nBroken vow: I will start saving this year!\nWhat went wrong: After paying your bills, there's nothing left.\nGet money smart: Think small. \"Any start is a start,\" said Scott Brewster, president of Brewster Financial Planning in Park Slope.\n\"If you have a 401(k) at work, start saving a small percentage, like 5%,\" Brewster said. \"Then, when you get a raise, increase your savings at the same time so you do not feel the pain.\"\nOne of the biggest money blunders people make is keeping all of their dollars in one place, added consumer expert Andrea Woroch. When you don't separate savings accounts from checking accounts, you're more likely to dip into those funds and lose track of your goals, she said.\nWoroch recommends using free online piggy bank SmartyPig, which lets you create specific financial goals like saving up for a special trip or a big purchase.\n\"Once you set up auto transfers on a weekly or monthly basis, what's out of sight will be out of mind, helping you reach those goals faster,\" she said.\nBroken vow: I will pay more attention to my investments."}

Doctors say she likely contracted it from tap water.\nQuestion: How did this happen?\nThe 69-year-old Seattle woman was looking for relief from a chronic sinus infection. Her doctor told her to rinse her sinuses twice a day. Which she did using a Neti Pot and filtered tap water. And after a month, she developed a red rash the size of a quarter on her nose. Ointments didn\u2019t clear it up and biopsies weren\u2019t conclusive. A year later, the woman had a seizure and a CT scan found a lesion on her brain. Unfortunately, surgery and a drug to fight the infection failed. Tests found the woman had died from Balamuthia mandrillaris, a type of amoeba that lives in soil and possibly in water as well.\nQuestion: So this type of amoeba traveled from her nose to her brain?\nBalamuthia mandrillaris is known to travel to the brain. It\u2019s very deadly, with few people surviving this type of infection. We don\u2019t know a whole lot about how it\u2019s picked up but assume it enters the body by getting in your mouth, breathing it in, or via skin wounds or cuts. But this amoeba is very rare, only 200 cases of Balamuthia infection have been diagnosed worldwide. The CDC says at least 70 cases have been reported here in the U.S.\nQuestion: So I believe you\u2019re not supposed to use tap water in Neti Pots, why is that?\nThat\u2019s correct. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Neti Pots, but you have to use them correctly. And you should not use tap water. Because it\u2019s not adequately filtered or treated. And that means bacteria and amoebas can live in tap water and once in your nose, can potentially cause very serious and deadly infections. So please use distilled or sterile water which you can buy at the grocery store. Or you can boil tap water for 5-10 minutes and then let it cool before using. There are also special filters that say they remove these types of germs. You can learn more about these on the CDC\u2019s website.\nThis week on The Dr. Nandi Show we\u2019re discussing the \u201cNew Age of Parenting\u201d.

This certificate is designed for undergraduates who want to deconstruct, experiment with, and revolutionize gaming paradigms; who want to explore alternative realities, interfaces, and narrative forms. The basic assumption of the core courses is that theory and practice go hand in hand, but the electives are wide-ranging and flexible enough to support intense production, rigorous scholarship or both.\ncritically engage with scholarship relating to the history, theory and analysis of games, game culture, gender and diversity.\nevaluate genres of video games and critically relate them to controversial cultural issues.\napply a formal iterative design process for a game, including prototyping and playtesting.\nanalyze the structural elements of a game and how they contribute (or not) to the success of the game.\nMost Game Studies courses focus on either production or theory. Production courses are hands-on classes, involving making multiple projects over a semester; class sizes are roughly 15-18 students. Theory courses are typically discussion seminars, examining analytical texts as well as games; class sizes are 30-40. Some online classes are available during winter and summer semesters. Students also have the option of independent study courses to work on advanced, individual projects, and internships with game or other media businesses, both local and national.\nAs the Game Studies Certificate is housed in Media Study, Media Study offers a range of state-of-the-art equipment and facilities integral to the practice of media arts production including: a student accessible equipment pool with hundreds of pieces of equipment for traditional and emerging media creation (video production, computational media, VR); computer labs with the latest industry-standard and open-source software for digital audio and video editing, computational media, multimedia creation, game design, 3D printing and prototyping; a large production studio with green screen and lighting grid; smart classrooms; a 200+ seat auditorium with HD projection and sound.\nThe Department of Media Study faculty is among the most distinguished in the university and are recognized internationally for their work in their respective fields.\nPlease visit the Media Study department website for additional information about our faculty.\nThe Game Studies Certificate will serve as an educational foundation for those interested in careers in the games industry proper or in the increasing number of closely related off-shoots: interactive museum and entertainment design; games in education, training, advertising, art, activism and politics; games and research. Past students have gone on to work in positions such as animator, art director, graphic designer, software engineer, QA tester, or independent game developer.

It's a bummer too, as Fillion has now been in two movies that had pretty good expectations that were not lived up to as far as box office.\nI did say in an earlier post that I thought (based on what I'd read and seen at the time) that Slither would end up being a \"sleeper\"... that it would make it's money over time, and it will probably end up being a cult hit a few years done the road.\nSlither opens with a mysterious meteor heading towards Earth, it's target a sleepy little town. A very sleepy little town where a significant portion of the residents seem to be the result of cousins getting married. We're introduced to what seem to be the only two police officers in town, with Nathan Fillion playing Bill Pardy, the recently promoted man in charge.\nThe meteorite crashes in the woods and with a tip of the hat to The Blob, cracks open revealing some gooey stuff. Cut to some background on key players in the movie including mayor Jack MacReady (played a bit too over the top by Gregg Henry), the always creepy Michael Rooker playing the wealthiest guy in town (Grant Grant, no that's not a typo), 20 years older than the high school beauty he married 10 years or so ago, and the beauty in question: Elizabeth Banks (as Starla Grant).\nThe mayor is a foul-mouthed fellow whose favorite word is the F-bomb. Now I have to admit the first couple of times he used it, I thought it was pretty hilarious, but after I don't know, the 20th or 30th time I thought the \"funny\" was pretty much used up. He's a good ol' boy whose IQ is about 10 points higher than the average citizen in town (put that at about 70) so I guess that qualified him for mayor.\nGrant seems like an ok guy, but it looks like his marriage has headed a bit south and that Starla is craving something more.

Another woman on the jury said she believes Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick was \"done wrong\" in his criminal conviction in connection with dogfighting.\nThe jury took shape after four days of questioning by U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton and lawyers for both sides. Clemens' defense team said the seven-time Cy Young Award winner will begin his defense by questioning the propriety of lawmakers' investigation into whether Clemens used performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe jury includes a 22-year-old woman who works two part-time jobs and cares for her daughter, a woman who said her thrice-weekly dialysis treatments will not keep her from the trial and a yoga teacher and lawyer who said she finds U.S. drug laws \"a bit heavy-handed.\"\nThe two sides threw out the maximum number of 20 people before the jury of 10 women and two men along with four alternates was seated.\nThe jurors were not told who among them are alternates. To keep the panel from encountering the dozens of journalists at the courthouse, the judge told them they will meet off site each daily, be bused into a back entrance and use nonpublic corridors. They will be served meals in what was once a judge's chambers so they don't have to use the courthouse cafeteria.\nClemens sat and watched final jury selection but left it to his lawyers to pick who will decide his fate. His wife, Debbie, was back home in Houston after being in court last week, Clemens' attorney Rusty Hardin said. She will be a witness in her husband's defense, but can't attend the trial until after she testifies, Hardin explained to jurors who might otherwise wonder where she was."}

A former interior designer, Cobb had a huge stash of fabrics in her house from her work and travels.

The baleful sorceror gets d6, may not wear armor and are proficient with daggers, short swords, sickles and scimitars. They may also use poison as a thief of the same level and may rebuke, command or destroy undead as a cleric of the same level. This sorceror learns one spell of a higher level every level, though more power can be gained via trafficking with dreaded Tsathag\u2019Kha, putting that control in the GM\u2019s hands. The sorceror may also try to cast more potent magic than he can, requiring a save. If he fails, he takes the Constitution-drain of the magic himself and is whisked away by Tsathag\u2019kha\u2019s servants to be looted and/or forced to sign a pact in blood.\nThis power obviously needs some balancing: Baleful Sorcerors of Tsathag\u2019kha can never acquire a familiar, multi-class or be lawful/good. Upon death, his soul is forfeit and there is a 7% chance that the soceror rises as a lich after dying. These guys do not require spellbooks. Aforementioned Constitution-drain either is equal to the spell-level or as noted in the spell\u2019s description, but these may be relegated to willing and unwilling targets, provided blood was drawn by the sorceror, and no more than 1 hour prior to the casting. Constitution recharges at 2 points per hour of uninterrupted rest, but characters below Con 3 must save to avoid systemic shock and subsequent death from the recovery.\nThe spell-list runs the gamut from magic detection (rolling a bunch of spells into one) to infernal conducts, blackish-purple tentacles, green, ichorous infernos and insta-kill at level 9. I wished the spells had more detailed casting/duration-infos, but ultimately can live with what\u2019s here.\nEditing and formatting are top-notch, I noticed no significant glitches.

Oh, and it is FREE. FREE is hard to beat indeed and hence, I will award full 5 stars + seal of approval in spite of this minor nitpick for this pdf \u2013 well worth the download!\nYou can get this nice little class for FREE here on OBS!"}

Museum visitors can explore the studio and have their children fingerprinted and photographed for free.\nThe museum is designed to educate the public on the punishments criminals face and the work that goes into catching the bad guys, Walsh said. \"Yes, you'll see some fascinating criminals, but you'll see the real heroes,\" he said.\nA history of American crime leads visitors through the winding hallway with information on crime and punishment in several time periods. Visitors can place their head and arms in colonial stocks, participate in a Wild West shootout and flip through mug shots of infamous criminals.\nBeyond the historical galleries, visitors can view the bullet-riddled car from the 1967 film \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" try to fool a lie detector, participate in a police lineup and attempt to escape from prison.\nA replica of legendary gangster Al Capone's cell at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia is re-created down to the crack in the ceiling and the peeling paint on the walls. The gallery also contains several other cells with artifacts on display, including crafts made by inmates at Louisiana's Angola state prison.\nAnother gallery, an exhibit on the death penalty, holds scale models of a gas chamber, an electric chair and a guillotine.\nThe museum includes interactive features, such as an FBI shooting range, a high-speed police-chase simulator and a police booking room. A \"crime scene\" on the first floor gives visitors the chance to look for clues and apply DNA testing, fingerprint analysis and even examination of a \"body\" in a morgue to determine the cause of death.\n\"There's a strong message throughout the museum that crime does not pay, criminals are not heroes and there are consequences,\" said museum owner John Morgan, a lawyer from Orlando, Fla.\nMorgan said he came up with the idea five years ago while trying to navigate the tourist crowds on a trip to Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison that's now a national park in San Francisco Bay.\n\"I think we as Americans, and as people in general, have a fascination with crime and punishment,\" he said. \"There is nothing in America or the world that focuses on what we're fascinated with, which is crime and punishment.\"\nLike other nearby attractions that have opened in recent years -- notably the International Spy Museum, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and the Newseum -- the crime museum is charging admission: $17.95 for patrons 12 and older and $14.95 for children 5 to 11 and seniors 60 and older.\nWithin a few blocks are a variety of government-supported museums"}

Just add enough trialware and throw in a few unnecessary programs, and the customer gets a miserable out-of-box experience. Microsoft is trying to fix that with its Signature PC initiative. Does it work? And can it scale?\nBuilding a Windows PC is a cooperative process. PC makers design and build the hardware, Microsoft designs and builds the OS, and then third-party software developers join the party. If everything works together, the end result can be a joy to use. But if any part of the partnership breaks down, the poor PC buyer is the one who suffers.\nMaking PCs is a tough business, with low profit margins and cutthroat competition. To squeeze a few extra bucks out of every PC they sell, some OEMs cut deals to make extra money by preinstalling trial versions of software. If they can convince you to pay for an upgrade to the full version, they make a commission. But those upsell offers (also known as crapware) are annoying, and in the worst case they can slow a PC noticeably.\nOn top of that, some OEMs feel compelled to \"add value\" to their hardware by bundling software programs and utilities that duplicate functions already available in Windows. And they can get downright sloppy about the things that really do matter, like updates and drivers.\nThis gorgeous machine was ugly in action: slow to start, sluggish when performing everyday tasks, crash-prone, and overloaded with annoying and unwanted software. But is it really a hopeless case, or was this system done in by the rush to market and a sloppy OEM integration?\nIn an interview at the time, a Sony senior executive candidly admitted that the problem was all theirs, calling his company's PCs \"the poster child for negative experiences people had [with trialware].\"\nI was able to fix that PC with a clean install and hours of fine-tuning. But that approach doesn't scale and should never have been necessary.\nNow, three years later, I'm curious. Have OEMs cleaned up their act? Are today's Windows PCs still a mess or do consumers have a fighting chance?\nNo trialware, and no unnecessary startup programs.\nThe desktop is clean, with no gadgets, no icons (except for the Recycle Bin), and no unnecessary system try icons.\nMicrosoft's free antivirus software is installed and activated, and Windows Update is configured to install updates automatically.\nThe Microsoft Signature theme pack, with images drawn from the same pool as those used on Bing, is installed and set as the default background.\nWindows Live Essentials, Office 2010 Starter Edition (not a trialware product), and Zune software are installed and all activations are performed.\nNo added mouse/keyboard navigation systems are allowed beyond the Windows Start menu and taskbar.\nIn addition, the installations are up-to-date, with the latest service packs and updates applied. And the final product includes 90 days of free support from Microsoft.\nThe goal is to make the experience of using a PC better\u2014not just on unboxing day but for the life of the PC.\nSo, two months ago, I picked up three pairs of new consumer notebooks, one pair each from HP, Samsung, and Sony. In each case, the hardware was identical but the installed software was different, with one model containing the OEM's standard consumer installation and the other built to Microsoft Signature specs. The differences were eye-opening.\nHere"}

Adams guarded Taylor (2-for-7) for most of the game, but there was no answer for Aubrey Dawkins, son of the Knights\u2019 coach, who is playing after missing two seasons, one sitting as a transfer and one due to injury.\nUConn players and coaches had trouble \u201clooking each other in the eye\u201d after losing at South Florida on Wednesday night, Hurley said, a game in which he did not like the effort.

Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO&apos;s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations&apos; economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department&apos;s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February.

It was independently recorded and distributed\u2013and it was available for free on every peer-to-peer service on the planet weeks before it was officially released, so it was only a modest commercial success.\nDon\u2019t feel bad. It was entirely expected. Even if there was such a thing as a record industry anymore, no one would expect a double-disc tribute to a 27-year-old album by The Clash to keep Avril or Pink from the top of the charts. But there\u2019s one reaction the record has received that has helped me understand something about the broader media business: the danger of looking backward.\nBack when I started the project in 2003, I was delusional enough to think I could get someone else to fund it. I spoke to executives at large multinational record companies and small independent companies, and they all told me, with varying degrees of politeness, to get lost. A few told me it was a crazy idea, a few more told me it was a bad idea and some told me, with that level of snideness only record-company executives can manage, that I\u2019d never finish the project.\nPerhaps. But I don\u2019t have to start it now. The media and technology businesses are now different than they were in 2002 and 2003. When I started the online newsletter in 2002, no one else was dumb enough to try that. Now it seems as if everyone has at least a semipro blog. When I started soliciting performers for the record in 2003, no one else was stupid enough to try and assemble 36 performers to redo\u2013for free!\u2013a long-forgotten record. Now tribute albums are all the rage. Is it just that I have uncannily bad commercial timing?\nIt is true that I would have an easier time funding something now than four to five years ago. Everyone else is. Indeed, as uncov and others report so gleefully, moronic ideas are getting funded again, while five years ago even a recipe for eternal life might have had trouble scoring a meeting on Sand Hill Road.\nBut the response I received should make entrepreneurs\u2013and the people who fund them\u2013wary. In both the case of the record and the email newsletter, I was told by experts that something I did at a different time would be successful now. Wrong! If I merely updated or replicated an old idea, it would still be an old idea. But today\u2019s business environment is all about innovation. At its best, it\u2019s about the next thing, not a redo of the last thing. The start-ups most likely to fail are the retreads, the wannabes, the copycats, the ones that mistake features for full-fledged services.\nLook at the record industry if you want to see what happens to an industry that reflexively looks backward for ideas. Know your history but don\u2019t be limited by it. At their best, media and technology are about the new. If you had an old idea that people like, say thank you.

Mike Rounds of South Dakota about the upcoming vote on CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be secretary of State and the nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to head the VA.\nIt is looking increasingly likely that Mike Pompeo will be the next secretary of state. Pompeo narrowly won a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. The support of a few Democrats is expected to get him through the full Senate. But another of President Trump's nominees for Veterans Affairs is looking much less certain. Admiral Ronny Jackson's confirmation hearing has officially been postponed.

I want to start by asking you about Mike Pompeo and Iran. Steve Inskeep, my co-host, was talking to Iran's foreign minister yesterday, and he pointed to Pompeo saying during the confirmation process that he doesn't think Iran is racing towards a nuclear bomb. Does that mean, as secretary of state, he might talk President Trump out of leaving the Iran nuclear deal?\nROUNDS: Well, the Iran nuclear deal, most of us felt, was a bad deal to begin with. It was never passed by the Senate. It doesn't have the force of a treaty. But we put our resources in upfront. And now it's a matter of whether or not Iran is going to honor the deal and whether or not they're going to be taking their time before they're actually able to create a nuclear weapon, which would be in about 10 to 15 years. So while most of us think it was a bad deal to begin with, we have nothing to lose in my opinion and, I believe, probably in Mr. Pompeo's opinion in keeping the Iran nuclear deal in place at this time.\nGREENE: OK. So a Republican senator like yourself feels that way, and you're not alone in the Senate. Mike Pompeo seems to feel that way. The president of France is in town for a state dinner. He certainly wants the United States to stay in the deal. Is this a moment? I mean, do you think President Trump might be looking in that direction and be less likely to pull the United States out?\nROUNDS: What he may very well be doing is is trying to find if there are some additional concessions that can be brought to bear. Look, if he can make it better, if he can strengthen it - more power to him. And that's part of what he has suggested in the past with other treaties that are actually in place. Trade agreements, the same way - he says he wants to make them better. I take him at his word. And if there's an opportunity for him to actually make some improvements in the agreement that we have today with Iran, then more power to him. And you know, that's something that (laughter), if he can get it done, would help a lot of us feel better.\nGREENE: What about your colleagues who want the deal to be scrapped? Will Pompeo face some trouble with them during the confirmation debate on the floor?\nROUNDS: Look, I think we're going to have solid support among Republicans for Mike Pompeo.

The company was evicted in late July from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, because of $214,000 in unpaid bills. In the month after the eviction, the company began parking buses at Manhattan curbsides without a permit. In that time, Bieber was cited for more than 200 parking violations by the New York Police Department and incurred about $91,000 in fines, according to city records.\nThe New York City Department of Transportation granted Bieber a temporary curbside bus stop permit in November to drop off and pick up passengers at 590 Eighth Ave., near the intersection with West 39th Street, and one block away from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. That temporary permit expired Feb. 2, but was extended last week until February 2020.\nAs of Jan. 31., the company had paid four tickets totaling $1,892, according to city records. More than two dozen tickets worth about $11,000 were dismissed. But the remaining tickets so far have accrued $9,200 in penalties and interest.\nEntering February, hearings had been held for 77 of the citations, with Bieber found guilty 50 times.\nThe majority of citations were issued in the 300 block of Madison Avenue and the 200 block of West 31st Street \u2014 the two locations where Bieber drivers were dropping off and picking up passengers without a valid permit after the Port Authority eviction.\nHaddad said in November that the company was disputing some of the tickets and paying others.

Lately, though, Larry\u2019s well of misunderstandings seems to have run dry and the formula has grown dull.\nHe seems to be covering the same old ground. Watching \u201cCurb,\u201d you wonder where you\u2019ve seen various things before. Didn\u2019t he already slag Jesus in the episode a few seasons back when he hired a troupe of actors to re-create a manger scene for his wife?\nAnd didn\u2019t he do the handicapped parking bit, revived recently on \u201cCurb,\u201d on \u201cSeinfeld\u201d years ago?\nOnce, \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was the freshest comedy on TV, based on the innovative way they made the show: Scenes were outlined rather than scripted and the end result, which was generally stellar, sprang from the participants\u2019 improvisation skills.\nNow such scenes seem forced. In fact, the whole show seems forced, as if Larry has run out of things to say but insists, at the risk of repeating himself, on saying them anyway.\nAnyway, thanks for the memories, Larry.

American startups sometimes experienced difficulty finding the right local manufacturers or could not afford to operate production in the U.S.\nCompanies that use specialized eco-friendly materials in their products may not be able to find them from suppliers in the U.S. The lower price points can also be advantageous to entrepreneurs who have just started a business, the source said. However, partnering with foreign suppliers is not without risks. Importing goods from China can lead to poor quality products, but sometimes Chinese companies are willing to collaborate to make improvements.\nSmall businesses can put themselves at risk by being too trusting of their international counterparts, so they need to find a reputable manufacturing partner. China has a bad reputation for intellectual property theft, which highlights the importance of supplier quality management, according to The Financial Times.\nEstablishing a face-to-face relationship with Chinese partners can be critical to the success of the enterprise, Fox Business stated. It can prevent entrepreneurs from falling victim to scams. Small businesses should always check to make sure an international supplier is legitimate."}

He blogs at The Baseline Scenario, which he co-founded with Simon Johnson. Simon and James have also written two books: 13 Bankers and, more recently, White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You. In a previous career, James worked as a management consultant and co-founded a successful software company. You can follow him at @JamesYKwak.\nJames Stafford: What changes do you see happening to the domestic energy landscape in Obama\u2019s second term?\nJames Kwak: The biggest trend is obviously the domestic boom in shale gas and oil, and hence the biggest question is what will happen to it. Frankly, I don\u2019t see anything happening to change the current trend. Plentiful fossil fuels do have obvious short-term economic benefits that the Obama administration is not blind to. Insofar as the administration wants to reduce fossil fuel consumption\u2014and it\u2019s not clear that they do want to\u2014there is enough opposition, both in Congress and in the courts, to justify a policy of doing nothing.\nJames Stafford: What are your thoughts on America\u2019s oil and gas boom?\nJames Kwak: There are some obvious benefits. Lower dependence on politically unstable parts of the world is clearly good. Shifting electricity production from coal to natural gas is also good. One can also come up with a plausible scenario in which plentiful natural gas buys us the time necessary to shift toward greater usage of renewable energy sources.\nOn the downside, I worry about the political implications of the boom. Increased domestic production will encourage politicians to declare victory on the energy front without doing anything about the big, long-term problem: climate change. Before, fears of rising energy prices and dependence on the Middle East were encouraging political investment in renewables and conservation. Now the message from ExxonMobil and its allies will be that we don\u2019t need to do anything because we are a (net) energy exporter and energy is cheap. That will further reduce the chances that we do anything meaningful about climate change.\nJames Stafford: What do you see happening to the US and global economies in 2013?\nJames Kwak: I\u2019m modestly positive about the U.S., but that\u2019s not because of any particular insight. It\u2019s because I read Calculated Risk, and because the housing market is turning around.\nJames Stafford: Obama has made clear his desires to cut the $4 billion a year tax breaks given to oil companies. What affect do you believe this would have on the US economy and the US oil industry?\nJames Kwak: I find it hard to imagine this would have a big impact on anything. $4 billion is simply not a lot of money for the energy industry (something like a few weeks\u2019 operating profit for ExxonMobil), and even assuming they pass it on to businesses and consumers, that\u2019s not a lot of money for the U.S. economy. At the same time, it won\u2019t do much to cut the deficit. But it\u2019s still a good idea simply to get rid"}

But he feared traditional hearing aids might amplify the sound of wind on the mountain and perhaps hinder his music- and movie-making efforts. He wanted a device he could easily control.\nThen, on a trip to the Washington State Fair in Puyallup last year, he stopped by a booth for a device called the ReSound LiNX2.\nHe was instantly taken by the device. He could fine-tune settings using his phone or watch. He could even take calls and listen to music through the hearing aids.\nWhittaker was sold.

Following in the footsteps of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Panera has worked at expanding its restaurant network and offering high-quality food and a positive, comfortable experience for customers. Coming into Tuesday's first-quarter financial report, Panera investors were ready to see a restoration and acceleration in growth from the company, and its results were even better than most of those following the stock had anticipated. Let's look more closely at what Panera Bread had to say this quarter and whether it can continue to deliver on its goals in the future.\nPanera's first-quarter results were uniformly strong. Revenue jumped 6% to $685.2 million, easily surpassing the consensus forecast among investors for sales of $674 million. GAAP net income was up 10% to $35.1 million, and even though one-time items helped boost earnings growth, a big drop in outstanding share counts produced adjusted earnings of $1.56 per share. That was $0.06 per share higher than investors had expected to see.\nA closer look at Panera's numbers reveals a reawakening in comparable-restaurant sales. Across the Panera restaurant system, overall comps rose 4.7%, and the much-watched figure for company-owned locations grew at an even faster 6.2% pace. Average check size accounted for the majority of the comps growth, but traffic count also contributed more than a third to the company's increase in comparable sales. Franchise-owned restaurants didn't fare as well but still produced comparable-restaurant sales gains of 3.3%.\nOn the margin front, however, Panera's numbers were mixed. From a GAAP perspective, operating margins rose four-tenths of a percentage point, but Panera incurred substantial costs in the year-ago quarter related to the company's refranchising efforts. When adjusting for those costs and other one-time items, adjusted operating margins fell four-tenths of a percent. Panera blamed wage increases, start-up costs, and expenses from the strategic transitions that the company has made for the drop in margins.\nPanera CEO Ron Shaich seemed surprised by the extent of the company's success. \"Our growth in same-store sales and transactions was the best we generated in four years,\" Shaich said, \"and we outperformed the Black Box all-industry composite by the widest margin we have ever recorded.\" The CEO also pointed to bottom-line growth as showing the success of the strategic moves that Panera has taken.\nBecause of the strong success that Panera has seen, the company chose to raise its full-year 2016 targets for comps and earnings per share. The fast-casual chain now expects company-owned store comps to grow at a 4% to 5% pace, up half a percentage point from its previous range. Similarly, Panera added $0.17 to $0.18 per share in earnings to its guidance range, which will now be between $6.50 and $6.70 per share. Panera still thinks that operating margins will fall between a half percentage point and a full percentage point.\nA combination of factors could keep Panera moving forward. Comparable-rest"}

After completing his humanities with brilliant success, he joined the Discalced Carmelites, and having been nominated prior of a convent, he chanced to meet Bossuet, who recognized in him a fervent religious, a learned writer, and an eloquent orator. Anxious to embrace a more austere life, he entered La Trappe in 1695, where he became the privileged disciple of the Abb\u00e9 de Ranc\u00e9, and made his profession in 1696. In the same year Dom Zozime, who had succeeded the Abb\u00e9 de Ranc\u00e9 after his resignation, died after a few months of administration, and de Ranc\u00e9 then asked the king, with the pressing recommendation of Bossuet, for Dom Gervaise as his second successor.\nDom Gervaise had given unequivocal proofs of his religious spirit and his eloquence; these qualifications led to the hope that his appointment would be of the greatest advantage to the reform, and consequently on 20 October, 1696, he received the abbatial blessing. But his turbulent administration, which in several points was opposed to that of the Abb\u00e9 de Ranc\u00e9, soon procured for him numerous enemies who to well-founded accusations added some that were baseless. Dom Gervaise yielded before the storm and tendered his resignation in 1698. Soon, however, he regretted this step and tried to withdraw his resignation, but without success. Under the abbot chosen to fill his place he left La Trappe and began his wandering life from monastery to monastery, exercising to good purpose his talent as a writer. His style is always well-turned and flowing, but he is reproached for being sometimes wanting both in exactitude as to his information and in polemical moderation.\nWe shall mention only a few of his works: the lives of several Fathers of the Church and ecclesiastical writers; the life of Ab\u00e9lard; the life of Abbot Joachim, Prophet ; the life of Suger ; a criticism on Marsolier's \"Life of the Abb\u00e9 de Ranc\u00e9\", in which he makes his own apology; finally, the history of the Reform of C\u00eeteaux in France, a work in which he does not treat with sufficient consideration the superiors of the order, and which caused his final disgrace. He was obliged to interrupt its publication, and was banished by order of the king to the monastery of the Reclus, in the Diocese of Troyes, where he died. Until the end of his life he remained faithful to the austerities of the life of La Trappe , observing in all its rigour the rule he had embraced."}

What government agency is responsible for it? The Ministry of Education? Or would it fall under the National Languages Development Division, which is being set up under the Ministry of Culture\u2019s Department of Humanities and Publications and is to be responsible for handling the draft national languages development act?\nThe KMT has a history of marginalizing Hoklo. After the KMT\u2019s Ma Ying-jeou (\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d) became president, his administration axed the plan to set up a Hoklo TV channel.\nIn 2009, when former KMT chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (\u6d2a\u79c0\u67f1) was a legislator, she proposed scrapping the Ministry of Education\u2019s NT$40 million (US$1.3 million) budget for Hoklo proficiency tests.\nIn response, a group of people who care about the Hoklo language came forward to protect the official proficiency tests, while denouncing Hung\u2019s policy.\nThey took it a step further by raising funds and establishing the General Taiwanese Proficiency Test. They commissioned National Cheng Kung University\u2019s Center for Taiwanese Language Testing, under the directorship of professor Taifallo Chiung (\u8523\u70ba\u6587), to set and hold the test twice a year.\nOf course, the best strategy is to speed up the enactment of the national languages development act. Meanwhile, voters should exercise their wisdom.\nEven if candidates use Hoklo to win sympathy and support before elections, once they are elected, they can immediately renege on whatever they promised. Ma\u2019s record is proof of this.\nAs for a candidate like Han, who is so hostile to Hoklo, Taiwanese should let him know not to push things too far, and they must not allow candidates who identify with China to show such disdain for Taiwan\u2019s native languages"}

Hearts are lighter, smiles wider, the golden evenings longer and brighter under a spectacular sliver of a moon. It is all extremely heartwarming.\nIn case some of you in the faraway have forgotten about the Seven Sleepers who flitted into being the springs of your childhood, I jog your memory. The sleepers are the bee, the bat, the butterfly the cuckoo and the swallow, the corncrake and the weather-bleat and, as the old folk used say, all the rest will quickly follow the original messengers. It has always happened that way even after the harshest and longest winters such as the one we have just endured.\nI have not yet heard the cuckoo in Clare this year, and the once widespread corncrakes are now less numerous than they were along the Shannon a few decades ago, but as bees and bats and butterflies ornament my local landscapes now on a daily and nightly basis (in the case of the bat population) it is impossible not to be touched deeply by the real perennial miracle of the changing of the seasons.\nThe early swallows, beautiful as ever, have been flitting around the place for more than 10 days now, the bees are droning in numbers, the grass and shrubs are growing strongly and vividly, and, any morning now for sure, in this most strikingly scenic stretch of Europe, I am sure to hear the first cuckoo.\nThere are not as many of them hereabouts, I\u2019ve discovered, as there were in Connemara during the years I resided there. But you still hear and see the odd one around the place, usually with angry small birds chasing her away from their precious nests lest she come in and eject their resident eggs before claiming squatters\u2019 rights.\nAs for the corncrake, the truth is that if I don\u2019t hear him or her at all this year I will be a happier man and likely to enjoy a better night\u2019s sleep. Their harshly unending ventriloquism from the meadows of my Ulster boyhood when you had been sent to bed behind golden curtains far too early in your view is a memory I can easily do without.\nSo, quite likely, that is the case for many of you too. Schoolboy sleeping and corncrakes do not happily cohabit for sure.\nAnyway, as the butterflies glorify the gardens again, it is equally fair to report that the west has rarely appeared so magnificently and awesomely beautiful as it does this year.

Children with the disorder can seem trapped in a world of their own, without friends or even a conception of friendship. Many prefer to play alone. Some lose the ability to speak more than a few words.\nBut researchers at UNC are making progress in developing new techniques to detect and treat the disorder, said Geraldine Dawson, PhD, a professor of psychiatry at UNC and chief science officer for Autism Speaks, a research and advocacy organization.\n\u201cNorth Carolina has really been at the forefront in research and services that are being provided,\u201d Dawson said.\nThe term \u201cautism\u201d refers to a group of developmental disorders that cause a person to have difficulties in social interaction and communication. The disorders include Asperger\u2019s syndrome, Rett syndrome, classic autism and other syndromes, which can cause symptoms from mild to serious. Together, the syndromes are often referred to as \u201cautism spectrum disorders.\u201d About one in 110 American children have an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nEarly treatment can help children with autism spectrum disorders to earn social and communication skills, Dawson said. In one-on-one interventions, therapists teach children the skills that come naturally to others: smiling, making eye contact, playing and using words.\nAt UNC, the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities offers a range of services for individuals with autism, including an autism assessment clinic for preschoolers, support for adolescents and adults, and a clinic for treatment of medical issues related to autism.\nThe TEACCH Autism Program at the UNC School of Medicine offers evaluations, parent training and support groups, and play and recreation groups to people with autism. TEACCH also brings together distinguished speakers and researchers each year for a conference on autism, said Lee Marcus, PhD, a consulting psychologist for the program. This year\u2019s conference will be held May 19 and 20 at the William and Ida Friday Continuing Education Center in Chapel Hill.\nMeanwhile, scientists at UNC\u2019s Program in Early Autism Research, Leadership and Service (PEARLS), are developing new techniques for diagnosing and treating the disorder. A team of researchers led by Grace Baranek, PhD, professor and associate chair for research in the department of allied health sciences, developed a questionnaire administered around the time of a child\u2019s first birthday. Preliminary results suggest that the questionnaire is effective in identifying infants at high risk of developing autism.\nThe PEARLS team, Drs.

{"idx": "34986", "prompt": "Generate text based on the: By kkrisberg on February 19, 2016.\nIn the last few years, the residents of Flint, Michigan, and its surrounding suburbs lost five grocery stores. Today, within the city limits, there's just one large chain grocery store, about 10 small and often-pricier groceries, and 150 liquor stores, convenience stores and gas stations. People who have a car often travel out to the suburbs for more variety and better prices. Much of Flint is a food desert \u2014 a place where accessing healthy, affordable food is a very real challenge.\nBut thankfully, a recent study in Flint found that simply relocating an area farmers market is making a positive difference. Such research adds to a growing body of literature on the role of farmers markets in expanding access to healthy foods and diets, especially among particularly vulnerable communities.\n\u201cSmaller-scale food retailers like farmers markets really do have the potential to strengthen communities,\u201d study author Rick Sadler, a Flint native and an assistant professor in the Division of Public Health at Michigan State University, told me.\nBecause much of the city has been classified as a food desert, the farmers' market's move downtown is a strategy of locating in the middle and drawing people in via the public transportation network. This move thus presents the opportunity to evaluate the following research question: What is the impact of a farmers' market move on customer shopping characteristics? A specific sub-research question is also addressed, namely: Are new neighborhoods (specifically those underserved by the conventional food system) being served by the adjacency of this market to the main bus station?\nTo find answers to such questions, Sadler adapted a 2011 questionnaire used to survey Flint Farmers\u2019 Market customers before the market moved downtown. This way he could directly compare differences in customer characteristics between 2011 and 2015. Among its many questions, the survey asked respondents to indicate the nearest intersection to their homes. Sadler geocoded those answers and overlaid them with a socioeconomic distress index, which would eventually tell him if the market\u2019s relocation heightened access for more people from disadvantaged neighborhoods. The survey also asked how people traveled to the market, which served as a socioeconomic proxy as well. (Sadler noted that because it\u2019s so difficult to get around Flint via public transit or foot, residents who take the bus are more likely to have resource constraints. Flint is still very much a car-centric city, he said.) In both 2011 and 2015, more than 400 customers were recruited to take the survey.\nThe use of the Market by a substantially different and previously underserved clientele is a major contribution in terms of the provision of \u2018preventive health services\u2019 \u2014 that is, the use of the Market by disadvantaged, underserved residents is important for helping to provide people with a better opportunity to consume healthy foods. This diverse clientele also reflects work by Guthman, Morris, and Allen (2006), who showed that market managers increasingly seek to balance economic motives with social justice goals to improve access to healthy foods. This motivation, seemingly shared by the Flint Farmers' Market, is reflected by the simultaneous increase in customer spending at the Market and customers attending from distressed neighborhoods.\nOverall, the 2015 survey found that 11 percent of respondents said transportation is a barrier to accessing food and 29 percent said distance is a barrier. Also, nearly half said they have at least one issue accessing healthy foods and 24 percent used food assistance. In addition to widening"}

Conservative author Byron York called the Kelly interview disastrous, noting that Bush's brother has a better rear view of Iraq.\nBush's view of the war is considerably less clear-eyed than that of his brother, former President George W. Bush, the man who ordered the invasion. In his memoir, Decision Points, W. wrestled with the dilemma of his decision to start a war on the basis of bad intelligence. Only W. did not call the intelligence \"faulty,\" as Jeb had. W. called the intelligence \"false.\"\n\"The reality was that I had sent American troops into combat based in large part on intelligence that proved false,\" George W. Bush wrote.\nEven though W. still argued that the world is \"undoubtedly safer\" without Saddam Hussein, he knew the failure to find the weapons of mass destruction that he used to justify the invasion was \"a massive blow to our credibility\u2014my credibility\u2014that would shake the confidence of the American people.\"\n\"I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it,\" George W. Bush wrote. \"I still do.\"\nSick feelings struck Team Jeb after the Kelly interview, and yet the candidate laid low for a day before telling another FOX News host that he had misinterpreted the question.\nOn Tuesday, Bush told Sean Hannity he would have made a different decision than his brother to invade Iraq in 2003 had he known what he does now about flawed intelligence.

Sometimes food reveals what we should know about a character, sometimes it\u2019s a pleasant pause in the action, and sometimes it\u2019s got too many onions, but it\u2019s still a very good sauce. Food Fiction is an ongoing feature that looks at some of the most memorable foods in the history of storytelling.\nNothing illustrates how good a particular piece of food is like its power to cause betrayal, not just of comrades or family, but of civilization in general.\nThat steak in The Matrix is one of the best looking pieces of food on film. Not because it\u2019s shot so well or lit beautifully to bring out the texture. Not because it\u2019s perfectly groomed by a food stylist or because the sound of cutting and chewing is turned up. That steak represents every basic worldly pleasure. Cypher chooses the expensive piece of meat over a life spent resisting the Matrix\u2019s machine-dominated society. And the best part is, we all sort of get that.\nThat scene\u2019s effectiveness goes beyond our concerns for the people of the resistance. Every meat-eating viewer is fighting a little internal moral war, because we identify so completely with Cypher\u2019s choice. After years of deprivation aboard a dingy old rebel ship, who wouldn\u2019t love to clean up, relax, and eat a meal like that? Even if we\u2019ve suspended our disbelief and are bound to root for Morpheus and company, we all get why Joe Pantoliano\u2019s traitorous jerk wants to give up, give in, and betray the cause. Just look at that steak, that wine, that linen tablecloth, and that cigar.\nAnother major example of \u201cfood so good I\u2019d forfeit all of what\u2019s good in the world\u201d happens in the first book of the Bible, then much later in a book that basically rewrites the main ideas of the New Testament as a fantasy for kids\u2014The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe, in which Edmund Pevensie gives up his family and endangers The Cause Of Right almost as soon as he gets to Narnia and tastes the White Witch\u2019s Turkish delights.\nFortunately, Edmund eventually repents, puts the delights out of mind, and is metaphorically saved. But if there is a criticism of the Narnia books and the movies of them, it\u2019s that they\u2019re kind of stiff\u2014and these Turkish delights might be an example of the sort of opportunity missed by the moviemakers to tap into our human desire; at no point are we made to really feel the draw of the Turkish delight. We see Edmund eating one rather messily, and presumably enjoying it, but we don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d that seduction the way we understand Cypher\u2019s motivations. All we know is the boy is mad for sweets, angry at his siblings, and easily influenced by Tilda Swinton.\nIt\u2019s the combination of forbidden food and a full accounting of its simple, basic indulgence that speaks to us the loudest. Food we\u2019re not supposed to be eating, described or illustrated in sensual detail, communicates flavor to the audience.\nThat\u2019s what makes that steak in The Matrix so memorably attractive.

{"idx": "34992", "prompt": "Continue the following text: By Peter Sellick - posted Thursday, 2 November 2017 Sign Up for free e-mail updates!\nIn the absence of religious journalism written by those who have studied their subject, we now see journalists who may be expert in their own fields turning their hand at commentary on faith and the Church. I have two journalists in mind, Paul Kelly, editor at large, and Greg Sheridan, foreign editor both of the Australian. Both of these writers have published articles on faith in the Weekend Australian. I have commented on Kelley's articles in On Line Opinion here and here.\nAfter publishing an essay on his Catholicism that I admired, Greg Sheridan is back in the 28-29th Oct Weekend Australian with a defence of the belief in God. The problem with the article is that it does not speak about the God Christians worship. Indeed, he does not begin with Christian theology but with a universal statement about the proclivity of the human mind: \"The resting place of the mind, its natural equilibrium, as it were, is belief.\"\nThis is an old argument that posits a \"God shaped hole\" in the mind that if left unfilled will produce an unfulfilled life. It may be that we have a tendency to project mind into nature as do children and as can be found in many religions. But that cannot be used as evidence that such a Being exists. Rather than evidence for the existence of God, it may be caused by the exercise of neural elements in the brain that have evolved to deal with our social context which is then unthinkingly projected onto the world or otherworld. Christian theology has long since recognised such a projection that has the world inhabited by spirits as paganism and antithetical to either the belief of Israel or of the Church.\nSheridan then changes tack and informs us that: \"you can get to knowledge of God through reason alone.\" He then takes us on a journey through Aristotle and Aquinas to show that this is true. He takes us through the arguments about the prime mover and the uncaused cause etc. But then he makes the observation that these arguments are all very dry and that \"People don't generally come to any serious belief in God purely through this or any other rational process.\" At last, a statement I can agree with! But why go to the trouble if this kind of rationalisation rarely if ever yields anything that can be called religious faith, let alone Christian faith?\nInstead of proceeding to talk about the unique insights of Israel and the early Church's grappling with the life and death of Jesus, Sheridan tells us of \"the deep mysteries of the human condition\". Such hand waving leads us nowhere. We are left to our own devices as regards the existence and character of God.\nThe other theme that is explored is the relationship between natural science and faith. Unfortunately, Sheridan avoids the question about causation by telling us that while science may tell us the \"how\", it cannot approach the question of \"why\". Certainly, this is true but the question that hangs around science and religion is the \"how\" of it. Did God create the universe or is it self-evolved? Can God reach into the mechanism of the world and change them at will as seems to be the case with the many miracles related in Scripture?\nThese are questions that must arise when the being of God is established from reason because the only God whose existence can be proved by such methods is the God of Aristotle, an immaterial being who hangs around in the universe waiting to meddle with his creation. This concept produced the Deism of the 18th and 19th centuries that was found to not have anything to do with Christianity.\nThe"}

This has funded impressive state programmes to reduce poverty, cut unemployment, raise literacy and improve healthcare.\nThe country has also won international kudos for progressive policies for the disabled and the environment, including the world's first constitution that recognises the rights of nature and the ITT initiative, which promises not to exploit oil in a 180,000-hectare area of the Yasun\u00ed national park if the international community can raise half the estimated $7.6bn value of the fossil fuel.\nThis has prompted some to tip Correa as a potential successor to Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez as the figurehead of the Latin-American left. For the moment, however, that looks premature, not least because Correa has failed to maintain the unity of even the Ecuadorean left, even though he has proved himself an immensely successful populist.\nIn the current race, two of his challengers are former allies who have turned against a president they accuse of abandoning his core principles and letting power go to his head. One of them has been described as a former ideological soulmate: Alberto Acosta served as energy minister and headed the panel that rewrote the 2008 constitution. Along with its widely hailed green principles, that reform allowed Correa to run again for office. Acosta now feels cheated that his former friend has abandoned the spirit of the constitution and become too authoritarian.\n\"Correa was almost my brother, but I regret that he has departed from the fundamental principles of the revolution,\" Acosta told the Guardian during a break on the campaign trail. \"When the constitution was introduced Correa said it was the best in the world and would last 300 years. But then he found it inconvenient because it was a straitjacket for an authoritarian. The constitution was written by democrats for democrats. Now I realise he wants to concentrate power for himself.\"\nAcosta is the presidential candidate for the Plurinational Co-ordinating Group. This is a broad coalition of left-wing bodies that used to support Correa but have grown disillusioned by the president's championing of oil, gas and mineral interests over environmental concerns and the rights of indigenous groups.\nMany were upset when the government condemned the Sarayacu tribe as terrorists when they tried to resist mining in their homeland.

Accompanying me on the plane were two employers of a local rock station in Nashville which caters to young adults, high school teachers from rural and mid sized school districts in Tennessee and two recruiters for the US Marines. Our destination was Parris Island, South Carolina, which is the primary training ground for new recruits to the United States Marine Corps. The Marines, which are a small branch of the US armed forces, receive about six percent of the Department of Defense annual budget and have two training facilities for new enlistees. I had been invited along on a USMC Educator's Workshop, which is essentially a marketing strategy designed to encourage high school teachers to develop friendlier relations with Marine recruiters, and to encourage journalists to write positive stories about the USMC.\nI am a peace activist, and my training and education is in the business of ending war and promoting peace. I am also a politician who has run for office twice as a candidate for US Senate representing the Green Party of Tennessee. If I had been elected to office one of my first actions as Senator would have been to sponsor legislation to immediately withdraw all US armed forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, to drastically reduce the scope of US military spending and close our military bases overseas, so I didn't fit easily into any category that the USMC had constructed for the three-day program. Still, as a former candidate and in the interest of good will and cooperation I attended because I believe that it is important to hear all sides in any conversation--and the USMC clearly has one side and they want to make sure that you understand exactly what that side is.\nWe flew into Atlanta early that morning with a two-hour layover. I milled around the airport looking for a Starbucks and the smoking lounge. I found a great restaurant serving eggs and grits. I ate while working on my laptop, smoking and drinking coffee. My head was still wrapped up with the most current manifestation of the war on the Palestinian people. I was editing a video I had shot two nights before at the Islamic Center of Nashville in which Yassir Arafat had given a fairly direct presentation on the history of Palestine. It was a forceful presentation that was unapologetically one-sided, documenting the history of abuse of the Palestinian people, the war of 1967, the demolition of houses and entire villages, the rounding up of civilians, the loss of citizenship, identity, imprisonment and the tedium of life under constant occupation. I looked at the clock and realized it was time to get on the transfer to Savannah. The war in Gaza and twelve hundred dead Palestinians continued to occupy my thoughts as I glanced out the window of the airplane and caught a good view of Stone Mountain, Georgia--a granite monolith protruding from the relatively flat plains of Atlanta where a monumental Confederate memorial was originally planned to function as the Mount Rushmore of the South.\nIn the halls and terminals of the Atlanta airport there had been Marines and soldiers of various types in uniforms walking about everywhere, a clear reminder of current activity within the US armed forces. My initial reaction to men in camouflage and hiking boots walking around an airport is caution and intimidation, especially when confronted by literally hundreds of them including some on the plane. We landed after a short thirty minute flight from Atlanta to a gray, overcast day with rain speckling the windows. The first thing I noticed about Savannah was that it was green.

{"idx": "34995", "prompt": "What is your idea about this text: Will UAE and Iran resolve the three islands dispute?\nThe United Arab Emirates has shifted its strategy from direct talks with Iran to calling for international mediation.\nLondon, United Kingdom - Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are once again at each others' throats over the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and the Lesser Tunb. This latest round of rhetorical warfare was instigated by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's official visit to the island of Abu Musa on April 11; a move that some described as \"tactical\", aiming to stir nationalist sentiment ahead of the nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 in Istanbul.\nLocated in a strategic zone near the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz, controlling these islands would enable one to dominate the sea-lanes entering and exiting the Gulf, and hence it is understandable why Tehran and Abu Dhabi are in fierce competition over them.\nNevertheless, it would be simplistic to blame the ongoing rivalry between these two neighbours on the geopolitics of the islands' location. Instead, blame partly lies with Britain's \"half-solution\" to the dispute and its continuous refusal to either support or deny the sovereignty claims of either Iran or the UAE. It is also in Tehran and Abu Dhabi's opposing readings of history that one can find the root causes of their contemporary antagonism. If anything, it could be argued, their mutual geostrategic interest in the islands should have paved the way for their cooperation, not their competition.\nAs the traditional regional power that once dominated its entire neighbourhood, and endowed with geographic depth, natural resources, independent armed forces, and a relatively large population size, Iran's approach towards the three islands dispute has been rigid and uncompromising.\nSince 1971, Tehran has repeatedly stated that its rule over the islands was \"absolute\" and \"certain\", while expressing a willingness to hold bilateral talks in order to \"clear the misunderstandings\". Tehran also insists that it had a \"gentlemen's agreement\" with the United Kingdom, whereby Iran retrieved its occupied islands in return for its acquiescence to Bahrain's independence.\nMore recently, finally, reports have been circulated in the Iranian press that accuse Abu Dhabi of opportunism, describing its activism over Abu Musa as a \"sober attempt to manipulate the issue, so to increase its own authority vis-a-vis that of Sharjah\".\nTo this end, Iranian officials allege that if the UAE was serious in its claims to the islands, it would have, at the very least, supported Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, and Algeria in the early 1970s when they, with the support of the Soviet Union, took the three islands issue to the UN Security Council. This is a charge that Emirati officials denounce outright, contending that it was literally impossible for the UAE government to back the Arab socialist camp, given the scale of intra-Emirate problems at the time of its unification in 1971/2, as well as the UAE's own concern with the pan-Arabist forces and discourses in that period.\nThe UAE, on the other hand, has proved more flexible in its approach since 1992, when it began to pursue the issue wholeheartedly.

Hundreds of truckers, who normally ferry huge shipping containers from dockside to waiting trains and warehouses, refused to get behind the wheel and drive. Instead, they caravanned to the terminal gates and appealed to their coworkers to climb out of their cabs and join their strike.\nPort managers claimed that it was business as usual on the docks. Standing in front of the BNSF rail yard, though, the strikers could see stacks of containers that weren\u2019t going anywhere. When they wouldn\u2019t drive, the \u201ccans,\u201d as they\u2019re called, stacked up on ships, in rail yards, and at warehouses. The port\u2019s lifeblood slowed to a crawl. Cargo has to move for shippers and trucking companies to make money. A still container, a waiting ship and an idle truck all mean lost profits. It was clear the strike was costing employers a lot of money.\nFinally, after the standoff had gone on for two weeks, on February 14 the two sides basically declared a truce, and drivers went back to work. In their eyes, however, it was only a step, not yet an agreement that resolved their problems. They had made their point, however, by showing the trucking companies they work for\u2013and the huge shipping corporations behind them\u2013that drivers have power over the movement of cargo. And they could and would use it to bring about the changes they demanded.\nThe truckers came away from the strike better organized than they\u2019d ever been before. Every morning they\u2019d gather at the Teamsters Union hall in Tukwila before heading to the docks. Then, in the evening they\u2019d return. The hall would fill with drivers in intense conversations in Amharic, Somali, Urdu and English as they repeated their demands and decided on tactics for the following day. After two weeks, a hardened core of 400 were veterans of the flying squads, deployed in winter rainstorms from gate to gate. They had testified in hearings and spoken to reporters.\nIn the end, many agreed their most important achievement was the organization that emerged strengthened from the strike: the Seattle Port Truckers Association.\nUltimately, the drivers want a change in their status, as does the union helping them, the Teamsters. \u201cWe want to be considered employees,\u201d said striker Burhan Abdi, by which he meant that the companies should assume real responsibility for the conditions they impose.\nWhile the containers with the cargo and the trailers that carry them belong to the shipping companies, the tractors\u2013that is, the engines and cabs that pull the trailers\u2013belong to the drivers.
